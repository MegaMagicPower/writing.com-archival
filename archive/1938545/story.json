This new school you and your friends had transferred into was a real pain. It combined the middle and high school into one joined building, making it almost a literal mad house in the halls between classes. You had thought it would be easier, being able to mingle in with the higher class men but no such luck. Still, you had your friends Jack and Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of your brothers. You knew that Tex was with Jack, out fishing by the lake and that Mat was up in his room, playing with his action figures. Then you thought of your eldest brother James, having just vanished a year ago without a word or any signs of where he might have gone. He was popular enough at school and he had no enemies. You and Tonya had asked around but no one knew anything, it was as if he simply fell off the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya tried to comfort you a few times by trying to get you to try out for the cheer squad but you were not sure about the cheer captain, Christina Wells. She seemed to have something against those younger than her and often treated them poorly. Tonya only made it on the team because she has great skills and the coach asked her to sign up, some thing that infuriated Christina greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, remembering your dad saying that James was finally coming home that night, and leaned back in the couch only to feel something hard against your back. You reached behind you and pulled out a large faded book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaotic Science?\" reading the title, you asked. \"As in mad science? You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had believed in science but not mad science, it was just a made up phrase for movies and books. Jack and Tonya did not believe in mad science either and were weary towards the concept of magic. You wondered who had brought it in the house and if it was a joke at your expense. Normally, you would have just put it down and walk away but something was drawing you to open the book. Just as you touched the cover to do so, you heard someone call your name...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You loosened the knots on the black dress shoes and put them aside before removing the crew length socks and placing them inside the shoes out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosened the tie and took it off before placing it on your bed and unbuttoned the white uniform shirt.

You moved on to your pants, unbuckling the belt and pulling them down. You winced upon seeing the boy's underwear snugly around your waist.

Of Course you were curious about the part where he mentioned Mad Test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Dad, what do you mean by Mad Test?\" you asked. Your father then quickly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Whether your a Witch or a Mad Scientist, each one is tested in various ways. This is to teach them that both Mad Science and The Witch World have laws that all must abide by.  Those who don't respect those boundaries will quickly find themselves dispatched by specialized force that punishes those that disobey the rules.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I think I understand now, but what are these rules exactly?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Jessica, you will learn them in time. In fact Since you have discovered your talent I believe Your father and I have an agreement to Carry out.\" Your Aunt Viva replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Indeed, it is one I made that Should Jessica discover her powers, you would be allowed to train her as a Witch. Which means you  wont be going through this training alone though. James and Tex will be joining you.\" Your father says as  he gives you a book. From what you could tell this book was entitled \"Magic For Beginner Witches\" As you looked on the first page you notice a small note that appeared to be from your mother. You then quickly read the note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Jessica,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       I have so much I want to tell you, but I can't. You are just taking the first steps in becoming a Witch and I am sure your brothers will want to have fun with you as well. Be sure to read all the rules of both books when you get a chance. You will find them quite similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Love Mom.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The note didn't have much left to it, yet oddly enough you felt as though there was more. However if you follow the instructions your mother gave in this note, it meant to discover more of this note you would have to read both the rules of Mad Science and Witchcraft before you could get anywhere.  After reading the note from your mother you then went to hug your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I believe now that you have your book. It's time to inform James and Tex of there new instructor. As for You Jessica,Under no circumstances are you to tell James or Tex that this is a test. I only revealed it to you, because of necessity. There will be times when you will have no idea you are part of a test. Is that understood?\" Your father said, He was using his serious voice when he gave you those instructions. You simply nodded your head.  As far as the idea of them becoming Witches for awhile James and Tex...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James even had the idea of going to his own lab to resolve the situation. Unfortunately for them your father had already though about that and left a note at the entrance of his lab.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" No Access to the lab, until you've finished your Witch Training. Love Dad.\" The note read. Which meant for them, that until they finished this training they were stuck without anyway of changing back. Which neither Tex nor James had liked. While they were being frustrated about their new image. You yourself had been reading the book and looking at each of the rules. It was a Witch book for Beginners, but form what you gathered the rules were rather detailed and did specify that you shouldn't use any spells out of anger. There was also a big emphasis on never try combining the two powers of magic and mad science together. Although you were somewhat curious about what would happen if someone tried that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As if answering your curiosity the book then began to explain all the previous attempts to mix the magics have resulted in permanent injuries or even worse some were even paralyzed for life with no memory of there life before. They didn't remember their names or even the families. After looking at some of these disasters at trying to combine magic and mad Science together you decided it would be best if you never attempted such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After you finished reading the rules of your book, and the reasons not to combine such magic together. You decided to walk out of your room and meet your New Sisters, at least for the time being.  Your dad was with your two new sister in the living room eagerly awaiting your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I take it you finished reading all the rules of your book Jessica?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I have it was quite an interesting read,  it was like If I was curious about something the book would answer as if it were reading my own mind.\" You replied. Your father easily could tell what you were curious about, however he knew at the moment you needed a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I'd like to introduce you to your two new sisters. However they haven't decided upon a name. Would you like to pick one for them? Or let them Pick themselves. Of course you could always let me pick their names. What will you decide Jessica?\" Your father asked.  While Your new sister's were grumbling about the idea. the thought of naming your sisters did seem to cheer you up a bit. Of course knowing Tex and James if they picked their names, they would probably go with something that would be gender neutral as to avoid being called an embarrassing name. On the other hand you have no idea what your father might pick.<br>\r\nThe downside is the more you looked at your sister's the more you laughed. This wasn't at the fact of them being boys turned girls. It was actually due to the fact that the outfits they wore. the outfits looked so ridiculous on them it was as if they didn't put any effort in getting dressed at all. Your brother's couldn't help but notice your laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually you told your dad that you would like to....</span></div></div>",

She was a mirror image of yourself, as a girl, with long jet black hair and emerald blue eyes. You teared up, missing her, and spoke. \"Mom, I just learned of real mad science. What power do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was no answer but then, to your surprise, the portrait smiled at you. \"My dear child, you have the power of real magic.\" softly, the portrait said. \"It is as strong and mysterious as mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad turned me into a boy, can you help me?\" hopeful, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father wishes only to share his world with you as your mother wished to share hers with your brothers.\" with a sad smile, the portrait replied. \"Embrace the experience then share your world with your brothers, become closer as a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the portrait stopped moving but the smile remained. \"Mom....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an enchanted portrait of your mother, created by grandma to hold her memories and wisdom so we may turn to her for advice when we are lost.\" touching your shoulder, James said. he held back a sob. \"Mad science nor magic is powerful enough to bring back the dead. We miss her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to cry but paused as something appeared on the table in front of you. Looking down, you saw a large faded book with the title, 'The Magic Book'.

It also works in the same way only for us boys it is from the 'phantom uterus'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled. \"It is an extra set of muscles that all 'witch boys' have.\" He moved his fingers up and down to signify sarcasm but you ignored it. \"This extra organ holds the chaotic energy we mad scientists use for our own form of magic that we of course call mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged then sighed. \"Okay.

No mad scientist gains his laboratory before mastering his spark and proving himself responsible in use of its power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that dangerous?\" Taken back, you asked. \"I have heard of witches learning magic as early as the age of six!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they call us 'mad'.\" Rolling his eyes, James retorted. \"Any great power is dangerous in the hands of the inexperienced or arrogant. For a witch to learn magic before she learns to control her emotional tantrums is a danger to everyone around her.\" He sighed. \"To be fair, boys are worse in that regard as they tend to be 'territorial' with any form of power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Okay; walk me through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded back. \"Close your eyes and find your center.\" Calmly, he instructed. \"Once you do, try to imagine a glowing ball of energy in the palm of your hand. This is the spark, an extension of your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as James instructed and within seconds, you opened your eyes to the sound of crackling electricity to find a glowing, spinning ball of energy the size of a baseball hovering harmlessly over the palm of your hand. \"I did it!\" Proudly, you exclaimed. Suddenly, the ball of energy vanished. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it requires concentration to maintain the spark.\" Smiling, James said. \"Just because you managed to summon it on the first try does not mean you are ready to yield it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned, frustrated, causing James to chuckle. \"Every young man goes through this frustration, bro.\" Kindly, he said. \"From what I saw of your spark, you have strong potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potential for mad science, I take it.\" pouting, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what you ultimately decide.\" Shrugging, James said. \"It is not our born abilities that make us who we are, it is our choices.\" he smiled. \"I had met boys born to be mad scientists who choose to become girls and are now quite impressive in their use of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you met girls wanting to be mad scientists?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. \"I have indeed.

It was a monstrous parody of something from a little girl's fantasy, with the worst of the 1980's. White gloves covered Jackie's arms until they met a massive puffed sleave. The skirt part was bell shaped and massively oversized, to the point where moving indoors would become problematic. All three puffs were connected by a embossed  bodice that gave almost no indication of Jackie's shape.

For now, please enjoy the ball and introduce... <i>Jackie</i> to the rest of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us get some refreshments.\" Motioning you to follow, Ella suggested. \"I wish to speak with you alone for a moment, if I may.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then followed Ella to the table while Devlin and dad held a conversation with Jackie. \"What did you want to talk to me about, grandma?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, like Devlin, you must call me by my first name or madam head witch when in public.\" Serious, Ella said. \"As for what I wish to talk about regards my role as the head witch.\" She sighed. \"My daughter, your aunt Viva is next in line for the throne of head witch. Only she must choose a lover before she can take the throne. Viva swore never to love another when her husband passed away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" Confused, you asked. Then it hit you and a gasp escaped your throat as Ella slowly nodded. \"I have chosen a potential lover so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you the next in line to take the throne when I step down.\" Serious, Ella said. \"Understand that this development has left more than a few witches feeling nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped glancing at aunt Viva. \"I take it I'm not the only one being bombarded with love letters.\" Wincing, you said. \"I guess a young girl becoming 'queen' would make anyone nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that, child.\" Calmly, Ella said. \"It is the fact that you are the granddaughter of the head mad scientist; many witches fear Devlin would use his influence over you to control the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa, I mean Devlin would never do that!\" Taken back, you protested. \"He's the kindest person I had ever met in my life! We would not take advantage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the same coin, there are many mad scientists who fear that, being his granddaughter, you could sway Devlin to make decisions that would favor the witching world.\" Bemused, Ella interrupted. \"You are essentially a key piece in the chess game witches and mad scientists play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane...\" Fearful, you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla gave you a rueful smile. \"Please do not allow this to give up your love for Jack.\" Kindly, she pleaded. \"I have many years yet before I must step down; plenty of time for witches and mad scientists alike to get over their fears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope.\" Smiling slightly, you said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each of them wore similar outrageously expensive suits with Jackie's mother, Rena wearing an exquisite gown. She was tall and slender with shoulder length black hair and green eyes. There was no sign of Jackie's father, Rio but that did not surprise you. Last you heard, he worked for some strange sort of police force that investigates unusual crimes in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was well over two inches taller than you with a near perfect physique, sporting short brown hair and fire hazel eyes that seemed to sparkle like real fire. Your twin brother, Tex, right behind him, had a similar build to yourself with the same jet black hair but fire hazel eyes like his brother. Matt was short and slender for his age with longish brown hair, green eyes, and wolf like ears. You had long believed it was a strange birth defect or something along those lines. Only now, you had a feeling there was more to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good in a suit, Jessie.\" Smiling, James teased. \"We'll make a man out of you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have your turn to sport a dress.\" Frowning, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled. \"Patience, my dear transformed sister.\" Maintaining his smile, he said. \"This is a time of celebration and happiness.\" He grinned. \"I would not dream of taking you out of the spotlight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big deal?\" Confused, Matt asked. \"Why all the hoopla over Jessica going out with Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla giggled. \"It's a little above you, Matt.\" Bemused, she said. \"Just think of it as the two families getting to know each other better in a fun way.\" She motioned to the tables. \"There are plenty of snacks to sample, if you wish to have a nibble before the banquet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled then eagerly ran for the tables while you and Ella laughed. \"Matt certainly loves to eat.\" Bemused, you said. \"I just can't figure out where he puts it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt is a rare boy.\" Cryptically, Ella said. \"He will have a rough transition once he comes of age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Ella?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his ears.\" Smiling, Tex said. \"It makes him almost irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla nodded, somewhat sadly. \"Yes... his ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried you slightly and you were about to press for more answers only...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was Viva's and Maria's step brother; the product of Ella's late first husband, Raz Cain and the black sheep of the family. She remarried to Axel Mist only Damien refused to change his last name in honor of his biological father. That alone did not make him the black sheep of the family; it was his habit of toying with witches and non-magical girls who had the misfortune to cross his path. He would change them into boys of various ages and sometimes cause them to fall in love with a nice girl before allowing 'nature to take its course'. It was his psychotic mischief that lead him to be branded a quasi psycho or a troubled mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not recall sending you an invitation.\" In a forced calm, Devlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep out and off limits are not in a mad scientist vocabulary, my patient and fearless leader.\" Bowing, Damien said. \"If I am here without an invite then your security requires some... adjustments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin flashed a toothy grin only you swore you could hear his teeth grinding. \"A well played comeback, my dear son in law.\" Calmly, he said. \"I believe my grandson, Ty had said it best; no security is flawless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no flaws in your security, Devlin.\" Calmly, Ella said. \"I invited Damien to avoid any claims of favoritism.\" She then added in a whisper, \"Which, I am sure you are aware he will take full advantage of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin sighed before motioning Damien to enter. \"Please enjoy the festivities.\" Smiling, he said. His smile then turned sinister before adding, \"Do behave yourself while you are here. I would not enjoy having to remove you from my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien gulped but returned the smile. \"I shall be the perfect gentleman, as always.\" He then turned to you, grinning madly. \"I see you are experiencing your masculine side, my ever cautious niece. Have you yet explored your potential for chaotic science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I just discovered all of this just today.\" Nervous, you replied. \"I'll grant you that this might make an interesting experiment later but right now... it's a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien chuckled, as if in sheer delight. \"Your first day of discovery and already you are speaking of future experiments!\" Gushing, he said. \"You make your uncle and dear departed grandfather proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I...\" Taken back you began. Only you saw the madness in Damien's eyes and finished saying, \"We need to take things one step at a time, uncle; an untrained scientist is a poor scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien's face lit up, his mad smile turning to that of something close to genuine. \"You are wise as well as cautious.\" Happily, he said. \"Please consider taking the path of mad science.\" He laughed, motioning top Jackie. \"Gender will not stand in the way of your true love and life itself will become the greatest of experiments for you both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... we have plenty of time to take that into consideration.\" Finding her voice, Jackie said. \"For now, I suggest we merely enjoy the festivities Devlin Moray has so generously and graciously arranged for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right!\" Enthusiastic, Damien said. \"I shall leave you two to discuss the endless possibilities while I engage the buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had left to fill a plate of food, Viva walked up to you with a bemused look on her face. \"Well played, you two.\" Smiling, she said. \"Damien is not usually so easily persuaded to end a conversation.\" She giggled. \"I believe you two now hold the record of the fastest time to be rid of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin chuckled madly. \"Like father like daughter...\" Amused, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jackie smiled at that.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The party began in earnest with several guests pouring in shortly after Damien's arrival. They were all relatives and their closest friends, most of whom you really did not know. Introductions were made which you and Jackie politely greeted. Fortunately, small talk was not the way of a mad scientist unless it was about comparing notes of who had the most accomplishments in their respective fields of study. Any talk that came directly your way was of the greatness you could achieve at one of the many mad science schools in the world. Your witch relatives were more talkative but, again, their focus of topic was of the witch schools and the wonders they offered to young witches learning their inherited powers. Dances seemed to be popular in these events only, as dad had told you, some of them were literally on the ceiling or on the walls or even in the air. Surprisingly, you found it fun and were soon smiling as you and Jackie danced together around the hanging chandeliers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the first song had ended and everyone returned to standing on the floor, James motioned you to a figure standing next to him. \"Dear brother, I would like to introduce you to my professor from Eligere Sententia.\" Smiling, he said. \"Professor Nero Osis, I give you my transformed sister, Jessie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Nero Osis was a muscular man of average height with messy, longish black hair. He wore a boomer hat, and a black suit covered by a long white lab coat. He bowed slightly, revealing bright hazel eyes under thick glasses with goggles hung onto his hat. He gave a toothy grin, saluting you with a wolf's head cane. \"It is an honor to meet you, my dear.\" Politely, he said. \"Are you coping well with your temporary new form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying not to think about it.\" Blushing, you said. \"It's very awkward and rather uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero chuckled, though kindly. \"Any major change will take time to adjust to.\" Kindly, he said. \"I have heard mad scientists and witches alike tell you of the many wonders each school can offer you. Have you given any of them some consideration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without any material on the schools to look over later.\" Politely, you answered. \"No offense but leaping before looking can and will lead to nasty surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero laughed. \"I like how you twist words of wisdom to explain your actions or lack of them.\" Smiling, he said. \"They show that you are quick on your feet.\" He smiled kindly. \"I have no doubt that there will be plenty of material for you to look over before the party ends.\" He then turned to Jackie. \"You will be receiving material as well... young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" curious, Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero smiled. \"Ask your mother.\" Cryptically, he replied. \"It is not my place to tell you directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie threw you a concerned look before Nero turned back to you. \"Please enjoy the party. The bonding ceremony will begin in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked off to talk to other mad scientists. You frowned seeing them produce paperwork before noticing your witch relatives doing the same. A giggle reached your ears and you turned to see aunt Viva standing next to you. \"As I explained, you are a valuable chess piece at this moment.\" Kindly, she said. \"It is to be expected that mad scientists and witches alike will try to compel you to visit their schools but do not lose heart.\" She smiled. \"I have been receiving love letters as well, all trying to get me to claim my place in the royal line to the throne. Your father is having the same experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so much to take in...\" Sighing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded, maintaining her smile. \"Welcome to our world, my dear.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was more unnerving was that there were a number of witches who also had a speech prepared. You made a note to ask dad or Devlin about it later. Once the room settled down again, Devlin motioned everyone into the next room where you and Jackie found a church like setting. Dad escorted you to the alter while everyone took their seats while Jackie's father, Paul Stone stood by Jackie's side at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the wedding scene?\" Carefully, you asked dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all a part of the ceremony.\" Whispering, dad replied. \"Have patience, it will not take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin stood before you at the alter while dad took his seat in the front row. That was when 'here comes the bride' began to play on an organ and Paul slowly walked Jackie to the alter then took a seat next to dad just as the music finished playing. You gulped and turned to Jackie who seemed just as nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearly Bemused, we are gathered here to witness the solemn bonding between Jessie Moray and Jackie Stone as boyfriend and girlfriend.\" Smiling, Devlin said. \"This marks Princess Jessica's first choice of a love interest, a sacred moment in any witch or mad scientist household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a number of young mad scientists crying softly in the audience and quickly realized the love letters that had stormed your house earlier were from a number of them, a last ditch effort to win your heart over Jack. This unnerved you as you knew dad must have been preventing these letters from reaching you the moment Jack showed interest in you romantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, Jessie Moray, take Jackie Stone to be your girlfriend? To honor and defend, to love and to hold to cherish for as long as you do not break up?\" Suddenly serious, Devlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, smiling then replied, \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin cleverly hid a grin then turned to Jackie with the same serious expression. \"\"Do you, Jackie Stone, take Jessie Moray to be your boyfriend? To honor and defend, to love and to hold to cherish for as long as you do not break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie also blushed then smiled as she responded, \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, by the power vested in me by the mad science collective, I pronounce you boyfriend and girlfriend.\" smiling, Devlin said. \"You may now kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you and Jackie were blushing brightly, you both leaned in and passionately kissed as the witnesses to the event cheered. Devlin gave out a maniacal laugh before changing you and Jackie back to your original forms with the appropriate clothing and yelled out, \"I give you Princess Jessica and Prince Jack Stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned to Devlin, startled. \"Prince...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin nodded. \"Did you not know?\" Amused, he asked. \"It should make for a riveting conversation after the reception.\" He motioned to the hall. \"Please make your way back to the ball room so we may celebrate your bond with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jack walked down the aisle together with the witnesses following to the reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young mad scientists who you heard weep during the bonding ceremony appeared to be upbeat. However, given the news of your position in the 'royal family', you knew that they were planning and plotting ways to lure you away from Jack or lure him away from you. Still, it was an enjoyable evening and you were smiling upon returning home. Dad had waved his hand, replacing the insanely expensive dress with casual clothing for you, doing the same for Jack's suit before motioning you both to follow him to his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Devlin told you that you were a prince, Jack.\" Calmly, he said. \"Take a seat, both of you, and I will explain the situation in full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jack took a seat, not knowing what to expect but what dad had to say blew both of your minds. \"Witches and real magic has only existed on this world for roughly two hundred years. Through an epic disaster of a grand experiment, a rift into a parallel world was opened. Hundreds of witches and witch boys were thrown into our world while hundreds of mad scientists and their female relatives were cast into their world, flooding both with an 'alien' power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is insane!\" Gasping, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"The mad scientists here were attempting to open a portal to alien worlds within our own universe.\" Serious, he said. \"On the other side, according to reports, a rogue witch government was attempting to open a gateway to a mythological realm of pure magic and reap its endless power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess.\" Frowning, Jack said. \"As the witching world is parallel to our own, it is in the same universe while the power of mad science is the mythological realm of endless power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad again nodded. \"Correct.\" He then smiled. \"This is where it gets interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this world, girls of mad science families have limited elemental power as mad science is based on the five elements.\" Calmly, dad explained. \"Normally, girls only have power only two alike elements and are considered weak compared to their mad science brothers. However, a growing number have the power over all five, earth, fire, wind, water, and metal. This makes them very powerful indeed. We call these talented girls Amazons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the other world?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys of witch families are blessed with physical power through enhanced attributes and senses.\" Serious, dad said. \"There were a few whose dormant magical power had awakened and taken root but were not strong enough to break the barrier, keeping them male. It instead increased their already enhanced attributes to impressive levels. The witches called them Ironclads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with me?\" Nervous, Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Like Jessica, your ancestors came from that alien world.\" Smiling, dad said. \"Your father was the son of a witch while your mother was the daughter of a mad scientist. You, Jack Stone, are the heir to the throne as king of the Ironclads in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked both you and Jack as you tried to take it all in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It goes far deeper than the act of a protective father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou half expected Jack to explode, knowing his private mail was reviewed prior to you getting it. You were tempted to explode right along with him. However, to your surprise, Jack nodded. \"Given your position, I would have done the same thing.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a genuine smile. \"I appreciate your restraint.\" Kindly, he said. \"You will find that, when it is your turn to select an heir, you too will be screening your son's correspondence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack later left on good terms to speak to his family about what he had learned from dad and you walked to your room, trying to take everything in.

Instantly, a table appeared with a literal banquet of breakfast foods appeared in front of you with a chair to sit in. \"Bon-Appetit.\" Smiling, he said. \"After you eat, I wish to show you something your mother had prepared for this day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom made me something?\" Tearing up, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"It is something normally handed down from mother to daughter.\" Somewhat sadly, he said. \"Only it is now my duty to walk you through the first steps into the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad left you to get dressed and eat with James silently following him. You teared up more, thinking of mom. She passed away a few short years after your youngest brother, Matt was born. You had not seen much of him or your twin brother, Tex since the other day when you first discovered the chaotic science book. You wondered what they had been up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had gotten dressed and finished breakfast, dad returned to your room and pointed to your closet. \"This will seem strange but I need you to trust me.\" Serious, he said. \"Walk with me into your closet and close the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Taken back, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly a very strange request but you had seen stranger things in the past several hours so you walked into your closet with dad following and closed the door. Upon doing so, dad pointed to a door that had suddenly appeared in the back of the closet. \"This door will only appear when the closet door is closed and there is a magical presence within it.\" Serious, dad said. \"I can not enter through these means and neither can your brothers.\" He then smiled, adding, \"Unless they are willing to become females for a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly at that then opened the door to reveal a spiral staircase. Curious, you walked up the stairs with dad following to a spacious attic you did not know existed before. You looked about in both curiosity and awe. The room took up the entire width and length of the house with a vaulted ceiling painted to look like the night sky. All of the far walls were covered with books from floor to ceiling with the exception of a small door on the far side near the rear of the house where your bedroom lied on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the room was a small workshop with a number of broomsticks with tools you guessed were used to repair them. Next to it was a sizable chemistry station which you also guessed was to make magical potions to defend yourself against other witches. Aunt Viva had told you that you were a key piece in the political games that witches and mad scientists play and guessed that not all witches or mad scientists were united.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room was a huge cauldron surrounded by a maze of hanging gardens with tables throughout, no doubt to assemble ingredients for potions. There were sectioned off areas of the room, hidden by office divider walls that you saw served as a form of infirmary and or nap area for over night projects. There was also a crow, standing on the edge of the large cauldron staring at you. The crow itself did not unsettle you; it was the magical power you sensed coming from it. You remembered mom telling you stories about animals such as crows or cats that can accumulate magical power, though they can not use it. She told you that they can grant that power to augment the magical power of a witch they chose to bond with. These creatures were called familiars. You knew that mom had a pet crow but you thought it died shortly after she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad spoke, pulling you out of your train of thought. \"Jessica, this was your mother's sanctuary.\" He spoke with a hint of pride and sadness. \"Normally, it is the mother's duty to introduce a young witch to her first lair to study magic. However, with her gone, the responsibility and honor falls onto me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this is mine?\" Awestruck, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded then motioned to the crow. \"This is Neva.\" Calmly, he said. \"She is a familiar and the guardian of your lair. Viva acquired her for you immediately after the bonding ceremony last night.\" He smiled, adding, \"Neva will be loyal only to you until the day you pass on to the next realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi, Neva.\" Nervous, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeva gave a quick nod before squawking, \"Much to learn you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"Where do I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeva pecked at the cauldron then squawked, \"Make a call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"I have decided that it would be best if you learn at home under the guidance of your aunt Viva who will be teaching you through a magical technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of technique?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a poof of green smoke erupted from the cauldron startling you. Within the smoke, an image of aunt Viva appeared. \"Greetings, child.\" Kindly, she said. \"I will be teaching you the art of magic through a form of video conference with me entering your lair for lessons that require a more hands on approach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your first lair, Jessica.\" Hugging you, dad said. \"I only wish your mother could be here to witness this event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dad.\" Hugging dad back, you said. \"You did a great job, mom would be proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to join us as I give her a tour.\" Smiling, Viva offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled then sighed as Tex could be heard screaming in the house. \"I fear my duty as a single father calls; it would seem that Tex has discovered his first spark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, dad.\" Smiling, you said. \"Go help Tex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled then bowed before leaving your lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zoe was much like yourself at the age of seven, hyper and always looking for adventure. She was tall for her age with long black hair and emerald blue eyes. Ty was about two inches taller with red hair and hazel eyes. He was surprisingly strong and fast for an eight year old and seemed to have it in his head that it was his duty as the 'man of the house' to protect his mom and sister. Normally, you would find that cute but Ty is protective to an annoying degree and had gotten into a number of fights with other boys at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will start with the cauldron.\" Smiling, Viva said. \"This seemingly normal, although rather large, pot is for using potions and spells from a distance as well as for travel, quick escapes, and communications with other witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick escapes?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For when you need to make a potion fast, you teleport into your lab through the cauldron.\" Simply, Viva said. \"The maze of gardens around the cauldron are for making potions as well as medicines for many purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the entire wall of books on either side of the door coming in here?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are books you will need to read.\" To your shock, Viva replied. She giggled at your reaction. \"Don't worry, I'll teach you a spell that will help you read and memorize them in a fraction of the time you are fearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at that as Viva then led you to a closed in area with a bed. \"This is where you will go in case you get injured during any of your lessons.\" Serious, Viva said. \"Either your father or I will very quickly come to patch you up from any injury.\" She giggled. \"What type of riot act you get later will depend upon who responds first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped you will not get injured at all during your lessons. You knew that Viva could be very strict when it came to serious lessons in life and that dad was even more so. You decided it best to change the subject. \"What of the workshops on the other side of the room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva smiled. \"That is the broom stick workshop where you will build your very first broom.\" With a bemused grin, she said. \"I find it a bit cliche but many young witches view riding a broom as a rite of passage into the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of riding a broom, although 'impossible' was a fantasy of yours when you were a child and the notion of getting your own broom seemed to rekindle that childhood fascination. \"When will I make my first broom?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva giggled. \"You are a long way from making your first broom, let alone riding one.\" Amused, she said. \"Your mother's broomstick is in the closet there near the workshop.\" She pointed to a large closet in the far corner of the room then raised a finger of warning. \"I only told you because I know you will look for it eventually. Do not try to ride it; you are not ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she concluded the tour and walked into the green smoke of the cauldron and vanished from the room. You looked at the cauldron and then to the broom closet. Neva flew up from her perch among the bookshelves and landed onto one of the tables of the work station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it!\" Loudly, she squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to look at it.\" Opening the closet, you said. \"There is no harm in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeva immediately squawked back, \"You'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's broom was elegant. The handle was of solid, polished oak and the bristles were made of strong grapevines; woven together with a thick wire like thread. There was a leather strip that you assumed was the saddle and two metal pieces attacked to the oak handle near the bristles where you guessed you were supposed to put your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful...\" In awe, you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it back!\" Hopping on the table, Neva squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to put it back, knowing that Viva would not agree with you riding it when you had not even had your first magic lesson. Yet, another part of you was screaming to give it a try, even if it was just inside the lair. Finally, you decided to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cat took a step forward, causing you to worry and want to fight against the blankets holding you down. You knew you were not trained in magic, you had not even gotten your first lesson.

You had no intentions to harm the cat, you just wanted to know where it came from and why it chose to enter your lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who sent you here?\" Firmly but kindly, you demanded. \"Is she another witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat only responded with a growl and a hiss, keeping its eyes on your flame and on Neva who had moved to another perch, squawking warnings at it. You took a step closer and the cat ran for the window and leaped out. You turned to Neva who had flown to the window, squawking angrily at the cat for its invasion. You turned back to the cat to see it hop onto the back of a broom with a small dark feminine figure riding it. She looked up at you, not revealing her face and flew off into the cloudy night sky. You were temped to go after her but you were not certain if it was a wise choice, given your lack of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was she, Neva?\" Shaken, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeva hoped away from the window and squawked, \"Curiosity should have killed that cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"I wonder if satisfaction will bring it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous and uncertain, you turned to the closet where mom's broomstick was stored. Hours earlier, you had no idea how to fly a broom but now you somehow knew exactly what to do, it was baffling to you. Still, you needed answers and the longer you hesitated, the further away the mysterious witch would be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through the memorized books, you knew exactly what to do without even thinking about it. You flew through a large arched door that lead up through the large chimney of the house, into the night sky. It did not take you long to spot the mysterious witch and you flew after her. It was only your intention to find out what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious girl flew her broom away from the house, careening through alleys and side streets which were all thankfully clear of any people. You managed to stay on her tail, calling out to her to stop and listen. \"Hold up!\" Irritated, you yelled. \"I just want to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so focused on catching up with the mysterious girl that you did not realize that you were now far away from home in a neighborhood you did not recognize.

Did you not sense that the rest of my family are mad scientists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sensed that.\" Calmly, the girl replied.

A read spell is nothing but words on a page; this prevents an inexperienced witch from casting spells that are too powerful for her to control.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Matt, I'll read the green book to you but I need you to do one thing for me.\" Softly, you said. \"Don't recite what I said, even if you had heard it a hundred times before.

What if it were a trap meant to use you for ransom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at that. \"I guess I didn't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't think!\" Interrupting you, dad snapped. \"You may have the same training as a year at witch school but you still know nothing of the dangers of our world!\" He sighed. \"The same is for that young coven who asked you to join them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to punish me then?\" Frowning, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"No; I am not.\" More softly, dad replied. \"I am simply emphasizing the potential danger you had put yourself in.\" He shook his head. \"If word got out that the young coven was trying to recruit you, they too could become targets of older covens trying to keep them out of the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I am a key piece in a chess game, is that it?\" Uncomfortable, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"We are all key pieces in that chess game, Jessica.\" Serious, he said. \"Your little brother is a critical piece in the game and I will thank you not to tell him this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taken back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt can work both mad science and magic as a boy due to his Neko traits.\" Softly, dad explained. \"This makes him...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your discussions out of the way the three of you headed to the mall. What you didn't know about the mall at t he time was that every now and then the mall would have what they would call a Science fair where people would bring some of there gizmo's, gadgets and all sorts of inventions. Normally this was something you would have written off, but for some reason you noticed that the sign this time was slightly different from the usual. Further more you also noticed your best friend Tonya Holmes heading towards the fair with you uncle. The very same uncle you were told to never ever visit, or go anywhere near his shop. For the moment however aside form the sign now reading Mad Science Fair, you decided to go and head towards the men's clothing section and picking out clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" James, I noticed something on our way here, The Science fair today oddly said \"Mad Science Fair? Do you know anything about that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" A little usually some of those who practice our kind of science have some gizmo, gadget or invention that they sell. To others. Most of the time it was quite harmless  but sometimes these gadgets and gizmos can have excess Chaotic energy that can have rather varying or sometimes horrifying results.\"  James responded. His answer however only made you more curious especially since you saw your friend Tonya Holmes with you uncle heading towards that way. For now however you focused on getting the clothes for your male form, unfortunately your worrying about your friend Tonya kept you from making any good decision and just decided to pick up something as quick as you can because you worried about what you saw. As far as your first pick for clothing once you picked out something you quickly picked out something  you didn't really didn't take any effort in picking out the first choice of your clothes, as you then quickly bring them to your brothers and ask them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Well how about this?

Having an idea what was going on, you ran out into the hall to see Mat  being 'attacked' by some of your old clothing from when you were a kid! It was an unusual sight to behold as the clothing forced themselves onto Mat's body, leaving him in pink panties, white stockings, and a pink princess dress. <i>\"The pranks are starting early.\"</i> stunned, you thought. <i>\"It's hard not to feel sorry for the kid, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat screamed again, his body beginning to change. You watched, almost horrified, as Mat shrank slightly, his shoulders becoming more rounded. He winced and you knew it meant that he was changing from boyhood to girlhood. Within seconds, a small seven year old girl was standing where Mat once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What happened to me!?!\" panicked, Mat asked. \"Why am I girl!?!\" he, or rather, she then noticed you and turned pale before screaming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, you were in for another shock, her room had already been somehow redecorated to suit a little girl. All of his belongings were gone, replaced with items you had at her age. <i>\"When a mad scientist pulls a prank, he goes all out.\"</i> disturbed, you thought. <i>\"Mat is going to completely freak when she wakes up.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, you gently placed Mat onto her new white canopy bed with princess sheets then quietly left the room, better understanding how hard it was going to be not to take any sides in this war of pranks.

James threw some form of glass beads at a table, which broke on impact. Seconds later, the table began to shift and change into a misshapen monster of wood which jumped Tex and wrestled him to the floor while babbling incoherently. Annoyed, Tex grunted and countered with a vial from one of his many buttoned pants pockets. He slashed its contents onto the wood monster, reducing it to saw dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad will be steamed that you ruined his antique table.\" Frowning, James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a replica.\" Smiling, Tex fired back. \"The real antique would have been immune to manipulative nanites; security protocol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of you made me into a girl!\" Angry, Matt grumbled. \"Now its my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, he threw a small device at at James then one at Tex. Unfortunately, the two older brothers were more experienced and blocked the attack with a shield of some type.

He politely knocked but you did not hear him. \"Jessica?\" Concerned, he called. \"It's me, Jack. Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, there was no answer and Jack's concern grew. He pressed his ear against the door and gasped as he heard you scream in fright! Unknown to him, you had just finished drying off and was wearing a pink robe.

He screamed in fright, seeing two orbs forming upon his chest then winced as he felt something shift in his, or rather her neither regions. You gasped seeing your friend lose a few inches before her black hair grew to her shoulders. Within seconds, an attractive teenage girl was standing where Jack used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?!\" Tearfully, Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know!\" Unnerved, you replied. \"You startled me and I got angry and.... boom!

Also, its a win- win sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store owners get more business, thanks to us and we get free to drastically reduced merchandise and food in return.\" Smiling, Emily added. \"Its the perfect set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you are forcing people to spend money where they normally might not.\" Frowning, you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only lure them to the store.\" Patiently, Diana said. \"Also, we only lure those who have the money to spend as opposed to those who are barely getting by.\" She smiled. \"You can always go shopping on your own; it makes no difference to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't report us.\" Suddenly frowning, Emily said. \"You will find us better friends than foes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a dark shadow fell upon the group as a voice stated, \"I seriously doubt you want my child to consider you foes, ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Diana looked up and instantly turned pale as they saw...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Mrs Mist, can you possibly change me back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the power to do so but I will not.\" Calmly, Elle replied. \"The reason is because doing so will rob you of the ability to resist magic.\" Before Jasmine could protest, Elle added, \"If you catch a man a fish, you feed him for a day; if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with this?\" Frustrated, Jasmine demanded, motioning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElle smiled. \"The more magic is used against you, the more resistant you will become to its effects.\" Patiently, she explained. \"If I change you back now, I save you for a day. If I allow your body and mind to resist magic, I save you for a lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it takes three months to resist magic?\" Downhearted, Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for a boy born into a witch family, it only takes three weeks.\" Calmly, Elle said. \"That time is considerably longer for normal people such as yourself.\" She then motioned to the racks of clothing. \"Shall we continue our little shopping adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Jasmine agreed and you helped her pick out a small wardrobe she could live with along with a few new outfits for you that Elle insisted upon you getting.

This hurt you deeply but you were more worried about the changes that were occurring and turned back to find that your legs were gone, replaced with a long scaly tail. Not used to swimming with a tail, you fell into the water but you were surprised to find that you could breathe underwater. This confused you until you realized that you had gills on both sides of your neck, taking in water. <i>\"He's turned me into a mermaid!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming a mermaid was one of your childhood wishes but now it was a nightmare as you knew nothing about how to survive in an underwater world let alone if James could change you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiment a complete success.\" smiling, James said. \"The test subject shows no signs of being in any pain and the transformation appears to be stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The test subject has a name!\" pounding on the glass, you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jessica.\" smiling, James said. \"I have to be disconnected when taking notes; it's nothing personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your experiment was a success, congratulations!\" sarcastically, you said. \"Now how about changing me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet.\" to your horror, James said. \"I want you to see something first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hit a switch and you felt yourself being pulled. You looked down and creamed, seeing the water being quickly drained, taking you with it! You swam has hard as you could, trying to fight the current but it was too strong and you were pulled out of the tank through a strange spinning ring with several lights. There was a flash as you passed through it and you found yourself being ejected into what looked like an underwater cave. \"Where am I?\" shaken, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming around, you found an opening large enough to swim through and peered out to find that you were somewhere under the pacific ocean, judging by the fish swimming by, meaning you were thousands of miles from home. \"Why did James do this to me?\" tearing up, you asked. \"How am I going to get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling helpless, you sank to the cave floor and began to cry...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, you did realize after a while that your clothes were torn to bits as a result of the transformation. Your bra was gone too, so you had to use your arms to cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....excuse me?\" asked a petite voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt caught you off guard to hear a voice here in the ocean. You looked around for the source, eventually seeing someone small behind the cave wall. It was a young girl, perhaps no older than 8 years old. She was pretty cute for a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you wondered what a kid was doing here, but then it clicked. For there to be someone else here, they'd have to be....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your question was answered when the girl swam out a bit, revealing her own mermaid tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you new here?\" asked the girl, who was wearing some seaweed around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....yes you could say I am. Who are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jenna.\" introduced the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jessica.\" you replied. The girl smiled a bit as she took your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you lonely?

Nathan was watching anxiously, but smiled as you surfaced.

Tex though, looked almost gleeful, though he tried to hide it. You easily guessed why; he loved the fact that Joyce remained Joyce, but didn't want to find out how its like to be a girl himself. Joyce looked at Tex and moaned, \"Shut up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said anything\" Tex said, openly grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, you're next....\" Joyce said annoyed.

Trust me, you can't get cooties\" you said, sighing. \"Give me a moment.\" You knew dad told both Mat and Tex about why Joyce was changed -for experimenting on you (he never told them what happened) without your permission, you could see Mat in particular was unsure. You needed dad to reassure Mat. Quickly you headed upstairs and knocked on dad's door. After a few seconds, it swang open. You walked through the door, and the door shut itself. \"Huh?\" you said softly to yourself, before to your shock, a woman in her bra and panties, stood up from a chair near the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da... daddy?\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...

I've been doing this secretly for the last few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I needed help to know how to raise a tweenage girl.

A lot worse. \"So you spilt it onto her, and it turned her into a merman!? What were you thinking? It couldn't just be pure restoration potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce shifted uncomfortably, knowing she was on thin ice.  \"Dad, I have to change myself back.

He produced some sort of ray gun that looked like something from the '50's, and pointed it straight at Joyce. Within seconds, and much to your disappointment, Joyce's breasts began to shrink, and her curves began to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad.. wait something's wrong. I'm still a girl. you're turning me into a little girl!\" Joyce said, her much higher voice accused. 'This is even worse. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica. Tex. Go upstairs and comfort our guest while I deal with your little sister\" dad calmly ordered, as he holstered his 'toy gun' You nodded, and headed upstairs very quickly. As Joyce said, Tonya was in the pool, looking like she- he- wanted to rip somebody apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she!?\" Tonya demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting outfitted with a princess dress, I guess\" Tex said, shrugging his shoulders as he eyed the angry merman. Having never seen Tonya or you in mermaid form, he was looking at him with a mix of surprise and awe. You eyed Tonya too; his scales were just as golden orange as before, but the noticeable differences were his hair was almost non existent, and the scales that covered both your and her breasts were gone, leaving a completely uncovered chest. Other than that, 'tommy' looked just like mermaid tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess. you've got to help me. I can't be a merman! That girl said she used restoration potion.

At that moment, you, Tex, and a furious Tonya walked up the stairs to see six year old Joyce crying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the price of failure.\" in a dead voice, dad said. \"Enjoy your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, you looked into Joyce's room to find pastel pink walls, a white canopy bed with princess sheets, a white dresser with pink handles, a white vanity, and a closet filled with the most girly dresses and skirts you had ever seen. \"Dad, are you really going to leave her like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll age normally.\" shrugging, dad replied. \"Hopefully, she will grow up to be a better daughter than she was a son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, dad walked away, leaving even Tonya stunned as she forgot her anger and looked sadly at your new younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christina always had been arrogant, to the extent you thought her personality would disqualify her from any sort of leadership role. As for Tex, he was being the protective brother. Too protective; he had only really jusy started learning about his skills. Who knew what abilities Christina had? You suspected she outgunned Tex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell us right now, you evil witch\" Tex demanded. You couldn't help admire his audacity, plus the fact even if he was overheard, anyone would think he was enquiring about why you failed to join the squad. Despite the fact it wouldn't do your reputation an favors.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smirked. \"You know, my brother asked if I knew if there was anyone that wanted to go to the prom with him. I was thinking of setting him up with some loser, but you'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it witch\" Tex snarled. You looked around and saw that the only people watching this was at a distance. Not enough for them to hear, but certainly close enough to see  if the sparks, literally started to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it. its safe enough to talk\" you urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina folded her arms. 'Fine. two reasons you failed. The first is that you'd come to me. i'm the only one with powers around here and I can't have you screwing up. You saw that with your little sister, right <i>Ariel</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure just how much Christina knew about everything, but you knew enough about her to know she's amused by your whole mermaid incident, and not in a good way. You wanted to know more, but not with the threat of WW3 breaking out right next to you. \"So you want to be a teacher of sorts?\" you said, trying not to sound repulsed. You knew getting anything off of Christina would be painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I have to\" Christina sighed. you resisted a glance at Tex, who you knew would be feeling volatile right now. He had put on a pair of headphone a few minutes earlier, which you suspected correctly, were sensors. As soon as it was safe, he would launch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other reason?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smirked meanly. 'that was even simpler. You're not good enough\" She gave you a look that she was done talking, and hissed to Tex. \"Next time, <i>nerd girl</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

There is a boy, turned mermaid, in another cave who had fallen into a pool on the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All he has to do is swim back up through the pool.\" Lightly, the second girl said. \"His transformation was a fail-safe so boys entering the pools and caves would not drown.\" She smiled. \"I am Connie Fawn and this is Bethany Torrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell him.\" Nodding, you said. You paused. \"Why was this island built anyway? It seems that changing ill-behaved boys into girls is just wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its far more complicated than just that, Jessica.\" Patiently, Connie said. \"There are several reasons why a boy is ill-behaved. He could be suffering from a curse, placed onto him by a rival of one of his sisters or mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could be slowly changing on the inside, which is very painful.\" Chiming in, Bethany added. \"Every boy is different and they are not sent here on a whim. As a witch, you should already know this after attending witch school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a witch but my dad does not want me to attend witch school unless I can talk someone else go go along with me.\" Sadly, you said. \"He's a mad scientist; so are my three brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your father is not ready to let go of his little girl.\" Sighing, Bethany said. \"Well, each case must pleaded and carefully reviewed before any boy is accepted for our care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could spend the summer here and see for yourself.\" Kindly, Connie offered. \"We are short staff this summer and we could find someone to accompany you to witch school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfazed, the girl grinned wickedly at you, making you feel very uncomfortable. You opened your mouth to protest, but instead, a series of screams erupted. Adam's creepy smile was enough to break your concentration, and that was more than enough. Quickly, your arms raised themselves above your head, and took on a bark colored color. Almost as quickly as the bark grew on them, your flesh hardened to wood, and both leaves and twigs spouted. Within thirty seconds, your arms had become nothing more than a pair of tree branches, leaving your head the only part of you still normal. Everything else was a human shaped tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. Change me back\" you pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that, tree-girl. You'll be a complete tree within thirty minutes of sunrise\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You said you'd change me back\" you yelled, outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, if I wanted to, but I don't. You turned me into a widdle girl\" Adam said, faking a lisp. \"Sunlight and water will finish the job for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon hearing that, it encouraged the other, fearful  mad scientists to act. They grabbed Adam from where she was standing, in a way that they were dealing with a fallen comrade than a new test subject, and produced a watering can. Your eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. You know that Adam is faking the whole thing! She wanted to steal my powers and become Amanda the wwit- wwww\" you stammered as the madmen started to water you. At first, you was fearful that it was your lungs; that your torso had turned fully into a tree's truck, but you quickly realized that it was your vocal cords hardening into wood. Soundlessly, you opened your mouth to protest. you had to stop this, as you knew that you had a sweet taste in your mouth, which you knew was the formation of sap. the boys had other ideas, though. All of them crowded around, and started to mock your sudden loss of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, tree?\" one of the boys asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, it has shut up\" another said, grinning madly. 'Amanda' however was quiet, as she noticed that something was growing from your branches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get out of here\" Amanda said, as she watched your newly grown flowers turn into fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Look! Our tree has grown something. Finally, it is of some use\" another boy said.</span></div></div>",

Has your newly found.... body addled your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it hasn't. Eat that, and I'm sure the tree would try to control your mind. Or turn you into a tree like it\" Amanda warned. You stood there in silent fury, fuming that they were starting to treat you like you was just another tree in the jungle. Your fury turned to panic as you saw that your nose was growing into yet another branch, and even worse, your hair was falling out as your bark grew ever further up your face. Whatever sway Amanda had on the boys still worked; they all sat down to watch the 'show'. It didn't take long; five minutes later, the transformation was complete, and you had turned into just another tree in the jungle.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are still a girl?\" one of the boys said, turning his attention from the 'entertainment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. Max\" Amanda pouted. \"I need to focus so there isn't any mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to help. Maybe we should burn that tree down....\" Max offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU DARE!\" a voice boomed from nowhere, causing all the boys and Amanda to look around, frightened and confused. they knew it was your's, but trees can't speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a stupid plant\" another boy, Ben yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, 'you' appeared. Whether it was your witch blood, the island's unstable mixed magics, or some other cause, your transformation had turned you into a dryad. The boys stared at your body, which was green, yet discretely covered, wondering what was happening. Amanda was the first to recover; she yelled, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me into a TREE!

She knew that this should not had happened, that you should be completely inanimate and not the most powerful paranormal thing on the island, and that you could, if you wanted, strike out at scientist and witch alike. She also knew this was likely due to the alternate reality magics generated by the island, and that you've likely to have such powers too. If she was turned into a girly kind of girl, it would be a victory compared to what else you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting out of here. I surrender\" Amanda cried, voicing what most had in mind. One did not. Max frowned with disgust. He pulled out of his pockets what looked like some ray gun from the 1950's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cowards. it's only a tree. Destroy it, and you destroy little miss freakshow\" Max spat out. It was a mistake; all his efforts did was to focus all your anger and hate onto him. Without warning, the earth near your tree became soft, including where Max was standing. Just as quickly, vines shot out of the earth and wrapped themselves around Max's arms and legs, preventing him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I do with you?\" you thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt me\" Max pleaded, all his swagger gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You cackled. \"I'll give you more than you can handle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Adam hesitated. He raised a single eyebrow as the sky turned dark and lightning flashed across the sky. The wind instantly moved from a light breeze to a literal gale before the clouds formed into a strikingly familiar face. Your head had been forced to look up as your arms raised, cracking from wood forming onto your skin. A gasp escaped your lips seeing the face. <i>\"Is that... me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked up and let out a raspy gasp seeing your face in the clouds. Your laugh thundered from above as five tornadoes twisted down, merging near the top of the clouds, becoming a cloud like hand and arm! The hand reached down and easily picked Adam up, taking him swiftly to the cloud formed mouth. Adam screamed in terror as the mouth opened revealing hundreds of lightning strikes going of everywhere like moving teeth, ready to chew him to pieces. The boy was thrown into the mouth screaming in blind horror and then nothing as the mouth closed and smiled. The skies then cleared as if nothing had ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly after, the tree bark began to disintegrate. You were returning to your normal human state only you were now completely naked due to Adam stripping you of your clothes. You felt something in your throat and coughed before a tiny figure fell out onto the ground. You gasped seeing that it was Adam only he was now fully female. She was unharmed, at least physically, shivering in terror. \"I guess I don't know my own strength.\" Wincing, you muttered. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were at the verge of collapsing from exhaustion, you waved your hand over the new girl, restoring her to a normal height only you could not make her any taller than a little girl; you magic had been spent. \"I guess that is as tall as you are going to get... little lady.\" Smiling slightly, you whispered. \"I hope you enjoy being a little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is far more than the jerk deserves.\" Appearing behind you, Bethany said. \"Had he succeeded in turning you into a tree, you would have remained on the island for the rest of your natural life.\" She then smiled. \"However, your desperation or rage forced you to create that massive illusion. It terrified Adam enough to release his hold over you, allowing your magic to restore your body to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how I managed to do that.\" Glancing up at the clouds, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany gave you a rueful smile. \"That was not your doing; not all of it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Turning to her, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This island has powerful magic and chaotic energy.\" Serious, Bethany explained. \"It protects the innocent who come here. That and your grandfather watches over all of his children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered thinking of your grandfather, Devlin Moray. You did not even want to consider what powers he may have had. Turning back to the terrified little girl, you asked, \"What will become of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany sighed. \"Her fate is sealed.\" Flatly, she said. \"However, her bold actions have created a chain reaction on the island. Those who followed her will change soon after this and they will blame her for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I change because of what I did?\" Fearful, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany shook her head. \"You acted out of self defense.\" Serious, Bethany said. \"Also, the attack was just an illusion, Adam was never in any physical danger.\" She sighed. \"Still, I am sure everyone on the island saw your little display of power. I have no doubt everyone will fear you now, including your little brother, Mat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teared up hearing that. \"I don't want Mat to fear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but it comes with the territory.\" Shaking her head, Bethany said. \"It is you who must convince Mat you are not a threat. It was that assumption that brought him to this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned pale. \"What?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instantly, Amanda's clothes shifted to a neat pink dress and sash. She looked at her body, horrified, wondering how everything had gone wrong with her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricked me\" the little girl whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Jess did not trick you, little one. You brought it onto yourself. By now, you should realize that we're going to make certain that you're completely harmless by teaching you how to be a proper little girl. First...\" Bethany said, with a slight smirk on her face. Amanda's expression of terror increased; with a scream of 'No!', she fled into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After her. Because of her actions, she is the catalyst for the other's changes. Stop her before she can reach her minions\" Bethany ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slight smirk, despite your worry for Mat.

She shook her head. \"Losing your temper with the boys will cause you to transform along with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, surprised as a teenage boy with light brown hair and brown eyes came running up out of breath. It was the same boy you had met outside the underwater caves. \"Connie, I sensed a huge spike in magic.\" Worried, he said. \"Something big happened not far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie turned to you. \"Exactly who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jessica Moray!\" Unimpressed, you countered. \"There is no time for games, Connie! Amanda's former friends are trying to transform us both into trees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Narking on us will not save you, witch!\" Angrily, Jason yelled. He produced a glowing globe of energy. \"Prepare to become one with nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, unsure of what to do. You had used all of your magic and would not have the strength to use any more until after a good nights rest. Only Connie gasped at the sight of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad scientists?\" Alarmed, she asked. She turned to the other instructors. \"We have a rift breach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie and the other witches immediately waved their hands at the boys. You could sense powerful magic being thrown at them before all three fell to the ground unconscious. Amanda backed away from them, looking as if she had just seen a ghost. \"We're on the other side of the rift?\" Stricken, she asked. \"I have to get back! Only my lab can change me back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were one of them.\" Sternly, Connie stated. \"What did you do to bring about your transformation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda refused to answer but you replied for her. \"She attempted to transform me into a tree to force me to relinquish my magic to him, err, her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie shook her head. \"I can sense that you were forced to use a lot of magic to foil his attempt.\" More softly, she said. \"Did you say your name was Moray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes; I am Jessica Moray.\" Nodding, you said. Wincing, you asked, \"Are we really on the other side of the rift, where my grandmother came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie raised a single eyebrow. \"One question. Were you a guest or a worker on Transgender Island?\" Serious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a worker there.\" Serious, you replied. \"I need to get these kids and myself back to the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie bit her lip. \"The boys and girl will be sent back immediately. However...\" She winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However what?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie sighed. \"I am very sorry, Jessica Moray.\" Sadly, she said. \"We can't send you back, not just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Alarmed, you asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie shook her head. \"When going through the rift, you have to go 'with the current'.\" Darkly, she explained. \"You and the children fell through a momentary tear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you send them back?\" Curious, you asked. \"Also, why can't I go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids still have enough magic or mad science to go be pushed against the current and sent home without any injury.\" Serious, Connie replied. \"Your magic is depleted. Sending you back would be risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I need to rest up before I can go home.\" Sighing, you said. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie managed a small smile. \"Welcome to Girl Island, Jessica Moray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand, causing you to fall to the ground unconscious.

You sat up to find Connie waiting for you to wake up. She smiled catching your eye. \"Good morning, Miss Moray.\" Politely, she said. \"As soon as you are able to walk, we will escort you back to the pool that will return you to your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the boys?\" Worried, you asked. \"Did you send them back early? I have a little brother on the island in my world, he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have looked suspicious if we had sent the boys and the girl back without you.\" Calmly, Connie replied. \"Maria Mist instructed us to wait until you were all ready to travel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the three boys?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie sighed. \"They were bunked with the boys being reformed here.\" Wincing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me something went wrong.\" Worried, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad scientists are not exactly welcome in this world.\" Frowning, Connie said. \"The witch boys here really put them through the wringer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought workers are responsible for the safety for the guests on the island.\" Annoyed, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are responsible for all of the <i>invited</i> guests.\" Coldly, Connie countered. \"You and your party arrived out of the blue.\" She shook her head. \"The only reason you were protected was because your grandfather is the head mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa Devlin, the head mad scientist?\" Surprised, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie nodded. \"The last thing we need is an inter-rift incident.\" Sternly, she said. \"Get up, you are leaving this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is getting the boys?\" Irritated, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bethany.\" Quickly, Connie replied. She lightly shook Amanda awake. \"Wake up, little one. It's time for you to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were annoyed with Connie, your worry for the boys motivated you to follow her out of the cabin with Amanda following behind. Outside, you saw the three boys badly bruised and roughed up with their clothing almost literally in shreds. \"You didn't even bother to give them medical care?\" Angry, you asked. \"What kind of island is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can give them all the care they need once you return to your home reality.\" Calmly, Bethany said. \"All who come to this island risks getting hurt in some degree, including the workers. The same risks apply to your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany looked exactly like the girl you new in your world only she was literally an Amazon in both size and build. She turned to the boys, motioning to march towards the caves. They obeyed without hesitation while a number of boys stood in the distance, grinning. You returned their grin noticing that they all had longish hair and pierced ears. <i>\"They will pay for their 'fun'.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside a cave, near the pool, Connie threw a strange object into the pool and ran. It looked like a pine cone with acorns on a string wrapped around it. Before you could examine it, the pool let out an unnatural sound before the water surged up like before. You, Amanda, and the boys were taken by the wave out of the cave, back onto the clearing. Only were you on the right island?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike before, everything seemed right; the caves had the same jagged formation, and the vegetation had the right density and composition. That said, you was still worried as you still had several now bruised boys that was after your blood, and these boys would have been freaked out, and nearly driven insane to have been thrown into a parallel universe, and literally beaten out of it again. You knew that you have no energy left. The only good thing is that the mad scientists also seemed to be drained of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the boys had signs of changes, most severely, and a part of you wondered if they were indeed beaten because they were a foreign threat, or whether the boys of that reality thought they were girls. In the case of Jason, he probably was a teenaged girl. He also was the most furious. Stiffing a yawn, he said in a sleepy voice, \"Get her....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind raged, because you knew you was falling asleep. \"No! I can't fall asleep anywhere near these madmen....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                              ***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I fell asleep!' you mind raged as you opened an eye. Immediately, you wished you hadn't. All the boys, or rather girls, as most of them had changed significantly as you slept were standing in front of you. Despite their changes, they seemed pleased about something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we really were sleepy, you stupid girl?\" Jason mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Is that all you have to say? You're so mature\" you said in an equally mocking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but the spell will soon reverse itself\" Jason said confidently to the sound of several cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you purpose that would happen?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled meanly. \"Take a look.... tree-girl\" You looked down, and gave a series of terrified screams. As before, you was stuck to the ground. This time however, the changes had progressed much further. Your arms were sticking above your head, and were covered in bark, with both small branches and some leaves projecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God no!\" you gasped. You felt even more terrified as you felt your vocal cords starting to harden as the transformation reached your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                  ********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up screaming, after the worst nightmare you ever had.

It was the same boy you had met outside the underwater caves. \"Connie, I sensed a huge spike in magic.\" Worried, he said. \"Something big happened not far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie turned back to you just as a small group of boys came running up behind you. \"I sense chaotic energy!\" Alarmed, she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Jessica Moray!\" Unimpressed, you countered. \"There is no time for games, Connie! Amanda's former friends are trying to transform us both into trees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Narking on us will not save you, witch!\" Angrily, Jason yelled. He produced a glowing globe of energy. \"Prepare to become one with nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, unsure of what to do. You had used all of your magic and would not have the strength to use any more until after a good nights rest. Only Connie had pulled both you and Amanda well out of the boys reach. \"I don't think so!\" Angered, she hissed. She then turned to the other instructors. \"We have a rift breach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie and the other witches immediately waved their hands at the boys. You sensed powerful magic just before all three boys fell to the ground unconscious. Amanda backed away from them, looking as if she had just seen a ghost. \"We're on the other side of the rift?\" Stricken, she asked. \"I have to get back! Only my lab can change me back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were one of them.\" Sternly, Connie stated. \"What did you do to bring about your transformation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda refused to answer but you replied for her. \"She attempted to transform me into a tree to force me to relinquish my magic to him, err, her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie shook her head. \"I can sense that you over taxed your magic foiling his attempt.\" More softly, she said. \"It must have been one heck of a spell.\" She giggled slightly. \"Did you say your name was Moray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes; I am Jessica Moray.\" Nodding, you said. Wincing, you asked, \"Are we really on the other side of the rift, where my grandmother came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie raised a single eyebrow. \"One question. Were you a guest or a worker on Transgender Island?\" Serious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a worker there.\" Serious, you replied. \"These boys are my responsibility; I need to get them and myself back to the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie bit her lip. \"The boys and girl will be sent back immediately. However...\" She winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However what?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie sighed. \"I am very sorry, Jessica Moray.\" Sadly, she said. \"We can't send you back, not just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Alarmed, you asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie shook her head. \"When going through the rift, you have to go 'with the current'.\" Darkly, she explained. \"You and the children fell through a momentary tear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you send them back?\" Curious, you asked. \"Also, why can't I go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids still have enough magic or mad science to be pushed back against the current while the momentary rift is still open without any injury.\" Serious, Connie replied. \"Your magic is depleted. Sending you back would be risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I need to rest up before I can go home.\" Sighing, you said. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie managed a small smile. \"Fortunately, there are stable rifts between your world and ours.\" Calmly, she said. \"We will inform the workers of Transgender Island of your whereabouts and an estimated time you will be able to return.\" She giggled. \"In the meantime, welcome to Girl Island, Jessica Moray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand, causing you to fall to the ground unconscious.

What was worse was the fact you were being watched by a pair of very young identical twins. Each had long forest brown hair and gem blue eyes. They both wore identical white dresses and were sitting in a small couch near the door. \"Good morning.\" Smiling, they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... good morning.\" Nervous, you said. \"Can you tell me who you are and where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can.\" Smiling, the first girl said. \"That was easy to answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, boy...\"</i> Rolling your eyes, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, who are you and where am I?\" Rephrasing your question, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tia and this is my sister, Ina.\" Kindly, the first girl replied. \"You are in our house. Mommy said that you are her aunt's granddaughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl, Ina looked at you, curiously. \"Are you really from the other side of the rift?\" Softly, she demanded. \"What's it like over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, the door opened and a tall, muscular woman entered. She had long forest brown hair and gem blue eyes, like the twin girls; you guessed she was their mother. She was dressed in a simple black dress and mary-janes. \"I told you two to alert me the moment our guest woke up.\" Scolding, she said. \"You are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough clearly disappointed, the two little girls obeyed and left the room before the woman closed the door and turned to you with a kind smile. \"Forgive them, Miss Moray.\" Kindly, she said. \"They are curious and can be mischievous but they are, for the most part, kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, who are you?\" Wincing, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled slightly. \"My name is Mrs. Mona Mage.\" Politely, she said. \"My mother is Elle Mist; her twin sister, on the other side of the rift, is your grandmother, Ella Mist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you realized you had been taken off the island to the home of your family on the other side. You turned to your wrist and found the return device missing. Mrs Mage blushed seeing your demanding expression. \"My husband is a mad scientist.\" Softly, she said. \"He is examining your device.\" She winced after saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He will have the power of magic and science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" Startled, you asked. \"Even I know the two powers can't mix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it, my dear.\" Gravely, Mona said. \"If your little brother does not pick a power and focus completely on it before his twelfth birthday, the two powers within him will decide for him and it will likely result in you having a new little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at that. \"Poor Matt... he's afraid of girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona smiled. \"He fears cooties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, bemused. \"He thinks all girls are from another planet because they act weird in his eyes and he can't figure them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mona shared a giggle just as a knock came to the door.

He stood by your side in a threatening posture, his short hair standing up on end; something you never saw him do before. His misshapen, almost wolf like ears were leaning back like a real angry wolf. \"Leave my sister alone!\" Furious, he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all laughed at the little boy's threat. Only their laughter died in their throats the instant a large number of shadowy wolves appeared, surrounding them. The dark wolves growled and barked at the boys, baring their razor sharp teeth.

Once they were far enough away, they made a run for it, into the wooded area of the island. \"That Neko boy brother of yours can't protect you forever, witch!\" The dark haired boy called out. \"This isn't over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the boys were gone, the shadowy wolves vanished with an eerie howl and Matt returned to his human self with a dull flash. He sighed tearfully before turning to you. \"Are you here because of a hard choice too?\" Wincing, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for a summer job and to earn a girl to go with me to Witchbloom.\" Honestly, you said. \"What choice are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad told me that Neko traits are inherently feminine.\" Tears falling, he said. \"Only I was born a boy so I can work both magic and chaotic science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped, realizing Matt's predicament. \"You have to choose which power you want more, magic or chaotic science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded, rubbing his tears. \"Uh-huh.

He was feverishly moving from station to station with both aunt Viva Vogue and grandpa Devlin Moray following him. Each were giving him a riot act that would have placed any other man into tears. Viva was your mother's older sister and a near mirror image of her; tall and slender with long black hair and hazel eyes. Devlin Moray was a tall, dark elderly man who sported an eighteenth century gentleman's suit with unusually long coat tails that moved about as if they had a mind of their own. He wore knee high riding boots, a top hat covering his raven black hair, and carried a silver tipped cane with a large diamond. His eyes hid behind round shining glasses while he held a toothy, almost sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you transform my sister's daughter before consulting me!\" Enraged, Viva shouted. \"Her birthright is to be a powerful witch and the next heir to the magical throne! You have just robbed me, the entire witching world of her talents!\" She shook her head, fuming. \"The witch council will not be pleased if her transformation becomes permanent and I cannot train her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right to train her is mine and mine alone, dear sister in law.\" Coldly, dad countered. \"Also, although I accept the responsibility of an err in judgment, the transformation is not permanent.\" He turned to her with cold, calculating eyes which forced her to hesitate. \"I am far more careful than that and for you to even suggest otherwise is a complete insult unlike your err of judgement with your former brother, Christian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva took a step back as if she were slapped in the face, tears forming. \"I payed for that mistake, in spades.\" Her voice quivering, she said. \"Both Maria and I did together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin cleared his throat, catching dad's attention. \"Son, I speak sincerely towards you; I trained you far better than that.\" In a deadly calm, he scolded. \"I am dismayed both as your superior and as your Father.\" He motioned to Viva. \"Bringing up past mistakes of others does not justify your own. The will of a mad scientist is to learn from your errors and the errors of others, not to repeat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my first grand error as a father, my dear mentor and head mad scientist.\" More respectfully, dad replied. \"My reference to Viva's error was not a justification but a reflection that even the most powerful to men and women are capable of mistakes.\" He frowned. \"I began work on correcting my mistake immediately upon realizing it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All errors, as a father are grand, my dear eldest child.\" Coldly, Devlin interrupted. \"The point is this error effects more than just the transformed girl in question but an entire community of magically powerful women who are demanding answers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack and forth, Devlin and Viva read dad the riot act as he worked on an antidote for your male condition which James knew had to be distracting to say the least. He jumped slightly as Devlin turned to him. \"This is a private matter, dear grandchild!\" Sternly, he said. \"Speak nothing of what you have seen and heard or I promise you a greater riot act will come your way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, James found himself in the sitting room, shaken. \"And Jessica thinks dad gives a rough riot act about her getting an A-minus on a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, dad made the antidote but...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Viva was far from impressed. \"Jessica has a legacy to uphold!\" Serious, she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A legacy of her choice.\" Grinning, dad countered. \"The antidote lies here, ready to be used at any time of my choosing.\" He then eyed Viva with a snake like grin. \"If my 'son' demands to be changed back, despite my offer to show her such wonders, I will of course comply. However, if he does not make such a demand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he is free to allow his son to explore his world.\" Smiling, Devlin said. \"The same is so written within witch law.\" He turned to Viva. \"You have the answers the witch council had demanded. The transformation is temporary, Nathan Moray has been reprimanded for his actions and steps are being made to correct the issue at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to teach him mad science...\" Wincing, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is no different than you teaching your son witchcraft.\" Turning serious, Devlin said. \"This issue has been corrected and our need to be here has expired.\" He turned to dad. \"You have three days to entice your temporary son to try mad science then you must return her to her normal state, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal clear, head mad scientist.\" Bowing, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin nodded then vanished, taking Viva with him in a flash and thunder like boom.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He used his power to lead the ironclads in a fight for independence... they won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed, shaking her head. Ironclads were witch boys whose dormant magic had taken root but were too physically strong for that magic to shatter the forces that were keeping them male. This made them almost insanely strong, endurant, fast, and resistant to magic. They could also convert their physical strength into energy with their rooted magic, allowing them to throw blast waves of impressive power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing the witching world here blamed Viva Vogue for that coming to reality.\" Serious, she said. \"It makes me wonder what our world would be like it that happened with the Roughnecks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shook his head. Roughnecks were their world's version of the Ironclads. \"I'd rather not think about it.\" Serious, he said. \"Let's just return home and file our report before we get caught up in any more of this family's problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and the two left the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I said, it was never about you or Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you do it?\" Curious, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, the current laws protecting witch boys was barbaric.\" Serious, Christian explained. \"By making the Ironclads independent, we had a say in changing the laws protecting witch boys.\" he smiled. \"Let those idiots blame you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we are good then?\" Hopeful, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a work in progress.\" Grinning, Christian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva, seeing her brother's dry humor hugged him warmly. \"Thank you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian nodded. \"Don't worry, sis.\" Ruefully, he said. \"With us witches and witch boys trapped in a world of mad science how long do you think it will be before we have our first pseudo witch or mad science woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva cringed at the thought, causing Christian to laugh. \"What we went through is mild compared to what it certainly yet to come so relax.\" He looked at a clock on the wall and turned serious. \"Your time is up, thank you for visiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded, a smile on her face as Christian normally said 'time to leave'. She left his house on good terms but was still rattled at the prospect of a boy working magic through science or a girl working mad science through magic. <i>\"The intricate web we weave...\"</i> Sighing, she thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he came in the room you could easily tell from his scowling face that he was quite upset with Tex. you have seen your father upset like this before only once. Either way there is one thing you knew and that is that you never want to get on your dad's bad side. \" Tex, You are in a lot of trouble young man!\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What for?\" Tex said trying to play innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Don't play dumb with me! I know exactly what you did, attempting to mess with my safety measures around the house, claiming your brother's lab as your own.  Then going out of your way to have Jessica learn of the family secret two weeks before she was supposed to. Does that clear things up a bit for you or are going to deny it, own up to your mess Tex!\" Dad told Tex with a cold and stern look at his face. It was then he produced a vial and poured it on to me and Tex, causing us to finally separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Thanks Dad.\"  you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Big deal I could of done that, And I don't think you need to be so harsh. I mean there isn't any harm in what I have done right?\" Tex asked. You still couldn't believe that despite what dad said, he didn't seem to mind the fact that your brother was going to use you as a guinea pig for his experiment, yet he seemed more upset by the fact he was trying to mess with dad's security measures than anything else.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You're welcome Jessica, trust me when I say that we do not mean to harm  you, but as you have already figured out b your brothers actions we are a family of mad scientist however only boys have t his power. As for the girls in a mad scientist family, well I will talk to you about that when the time comes. Right now it hasn't and I have to punish Tex for his actions. Normally I wouldn't interfere in this type of prank and et you two solve it on your own. However Tex had attempted to mess with my security measures, which of course could endanger everyone. Therefor he will be punished for that.\" Your dad explained. You weren't exactly sure of why he was upset more over these security measures than the prank, however you quickly figured out that these security measures must be related to the mad science that James, dad and your Tex have talked about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your father then begins to show his flame and concentrate an event specifically towards Tex. Which as you see quickly then turns your twin brother to your twin sister.  Your were amused with this, since this started with your brother wanting to change you, but ended up being changed by his own father. Tex however didn't exactly appreciate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You've turned me into a girl?! How could you do this!  I didn't do anything serious. Turn me back.\" Your brother now sister demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"  No, This is your punishment Theresa! You will remain a girl for the next six months! You broke my rules and endangered  your own family by your actions. Therefore you are not capable or responsible enough to handle your power  yet. I hope this time you will learn the lesson. Just to remind you, this is a locked event it wont reverse until your time is served, or I unlock it.\" Dad said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It wasn't long after that when Dad left and went towards his study. At this moment you could have had made fun of your brother for having been turned into a girl. However you decided a different idea. You quickly had a thought that it would be better to show your new sister that being a girl can be fun even if he can't use his science powers for six months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I will see you later sis, I got my own experiments to get to, But here's a souvenir one day you will enjoy looking at this picture.\" James said as he walked away towards his room. You look at the picture and saw that it was the picture he took of you and Tex being stuck together. It was an odd gift which you weren't exactly sure how to deal with it. Still you decide to keep it, as you didn't want anyone to see you in such an embarrassing situation again.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Tex, err I mean Theresa I'm sure you'll get used to it.\" You said unsure of what to say in a situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I'm a man and a guy I can't be a girl! Sis you've got to help me change dad's mind!\"  Theresa said, now she wanted your help but you knew that your dad wasn't going to change his mind from the look he gave your sister earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You know dad doesn't easily change his mind easily and I doubt he would be even willing to. you're just going to have to live with being Theresa for now.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Stop calling me Theresa.\"  She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" It is what dad called you and your going to have to get used to it. After all from what dad said your going to be a girl for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" I don't like being  a girl, I want to be a guy again.\"  She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Consider this an experience you get to learn the life of being a girl, and trust me being a girl isn't so bad. Consider it a learning experience.\" You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I don't want to learn, I want to be a guy again.\" Your new sister Theresa was set on being a guy again and it looked like that would have been a dangerous path to follow, however you were still going to show her that being a girl isn't so bad. Of course you haven't decided exactly how yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You go and knock on her door. \" Theresa, I need to speak to you.\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Don't! Call me Theresa! Did you get dad to change his mind or not?\" Theresa asked. You could tell that she was still not used to being called Theresa and would rather you not call her that. Yet you knew you would have to keep calling her that at least until she's back to her old male self again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I didn't ask, he just made his decision and you and I both know that once dad makes up his mind there's' no convincing him to change it back.

Although you did find if strange that you could read his thoughts. Curious about this you decide to have a little experiment of your own and try to speak through your thoughts to her. Much to your surprise it works. <i>\" Tex, err Theresa you just skimmed through the mad science book of yours?</i> You thought sending it to Theresa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" How did you know?  How are you communicating through my mind?\" </i> Theresa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>\" I don't know but I just thought about it happening and it happened. We could of both lost our lives if Dad didn't undo that serum you know.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>\" Fine, I'll admit it I just skimmed over most of the book so I could use a serum that I thought would be beneficial to us both. I didn't know about the consequences. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You and Theresa continue discussing the issues that have past and the dire consequences of the misuse of the serum, eventually she finally comes to understand why her father was so harsh on her. Eventually you both agree that you would leave dad alone on this matter and wait at least a week before discussing it again.  However you did now however have something else to discuss with Dad.

Fine\" Theresa moaned, before giving a hurried whispered reply. Mat laughed for a half second, but his laughter was cut short as he stared at his (unwilling) sister. \"How did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you\" Theresa said causing Mat to closely stare at her.

I'm holding judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you will be enticed to enroll.\" Grinning, Nero said. \"We offer far more than any normal academic institution...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not one of the first items on my to do list.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You did not state it was not on your to do list!\" Smiling, Nero pointed out. \"You must be specific when answering a question as many answers can be turned against you if left open for interpretation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at that and quickly said. \"I have not yet decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero smiled. \"That's better.\" Calmly, he said. \"You will find that mad scientists and witches alike will use your own logic against you to get their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witches...?\" Taken back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic wielders.\" Simply, Devlin said. \"As I said, a power you will discover later in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It almost sounds like you two are trying to recruit me...\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero and Devlin smiled. \"Of course, we are, my dear.\" Calmly, Nero said. \"You may not know it but you have great potential.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their combined power, as twins was strong enough to force a teleport through the shields, giving you a hint of her magical power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the students turned pale in a stunned surprise. \"Will Jessica Moray be studying here?\" Politely, another student asked. \"As identical twins, their power would be ten fold greater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred fold, to be precise.\" Calmly, Devlin corrected. \"However, do you seriously wish to risk the wrath of her grandmother, the current head witch?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Jessica found it wise to return the book to me instead in an attempt to soften my resolve in this matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What occurred to set this event into motion, father?\" Curious, James asked. \"Did Jessica attempt to access the power within the book? Did her own potential power inadvertently trigger said event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed, placing a firm hand onto your shoulder. \"I fear that I startled her when I demanded where she had found the book.\" Evenly, he replied. \"She dropped the book and it 'went off'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. \"The only explanation for this is that her power was about to trigger a transformation and her dropping it caused the event to strike her indirectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur.\" Nodding, dad said. \"This is not a permanent situation.\" He then turned to Matt. \"However, this situation forced many issues into the light before we were properly prepared to reveal them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt began to cry. \"I tried to get the book back!\" Defending himself, he wailed. \"Please don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Dad's voice shook the room again. \"You will not be punished for this inadvertent incident so cease and desist your vexatious whining before I give you a form that will match it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fell to his knees, trembling. You winced seeing him looking so pitiful and threw dad a pleading look; hoping he would get your message that he was going too far. Fortunately, dad's face softened and he took Matt into his arms. \"Now, now...\" More softly, he cooed. \"I am merely attempting to clearly convey that the book of chaotic science is not a harmless novelty you can just leave laying around.

However, I do not know which even within the book was triggered so I advise against any attempts to reverse this event before it runs its course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad then dismissed you and your brothers who dragged you out with them. \"Any thoughts on where to begin this task?\" Wincing, Matt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would start by preparing the spare bedroom.\" After a thought, James said. \"Until we know with absolute certainty that <i>Jessie's</i> form is permanent, there is no reason to transform his room to match his new gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest we take Jessie out for some fresh air.\" Nodding at you, Tex said. \"It is best to tackle this situation with a clear mind and a calm disposition.\" Pausing, he added, \"Perhaps a mall trip; such activities always seem to brighten Jessica's spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the boys decide to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am certain Tonya will not take advantage of your little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Tonya blushed slightly before laughing. \"I'll be back to normal in two days.\" Smiling, you said. \"There is nothing to worry about, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there isn't.\" Chiming, in, dad said. \"I'll drop you two off so you can do some shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you and Tonya were walking through the mall, looking in the windows of the various shops, talking and laughing with each other. \"So, tell me, how does it feel to be a guy for a while?\" Quietly, Tonya asked. \"Is it as weird as I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different, I can tell you that.\" Frowning, you replied. \"Everything feels weird; even walking.\" You shuddered. \"Having a... thing between your legs carries its own challenges.

Suddenly, Tonya gripped your arm, smiling. \"Look, they have a sale at the Curious Oddities store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, seeing the store that sold Gothic and science fiction themed curiosities \"Dad has always told me never to step foot in that store.\" Serious, you explained. \"It's owned and operated by Uncle Damien Cain, a really creepy relative of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad is just being overly protective, as usual.\" lightly, Tonya said. \"I had been in that store dozens of times. I have quite a collection of neat stuff from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered Tonya's collection. It was a montage of strange gadgets and props that looked like they had been used in a number of B rated science fiction movies. Tonya had played with a number of them, none of course did anything but they still worried you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Uncertain, you said. \"Dad told me that he has a habit of messing with girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Cain may be creepy and strange but he's never made a single inappropriate comment or move towards me.\" Confident, Tonya said. \"In fact, he's the nicest man you would ever want to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all are until they reel you in.\" Frowning, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your dad talking.\" Winking, Tonya said. She smiled. \"I'm going in to look around. You can either come with me or wait out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked into the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please, mommy, can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of mom smiled. \"I was a witch in life, Jessica.\" Calmly, she said. \"I know this is hard to believe but you will find proof of it in the attic; there is a secret door to it in the back of your closet.\" Mom then blew you a kiss. \"When one door closes, another will open; all of your answers are there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the portrait stopped moving and fell silent once more. \"The back of my closet?\" Confused, you asked. \"I never saw a door there before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken and confused, you hurried to your room and entered your walk in closet. Moving to the rear, you found no door. Then you thought of what mom had said. \"When one door closes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to the closet door and closed it.

Finding a light switch, you expected a few light bulbs to illuminate the space. Only, to your surprise, a number of torches lit inside strange lanterns that were hovering in the air on their own. You walked passed selves upon shelves of old, dusty books in semi-circular shelves into an open area where you found a huge cauldron surrounded by two semi-circular stacked gardens on either side with a large variety of herbs, flowers, and plants. On the far side of the attic was a small platform near an opening in the house's sizable chimney with a broomstick resting upon a stand. Not too far from the platform was a bed with a huge row of shelves holding various vials with different colored liquids inside. Taking it all in left you in a state of awe and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all of this?\" Whispering, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the cauldron, you felt compelled to approach it but stopped upon seeing your pet crow, Neva fly in through a window. The black crow was given to you by mom the year she died. You named her Neva after your mom's maiden name. Neva perched upon a tall stand near the cauldron and squawked, \"Welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled slightly and looked into the cauldron, wondering what to do. Neva then squawked, \"Just say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back by Neva's sudden increase in vocabulary, you spoke into the cauldron. \"I need help; mom told me I can get my answers here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened. Then, the water in the cauldron began to boil, causing you to step back as a bright green flame shot out from the waters! A startled scream echoed from your lips just before an image of your aunt, Viva Vogue appeared within the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that troubles you, my apprentice witch?\" Kindly, Viva asked. \"I will walk you through the steps to solve whatever issue you may have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It was a massive lair deep underground of which he prided himself in building with his own two hands. He marched passed nearly countless stations before coming to a large number of computer screens that faced a circular disk built into the floor with a podium holding a control panel. Dad stepped onto the disk and tapped a number of keys on a control panel. \"Fellow mad scientists, hear my plea!\" Firmly, he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitors instantly came to life with a number of mad scientists all with concerned to panicked looks upon their faces. Below their images, their names appeared on the screen. \"It is very rare that you call upon the collective for assistance, Nathan Moray.\" Worry in his voice, one man, named Don said. \"What is it that you require of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a personal matter which involves scientific pride.\" Standing his ground, dad said. \"I have spawned a son with Neko traits; his potential for scientific might is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there is clearly an issue.\" Guessing correctly, another mad scientist, named Frank stated. \"Otherwise, you would not have called upon us for guidance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have guided you all individually and as a group!\" Annoyed, dad thundered. \"This is your chance to pay your debt of honor to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain the situation which involves your Neko son.\" Calmly, Don said. \"We will discuss options with you for a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took a breath. \"As explained, my youngest son, Matt was born male with Neko wolf traits.\" Calmly, he began. \"My wife, fearing the scenario I now face, attempted to permanently transform him into the female state of which I denied her with my own efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an issue of mixing magics then.\" Frowning, Frank said. \"Please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt's chaotic power has begun to surface.\" Showing pride, dad said. He sighed. \"However, so has is magical power. He is now locked in mental combat with his female self in a battle for supremacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer to your problem is elementary, my dear Nathan Moray.\" Serious, Don said. \"Make use of the restoration formula or, as it had been dubbed by witches, the 'boy maker'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have considered that option.\" Frowning, dad countered. \"The reset potion, dubbed the 'girl maker' did not have any effect upon Matt when used by my late wife. The restoration formula is similar in design, its chances of success are just as remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suggest you make a better formula to assist your offspring, Nathan Moray.\" Frowning, a third scientist, named Robert, said. \"It is the most logical option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another option.\" After a thought, Frank said. \"However, its chances of success all hinges upon the boy's determination to remain male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me of this option so I may consider it!\" Firmly, dad barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Balance his existence.\" Serious, Frank said. \"With a perfect mixture of both magic and chaotic energy your Neko son will be able to become the mad scientist he is destined to be as well as become a human familiar the likes of which witches would tremble in his presence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad paused, considering the options given to him. \"I thank you for your guidance, fellow mad scientists!\" Smiling, he finally said. \"I shall, of course, praise your efforts to assist the Moray family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists all bowed before the screens went blank.

Listening to them, dad smiled, knowing that they were essentially the same person just holding the view point of opposite genders. He politely knocked and opened the door, a mischievous grin forming upon his face. \"I do apologize for interrupting your enthusiastic debate.\" His smile becoming sinister, he said. \"However, it is time for my little brain child to take his medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad held up the syringe he had up till now been hiding behind his back. Upon seeing it, both Matt and Mattie's eyes grew wide in fear as dad chuckled madly. The two versions of Matt screamed in unison and ran for the nearest wall as the door was blocked. With a wave of his right hand, a door instantly appeared and he ran through it with his female version right behind. Dad laughed hysterically as the door vanished behind them and gave pursuit through the halls. \"Come now, my needle phobic off spring!\" Amused, dad called. \"It's just a pinch on the arm, really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its what's in the needle I don't trust!\" Running, Matt yelled back. \"Cease and desist this pursuit! I will not comply to your syringe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will comply, Matt!\" Chuckling, dad countered. \"I am quite persistent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are more so today!\" Crossly, Mattie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired a spell at dad, who dodged it with incredible ease, grinning at the attempt. <i>\"Good, they are beginning to work together.\"</i> Pleased, he thought. <i>\"Fear is a great motivator.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was hoping he would not have to use the syringe as there was a great chance the serum would cause a were-girl effect. This condition would have left Matt a boy during the day and a girl at night with both fighting for control over the body and mind. If the two decided to merge, they would become a stable were-girl which means Matt could switch back and forth at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough every room and down every hall, dad chased Matt and his ghostly female counterpart. Tables, chairs, lamps, all got knocked over in the crazed pursuit with dad laughing practically the entire time. Finally, Matt and Mattie lost their patience and turned on dad, their two forms merging into one being. This was what dad was hoping for. The transformation was swift. Matt's raven black hair grew to his shoulders while his hazel eyes became two colors; his left eye was green while his right eye was brown. He shrank slightly, gaining some feminine features and his wolf like ears became more prominent. Finally, the transformation was complete. Dad smiled, knowing that Matt was now a Male Neko, a very rare from of a stable were-girl. Matt was now able to work mad science but he also had powerful reserves of magic of which he could call upon due to his Neko traits. Only he did not have time to celebrate as Matt fired a powerful blast in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt, what are you doing to your room?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt spun around in his chair, startled then looked at you, annoyed. \"It is customary for a lady to knock before entering a gentleman's room.\" Irritated, he scolded. \"The same is expected for a gentleman entering a ladies room so show some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am worried about you, bro.\" Firmly, you said. \"I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mattie and I are working out our differences.\" Pointing to the mirror, Matt said. \"For us to merge, we need to find a way to coexist while sharing the same position in time and space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked passed Matt to see a female version of him looking into the room from a mirror. \"Hey, sis.\" Smiling, Mattie said. \"I and Matt are sharing the same body but this mirror makes it seem a little less weird while we negotiate a merger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean a take over?\" Folding your arms, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound so dramatic.\" Wincing, Mattie said. \"Matt and I are building our laboratory lair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I understand, a mad scientist needs to earn his laboratory.\" Unimpressed, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, your lair was handed to you on a silver platter with no restrictions.\" Smiling, Mattie countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked at Mattie who giggled. \"Yes, we know what you have been up to, sis.\" Confident, Mattie said. \"Matt and I are happy that you want to help us become one. Dad even tried in his own way but, in the end, he left it up to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He what?\" Surprised, you asked. \"That is not like dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. \"Well, dad knew that the serum he made would kill a piece of us both to form one person.\" Calmly, he replied. \"Only there is no way of telling what part of each of us would be sacrificed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Turning pale, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear sister.\" Smiling, Mattie said though Matt. \"Everything is going to be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sensed Mattie using magic and raised your defenses as aunt Viva taught you.

Zoe was much like yourself at the age of seven, hyper and always looking for adventure. She was about Mattie's height with long black hair and emerald blue eyes. Ty was about two inches taller with red hair and hazel eyes. He was surprisingly strong and fast for an eight year old and seemed to have it in his head that it was his duty as the 'man of the house' to protect his mom and sister. Normally, you would find that cute but Ty is protective to an annoying degree and had gotten into a number of fights with other boys at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe has no other female relative her age to play with, Mattie.\" firmly but kindly, dad replied. \"Its only natural that she would want to play with you.\" he sighed then added, \"I agree that Ty can be a bit of a nuisance at times but you can not deny that he means well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rang. Your aunt and cousins had arrived. Mattie, in a touch of panic, tried to run for his room but suddenly found that he could not move. \"Daddy!\" crying, she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, pumpkin.\" walking to the door, dad said. \"You must face your fears; running from them will not do anything to conquer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he opened the door and allowed aunt Viva to enter. She was tall and slender with long black hair and fire hazel eyes. \"It's good to see you again, Nathan.\" hugging dad, she said. \"I trust you and your family are doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we are going through a number of adjustments.\" wincing, dad replied. \"Jessica discovered part of our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva released dad, looking surprised. \"You didn't...\" looking at him, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not.\" sighing, dad replied. \"Mat decided to tease Jessica about her discovery so I introduced her to the family business by changing him instead.\" he chuckled. \"Mattie will be around for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva giggled, seeing Mattie trying to be as unnoticeable as possible. \"You will survive this experience, young lady.\" walking up to her, she said. \"Try not to sulk so much, its not becoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try being a boy for a while then tell me I'll survive.\" pouting, Mattie fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva giggled. \"I've been there, done that, bought the T-shirt, and moved on.\" smiling, she said. \"This is just the beginning, Mattie. You will experience many strange and wondrous things, try to enjoy what comes your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Mat!?\" giggling, Zoe asked. \"You look cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" moaning, Mattie complained. \"I won't be a girl forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't handle being a girl?\" teasing, Zoe asked. \"Nice dress, I have one like it at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you!?\" now approaching Mattie, Ty asked. \"Who- what did this? Is it contagious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" chuckling, dad replied. \"You see, Mat teased Jessica and I changed him to give 'her' some perspective in what its like to be a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Ty react?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She childishly stuck her tongue out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva giggled at the sight. \"Zoe and Zia, the 'Z' sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you make her act more like a girl, mommy?\" Whining, Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could.\" To Zia's terror, Viva replied. \"However, I can't play favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means you'll be acting more like a boy when it's your turn, <i>Cinderella.</i>\" Smiling, Zia said. \"I hope you like playing in the mud and climbing trees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you'll like makeup and playing with dolls.\" Zoe fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just like wearing war paint and playing with action figures.\" Smugly, Zia countered. \"Bring it on, I am so ten steps ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"They are as competitive as ever.\" Amused, he said. \"I feel relieved that they are not in their awkward teen years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva rolled her eyes, sighing. \"I'm thankful for that.\" Weary, she said. \"These two will be a handful as it is, being little girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mattie, would you like a makeover?\" Grinning, Zoe asked. \"I bet I can make you really pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not stand out in a crowd.\" Wincing, Mattie replied. \"Um... rain check?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe giggled. \"Are you afraid?\" Teasing, she asked. \"Zia seems eager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let Zia go first.\" Uncomfortable, Mattie said. \"I'll be happy just to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, you are to keep the makeover simple, am I clear?\" Sternly, Viva stated. \"I want your sister and cousin to look like pretty young ladies not beauty pageant winners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe pouted slightly. \"I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded then pointed to the stairs. Zoe smiled again, grabbing Mattie's arm. \"Come on, you scardy cat!\" Giggling, she said. \"I bet you'll love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia shrugged and slowly followed while dad turned to me. \"Please be a dear and watch over the makeovers for me.\" Softly, he said. \"I do not wish to turn a simple event into a battle of genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, nodding then walked up the stairs after them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These transformations will last longer and longer until the magic dissipates or the boy permanently becomes female. A stable weregirl is a witch born boy who can transform from one gender to the other at will only that will is on the subconscious level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is close to becoming that, yes.\" To your horror, Viva said. \"However, there is still a chance that her condition may right itself and Matt will return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is all up to her.\" Shaking his head, dad said. \"If Mattie yearns to be a boy and a mad scientist with all of her heart, that is what 'he' will become.\" He managed a weak smile. \"If her heart tells her she wants to be a girl and a witch, she will remain just that and you will have a little sister to teach magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is nothing we can do but wait?\" Frustrated, you asked. \"Surely, there must be <i>something</i> we can do to help Matt be a boy again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva sighed. \"I understand you feel helpless right now, Jessica.\" Gently, she said. \"Only, this is Mattie's fight right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fight you and mom started!\" Angrily, you hissed. \"Why couldn't you just love him as a boy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a weary sigh. \"Your mother and I loved him dearly; I still love her with all my heart.\" Pained, he said. \"Matt was born with Neko traits which normally only go to females.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that Matt was born with wolf like ears near the top of his head but you had always thought it was some minor birth defect. Only, now that you had an understanding of magic, you realized that Matt was on the verge of a gender change since the day he was born. \"You and mom tried to help him before he changed on his own.\" Catching on, you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Matt would have become female before the end of his teen years.\" Softly, he explained. \"Your mother and I wanted to make that change happen while he was still young. That way, she could adapt to her new gender and bounce back faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"It still sucks, dad.\" Tearfully, you protested. \"What am I going to tell Mattie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her exactly what we told you.\" Simply, dad said. \"I understand that it is my duty to handle this but you are better suited for the task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave dad a knowing smile. \"Because she is a girl right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad blushed slightly as Viva giggled. \"Precisely.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was disappointing, but not unexpected; you guessed it was fear of having cold feet, rather than not wanting to hang around a bunch of witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dump\" Mattie complained, surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought you would had commented about daddy leaving\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed his hurry was due to the fact he doesn't want them to know about his own abilities. No, I'm scared for us, Jess. Look at this place. It looks like a prison\" Mattie scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to agree. The school had eight foot high concrete walls surrounding the school, leaving a grim impression, that wasn't helped by a single ugly looking black iron gate. You walked over to the gates, and a single woman approached. She was in her thirties, had auburn hair, and a slim build. \"Welcome to Spellblossom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it don't loo too welcoming\" you said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deliberate ploy on our part. We can not have regular people walking into this school, especially teenage boys wanting some 'fun'. My name is Andrea Adams, and I will be introducing you to your dorms and to your uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have to wear a uniform\" Mattie said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but only on campus. Wearing your uniform though is not encouraged when on field trips and when you have days off campus; we do not want to draw attention to ourselves\" Andrea said, as she guided you though the school. Surprisingly, there wasn't any signs of any students or teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everyone?\" you wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In class. Here we are, your dorms. You'll find your uniforms on your assigned beds. I should warn you beforehand, we are currently having a friendly completion with one of our sister schools for the most unusual uniform....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" you demanded, but Mattie cut of any chance of reply as she saw the uniforms and gave a despairing wail. The uniforms were......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It comprised of a white top with a dark blue stripe on the short sleeves and a dark blue tie with a knee length pleated skirt. The only difference between your skirt and Mattie's was the color.  You could only guess why. Forcing a smile, you said, \"It's not too bad; it could have been worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pink!\" Distraught, Mattie complained. \"You know I do not favor that color!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The skirt colors are to alert the staff and fellow students of the background of the one wearing them.\" Calmly, a feminine voice explained. \"I am Miss Rose Thornwood; your teacher for this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mattie whipped around to see a tall and slender young woman dressed in a flattering ball gown approaching you. \"That's an unusual way to stereotype the students.\" Unimpressed, you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could view it that way.\" Patiently, Rose said. \"However, its purpose is so students can easily find others with similar backgrounds and bond with each other.\" She smiled. \"We have strict rules against ridicule as we live in a world where there is more than one great power at play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad science.\" Frowning, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"The pink skirts indicate a boy who was permanently transformed into the female state.\" Calmly, she explained. \"I realize that it may not be everyone's favorite color but it only needs to be worn while on campus during school hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed your uniform skirt and noticed that it was white, like the shirt. \"What does the color white indicate, Miss Thornwood?\" Politely, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiled patiently. \"Please, just Rose.\" Kindly, she said. \"I want you two to think of me as an older sister; not just another teacher.\" She motioned to the skirt. \"The white skirt indicates a background of great importance; in fact, you are the only one wearing this color, Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Taken back, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed before smiling. \"Your grandfather on your father's side is the head mad scientist.\" Startling you, she explained. \"Also, your grandmother on your mother's side is the head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth yours and Mattie's jaw dropped. Only before you could utter a word, Mattie blurted out, \"Their my grandparents too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose giggled. \"That is why your skirt is pink and white, Mattie.\" She moved the skirt slightly to show that it was pink and white stripped rather than all pink. \"It is important that other know of your lineage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Worried, you demanded. \"I didn't even know this before now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, one which I will get into later this year.\" Serious, Rose said. \"I read your profiles and I know you or Mattie would never take advantage of your titles.\" She sighed. \"For now, let us just say that there has been a lasting peace between the two powers; no one wants that to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you and Mattie were wearing your uniforms sitting in the common area of your dorms as the rest of your class walked in. Rose was waiting for them. \"Welcome, class.\" Calmly, she said. \"We have two new students here, please make them feel welcome.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all turned to you, curious then turned slightly pale as they took notice of the color of yours and Mattie's skirts. There was an awkward moment for silence before the first girl stepped up. She was about your height with shoulder length brown hair and emerald green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tessa Bog.\" Bowing slightly, she said. \"Welcome to the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Politely, you said. \"I am Jessica Moray and this is my sister, Mattie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa nodded. \"I take it the transformation was permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMattie nodded back, fighting tears. \"It was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider yourself fortunate.\" Calmly, Tess said. \"Male Nekos are very rare; your teen years would have been very rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl nervously stepped up behind Tessa. She was slightly shorter than Mattie with mid back length black hair and ocean blue eyes. She also wore a pink skirt, indicating she was a boy who was permanently transformed. \"I- I'm Kimi Mystique.\" Softly, she said. \"How were you changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMattie sighed. \"My gender was a coin toss since I was born, being a Neko.\" Blushing, she replied. \"Long story short, magic won over my chaotic science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pleased that Mattie left out what mom and dad had tried to do to him when he was much younger then turned to Kimi. \"We are pleased to meet you, Kimi.\" Kindly, you said. \"How were you changed, if you don't mind us asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi teared up slightly before Tessa spoke up. \"Her mother and father got into a fight.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"Kimi, known as Ken then, tried to break it up and was inadvertently hit with a powerful gender and age spell from her mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at that. \"What happened to your mom and dad?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi sniffed away some tears. \"Their fight triggered some kind of fail safe, changing them into three year olds; too young to use their powers.\" Worrisome, she replied. \"The head witch, Ella Mist said they would stay as three year olds, being babysat by their relatives until I graduate here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that. \"Harsh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been worse.\" Honestly, Tessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl stepped up and gave a graceful bow. She was slightly taller than you with shoulder length red hair and dark blue eyes. She wore a red skirt which somehow placed you and Mattie on guard. \"Greetings, your highness.\" Sweetly, she said. \"I am Fae Amaris; it is an honor to be in your presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's creepy...\" Whispering carefully, Mattie commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement but did not comment on it. You simply gave Fae a patient smile. \"The honor is mine, Fae.\" Casually, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fae is the daughter of a quasi rogue known as Jinx Amaris.\" Patiently, Rose said. \"That is the only reason why she wears the rogue skirt color of red.\" She sighed. \"She is here to learn the laws of magic and chaotic science before she falls into her mother's footsteps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth girl stepped up, rolling her eyes at Fae's introduction of herself before turning to you. She was near your height with mid back auburn hair and deep brown eyes. \"I'm Avery Skye, its a pleasure.\" Gruffly but politely, she said. \"Out of curiosity, why did two high profile witches like yourselves choose Spellblossom over Witchbloom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really wasn't our choice.\" Shrugging, you explained. \"Also, we did not know we even were 'high profile' until Miss Rose explained it to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Surprised, Avery asked. \"Your father must be protective to quite a degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly. \"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others giggled with you except for the fifth girl who seemed to want to make herself as unnoticeable as possible, sitting in the far corner. She was about Mattie's height with mid shoulder length dust blond hair and bright blue eyes. She wore a plaid skirt which made you curious. Rose cleared her throat, causing her to jump slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm Raven Wolfram.\" Somewhat sheepishly, the fifth girl said. \"I kind of... well, woke up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Taken back, you said. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed. \"That will take some explaining.\" Wearily, she said. \"You see, she comes from a world parallel to our own and fell through a rip in time and space; ending up here, in our world in this school.\" She sighed before adding, \"She wears the plaid skirt as she is a ward of the school... an orphan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that as did Mattie. \"Is there no way to send her back?\" Worried, Mattie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sadly shook her head. \"I'm afraid not.\" Seriously, she replied. \"The rip she fell through was unstable at best and it nearly killed 'him'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened at that news while Raven began to sob slightly. \"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose shook her head. \"It is best if we start class.\" Motioning everyone to take a seat, she said. \"I will start with a brief history of witches in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brief history?\" Confused, Tessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"It may surprise you all that witches have only existed in this world for the passed two hundred years; we all came from the very world Raven fell from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Raven was intently listening as Rose continued...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Rose paused to compose herself while telling the story, Tess asked, \"Miss Rose... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed, dabbing away a few tears. \"The gateway was quickly closed and sealed when both sides realized what had happened only it was too late for hundreds on both sides who were literally violently pulled through into an alien world.\" Sadly, she said. \"My grandmother was only a child when this happened; she was pulled out of her mother's grasp who desperately tried to keep a hold of her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember my grandmother telling me similar stories.\" Tearing up, Avery said. \"She told me that an effort was made to return to their own world but they were denied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"Both powers were fortunate to be able to close the gateway when it was first opened.\" Serious, she explained. \"To make a second attempt, regardless of the reason, was deemed a suicidal endeavor as it could force a paradox of biblical proportions; the merging of two realities into one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why gateway magic and science is forbidden, Miss Rose?\" Shaken, Fae asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For that exact reason, it is forbidden to all but the governing powers, yes.\" Firmly, Rose replied. \"The lives of hundreds of witches were forever changed because of of an experiment gone horribly wrong. One can only guess what had happened to the ones pulled from this world into the other.\" She sighed, a slight smile forming onto her face. \"However, in the two hundred years since, we have made a home in this world and blossomed into a thriving secret community along side the host power of mad science. We are the bearers of real magic; we are witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the class applauded Rose upon finishing her lecture.

Those who possess all five are powerful indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that like magic?\" Confused, Raven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose shook her head. \"No; not at all.\" Bemused, she said. \"Elementals can not cast spells, just control the elements to a small degree. For example, one who has power over Earth can change gravity in an isolated area, throwing her mad science brother to the ceiling or making it hard for him to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would such a power make a boy a witch or a girl a mad scientist?\" Worried, Avery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"Unfortunately, yes.\" Calmly, she said. \"A witch boy with too much strength can find himself transforming into a girl and a witch. On the same coin, a girl with too much elemental power can become a boy and a mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If a boy were turned into a girl, would he become a witch, like Mattie?\" Curious you asked. \"Would that be the same for a girl turned into a boy; become a mad scientist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if the father and mother have the two powers in their bloodlines.\" Serious, Rose replied. \"However, a normal boy can be granted the power of a mad scientist and a normal girl can be granted the power of a witch but both come with prerequisites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as...?\" Curious, Fae asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In both cases, the boy or girl would have had to performed a great selfless act or deed that saved a witch or mad scientist or gained the attention of the respective powers.\" Honestly, Rose said. \"Such a gift is not bestowed upon a normal individual lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So witch boys with no mad science are juggernauts and mad science girls with no magic are elementals.\" trying to understand, Raven said. \"What creates this balance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good question.\" Smiling, Rose said. \"Both mad science and magic are somewhat supernatural. Those born into these families without the prerequisite of being the proper gender have the power but it lies dormant. That dormant power is what gives them their natural abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then over use of those natural abilities is what wakes up that power.\" Understanding, Avery said. \"Do they offer training for these abilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nodded. \"We do have schools for these children.\" Calmly, she said. \"They too have laws to follow and consequences to face if they break them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the clock then sighed. \"That is all for this morning's class.\" Standing up, she said. \"Please take this time to reflect on what you have learned. \"We will continue your lessons after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, as you enjoyed lunch with your class...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked around and saw no one. You paused, listening carefully but heard nothing and turned back to the book you had found. Opening it, you were immediately bombarded by an eerie dim light. It startled you at first but it quickly faded and you shrugged it off to flip through the pages. As you read the first few pages, though, your face began to turn pale; the contents of each page had an uncanny familiarity to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This page talks about serum making.\" you whispered. \"This page, 'events' or spells... and this page...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly closed the book, shaking your head. \"It can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed the book down then leaned over the coffee table, waving your delicate hand over the center of it. The table top seemed to melt away and a large faded book rose from inside before the table top became solid again. On the cover of the book, in large bold letters was the title, 'The Magic Book'. You took the book into your hands and held it close to your heart. \"Is it possible?\" whispering, you asked yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book had been given to you by your Aunt Viva, shortly after your brother, James vanished. At the time, you blamed yourself for it happening, though your dad said it was not your fault. You did not fully understand then what Aunt Viva meant when she spoke to you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything in life occurs for a reason, Jessica.\" she said. \"That is why I am passing this book on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked her, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that has been passed down from mother to daughter for centuries in our family.\" cryptically, Viva replied. She then pointed to you serious. \"You must not tell anyone about that book you now possess, especially not your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not ready to let go.\" again, cryptically, Viva replied. \"Study and practice the contents of that book well, Jessica, and I promise you it will, someday, save your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you first opened the book, you found instructions to a hidden door in your bedroom and how to gain access to it. Beyond the door, you found a series of secret hallways that moved throughout the house and a secret room in a full attic you did not know was there before. It was already fully equipped with everything any witch could want or need, including libraries of books on the subject of magic. Upon exploring this new floor of the house, you discovered it belonged to mom who had passed away a few short years after your little brother Mat was born. You decided to follow in your mother's footsteps and began to study the curios book inside the secret room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, you began to practice and soon love magic and witchcraft. You understood then why you could not tell your family. Your father would have feared for your safety and forbid you to study the magic any further, you were not about to allow that to happen. Volunteering to do help with the house keeping after school was a brilliant plan in your mind to earn some peace so to practice your magic without interruption. In the year that passed since then, you had become quite talented and, thanks to a few successful spells, rather intelligent. Only that had a down side as well. School became too easy, thus slightly boring, as you could teach the teacher a thing or two. Fortunately, at home, you found that just being yourself kept any suspicions from rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your mind to the present, you looked at your book then to the one you found and sighed. \"I guess there's only one way to be certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your book next to the other and opened them both up to compare them to each other. As you did, your eyes widened, a cold chill running down your back. \"This is nuts!\" your fear and voice rising above a whisper, you said. \"These books are practically identical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then held out your hand and concentrated, summoning a bright but harmless flame to your hand, thinking about your discovery. \"Have I been studying witchcraft.... or mad science!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, as you mussed over your own question, someone was watching and listening....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

One lightning bolt struck the front porch at an unnatural angle. There was a flash before a tall, dark elderly man appeared where the odd lightning had struck. He sported an eighteenth century gentleman's suit with unusually long coat tails that moved about as if they had a mind of their own. He wore knee high riding boots, a top hat covering his raven black hair, and carried a silver tipped cane with a large diamond.

The only way to become your male self again is to complete her training or to get her to accept mad science training as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How inventive of you.\" Sarcastically, Nathan, now Bethany said. \"How did you gain the power to grant me such knowledge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head witch taught magic to a certain frightened but powerful little girl a few years back.\" Sporting a toothy grin, he replied. \"I tolerated it in the name of science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricked the head witch?\" Disturbed, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin chuckled madly. \"Do not fret, my little cherub.\" Grinning, he said. \"She returned the favor by coming to me as a frightened but powerful little boy. We tricked each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Crossly, Viva asked. \"Am I to train Ty in mad science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you so wish.\" Amused, Devlin replied. \"However, you are to supervise James' training of his brothers and help if anything goes wrong. You have the same amount of training at your disposal and it will help you both greatly in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she have an early way out like dad, er, mom?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can both end this early in one of two ways.\" Turning serious, Devlin said. \"One, Jessica and her brothers complete their training; Ty as well if <i>Geo</i> so chooses. Two, both Ty agrees to learn magic and Jessica agrees to learn mad science. Both have to agree, not just one or the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Annoyed, Geo said. \"Just perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so glad you agree and approve of my solution.\" Grinning madly, Devlin said. \"My work here is done for now. Chow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light and a hollow thunder like boom, he was gone. Geo and... mom glared at each other but paused as the doorbell rang. Your cousins had arrived.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just returned from a year he was still trying to completely wrap around his head. The year before, he learned that he and his father possessed the power of chaotic energy, making them mad scientists. Tex and Mat would soon reach the age where their bodies and minds would produce this energy as well. However only boys possessed such power and James believed that Jessica would be left out as she was a girl. Only dad informed him that Jessica possessed magic but she would have to discover this on her own and, once discovered, she would have to be sent to a special school to learn control. Being the eldest son, James had to undergo special training so to protect himself and others from his own powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames readily agreed to this and left for this special schooling as he was very close to his brothers and sister as well as his friends, Jack and Tonya. He did not wish any harm to come to anyone because of any misuse of his power, hence he had to prove he was responsible before receiving his laboratory. It disturbed James to have to leave without telling anyone but father believed it was for the best that they do not know of the family secret until the time was right. Also, the family enjoyed playing friendly pranks on each other and, with mad science in the fray, those pranks would intensify. James smiled, knowing you would likely end up as 'one of the boys' during these pranks, though he nor father would allow you to be kept that way for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James entered the house, he expected to find Tex but he instead found you looking into a chaotic science book. Worse, you also had a magic book and from what he had heard, the two were practically identical. \"That is not possible.\" whispering, James said. \"The book has millions of sensors, woven into the pages, to only allow boys with chaotic energy to read the text...\" he gulped. \"More disturbing still, where did she get that magic book!?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly fired off a globe of blue energy to counter it. His 'spell' hit yours and the two exploded, filling the entire house with a strange colored light. When the light eventually faded, you and James both screamed in fright. You were now a boy in girl's clothing and he was a girl in boy's clothing. \"Nice going... <i>bro</i>!\" annoyed, James yelled. \"You switched both our genders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pushed me into casting that spell!\" irritable, you fired back. \"That and you are the one who caused my spell to explode, not me! This is your fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour argument was cut short by two feminine screams in another part of the house. You grabbed your magic book while James grabbed the chaotic science book before you both quickly ran to the source of the screams. You soon found Tex and Mat, both transformed into girls, with a tall woman who you immediately knew was dad. He looked at you, holding your book, then turned to James who was holding his book. At first, you thought dad was going to explode in anger, or at least a high annoyance but she instead began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I can explain.\" wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was not intentional, father.\" wincing as well, James added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad only laughed harder, more maniacally.

If Matt finds it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for it...\" Grinning, dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned hearing a feminine scream a few seconds later. \"Daddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Matt is impressively intelligent but he lacks wisdom.\" Smiling, he said. \"I still will not force... her to enter the lioness den but I have a feeling she will go there herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grinned madly. \"The magic book belonged to 'Sarah' Port.\" Amused, he explained. \"She left it here during her visit. He gave a smug look. \"That and I placed fly drone on the book so to see the inside of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So naturally, Matt will believe Ms Port or one of her daughters will be responsible.\" Rolling your eyes, you said. \"That is insane! They will know its a set up! They are sure to spot the mechanical fly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a minor concern as I use such devices to watch over the house.\" confident, dad said. \"Also, they will know that Sarah left her book behind.\" He paused, smiling. \"Normally, that means a year as a boy or living without magic depending upon the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is exactly what 'Sarah' wants.\" Sighing, you said. \"Only, if she is being abused...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she and or Matt may be punished by means that could break the lasting peace accord between our two powers.\" Turning serious, dad said. \"The leaders of both powers will step in quickly to avoid this nightmare and Ms Port will be neutralized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... neutralized?\" Suspicious, you asked. \"There is more to this, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"More than you will be able to understand.\" Patiently, he said. \"Let's just say that Ms Port had used up two of her three strikes. One, she never married. Two, she never 'legally' adopted any children....\" He frowned. \"This is why she is under investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Samuel, or rather, Sarah is the third strike.\" Wincing, you said. \"You have enough evidence, why not bust her now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"Ms Port has a lot of clout in the witch community.\" Darkly, he explained. \"We must approach this carefully or risk damaging the trust between the two powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A public relations nightmare.\" Worried, you said. \"What do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt is under strict surveillance, being the grandson of the head mad scientist.\" Smiling slightly, dad said. \"If Ms Port is wise, she will restore Matt or assure him that the spell will wear off. If she panics, well then we will have her dead to rights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, girl Matt stormed to Ms Port's house, holding the magic book. Ms Port opened the door before he could knock. \"Samuel left this behind when he visited.\" Barely remaining calm, Matt said. \"It changed me the instant I picked it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Port's eyes widened slightly before she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mechanical fly flew off the book unseen and landed onto the ceiling to gain a panoramic view of the room. Matt was frightened but not speechless. \"Change me back, witch!\" Angry, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, child!\" Forcefully, Ms Port barked. \"Do not move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was startled into silence; he froze on the spot. Ms Port placed a light hand onto her head and gazed deeply into her eyes. After a moment, she sighed. \"You were lucky this time.\" Ruefully, Ms Port said. \"Your own power prevented the spell from forcing a permanent change. I'd dare say you will return to your annoying self in about two hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news relieved Matt but he remained defiant. \"Why won't you change Samuel back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Port sighed, studying Matt's face. \"She could have changed herself back to normal a long time ago if she only tried or asked to be walked through it.\" Firmly, she replied. \"I will not change anyone back to normal just because they demand it!\" Frustrated, she muttered, \"They need to learn how to survive on this side of the rift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Matt heard her last statement and turned slightly pale. \"Wait a minute...\" Startled, he said. \"This side of the rift?\" She gasped. \"You are a smuggler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your house, you and dad watched the video feed from the mechanical fly. Dad sighed, hearing Matt's realization of Ms Port's occupation. \"Damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A smuggler?\" Worried, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad ignored you at first, he was frantically gathering seemingly random objects in his study. \"There are witches and mad scientists alike who wish to start a new life in a new world.\" Motioning you to follow, he said. \"However, there is a mountain of red tape to go through for one to permanently move from one reality to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what brings the business of smuggling people back and forth.\" Wincing, you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or sending someone through the rift to get them out of the way.\" Darkly, dad replied. \"Either way, Matt is in serious danger of being sent through the rift or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused you to panic as you followed dad to the grandfather clock. He opened the face door and turned it to 13 o'clock. You found this unusual as all clocks only went up to twelve. This clock went up to 24. Dad had said it was a military time clock when you were much younger. The clock moved aside, revealing a secret doorway. \"We don't have a second to lose!\" running through, dad said. \"I must act now or we will lose Matt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the door was an extensive laboratory that seemed to go on forever. It was beyond you to understand how such a room could exist inside a wall of your house but you had more important matters on your mind. Dad began to install the various items from his study into a complex machine before frantically typing a series of commands. \"Ms Port is about to learn what happens when you trifle with a mad scientist.\" Furious, he declared. He then turned to a microphone. \"RELEASE MY CHILD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Port residence...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wind howled as cars and trees flew about at impossible speeds. Matt looked up surprised as Ms Port looked at the skies in horror.

Matt smiled. \"Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RELEASE MY CHILD!\" Angrily the face demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's voice shook the house at its foundation, forcing Ms Port to hold her ears.

But what mattered right now was escaping, and Samantha was going to be a part of that. Ms Port's daughters had been alerted, if the house was ever breached. The woman knew that her children would be at the safehouse on the other side of the rift by this point, waiting for their Mother to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word Ms Port teleported away from the door, the police took that as a cue that she wasn't going quietly. And they wasted no time in storming the place, only when they got to the living room Ms Port was there. Holding Samantha in her arms as a human shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not take a single step further, or she'll become a girl permanently!\" Voe barked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom! Stop this!\" Samantha shouted out, the poor kid was scared witless. He or she had no idea of what the hell was going on. The officers hesitated, and Ms Port took that chance. She kicked out the carpet in front of her, exposing a large sigil carved into the wood. It was an old witch spell, that would take her to where it had been drawn. In an instant there was a flash of red lights as Ms Port stepped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was gone, Samantha with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Moray house Matt had arrived back safely, Jessica and her Father having turned him back to normal.<br>\r\n\"Damm, she got away.\" Jessica said sighing at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Mr Moray didn't seem the least bit concerned, in fact he was smiling.<br>\r\n\"What's with the large grin Dad? By all accounts you should be annoyed that Ms Port got away with my friend.\" Matt muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's just say that where Ms Port is going will be anywhere but safe, rouge witches have much to fear.....\" Nathan said with a bemused grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ms Port had escaped, going through the sigil on the other side. It was a little safehouse on the other side of the rift, Samantha was silent aside from sobbing. Her Mother just glared at her child, annoyed that her offspring was weak. Unlike her older daughters, speaking of which they should be in the room ready to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were there, only not the way Ms Port thought they would be. Her eldest daughter Jane was in the middle, in her late teens. The one to her right was second youngest, Patricia who was just 13. And lastly there was Erica, a girl about Matt's age who had been the most eager to turn Samuel into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all sitting on chairs, bound by thick rope with gags over their mouths. Ms Port was shocked by this, and then a flash came out the corner of her eyes to the left. In an instant she then yelped out, a Jian was thrown at her. A type of Chinese blade stabbed her right in the left shoulder with enough force to pin her to the nearby wall, blood lightly seeped out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a figure emerged from the shadows.......<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np8/char/kenshi-mk9concept.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np8/ch...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-....You!!\" Ms Port spat out, Samantha by this point had entered a state of mild shock. It was all too much to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voe Port, we meet at last. I must say this has been too easy. Your daughters are piss poor witches, even the Bane family put up a better fight. But I like it when it's easy to take down my targets.\" the man was Chon Kay. This man was feared by any witch who didn't abide by the law, to the point where they gave him the nickname of blind vengeance. Ms Port knew of this man, how most magic attacks seemed to just brush off of him. He had never been turned into a girl either, Chon was a master of the Asian art of chi. An energy hardly understood by the witches of the western world, in fact all rouge witches were ordered to kill him on sight. He was that much of a danger to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing him were two girls named Viva and Vogue, dressed in the same type of armour that Chon wore. Only it was fit for their size, both girls were daughters to a known rouge witch. Who only used them as pawns, the blind vengeance didn't stand for this. And in a surprising act took the girls under his care, the girls were considered traitors by rouge kind from then on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Port was about to try and move when Chon closed in, backhanding her with his left hand. He then muttered \"I suggest you don't move an inch, all I need to do is move the blade down and into your heart.\" to show this the blind vengeance's left hand then moved to caress the handle of the sword. Almost as if he contemplated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then moved his blindfold covered gaze down to Samantha, who by this point had passed out. \"Girls take this child away, and restore his gender. I'm sure he'll be thankful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue said not a word, they knew that their adoptive Father was quite serious about this. Viva picked Samantha up and over her shoulder, thanks to Chon's martial arts training the girls had developed good upper body strength. It came in handy as most witches didn't expect the use of hand to hand combat when fighting another witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the V twins had left Chon muttered to Ms Port in a dark tone \"Now Voe, you will tell me everything I want to know. If I like what I hear then you'll be fine, if not......I leave you where you are and the sword stays too. Tell me about the people involved in the rift smuggling operation.....\"</span></div></div>",

A quick look down proved that Samuel was still a girl with the dress, and memories of what happened began to run through the mind. Samuel began panting, and quickly Viva and Vogue entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy!\" Viva said as she quickly put her hand on Samuel's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep breaths, please calm down.\" Vogue said, putting her hand on Samuel's solar plexus. That was a little trick Chon had done with the girls when they had trouble sleeping or were in a scared state of mind, the extra part was to use some chi energy. The girls had been learning how to do that since Chon took them in, little things. They couldn't increase their speed or heal wounds with it, but it could appear on their hands at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough Samuel began to noticeably calm down, once Vogue removed her hand Sam looked at the pair and said \"Wh-How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva tapped the bridge of her nose and said \"It's not magic, not in the slightest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancient Chinese secret.\" Vogue said as she took a seat opposite Samuel. Viva quickly did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....What's going to happen now?\" Samuel asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk, just a few questions. Nothing more, after that we'll get you turned back into a guy if you want it. And go from there, we can help you trust us.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel was a bit hesitant but then nodded and said \"What about that Chinese guy, Chon was his name right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's busy at the moment but he told us to speak to you, don't worry you can trust us. Not all witches are evil.\" Vogue said to assure their guest, it was true. The girls had been slaves to their Mother before Chon saved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what do you want to ask?\" Samuel states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Sisters, when did you first find out they had magic?\" Viva says, she produced a notebook and pen from the folds of her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....few months ago, they asked me to come and help them tidy in the kitchen. When suddenly the door was shut and the next thing I knew....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue raises a hand to say that Samuel didn't need to continue, Viva wrote down his words. Vogue would then state \"Do all your Sisters have magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was turned into a girl by all of them. So I feel correct in saying they do.\" Samuel says as she huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva then said \"Okay. Samuel you needn't worry about them. They'll be punished. Please tell us more about the women that visited your Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel was quiet, the V girls leaned in to wait. Then their guest went on with \"Mom never let me see them, I was told to stay in my room during it. The same with my Sisters. Sometimes when I was curious I would use the old glass on the doorframe trick, my room was upstairs. But I did hear a couple of names being tossed around. I think there was Lily Sweetie, Eliza Ren and Helena Young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue suddenly paused, but Viva quickly wrote this information down. She sighed before saying \"Well Eliza's in jail, we know her children. Lily's in hiding as far as we know, and Helena is presumed dead. But this is very important information, thanks a lot Samuel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest nodded before saying \"Can I please become a boy now?\" Vogue smirks before waving her hand. Samuel felt himself changing back to his usual self, the dress even changing back to boy clothes. He looked in quiet awe before Viva giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're pretty good at magic, to be honest Sisters really didn't bother trying to improve their spell. Come on, let's talk about what happens next.\" Viva said.</span></div></div>",

Unknown to him, you were uncertain what to make of your strange discovery. You decided it best to return both the chaotic science book and your magic book back to where you had found them and sneak away before anyone took notice of you. As you walked out of the sitting room, however, James had second thoughts and returned to speak with you. Both he and you nearly collided in the hall and stepped back startled. For a moment, you both stared at each other with an uncomfortable awkwardness in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. Hey, James.\" Slowly, you said. \"I'm glad to see you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sis.\" Softly, James replied. \"It feels good to be home again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and James again felt the awkwardness in the air.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was obvious that neither James or you were willing to open a conversation. You nor he had a single clue where to start or how the other would react to the news of his or your powers. You suspected that at least one person inside the house had power similar to your own, the 'chaotic science' book you had discovered was proof of that. However, you were at a loss as to who it might have been and you were not about to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so infuriating!\" you thought. \"I can't just suddenly yell out, hey, guys, I'm a witch are any of you a mad scientist?\" you looked at James and let out a low sigh, which he noticed, then thought, \"I have to get away, for now, and call Aunt Viva.  She got me started on this, she has to know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had seen some of your power and had his suspicions as to who had given you a magic book. However, he did not have enough evidence to prove anything.  Also, he was at a loss as to how you could have read the book of chaotic science at all as only boys were supposed to be able to read it.  Aside from that, he knew you had the potential for magic as your mom was a witch. However, he never dreamed it would become so strong so quickly and he was not about to guess how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a dilemma for the record books!\" Frustrated, he thought. \"I can't just tell her that I'm a mad scientist and demand, or even ask, where the hell she got so much magical power in one year as even boys can't gain chaotic power that fast!\" he let out a low sigh of his own, which you noticed, then thought, \"I have to get away from her, for now, and talk to dad... maybe he can enlighten me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I have to my homework now.\" you said. \"I've been studying college level courses to get ahead after graduation.\" you paused, seeing James' surprised look and wondered if it was a mistake to say that. \"Can you recommend any good reads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah.\" replied James.\" he handed you a thick book from his bag. \"It covers all of the required courses to enter the top colleges in the nation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, taking the book and sadly walked away from him, towards the stairs. As James watched you leave, he remembered finding it strange when dad mentioned that you were hitting the books hard shortly after he had left for his training. It caused him to think that the answer to the mystery lied somewhere in your bedroom. He did not dare go in there just yet as he did not want a fight between him and you over privacy issues. He decided it more wise to talk to dad first and see what other strange things you had been doing while he was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to know who is training her or if she is learning alone.\" Concerned, he thought. \"I'd better watch her carefully for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he sadly walked towards the stairs, picking up his luggage, and went up, into his room. It was just as he had left it with the exception of welcome home cards from you, Tex, Matt and dad. He grinned at them and read the one from you first. Sadly, there were no clues inside. Frustrated and worried, he left the room and walked towards dad's study. On the way there, he met up with Tex and Matt. He stopped, giving them each a warm hug, then asked them if they had any clues to your odd behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, James.\" Frowning, Tex replied. \"The unknown factor of Jessica remains elusive to me.\" He frowned, looking frustrated. \"I had repeatedly searched the attic meticulously but found nothing of note that may be regarded as suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I searched through Jessica's room a few times.\" added Matt. \"She yelled at me for it.\" he began to tear up. \"I didn't find anything, James... She is hiding something though, I'm worried about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" admitted James. then he thought, \"More than you might realize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames politely excused himself then knocked on dad's. \"Father, it is I, James!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, my boy.\" came dad's authoritative voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked in and immediately noticed that dad was worried about you as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dad drew in a long breath and slowly released it before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are aware, your mother was a powerful witch.\" Somewhat sadly, dad said. \"She died at the hands of a rogue witch attempting to steal your youngest brother, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This offers no comfort nor any answers to how Jessica had acquired a magic book, summon a strong test flame, or was able to read the book of chaotic science, father.\" Firmly but respectfully, James countered. \"If you know something, I implore you to enlighten me so I may take the appropriate steps to help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not possess the necessary skills to help her even if I reveal all to you, young man.\" Sternly, dad said. \"Everyone has a right to their secrets; I have mine and you have yours. We would be hypocritical to deny Jessica her secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if those secrets may jeopardize her well being, father?\" Frowning, James demanded. \"Only boys are supposed to be able to read the book of chaotic science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because of the nanites woven into the pages programmed to detect chaotic power.\" Smiling slightly, dad said. \"A strong magical aura can sometimes be mistaken for the power of a mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That troubles me as well, father.\" Frustrated, James said. \"Jessica summoned a flame that showed at least a year of experience. Are you not even curious as to who may be teaching her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"I have my suspicions.\" Serious, he said. \"However, you nor I can not act on suspicion alone; we need more evidence than a single visual encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care to share your suspicions, father?\" Raising an eyebrow, James inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"I rather not speak of it until I am absolutely certain.\" Firmly, he said. \"If I am correct, Jessica is in way over her head. If my logic is flawed then this is simply a family affair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad then turned to the window. <i>\"If I discover that either of those two witch schools are trying to pull away my little girl behind my back, I will cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gulped seeing a death look in dad's eye. \"Father...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's expression quickly softened as he turned to James and smiled. \"My earlier scans of the weather indicate that the conditions tonight will be perfect for a full test run on your new anti gravity bar. Results of your simulated flights at Eligere Sententia showed that a night flight often cleared your mind of turmoil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, inside your secret attic lair, you stood in front of your cauldron facing an image of your aunt Viva in a flume of smoke bellowing from it after casting a spell to call upon her. She looked down at you with a look of concern on her face. \"You look troubled my dear.\" Softly, she said. \"Tell me what worries you so; I would like to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly explained what had happened in the sitting room upon discovering the book of chaotic science and finished saying, \"I don't know how I am going to tell him I am witch. I'm even more worried about telling daddy that I had been studying magic without telling him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva was silent for a moment then replied, \"I believe it is supposed to be warm and quite cloudy tonight. A good night ride on your broomstick will do well to help place your mind and spirit back into balance. The answers will come to you more clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that as you always wanted to take your 'broomstick' out and give it a real shake down.<br>\r\n\"Four hours to launch!\" you said, now smiling. \"I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, you approached James and gave him a warm hug, surprising him. \"I'm sorry I didn't hug you when I saw you back home.\" you said, kindly. \"I sort of blamed myself for your leaving so quickly. When I saw you return, I was afraid that you might...\" you teared up. \"...push me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are completely blameless regarding my sudden departure.\" Calmly, James replied. \"I was offered a once in a lifetime chance at a higher education early in life and I accepted.\" he paused. \"Rumor has it you were a bit of a lone wolf during my absence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fishing.\" you thought. then you said, \"Because I was studying and helping with the household chores. It kind of took a lot of my time so I cherished my alone time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat became the main topic of your dinner conversation that night but both you, James, and dad avoided the subject of any secrets you or other may have. Still both you and James used casual conversation to try to pry answers out of each other. Neither he or you gained any ground but this did not detour any future plans to try again later. Near midnight, you opened your walk-in closet doors, entered, and closed them behind you. That triggered a secret door in the back of the closet to open revealing a hidden dim lit staircase. You followed them to your attic lair where you found your broomstick waiting for you. It was a remake of the early eighteen hundreds broomstick fabled to carry witches through the air only this model was made of solid oak with bristles of grapevine woven together with thick spindle thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon mounting it, you were immediately hovering over the floor, looking at a tunnel that led to the very wide chimney of the house. You turned to a small mirror which, after a quick spell, showed you the outside area from your pet crow nestled in a nest on the roof. Her name was Neva, she served as your eyes outside of the house. \"Everything looks clear.\" Smiling, you said. \"Thanks, Neva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeva squawked, \"Fly already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and willed your broom to fly up the chimney. You cheered as you flew straight out into the night sky. Unknown to you, James had launched through the same chimney ten minutes before you and was already in flight above the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, James was hovering high above the clouds, staring at the moon. It was full that night but the heavy cloud cover kept everything dark below, so it was safe to fly about unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something about staring at a full moon that just takes my breath away.\" he said, with a sigh. \"I wish I could show Jessica this. Maybe it will open her up. I want to help her.\" He paused sensing magic nearby and looked about but saw noting alarming. \"There is a witch nearby but who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a low gasp as he saw you rise above the clouds, in front of him on a magical broomstick! Normally, he would have laughed at the notion of a mere broomstick carrying the weight of an average  human being. Only there you were, hovering several hundred feet above the ground on just such a device!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James loves to stare at the moon.\" you said aloud to yourself. \"I can see why. It really placing things into a new perspective.\" you sighed. \"I wish I could show James the moon this close. Maybe it will open him up and he will tell me what is troubling him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just nervous about talking to me as I am!\" thought James. \"Fascinating!\" He then loudly cleared his throat, causing you to turn around, startled. He then stated, \"It seems as if we both have more than a few secrets to hide. I'm willing to share a few, if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you reply?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or him; neither of you should have been in the air to begin with. A part of you wondered if it would be best to just fly off and leave things unresolved, but another part knew leaving things to simmer would end in escalation; in the end you decided to bring things to a point, but on your own terms. Quietly, you cast a somewhat subtitle spell at your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute flew past without either of you saying anything to the other. Just as you were beginning to believe James couldn't detect your spell, he gave a somewhat frightened cry. \"Hey! WHAT are you DOING!?!\" James said, genuinely alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that it is pointless to deny that we both have some sort of abilities, James. I agree with you that 'ladies first'\" you said in the same dry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You're turning me into a <i>woman</i>?

His bold move caused you to do a double take but you recovered swiftly and cackled as you gave pursuit. James glanced into the rear view mirror on his bar, expecting to find you far behind. He let out a snort and laugh seeing you were less than a car's length away, grinning wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least now I can see what kind of power she is packing.\" Bemused, he thought. \"Let's see if she can keep up on that piece of wood and vine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a surge of adrenaline, seeing that you were quickly coming within striking range with your magic. Normally, it was not easy to fire off blasts while flying a broomstick at such speeds. Fortunately, you had found a way around that. You had added oak branches to the broomstick which acted like handlebars, allowing you to fly one handed. You fired off several blasts and a few spells with your free hand only to find James firing back. He was using rear view mirrors on his bar to watch you and counter your attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's better at this than I thought!\" Smiling, you muttered. \"I have to admit, win or lose, this is going to be great fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh into the night sky, through the dense clouds, and around tall buildings, you chased James, just managing to stay right on his tail as you fired while he defended. You managed to take out one of his rear view mirrors, taking away at least part of his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's actually very skilled with that broomstick.\" Impressed, James stated to himself. \"I haven't been able to shake her yet.\" He then grinned proudly. \"Still, she has yet to strike a single blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gez!, I'm just barely staying on his tail and I'm giving it all she has!\" Frustrated, you stated. \"What is powering that thing!?!\" Then you smiled. \"It's time to add a little magic to the mix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you gripped both the handlebars and added your magic to the broomstick. Only, in your zealous move, you used too much and ended up passing James in a blur!  This time, he was forced to do a double take. \"What could she be up to?\" Raising an eyebrow, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he let out a low scream as you suddenly turned around and fired magical blasts at him! He spun out of your path just narrowly missing getting hit by one of them as you passed. James laughed seeing that you still had a few tricks up your sleeve. He then became serious, knowing that he had to end the duel before things got out of hand. He allowed you to get within hearing rage then called to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, Jessica!\" He called. \"We will call this match a draw! Last one home talks first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then kicked your broomstick into overdrive but James was ready for you and activated some form of booster rocket, staying several feet ahead of you. Knowing that you were not going to win, you quickly touched one of your pierced earrings, calling to your crow, Neva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am coming in fast with an invited guest twenty feet ahead.\" you said. \"Be ready to welcome James to my lair, Neva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One boy in the pot!\" Squawking, Neva said in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behave, Neva!\" Giggling, you scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames flew down into the chimney with you right behind him giggling. When you reached the landing area, ten seconds after your brother, you found him looking about. \"Fascinating...\" Whispering, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my lair, James.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned to you, smiling slightly then turned back to the scene before him. You could tell that he was impressed; that made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost the race so here it goes...\" Smiling, you told him. \"I am a witch, just like my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew that his and your mother was a witch but he did not suspect that you knew of this. Nor was he aware that your aunt Viva was a witch as she hid her power very well from him. Dad seemed to know something but did not wish to speak of it unless he was certain. He guessed that your lair would provide the clues he needed to determine who had been teaching you magic.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James looked about with his eyes welling with tears. Your lair took up the entire width and length of the house with a vaulted ceiling painted to look like the night sky. All of the far walls were covered with books from floor to ceiling with the exception of a small door on the far side near the rear of the house where your bedroom lied on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere you and he stood was a small workshop set up to make and repair broomsticks with a small chemistry set to make magical armaments. He guessed they were to defend yourself against other witches as not all witches or mad scientists were united. Dad had told James before he left for training that some witches would try to attack her merely because of her last name. He was not sure why then but he knew now. Mad scientists and witches, though allies, do not fully trust the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room was a huge cauldron surrounded by a maze of hanging gardens with tables throughout to assemble ingredients for potions. From what James could tell from the short duel, you had become fairly skilled in the art of making potions. What concerned him was why he was not informed of your training. It was a question he intended to find an answer to soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were sectioned off areas of the room, hidden by office divider walls that he guessed served as a form of infirmary and or nap area for over night projects. There was also a crow, standing on the edge of the large cauldron staring at him. The crow itself did not unsettle him; it was the magical power he sensed coming from it. Certain animals such as crows or cats can accumulate magical power, though they can not use it. However, they can grant that power to augment the magical power of a witch they chose to bond with. These creatures were called familiars. James knew for a fact that mom had such a crow and now it was loyal to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was mother's sanctuary.\" Whispering, James said. \"How did you come to acquire it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through mom's will.\" Sadly, you replied. \"Only I did not know about it until aunt Viva approached me on my twelfth birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told James everything that had happened that day aunt Viva had approached you and how you came to practice and love magic and witchcraft. James listened intently; only nodding or grunting in response. When you had finished, he drew in a long breath then slowly released it. \"I take it aunt Viva has been your teacher for the entire eleven months since you gained access to this lair and the magic book?\" Evenly, he inquired. \"You have not been attending any schools of witchcraft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only training I had been given was from aunt Viva.\" Calmly, you said. \"She told me that if Spellblossom or Witchbloom all girls boarding schools learned I was practicing magic, they would try to quietly coax me into signing up with one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be ill-advised.\" Serious, James said. \"You are the only witch in a family of mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sort of figured that part on my own.\" Shuddering, you said. \"But what does that have to do with either of these schools that teach witchcraft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fear the attending staff of either school would try to convince you to 'transfer' into a family of all witches.\" Frowning, James replied. \"We the Moray family will not stand for that sort of practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would try to kidnap me?\" Startled, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just a rumor; likely unfounded.\" Flatly, James said. \"Still, would you take that chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face then softened. \"I am curious to see how you hold yourself in a one on one practice duel; low level energy bursts only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled slightly. \"Okay. What are the rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pointed to the circular landing platform you and he were standing on. Both yours and his broomstick were already placed on special hooks near the workstation. \"The first to knock the other off this landing wins.\" Smiling, James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"I can handle that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled. \"Let's have at it then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You counter by summoning a flame that harmlessly burns over the palm of your own left hand. James grins then tosses his sphere into the air. It seemed to explode only the pieces of it created a transparent globe around him with various screens with strange lettering on them. You suspected they were mathematical in nature as he was a mad scientist. Still, you replied by doing the same with your flame which also seemed to explode, creating a similar effect. Only your globe seemed less complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you know how to create a dueling sphere.\" Smiling, James said. \"Let us discover if you know how to wield it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to one of the various screens which lit up before a blast of energy fired from it. You quickly pointed to a specific spot inside your globe, firing a blast that countered James' attack. Now it was your turn; you pointed two fingers at two different points in the globe and a stream of fire and water fired from nowhere at James' globe. He chuckled and launched water and fire to counter act it in a similar manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Jessica.\" Calmly, James said. \"You understand the basics.\" He then turned serious. \"Prepare yourself for the real duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow. <i>\"What was that supposed to mean?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames moved his arms in a wild motion, seemingly pointing in every direction as if he were thwarting off a swarm of bees. He then suddenly stopped and grinned at you. \"I told you to prepare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as what seemed to have been everything in James' hidden arsenal came flying at you with impossible speeds! You raised your arms to defend yourself but stopped as a voice entered your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not think of what to do.\" It was Viva, watching through the flume of smoke over the cauldron. \"You already know; let your magic protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go your your control and allowed your magic to work on its own. Surprisingly, the fire shield summoned everything needed to counter every part of James' brutal assault! Once the attack had stopped, you felt your magic slipping back under your control. Part of you was thrilled that your magic could work as a separate entity to protect you. Another part of you was terrified fearing your magic could leave you at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was stunned by your seemingly unprepared response to his attack. Although none of it was in by any means meant to hurt you, they would have easily knocked you off the platform. Still, he managed to smile and look proud. \"Not bad for a in home student.\" Smirking, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned the smirk. \"It's my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames childishly stuck his tongue out at you. \"Nah! Nah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack and forth you and James fired and countered attacks with aunt Viva watching through the smoke. Within minutes, however, the duel was over. Who won?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You took it and he helped you back onto your feet. \"Well played, Jessica.\" Smiling, he said. \"Your skills are near equal to my own only you made one critical error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Catching your breath, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should only allow your power to defend you when you are caught unprepared.\" Serious, James explained. \"It takes more energy than you might think. Staying on the defensive until you spot a weakness in your opponent's attack strategy is wise but if you wait too long to strike, you lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother is quite correct, Jessica.\" Chiming in Viva said. \"I only gave you that advise during the duel as I am your instructor. You had to figure the rest on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, aunt Viva.\" Calmly, James said, facing her image. \"I take it you were the one who gave Jessica the magic book and had been teaching her magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded. \"Page three of your mother's will, James.\" Serious, she replied. \"It was her wish that she gain access to her lair and be trained by a member of the family upon her twelfth birthday. As her sister, I was asked to take on that task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not recall a third page to the will.\" Raising an eyebrow, James countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva smiled. \"It was in witch writing, intended for the female members of the family, James.\" Ruefully, she said. \"Recall the treaty between witches and mad scientists. Every witch is entitled to the right to pass on her knowledge of her practice to the next of kin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed. \"Why was I not informed?\" Irritated, he demanded. \"Also, dad seemed unaware of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father knows how to make witch writing reveal itself to him.\" Serous, Viva countered. \"It has been there all this time for both him and you to read.\" Seeing James' face harden, she added, \"Witch writing forms a contract between witches; it is not meant to deceive anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must contemplate how to explain this to father.\" Frowning, James said. \"He will not be pleased by this turn of events.\" His face softened. \"However, it is far better than what I had feared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Viva, would the two schools of witchcraft have tried to make me live with an all witch family?\" Worried, you asked. \"This seems to be James' fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would only have been during your training as a witch.\" Frowning, Viva replied. \"Still, yes, some would have attempted to coax you into doing that hence why I am training you from home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must return to my lab before father grows impatient for my return.\" Walking to his anti-gravity vehicle, James said. \"We will discuss this with him together, Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hand, causing his anti-gravity vehicle to vanish. You assumed it went back to his lab. He then waved his hand at you. Before you knew what happened he and you were suddenly in the living room where you saw dad jump slightly at your sudden arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report, James!\" Sternly, he snapped. \"Who has been teaching Jessica the art of witchcraft?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He opened it and retrieved mom's will. After making the witch writing reveal itself with a few muttered words, he carefully read the hidden wishes within the will and nodded. \"Everything appears to be in order.\" Softly, he said. \"However, you are obligated to inform me of these activities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am obligated to inform the parent of guardian of the student only if I am not a blood relative.\" Politely, Viva pointed out. \"I am her aunt and thus fully within my rights to teach her.

He wore a boomer hat, and a black suit covered by a long white lab coat. He turned, hearing dad's voice, revealing bright hazel eyes under thick glasses with goggles hung onto his hat. He gave a toothy grin, saluting dad with a wolf's head cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to my lair of teachings, James Moray!\" Smiling, he said. \"To what honor do I find you returning to Eligere Sententia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father and I are proudly giving my transformed sister a tour of this fine school so she will understand our powers rather than fear them.\" Motioning to you, James replied. \"He is rather skilled for being a home schooled witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero threw his head back, laughing before turning to you. \"How well are you coping to having a male form rather than being female, my dear?\" Amused, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying not to think about it.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero chuckled, more kindly. \"It will take time to adjust to any new form.\" Calmly, he said. \"You are not the first to experience a gender transformation.\" He paused then asked, \"Are you planning to attend our prestigious academy of advanced learning of mad science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not one of the first items on my to do list.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You did not state it was not on your to do list!\" Smiling, Nero pointed out. \"You must be specific when answering a question as many answers can be turned against you if left open for interpretation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at that and quickly said. \"I have not yet decided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero smiled. \"That's better.\" Calmly, he said. \"You will find that mad scientists and witches alike will use your own logic against you to get their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What logic are you using then, professor?\" Smiling slightly, you asked. \"I get the sense that you are trying to recruit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero chuckled. \"Of course, I am, dear child...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, too many scientists overthink their plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we being detained as troubled students, professor?\" Annoyed another boy demanded. \"No rules or regulations were broken in our plan, despite the fact that our plan failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero's smile changed to that of a serious scowl. \"You have the audacity to ask such an unintelligent question, young man?!\" Angered, he inquired. \"We mad scientists are all held responsible for every mistake we make, regardless of how insignificant they may seem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any mistake made can cascade through a chain reaction, resulting in disastrous consequences.\" Speaking up, dad said. \"Mistakes left uncorrected are guaranteed to end in said result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero smiled at dad then motioned to you, dad, and James. \"Students, we are in the presence of three members of the Moray family.\" Smiling again, he said. \"They expect nothing less than perfection from trained mad scientists like yourselves.\" He then scoffed. \"Even Mr Moray's transformed daughter here could execute a plan better then the one you idiots pieced together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, sensing a trap only James spoke up. \"Forgive the interruption, my most patient professor; I can not contain my curiosity.\" Smiling, he said. \"What plan did these misguided students form which earned them to be dubbed troubled students?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero smiled madly. \"They attempted to duplicate my famous feat at Spellblossom all girls boarding school, using this school as the testing grounds.\" Smiling, he explained. \"Only they failed to anticipate the detection of an unauthorized gender transformation within the school grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should have declared their plan a self test of their capabilities.\" Smiling, dad said. \"That way, the gender transformation would have been authorized and they would not be in altercation with authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero eyed the students with a grin. \"Precisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned that Mr Moray's transformed daughter could execute our plan better than the one we 'idiots' pieced together.\" Defiant, the first student said. \"I believe we would all agree that would be interesting to witness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw the student a death glare, not realizing that you had just revealed to him that you were the transformed daughter. Nero laughed, shaking his head. \"I see you wish to challenge a member of the Moray family!\" Grinning, he said. \"What a dangerous concept. You are indeed a fanatic of risk taking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My transformed daughter is an authorized visitor of Eligere Sententia.\" Smiling madly, dad said. \"As such, 'he' is free to explore the school and leave without any consequences.\" He then eyed you, making you feel nervous. \"However, if 'he' is up to the challenge, I will allow 'him' to attempt to leave the school unnoticed as a test of his newfound attributes and existing resourcefulness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Jessie Moray?\" Smiling, Nero inquired. \"Are you up for the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to me if I fail?\" Nervous, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will be returned to me and we will return home where I shall keep my promise to you.\" Serious, dad said. \"This is a direct challenge from a troubled student.

Split up and we will regroup there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boys each took a different hall to search for you. Only you had stopped only a few feet down the hall and listened. \"The administration hall... well now I know which way not to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the minutes passed.

You would make a fine mad scientist, <i>Mr Moray.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left as the troubled students eyed you with a certain displeasure. Their cold glares made you feel uneasy only they remained in their seats to the dark return glare from dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This challenge is over, Jessie Moray is the victor.\" Smiling, Nero announced.

He casually entered the room where Tex was struggling to pull a book out of your hand. He stopped immediately after he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite an unnerving sight before me, children.\" Sternly, he said. \"Barging into a room and snatching a book from your sister's hand is hardly gentleman like behavior, Tex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The book is my personal possession, father.\" Almost whining, Tex protested. \"You know its importance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bemused smile formed upon dad's face.

Tex looked down at the book he was still trying to pry from you and screamed, jumping back as if he had just been electrocuted. \"That's the magic book! I wanted my book of chaotic science!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Grinning, dad said. \"However, the magic book sensed your desperation and desire to have it, thus it is granting your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex screamed again as the changes to his body accelerated. \"Jessica, please throw me the other book!\" Desperate, he pleaded. \"I need it to stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around for the other book but found it missing. You turned to dad to find the book in his hand. \"Your new sister will not be needing this for a while.\" Calmly, he said. \"She will have to learn the proper way to change herself back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, what is going on here?\" Worried, you asked. \"Are you and Tex some kind of mad scientists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded, a grin forming onto his face. \"All of the boys in this family are mad scientists.\" Calmly, he explained. \"We shall discuss it in length later.\" He then motioned to the pouting teenage girl where Tex once stood. \"For now, I suggest you help 'Erica' find some more appropriate clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fix this, daddy?\" Wincing, you pleaded. \"Te- err- Erica does not seem to like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have been more careful with her book and more alert when trying to reacquire it.\" Firmly, dad said. \"No; she will have to learn how to change herself back.

He moaned. \"Why are you following me, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, making yourself visible. \"Dad asked me to follow you in case you might need help.\" Approaching him, you admitted. \"He knows from experience how protective mothers of witch families can be of their daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a witch, then?\" Curious, Ms Mage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"My mother was a witch.\" Somewhat sadly, you said. \"My aunt is training me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any sisters?\" Concerned, Ms Mage pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"I'm the only daughter.\" Sighing, you said. \"My father can be very protective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you understand my position.\" Firmly but kindly, Ms Mage said. \"Since you are here with your brother, I will allow the two of you to enter. Be aware, though, I have strict house rules with spells and enchantments to enforce them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father has similar safeguards to enforce our house rules.\" Serious, Matt countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mage nodded and stepped aside. \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Matt into the house where you saw Lilith sitting on a couch in the sitting room. She was no taller than your brother with long sand brown hair and emerald blue eyes. She was wearing a pink princess dress, coloring a picture. Also sitting in the room were two girls, you guessed were her older sisters. One looked to be your age with long sand brown hair and fire hazel eyes.

He gulped loudly, trying not to focus on the girly things in the room. \"Keep your view on Lilith, think of something to say....\" Matt shouted in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed, the usual one that you'd do when you were about to start talking. Only Lilith motioned for him to sit on the end of her bed, Matt nodded and did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....Lilith said as she sat in the chair of her vanity, at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Lilith then went silent, Matt bit his lower lip and looked at his shoes.<br>\r\n\"This social situation is indeed very difficult, but I must try and persevere. Ms Mage did say there is good and evil in all sorts, consensus has shown that to be true most of the time.\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith would then start talking with \"So....you know much about witches then Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head \"Not really, I mean I know my Sis is one. And so was my Mom. But anything beyond that no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded and leaned forward, putting a hand on her chin in thought. \"Right....it's just I wanted to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's interest was piqued, he had to investigate. \"Go on, I'll hear you out. Remember what your Mom said though.\" he said. The last thing Matt wanted was to cause problems right now, that could increase the chance of his girl side being shown. And that was something he didn't dare entertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that Lilith took a sigh and stood up \"Have you by any chance heard of a Neko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word was odd, something Matt had never even heard of. Was it even a word? Matt lifted an eyebrow and said \"A what? I don't think I heard that right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith Mage bit her lower lip, unsure of how to go about this. Before figuring it might be best to explain, or rather show what she was talking about. She muttered something under her breath and.....a pair of small fur tufts appeared on her head. They were the same colour as her hair, just noticeable enough to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?! Remember no magic Lilith!\" Matt said as his eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith quickly waved her hands in front of Matt, and said \"No no it's not magic, it's well....a part of me. I've always had them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......What?....\" Matt said, tilting his head to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith looked down and fumbled with her hands before saying \"What animal do witches usually have Matt? Do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toad? That's one of them anyway, even I know that.\" Matt said. Upon hearing that Lilith and Matt began bursting into laughter, it was an awkward situation and they both sort of knew that laughing helped defuse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith took a happy sigh and then said \"What about the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a cat isn't it? But does that mean you are?...\" Matt said, putting both hands under his chin in thought. Being from a family of smart people it didn't take long for him to figure out something....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sort of. A Neko is a witch who's half human and half cat. They can be identified by the tufts of fur on their head, Mom says I need to keep them hidden unless I trust someone a lot.\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lightly coughed and said \"I see, well don't worry. You can trust me Lilith, so why are you half cat then? Are your Sisters the same as you?\" as much as he didn't want to admit it those tufts of fur looked rather....nice. Like it suited Lilith quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith shook her head \"No Mom told me that about 1 in 100 witches are Neko's, from what we know witches hundreds of years ago tried to cast a spell to gain the form of their cats. Something went wrong though, nobody knows what happened. But any witch, once they reach the age of 6 can have small tufts of fur which mark them as a Neko. Mom says that some even get tails, but I've not got one.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was silent, taking this all in. He had never heard of something like this, he assumed that all witches were the same. Just scary girls that could use something the opposite of science, but Lilith was being so upfront and honest with this. He couldn't help but feel impressed, and honoured considering that Lilith had said it was a close kept secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Matt?\" Lilith said with her arms behind her back, a minor blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of what you've just said, but I believe you. Thank you for telling me this Lilith.\" Matt nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl closed her eyes, smiled and let out a happy giggle.</span></div></div>",

It was something he hadn't felt before, and it sort of tickled. Maybe he could get used to this feeling, after all Lilith was different from most girls, even different from other witches. They had just shared an important secret with each other, one that no one aside from those close to really knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were then kneeling on the bed, with Lilith making purring noises under her breath.

Although they didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh we are we doing this anyway?\" Matt suddenly said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith blinked a couple of times, then shrugged and said \"I dunno, I kind of like it.

He had dark blonde hair to his ears and blue eyes hidden behind a pair of sunglasses. He wore a black leather jacket, T-shirts with Japanese writing on it and old nikes with blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was a few inches shorter than Ryan but just as well built. He had black hair, slicked back, and wore a red cloth over his eyes. Kayo raised a curious eyebrow but made no statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was slightly shorter than Jenny with long black hair, emerald blue eyes, and doll like features. Kayo's eyes widened slightly seeing her and bowed respectively. This surprised Amy but she bowed in return so not to seem rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was rather short for a boy around twelve years of age. He had dust blond hair and curiously deep blue eyes. Kayo's jaw dropped seeing him but she quickly recovered and smiled politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a unique group of friends you have here, Jenny.\" After a pause, Kayo said. \"Two warriors, a mage and a sleeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Kayo...\" Blushing slightly, Jenny protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\" Curious, Charlie stated. \"I can see the two warriors but a mage and a sleeper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo chuckled kindly. \"A mage is a person, typically female, who is a natural at defending herself and others from magic.\" Politely, she explained. \"A sleeper is a person, typically male, who possesses great power but has not yet discovered it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Confused, Charlie said. \"What power do I have then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you must discover on your own in your own time.\" Kindly, Kayo replied. \"If it is rushed, you will not be ready to control it.\" She then turned to Jenny. \"Lilith took Matt Moray into her bedroom to talk. His older sister is in the living room with my other two daughters. She is a witch as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded then turned to her friends. \"Remember, things are a bit backwards here.\" Serious, she said. \"Mad science is the dominate power and magic is the minority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may interest you that my daughters are graduated cadets from Rogue hunter academy.\" Proudly, Kayo said. \"They will be jointing the magical police forces soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue hunters?\" Curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are strict laws that protect the delicate peace between mad scientists and witches.\" Turning to Chon, Kayo explained. \"The rogue hunters are police officers who enforce those laws.\" She gulped. \"The punishments are just as strict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Adjusting his blindfold, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you can help me sort out this matter with Lilith.\" Sighing, Kayo said. \"She's so fragile, I don't want to see her get hurt with rejection or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed, looking at Ryan. \"Lilith is like me, a Neko.\" Softly, she said. \"As such, she has fragile emotions so we must be certain this boy's affections are genuine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded. \"I suggest you and I have a friendly chat with this boy.\" Smiling, he suggested. \"You can get a lot of information out of a pleasant conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy and I can talk with the boy's older sister.\" Casually, Chon stated. \"Perhaps we can get a few clues from her as to the kid's intentions.\" He smiled slightly. \"That and I am curious about these rogue hunters that were mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They exist in our world but they are more used for 'high priority' cases.\" Wincing, Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Curious, Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your friends' permission, you can come with me.\" Kindly, Kayo said. \"I want to have a word with Matt Moray's father and sons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Ryan nodded. \"I expect you to keep him safe, Ms Mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does the story follow from here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He became an expert in marital arts, as well as mastering the obscure art of chi energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your honest, that's something.\" Amy said frowning at the blind man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you here?\" Maxine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned his head to Amy, detecting her via her chi energy that she gave off. The goth girl said \"Well there's two things that we'd like from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we'd like to talk to you Jessica about your Brother, it's just we're concerned being friends to Lilith's relatives.

It was where he first began to train his daughters, Viva and Vogue in martial arts. Every last detail was perfect except for one. Normally, he would hear the muffled sounds of other students through the door but now there was no sound at all. Curious, he opened the door to find it would not budge. He turned to Serena and Maxine, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your first, reality trance.\" Calmly, Serena explained. \"Practice will allow you to expand the set you create. If it means anything, this is impressive for your first attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"Shall we begin?\" He motioned with his finger. \"Come at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena and Maxine smiled then charged Chon. Maxine fired an energy blast, a small ball of energy that stuns an opponent on impact while Serena attacked with a jump kick. Chon grinned as he easily dodged the blast before catching Serena's leg in mid flight and threw her into Maxine. Both fell to the floor with surprised looks on their faces. Chon merely shook his head. \"That combination might work on a novice witch but I'm a trained professional.\" In a neutral tone, he said. \"Get up. Try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just testing the waters.\" Rising to her feet, Serena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The waters are still but deep.\" Serious Chon said. \"Don't stare into them too long; they will stare right back at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine shivered slightly. \"That's creepy.\" Frowning, she said. \"I'm impressed that you can fight the way you do, being blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon cracked a slight grin. Viva reacted the same way when he stated that quote. \"Blindness is a relative term. There are those who have sight but can't see what is right in front of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a fighter and a scholar.\" Smiling, Serena said. \"You would make a fine witch.\" Seeing Chon's face harden, she quickly added, \"That is a compliment in our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's face instantly softened. \"Let us continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena and Maxine nodded. \"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the man had been oddly silent this entire time, granted the goth girl knew that the blind man was often quiet. But not like this, usually he was alert at all times. Sometimes Amy swore that he had eyes in the back of his head, that or was enhanced senses thanks to his lack of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chon once told her that he could still see people, but he never proceeded further with it. Jessica tapped Amy on the shoulder and said \"Do you know this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \"Yeah you can say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Didn't the pair of you come with that Jenny girl?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Amy paused, seeing if Chon was going to respond. But he didn't, either he was busy with something or he just didn't care. That big blindfold of his made it hard to tell what he was thinking sometimes. Chon didn't say anything though, so Amy decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we all live in the same dorm back at Starmage Academy. Chon is....different now though.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different? As in what?\" Jessica said, the man looked really curious with that ruby red cloth over his eyes. If he even had any there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't talk about his past all that much, but something happened. To him and his Brother, and he used to really hate magic. I mean he really did. Every day he'd spout nonsense about how magic is a blight on the world and nothing good can ever come from it.\" Amy recalled the times where he'd do that. Usually when he looked at a guy turned into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet that must have been pretty annoying sometimes.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know the half of it, man the arguments we used to have. You know how you get told the dangers of improper use of magic? Well I think Chon's the prime example of a victim of it, only he ends up becoming a bigger danger than the rogue witches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took a deep sigh, making brief eye contact with Jessica before saying \"I heard rumours that....he killed witches in the past. Before he came to Starmage Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was silent for a second before saying \"What? But magic and mad science can't kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon doesn't use either, he claims that he uses the Asian art of chi manipulation. Whatever that is. He's able to have his fists glow with a blue aura, and he can move at lightning speeds.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Can't say I've heard of stuff like that.\" Jessica said, wondering more and more on just who the hell this guy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he's gotten better I suppose. Better person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then cracked a smile and said \"There was this rogue witch that we dealt with one time, who used her daughters like slaves. Mind control collars and stuff. But then it became ironic, the person who despises magic and witches. Ends up taking two young witch girls into his care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave a small laugh \"Yeah that is a twist, do you have any idea why he did that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue, maybe it was they're the same age as he was when whatever happened to him happened. He's gotten better, still hates magic like a passion. But he does seem to admit it can be useful, Charlie was kinda the same. Only it was because he didn't know magic could be done in a good way, he was raised by a rogue witch so ya know....\" Amy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you.....care for him?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned to face Jessica and blushed \"N-No way! I....The only thing we've really done are argue, and live under the same roof. I mean don't get me wrong, he's buff as hell under that shirt. Covered in scars and stuff, and he knows how to fight most certainly. But he just gets into arguments with witches over the slightest faults sometimes.\" folding her arms after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Chon's head jerked up, and he smirked. Amy's mouth went agape and she looked away at both Jessica and the newly woken Chon. Just her luck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of hours later the dojo had been more or less wrecked, Chon had been getting the hang of the reality trance. Several weapons, hook swords and Jian's had been implanted into the ground. The sounds in the room were that of blades swinging, and spells being cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine and Serena were sitting down, panting and drained. They hadn't been this knackered since their final test as rouge hunter cadets, nicks and cuts adorned their arms. Presents from their opponent, the blind marital artist Chon Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon meanwhile had discarded his shirt, and was on one knee. His blindfold had also been removed by him, exposing the injuries that lurk below it. He had no eyes, he tore them out years ago. Chon had refused to have the injury healed, although with the technologies that mad scientists had he could easily have new ones. The girls tried to avoid looking at his eyes too close, Serena could have sworn she saw a bug crawling around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...certainly live up to the name of blind vengeance, whew.\" Maxine muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon altered his stance so he was sitting Indian style on the floor, his Jian's planted blade first into the floor. \"You fight well. The rouge witches I've fought usually turned and fled the instant I drew near, if they ever did spot me.\" he said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded, in the fight Chon had somehow teleported. And sent Maxine flying. He explained that it wasn't magic. Chon had simply learned to use his chi energy to move at a short distance at such a fast speed, that to the normal eye it looked as if was teleporting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward moment, and then Serena asked \"Why have you hunted rouge witches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon frowned, his brows narrowing. He then said \"My Brother was killed, rouge witches fried him to death on my birthday when I was just a kid. You can guess what I did....\" pointing at where his eyes should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really kill them?\" Maxine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man sighed and replied with \"Yes I did, most of them anyway. The ones I've not found are still kicking, I don't see them in the nightmares. Me standing on one side of a battlefield, all the people I've slayed stand on the other. They stay in a single file line as I rip them limb from bloody limb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence in the room, although Chon placed his blindfold back onto his head. \"But I like to think I've changed. I'm not that man anymore, if my older Brother was alive he'd say I have been nothing but a fool. I'm really glad I met my adopted children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have kids?\" Serena said with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"Yeah Viva and Vogue, they were daughters to a rouge witch. They were the same age when I lost my Brother, I...didn't want magic to ruin them like it did me. I swore not to let that happen, it left me a broken person. Kami only knows what might have happened to them.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of witches?\" Maxine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned his head to her and said \"If you had asked me that a year ago...I would have stated that witches and their magic were a blight on the world. That they couldn't be trusted, that sooner or later they'd abuse their power and fall to evil. Now? To be honest I still have that view, but I grant exceptions to those who earn it. My daughters and the pair of you for example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena nodded and said \"When we were training to be rouge hunter cadets we were told stories about you, how magic when used for evil purposes could create one's own demons. All rouge witches are in fact ordered to either kill or flee away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. They are free to bring it on. I think we've spent enough time on this, let's return to where we where.\" Chon said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded and Chon felt his surroundings change, and sure enough he heard the familiar voice of Amy.<br>\r\n\"What the hell were you doing? I swear it's hard to tell what you think sometimes besides burning witches.\" she snarked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon huffed and replied \"I was training, you should dip into your own mind from time to time Amy. You may learn something.\" as he nodded his head at Maxine and Serena. He detected their chi energy.</span></div></div>",

Night had fallen and the moon's light shone through the glass windows, perfect for a shady gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're hunting a rouge for real this time?\" Serena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, this will be our final test.\" Maxine said while fiddling with a strand of her hair, if the girls were honest they were a tad nervous. After all who wouldn't be? Rouge witch hunters were the elite of the elite, to be one took hard training and dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls was Natasha Wealth, a girl who was from a long line of witches who were highly adept at healing magic. It was most likely going to be needed for tonight, not for the people involved. But rather the victims of the rouge witch they were pursuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the chapel opened and in walked a woman named Tonya Powers, a woman in her early 20's. She was a noted rouge hunter/teacher at the school the girls are went to, and this was to be their final test before they passed and became full fledged rouge witch hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya then walked towards the girls, before stopping and smirking. She looked up to the rafters above and said \"You can come down now, you might as well meet who you are going to work with tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls apart form Serena and Maxine looked confused, before suddenly a flash of light appeared. And a Chinese Jian stabbed itself onto the floor near them, Natasha let out a small scared yelp as a figure then landed above it. Perfectly placing himself atop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure wore a red cloth over his face, it was Chon. Dressed in a black leather trenchcoat, with his battle attire shown under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np8/char/kenshi-mk9concept.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np8/ch...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...It's him! The blind vengeance! Slayer of witches!\" Natasha shouted before producing a flame in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you get here?! Are you planning to fight us?\" she said trying to advance towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was unfazed and folded his arms while balancing on his sword. \"Ancient Chinese secret, that's how I got here.\" he muttered in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya then quickly clamed the girl down by saying \"Relax, he is working with us tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine smirked and said \"Do you always announce your presence like that? I thought you were not seen till it was too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon returned the smirk and got off his Jian, grabbing it and placing it back in his sheath. \"Your leader was the one who requested I come down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you did, I'm sure you know everyone apart from Natasha. If you get injured you'll be pleased to know she's a highly skilled healer witch.\" Tonya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave a small wave, everyone at the school heard of Chon Kay. Although they blew his story a bit out of proportion, but that was for another time. They had business to attend to, although Chon gave her a nod and said \"I have a friend who practises the art of magical healing, I'll admit it can be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya then went over to a table and took out a folder, and said \"Our target is Lily Sweetie, you may know here as a borderline rouge witch. She and her little pal Samantha love to cause trouble on boys and girls, both witch and non witch alike. Although she's been going too far this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is her crimes?\" Chon asked, fingers flicking the hilts of his twin Jian's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had been using magical stone epoxy to trap her victims, so that they appear made of stone. Those covered in it can't move or talk while in it. It's purpose is to encase someone in a safe barrier to help heal their wounds, however Lily enjoys using it to torment people. Just because she can, she has quite the collection. And the law is calling her now.\" Tonya explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls could sense Chon's anger, witches like Lily took away his Brother. Killing him without a second thought, like a human would do with an empty cola can. \"What's the plan?\" Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, Chon you can attack from the roof of the house. Serena and Maxine will approach from the back while me and Natasha will take the front, that's where she's placed her victims. We'll get them out while you and the Mage siblings focus on Lily, once all the victims are out will move to assist.\" Tonya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that everyone nodded and they got into a large van, with Chon sitting in the back. He was muttering in Chinese while ignoring everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone know what he's saying?\" Natasha asked her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems he's praying.\" Serene muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To China's God of war, I hope we don't have blood on our hands.\" Maxine muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then spoke up with \"I've got enhanced senses you know, I can hear you trying to keep it quiet. If your worried that I'll turn Lily into pieces then don't be, I'm not that man anymore. Just offering my words up to Guan Yu before I get started.\" </span></div></div>",

And since I couldn't be a witch like them they....treated me like a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mage sighed and shook her head, something like this did happen from time to time. Kayo silently embraced Charlie, the kid going into the hug. But to her surprise there were no tears on her shoulder. Charlie smiled and said \"I quit crying ages ago, I have people who helped me like Ryan. And others who've been in the same boat as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo breathed a sigh of relief at this, and continued walking with Charlie. \"What about those people in the same boat as you, what are they like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that Charlie would say gleefully \"It's a pair of twin girls my age, Viva and Vogue. Their Mother was a rouge witch who controlled them with slave collars. Chon adopted them though, I'm dating both of them in fact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo smiled as she heard of the story, it seemed like there was more to Chon than he let on. And then Charlie said he was dating both of his daughters at the same time, her eyes went wide and she sputtered out with \"W-What?! Does he approve of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie did a half and half gesture with his left hand and said \"Kind of, he knows I wouldn't do anything to hurt them. It's just sometimes they argue over me, but it's all okay at the end of the day. I remember the first time my Sisters met them, woo boy they were like cats near water after that exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mage was quiet, taking in Charlie's words. If Chon's daughters helped him like that they must have had genuine feelings for the boy. He went on with \"So you know how you were talking about whatever power I have, any idea what it could be? Like just a wild guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo thought to herself, rubbing her chin as they neared the house of Matt's Father. \"It could be anything, I honestly don't know. But perhaps the mad scientists here can shed some light on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about them, there's this one guy called Juan Smith I think his name was.

The aura around him grew thicker, in fact back in the real world....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Mage we need to leave this room at once!\" Nathan said as he began to evacuate everyone out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's Jenny's friend, I swear to God if he's hurt...\" Kayo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time, we need to get out of here!\" Nathan exclaimed, once everyone left the room large steel shutters covered the windows and doors. Charlie's red aura began to envelop him, the anger that was built up over his childhood at the hands of his abusive family only made it even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE YOU ROSE! I HATE YOU CARLA!\" Charlie screamed out at the top of his lungs, he rushed forward. In his mind he was grabbing both his Sisters by their necks, and proceeded to slam them into the ground. When in truth he just plowed his fists into the floor, enough to make large holes in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE MOTHER FOR ALL THE PAIN SHE'S CAUSED ME!!!!\" he yelled out as he then brought his hands up and held them together, his red aura surging within his hands. And then he slammed them down onto the floor, in an instant bits of wood and glass flew in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was watching in the next room, Kayo bit her lower lip in sadness. \"What did that poor boy go through?\" she muttered.</span></div></div>",

There was fire in his eyes but James maintained a mad grin. \"Bond with me.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then flicked his finger against Charlie's head, sending him into a blind rampage. he grabbed James by the collar and threw him against the floor like a rag doll. James cried and begged as tile and wood went flying due to the impact. \"Your family was cruel! \" Screaming, he yelled. \"Show me your pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie screamed in complete anger, punching and slamming James all over the room while he continued to cry and moan with each impact. Kayo's face was pale with horror as Nathan and Tex merely watched with bemused looks on their faces. \"Don't just stand there!\" Desperate, she screamed. \"Do something! Charlie is killing your son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan and Tex chuckled in response. \"James is in no danger.\" Amused, Nathan replied. \"We mad scientists are nearly indestructible with our chaotic energy shields up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie will exhaust himself before he even scratches James.\" Chuckling, Tex added. He then turned serious. \"The boy has a lot of built up rage, let him get it out of his system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, Charlie stopped slamming James around. He was exhausted but highly annoyed that James smiled at him. \"Do you feel better, kid?\" Smiling, James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's rage ebbed off slightly. \"Yeah, I do.\" Honestly, he said. \"Just wipe that smirk off your face, its pissing me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed before giving Charlie a hug than nearly knocked the wind out of him. \"That's my quasi bro!\" Roughing his hair, he said. \"Thank you for bonding with me! Your plight is mine thus no one shall harm you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonding?\" Catching his breath, Charlie asked. \"Quasi bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you just went through we call the mad bonding ceremony.\" Smiling, Nathan explained. \"You do know that strangers become brothers in intense situations such as war or disasters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\" Nodding, Charlie said. \"My friends and I have all become much like a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through this experience, you shared your pain and released your anger with James.\" Motioning to his son, Nathan said. \"Search your feelings. You will find that he has shared his plight with you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie paused then turned to James, tearing up again. \"Your mother.... she was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, tears swelling up as well. \"Murdered in a most grotesque manner.\" Whispering, he replied. \"I spared you the image as it scared me for life. However, you know my pain. I was the first to find her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you return to your home, Charlie, you will carry the memories of my son.\" Serious, Nathan said. \"If you ever feel you need help or just someone to talk to, go to a mirror and call his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see me rather than your reflection.\" Smiling, James said. \"Like a crazy video phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled then became curious. \"Did you discover my power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.\" Smiling, Nathan replied. \"You, dear boy are a....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was dark times Charlie, very dark times. Most of them gave their lives to protect others, and even outside of war they stood a chance of being turned into witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ryan says that I'm immune to being changed into a girl, that's probably why my Mother and Sisters treated me the way they did. You said that being a roughneck had something to do with willpower right?\" Charlie said as he looked at Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, I believe that because of your harsh upbringing you had low willpower. And your anger towards them was being restrained as well. After unleashing all of that you have awoken to your destiny, you will require training. And weapons.\" Nathan said as he made his way out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapons? Training? How am I going to get them?!\" Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't train you, this is out of both me and Mr. Moray's knowledge.

Kayo inwardly mused that the kid standing up was a feat in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your okay to be going to Ryan?\" Kayo asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm still just a little shaken up by everything. But I'm glad that I can at least help everyone now, I just need to learn. And I'm ready to do that.\" Charlie said, he seemed more focused and determined. Since getting that anger out and awakening his new found abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayo smiled, she believed that this kid would be fine. She had heard stories from Jenny about her boyfriend Ryan, even when Jenny was forced to leave Ryan still loved her. Boys like that were rare in this world, and Mr Carlson proved to be a kind young man. Although Ms Mage still hadn't as yet spoken to the Starmage student at length, she'd need to of course but Kayo believed it would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the house Jessica was sitting on a couch next to Amy, the girls talking at length about their lives. Chon meanwhile was sitting across from Ms Mage's older children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can still see us despite that blindfold over your head?\" Serena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, although I won't tell how I can. Let's just call it one of my many powers.\" Chon said leaning back in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan came into the living room, looking at Charlie with concern. \"Is everything alright Charlie? You seem...different somehow.\" he said as he looked the 12 year old boy over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to have a word with you in private young man, regarding Charlie. Listen Charlie why don't you go back into the mirror, and speak with those twin girls you told me about.\" Kayo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right okay, better tell them.\" Charlie said. As he neared the mirror he closed his eyes, the magic kicking in to send him back to his Starmage Academy dorm. When he reopened them Viva and Vogue were watching TV while sitting on a bed. The girls were exactly the same, although Viva cut her blonde hair short just past the ears to tell themselves apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHARLIE!!!\" both of them said at the same time, glomping him with a double hug. Charlie let out a grunt as the wind got knocked out of his sail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Careful girls, I might hug you too hard.\" Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were confused by this, and broke the hug to look at him. \"What do you mean Char?\" Viva said using their nickname for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie took a deep breath and said \"It turns out I have some kind of superpower! By using my willpower I can have enhanced speed, strength and endurance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue tilted her head \"What? Isn't that like something elder Brother can do?\" she said, elder Brother was Chon. Although legally speaking he was their adoptive Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not chi energy, but willpower. Because of what my Mother and Sisters did to me I had none, but after being shown a vision of my worst fear. And lashing out in anger against it, my power awoke. I'm even getting weapons custom made for me, they called me a roughneck. And it seems I'm the first in a long time too! Isn't that awesome?!\" Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls listened to this, and then took it in. They then smiled and said \"Well don't worry Char, we'll support you every step of the way.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these weapons done yet? I'd like to see them.\" Vogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, let's go and find out!\" Charlie said as he grabbed the two girls by their hands to lead them into the mirror.</span></div></div>",

Kayo instantly sensed magic and took a step away, fearful. \"You sparked a transformation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smile vanished, replacing it with a dead seriousness. \"First, the emotional pain was already there, I merely released it.\" Ice in his voice, he said. \"Second, that pain was serving as a lock, holding his true power, keeping it from being discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What is this!?\" Shaken, Charlie asked. \"Boys aren't supposed to have magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan sighed, throwing James a 'we'll talk later' look.

You, Charlie, are literally one in a billion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie rose to his feet and accepted the chair that was offered. \"This is a lot to take in.\" Wincing, he said. \"Are you saying my emotional pain was keeping it locked away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given what you told me on the way here, Charlie, I'd guess that your mother was trying to get at that power you possess.\" Darkly, Kayo said. \"Now that it has been released, I fear you will need protection as many witches will want you for that power you hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie began to cry all over again only Nathan waved his hand, causing him to become calm again. \"There is a catch to being a human familiar, Charlie.\" Serious, he said. \"Only you can decide who to grant the power to and who you will not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be stolen?\" Curious, Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless they want to be blasted with raw magic.\" Smirking, James replied. \"That is what you have within you, by the way.\" He chuckled. \"From what I can tell, your power would give the head witch a run for her money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sending a note back with you, Charlie.\" scribbling several lines onto a piece of paper, Nathan said. \"The moment anyone unfolds it, they will see what had transpired here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pointed at James.
