She had a dragon tail, sharp teeth, and claws. She was only 5' 7'' but she weighed 1000lbs. thats right half a ton and was still growing. Then she ran into me one day and told me her problem. Her problem was she was always called fat even by people she trusted. Odd enough not of being jealous even though Mai was the biggest girl in her school. Size DDDDD-breasts. A belly sticking out 7 feet in front of her. An ass that required not two, not three, but five chairs to hold it up. Big arms, big legs. You get the idea. I took her home with me (\"Lucky basturd!!!\" said Tarumax) The next day she decided to gorge. She ate and ate and ate. The next day she weighed...</span></div></div>",

Then I remembered that she was a dragon. She supposed to weigh that much. Oh and I forgot to mention she had wings as well. She then decided to stay with me. I accepted. Months went by. Then one day she weighed 100 tons or 200000lbs. After which she didn't get out of our bed for days but I saw her every time I went into our bed and then snuggle up in her fat to keep warm (Fact it's cold in Redmond WA during the winter) and in the summer uncover us both from the bed sheets to keep cool. Today she is still around but now she gets out more so if you see me someday with Mai ask me about this story. She'll tell you more.</span></div></div>",
