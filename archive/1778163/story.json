            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It was the end of another day of college, Oliver and Alexandra were on their way home walking through the city. They weren't the kind of people who would normally be friends and had their own groups at college but they had known each other from primary school and lived close together so they kept each other company on the walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they walked down a cobbled street on the outskirts of the city a resounding clap of thunder echoed from above causing Alexandra to shriek. The two ran for cover underneath an old archway in a backstreet just as the first few heavy drops of rain began to fall. Another boom and a bright flash followed. Alexandra threw her hands over her ears and scrunched up her face yelling \"We've got to get out of here, now! I hate thunderstorms, I absolutely hate them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not being able to say anything to her on account of Alexandra covering her ears, Oliver grabbed hold of her arm and yanked her inside the shop they were sheltering in the doorway of. The shop consisted of a small square room with the only door being the one they had entered from, the ceilings were deceptively high though and the shelves were lined with polyester wigs of all colours and rubber witches masks. There was a shopkeeper behind the till on the far side, directly opposite the door although he had taken no notice of their entrance. Feeling slightly awkward about the situation, Oliver called out to the shopkeep \"Never heard the thunder before the rain before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The shopkeeper snapped his head upright, a slight grin tickling his lips and a mad glint in his eye, \"Causes quite a headache wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The intensity with which he said this phrase startled the two. Alexandra replied \"I would agree\", which caused Oliver to give her a strange look and the shopkeeper to spring energetically to his feet. He lifted up the counter and walked over to a tall double doored wardrobe to the right of the two. He opened the door, Oliver could see that the inside looked empty but the blackness was so deep that it looked like it was far bigger than it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In that case it's settled\", said the shopkeeper in a matter-of-fact way, \"I'll show you the way in\", he gestured into the wardrobe and looked at them intensely. The two walked across the room to where the shopkeeper and the wardrobe were. The shopkeeper climbed inside the wardrobe onto what seemed to be a thin metal floor from the sound it made. Oliver looked at Alexandra puzzled, Alexandra then shrugged and climbed in next to the shopkeeper, turning to face Oliver. Apart from thunderstorms, there wasn't anything that she was scared of, Oliver on the other hand, that was a different matter. Alexandra stared at him as if to say 'Come on!' </span></div></div>",
