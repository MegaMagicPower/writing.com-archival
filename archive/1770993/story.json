Birds songs sing nearby and while beautiful do more to accent the headache you're currently sporting. Raising a hand to shade your eyes against the light, you gasp and discover it's not a normal hand but covered in black fur to the middle of your forearm and each finger is tipped with small claws. Crossing your eyes some reveals a discovery of a red furred snout and black tipped nose. Somhow you know this is wrong and yet you can't seem to recall what is 'right'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up causes your headache to throb a bit harder but you are determined to examine your body and make a valiant attempt to ignore it. Looking your form over you discover you're in the shape of a red fox, judging by your paws, fluffy tail and colorings, but one that apparently can walk upright judging by your hands and the shape of you legs. Again the thought crossed your mind that this isn't normal, but with the headache it's hard to recall anything except your name. Everything else is a blur of colors and noises with no real structure or coherence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths you try to get your bearings. Now that your eyes have adjusted and your head has stopped spinning, you can see you appear to be in the center of a large park of some kind as tall buildings stretch upwards all around the edges. Grassy rolling hills stretch around you sparsely dotted with decently large trees. More interesting though is the park and city seem to be populated by other creatures in much the same state as you, all of them animals and yet all walking upright. Here and there you spot creatures that look like they stepped out of a cartoon or childrens' picture book as wolves, rabbits, tigers, zebras, and many more species walk down the paths, play games, or just laze about in the sun. What's more, not one you can see looks at all thin, oddly enough. Every single one runs the gambit of slightly chubby, like they'd had a few too many big meals lately, to something seen more often in a sideshow at the circus or a world record book. The largest of which actually need special platforms to get around as they float on what look like hover pads along the trails<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath you try and relax and decide what to do. Clearly action needs to be taken of some kind, you can't just sit there all day, but as you're trying to figure out what to do another pressing problem comes to mind....</span></div></div>",

The ride to his house seems forever because of your empty stomach, but it's only about thirty minutes. You look out the window as you approach a very large house- fancy too. <br>\r\n   \"Well, here we are!\" Mark says as he parks the van in the driveway next to a few other, more expensive looking cars. \"I got food inside for ya, ya seem starved.\" He walks up to his doorstep, grabs his keys and unlocks the door. You follow and as you walk in, you instantly smell an aroma of foods fill your nose. Your ears perk up in excitement.<br>\r\n   \"You can go into the dining room and eat what you want, I have food to spare.\" Without hesitation, you scurry into the dining room only to see tables of different food ready for your consumption. You walk over to the table full of cheeseburgers and french fries and begin devouring it. Eating burgers by the stack and fries by the handful. About a half hour passes and you ate at least sixty burgers and buckets worth of fries. However, your hunger was not merely satisfied.<br>\r\n   You wander to another table filled with different pizzas and begin digging in. You don't even savor the sheer deliciousness of it all either, you just shove as much into your mouth as you can. You clear the enormous table of food, and by your fifth table, you pass out.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n   Mark jerks your shoulder while yelling at you to wake up. Eventually, you do, but you feel very different. Your body has become thickly layered with jiggly fat. For a while, you just lied on the ground unable to get up because of your weight. Mark pulls you up by your hands and you notice how of your belly stuck out from underneath your shirt. And your pants felt very, very tight. <br>\r\n   \"Hey, are you okay? Ya were passed out on floor.\" Mark said rather urgently.<br>\r\n   \"Yeah, I just ate too much is all I guess.\" You felt fine, but a little tried.<br>\r\n   \"Okay, ya probably shouldn't eat that much again.

You wind past some trees and don't stop, eventually, you see more furs around, but you're still running away. After so long you turn your head back in search for the pig, but you didn't stop running. The next thing you know is you make impact with something large and fluffy while your has was turned. You ran into somefur, and a rather big fur too.<br>\r\n   \"Ah!\" The fat fox lady squeaked. \"What was that?\" She tried to shove her stomach down to see what hit her. \"Oh, did you just run onto me?\" He giggled.<br>\r\n   \"Yeah... sorry. I didn't see you there, I was looking backwards.\" You said awkwardly.<br>\r\n   \"Oh, backwards?\" She laughed. \"Are you new to town? I never saw you here.\"<br>\r\n   \"Yeah. Oh! And do you know anyplace to find some food?\" Hunger hit you again now that you weren't focused on running away.<br>\r\n   \"Oh yeah, I have some at my place, my house is right over there.\" She lifted a her fat arm and pointed over to a nearby house. \"Wanna go?\"<br>\r\n   \"Okay, sure.\" She was obviously more trustworthy than that pig. <br>\r\n   \"Here, hop on my back, I have a hover platform so you don't have to walk.\" <br>\r\n   You jump up onto her back, your feet sunk onto her large folds of gelatinous flab. You put your paws into her shoulders and hold on as you begin hovering toward the house. It was relatively fast. At this point you wanted one too, they're cool! Once you got there you didn't get off, because her house had extremely wide doors that allowed the platform to go inside, she must never get off of it.<br>\r\n   \"There's food in the fridge. I don't care how much you eat by the way. This town is built on food, like seriously, our town will never run out.\" <br>\r\n   Taking the advice you raid whatever you can out of the fridge and devour it. It was a large fridge too, so eating everything seemed impossible. Eventually, all the food is gone, except for a brown mushroom in the back in a container. Still hungry, you have no choice but to eat it. <br>\r\n   After that you felt stuffed and full. You walk into the living room and thank her. \"Hey, I still don't know your name.\"<br>\r\n   \"Oh, my name's Mira.\"<br>\r\n   \"Whoa...\" your stomach felt very bubbly inside, and it began to make some odd noses, \"my stomach feels really weird, I guess something didn't agree with me.\"<br>\r\n   \"You didn't eat that mushroom did you!?\"<br>\r\n   \"Yeah, why?\" Worry grew in your voice.<br>\r\n   \"Those aren't regular mushrooms! Didn't you read the label on the container or was in that said not to eat it!\" She seemed really worried and so did you.<br>\r\n   \"Wh- what are they!\" <br>\r\n   \"They cause the consumer to produce more fat in your body than use sugar! You're going to slowly be gaining weight for who knows how long!\"<br>\r\n   Already, you could feel your body grow softer, and your belly grow.<br>\r\n   \"It's going to make you feel more hungry too because your body isn't producing enough energy, so you'll have to eat...\"</span></div></div>",

Appreciate it, though. Have a nice day.\" A bit deflated, the pig thanks you for your time and begins pushing his cart away, searching for other park denizens whom he could interest in a bite to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk further along the park's inner trails. It's a strikingly gorgeous place and fairly sparse to boot. Maybe the bigger physiques of the locals keep them from venturing this far from a place to sit and rest? You think to yourself for a few moments as you walk, wondering exactly what is going on with your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, you end up veering off the path and into a sign on the grass right next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auditions ahead at the gazebo,\" the sign itself reads, although auditions for what, you're not sure. A small posting below it says that said auditions were running from 10 to noon, and looking at the sun, which is exactly centered in the sky, it looks like it's about closing time for them. Still wondering what could possibly be going on, you walk ahead to see what's up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the gazebo, a white enclosure that's about 10' by 10' with a few tables and such surrounding it, you see that the auditions themselves appear to have been less than successful. A few assorted sheets of paper are strewn about the grass, while a few staffers take down a few tables. Among them is one elephant in a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other staffers are fairly normal, maybe about 50 pounds overweight at most, this elephant has extravagantly let himself go. He's wearing some dapper duds, one step below a suit, and they strain to hold his belly, which seems to be about three feet wide. The rest of him is suitably swollen as well - you'd bookmark him at about 600 pounds. Still wondering what the story was here, you figure that he'll have answers and walk over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, as you walked up to the gazebo, the elephant had a somewhat-concerned look upon his face, but everything seems to change when you walk into his field of view. His relatively dour demeanor completely changes, his eyes becoming more expressive and his mouth breaking out into a grin under his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sir! How are you today?!\", he bellows, thrusting out a hand for you to shake. \"Are you here for the auditions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess I am,\" you say. \"I was walking along and wondering what was going on here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! My first question for you, of course - do you want to be a reality TV star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was straightforward. You've always wanted to be famous, of course. Who hasn't? But there's no sense in signing up for something you have no clue about in the first place, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course I would, but I have no idea what I'd be getting myself into,\" you stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you're in the right place. We've been looking for candidates for a new reality competition, and we're one short.\" Glancing you over, he continues, \"Your... let's say lithe physique is perfect for what we're trying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is that?\" Once again, you think, better safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My television station, YummTV, is branching out into a new niche we've found is likely to provide us with a hit in Zaftig City. The new show is called 'The Biggest Gainer,' and it takes several undernourished people like yourself and gets them more well-rounded for city life here. Our winner not only takes home $250,000 on top of their makeover, but they'll also receive their own half-hour TV show on our network in whatever kind of genre they'd be interested in. It's an easy sell, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is a game show where thin people, like myself, get fat for money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, yes. We've found there's big demand among those who have taken to life in Zaftig to see others follow in their footsteps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, this sounds ridiculous, even before you consider that it could be too good to be true, or even a complete lie. $250,000 is crazy! It's also... it's a lot of money. And you've always wanted to be a bigger-than-life TV star. You'll never have to worry about another diet again... what's your decision?</span></div></div>",

Cherry Sunday's the name,\" you tell him... hoping he doesn't see the ice cream shop's advertisement flying behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an odd name,\" the elephant starts to say. \"And yet you're as thin as a twig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you quickly stammer, \"my parents named me Jerry originally, but I got the nickname after the ice cream because of my coloring,\" you lie through your teeth. To be fair, it's not a terrible lie, as your red fur is dark enough, and your white fur creamy-colored enough, to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant considers this for a moment. \"Well, with such a name, I'll be expecting big things from you!

As you climb in, sitting in the seat that could hold a fur four times your side, you suddenly get a small bout of butterflies. \"My big TV debut...\" you think to yourself. \"No wait, my BIG TV debut,\" you correct yourself, chuckling a bit.

Mr. Pachy had an old manufacturing building re-fitted for the pilot season of TBG,\" the cat responds to you as she disembarks from the cart, beckoning you to follow her. As the two of you walk through the front door, you find yourself gaping at what you see. What used to be a manufacturing floor, filled with machinery and equipment, has been replaced by not only a large living arrangement in one quarter of its space, but a strange assortment of sets and laboratories. One appears to be a supermarket, albeit half-sized, though apparently operational and stocked with a variety of different products. Also on the floor include a few separate obstacle courses, what appear to be game show sets, and a series of vats near the center of the floor. Whatever's going to take place here will be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving you some time to gawk, you find yourself whisked into the living area, where you're seated in a bedroom. \"This will be your living space,\" Cassie says, as a few workers - a wolf and a gator, both obese - bring in a series of forms and assessments that you need to fill out. One's a series of information and nicknames, for example, meant for improving the narrative process of the show. Others have medical information, clothing preferences, allergies, and legal information. You're even measured in both size and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, you find yourself outfitted in a jumpsuit that's both snug and tight. Examining yourself in the mirror, you see that it sags in places in which weight would add itself to a body, such as in the belly, waist, arms and legs. It's red and white, matching your natural fur colors. As soon as you seem comfortable, a camera crew comes in along with an interviewer, who gathers some additional information from you on camera - your name, your favorite foods, basic stuff meant to flesh out your character. Near the end, you're asked for a motto you'd like to apply to what YummTV will be calling \"Team Sunday\" - not great at thinking on your feet, you clumsily respond \"Gotta stay hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

In the center of the arena, over the vats, a scoreboard has been constructed, on which your six names are displayed, along with a count of each contestant's respective weight. Apollo weighs 140 pounds, while you're hanging in there at around 160. In rising order from there are Rip and Frost at 175, Tina at 180 and Sally at the top with about 220 pounds. After examining the board, you quickly continue on to the supermarket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to The Biggest Gainer!\", booms Cal when you get to its entrance. \"You're all probably wondering what's going on right now. I figured it was time for the first event, not to lose any time! I want this show on the air in a matter of hours! Now, here's the deal for your first task. Each of you will have five minutes in this supermarket, and your aim is to grab as much of your favorite food as possible. After the ten minutes, you'll have the next twelve hours back in the living area to eat as much as you can. Just, you know, totally pig out and stuff. As soon as that's done, we'll have your first weigh-in. Whoever comes in last for pounds gained walks out the door, and whoever comes in first gets our first award. I'll explain those later. As for the order... you're going in in order of how much you weigh. That means Apollo's up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal waves his arm, and as Apollo walks toward the entrance, the windows of the supermarket are blackened. \"Can't have anyone copying strategy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a whistle sounds, Apollo runs into the supermarket, pushing a cart in front of him. \"Cherry, you're up next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll have five minutes in the supermarket.

You're one of the smaller furs entered in the reality show, and you're going to have to do more than just eat normally to stay in the competition. As a result, you're firmly set in your strategy - get as much food that's as easy to get down as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a bang, and you realize your five minutes have started. Quickly, you run into the market and look at the aisles. The dairy is to the left, and that's where you go. If you're going to take this seriously, milkshakes are going to be a lot easier to drink nonstop than regular food. Cart in hand, you rip open a freezer door and fling carton after carton of various ice creams into it. Filling it as full as possible, you quickly grab a second cart and check the milk and cream sections. You're in luck - not only do they have heavy cream, but they have plenty of eggnog, too. These, too, quickly enter your cart. Filling it all the way, you immediately rush to get another cart and repeat the process, then another. You're about halfway done filling a third cart with heavy-churn chocolate when you hear a 'ding.' Immediately, two workers come from the back of the store and grab your carts, telling you to follow them. They gradually bring you and your small dairy farm's worth of groceries back to your bedroom, where a massive fridge has been installed, along with a small kitchennete, complete with a blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're looking at your new stuff when Cal himself pops into the doorframe. \"Hey, Cherry, nice strategy,\" he tells you. \"Thanks,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering why we gave you these jumpsuits,\" Cal says, and your confused face prompts him to go further. \"These suits can help you eat more food longer and get fatter easier,\" he continues, \"only needing you to pat your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what he's talking about, so you pat your belly. Suddenly, the jumpsuit seems to stick to your frame a bit more, and it feels strange. Inside the suit, you feel like you're buzzing slightly, and your stomach becomes much more sensitive. By the time you recover enough to say something to Cal, he's already gone, and the two workers have completely filled your fridge, leaving the door wide open. A clock in the room has also been installed - it says \"12:00\", then \"11:59.\" You realize it's your timer.</span></div></div>",

As the clock turns to 11:58, you decide to waste no more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, a full tub of ice cream gets thrown into the blender, followed by cartons of heavy cream and eggnog. After a quick swirl, your first of many milkshakes is finished, and with a hearty \"Gotta stay hungry,\" you swiftly begin drinking the gallon of fattening dairy. Two minutes of beleagured chugging later, you've finally killed the drink, and look down at your belly. It's somewhat swollen, popping out about a half-inch from your waist. Almost before your eyes, however, that small bump slightly shrinks, and the rest of your body slightly shudders. That must be the jumpsuit taking effect, you think. Grabbing a second tub of ice cream, you grab a serving spoon out from a drawer and dig into it, gulping down spoonfuls as big as half a scoop at a time. For some reason, the suit prevents you from getting full - as you down your third, then fourth tubs over a half-hour span, your belly starts keeping its slight heft, growing a bit more noticeable with every few bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've managed to kill six tubs of ice cream, you finally come up for air, finding that you've been eating for an hour straight. Pausing for a moment, you look down at yourself. Your gut is now slightly prominent, and while the growth isn't too dramatic, you've definitely added about ten pounds onto your frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug look on your face, you turn back to the fridge. Wanting to go full hog, you get your hands on a dozen cartons of eggnog and arrange them on the table. Opening all twelve, you get yourself in eyeline of the clock and decide to create an eggnog challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock hits 10:55 remaining, you grab the first carton and suck down what's inside in a matter of seconds, killing the carton in half a minute. You manage to get five down in two minutes and change, at which point you begin taking the cartons two-at-a-time. After another three minutes, you groggily finish the last of the twelve. If your gut wasn't noticeable before, now it is. It's clearly a few inches off your frame, and it's finally telling you it's near bursting. Guess the jumpsuit can only do so much. Resisting the allure of resting, you pull open the fridge again and lean yourself against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, you pass out in a delicious food coma for two-hour spans, at which point you wake up to find a smaller, yet more permanent gut. When you wake up, dull hunger brings you straight to the freezer for another half-gallon tub of ice cream washed down with half a gallon of heavy creamer, after which you become too full to do anything but sleep more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with an hour left, you find yourself coming to again. Examining the damage, you can see your gut has definitely grown. Somewhere close to five inches off your waistline, it's held up somewhat by the jumpsuit. Looking to pull yourself up, your arm brushes your thigh, making you reassess things. Your legs are each a bit thicker, while your arms are as well. It almost looks like you've been working out, yet the puffiness is from fat instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour left. It's time to ensure your safety, you think. Grabbing as many drinks as you can reach, you begin pouring them in your mouth, covering yourself in the process. At the same time, you pull a bunch of ice creams out of the freezer and gradually let them melt. By the end of the hour, between pouring eggnog and cream into your stomach and drinking down melted tubs of ice cream, you see your belly has expanded another inch and a half, while your arms and legs are even thicker, slightly bulging against the jumpsuit. Your butt, especially, has seen growth, becoming a true booty and expanding out by three or four inches. As the bell sounds, you're told to use a scale that's been placed outside the door. Your red-furred behind has grown by 60 pounds.</span></div></div>",

You and the rest of the competitors are guided onto a stage, and though the scene is rushed and confusing, you're able to check out each one's changes after the first round ended. Apollo, the fit falcon, doesn't appear to have been able to do anything to himself - he only has the slightest pooch of a belly. Both Frost and Tina were able to do somewhat better - they look like their jumpsuits fit just a bit more snugly, their slightly-prominent bellies jutting out an inch or two more. Sally, the hippo, is clearly at least 30 pounds bigger than she was before - her everything creeps just a bit further out than it used to, especially her gut, which is much more noticeable than before. Your biggest surprise is the tiger - his gut extends more than a few inches over his belt, now, and the rest of his body follows suit. However, you're confident that you've done the most, and your suspicions are confirmed when Cal reads off the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In last place, we have Apollo, the falcon, who was only able to gain 10 pounds. Apollo, I'm sorry, but your time on The Biggest Gainer has ended,\" Cal says, as two assistants appear to whisk him off-stage and away from the competition. \"From there, we have Frost, who gained 15 pounds, and Tina, who added 18. Sally is in third place with 30 pounds added, while Rip takes second with almost 40 new pounds of fat. However, our first-place prize goes to Cherry, who put on an absolutely stellar 60 pounds in the first round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal walks over and presents you with a candy bar. You give him a look that suggests \"That's it?\", but he smiles and continues talking. \"For his success, Cherry has earned a skip pass! Should you fall behind in a future competition, you'll be able to eat that candy bar and instantly add 40 pounds to your frame,\" he said. \"After all, while we measure overall gains, you've gotta place in every round to move on. Speaking of which... it's time for our second competition!\", he says into the camera.

You have only one hour to complete this round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a buzzer go off. You then notice the other competitors attacking a pile. You begin to so as well. You start with the pile of chocolate. You figured it would be wise to start small and build your way up. You make quick work of the pile and head over to the pile of pastries. Though slightly heavier you continue to press on. You notice that Rip was eating like he was possessed for he began eating from two piles at a time. Seeing this you don't want to lose. Rip and Sally are the only real threats to your prize. Frost and Tina were the underdogs, but you can't underestimate them due to the possibility of one of them eating a pile filled with the appetite stimulant. As you bite into the pastry you are filled with a euphoric feeling. The next time you blink you realize that you are eating the pile of fried chicken. As time flies you subconsciously notice that you and rip were competing for the lead. Gloria was not far behind given her natural appetite. The buzzer sounds as Rip finishes off the last pile. The overstuffed tiger has definitely porked up by a huge amount, but you did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will now weigh the competitors to see who moves on.

It's our special recipe, extra fattening! When the pudding stops - or, more accurately, when you manage to empty your serving before everyone else - you take a seat. The first person to lose a seat will be headed home, and after that we'll play three more rounds - whoever manages to gain the most will be playing for another candy bar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal's assistants quickly move the five of you into position, and you quickly surround the chairs. Then, the hoses are placed in your mouths. Seconds later, you're given a signal, and Cal flips a switch. Immediately, the hose squirts a fast and furious stream of chocolate pudding into your mouth. It's absoutely delicious, almost to the point where you forget to walk. Instead, you take a moment to suck as much as you can and start gulping down huge swallows. Tina, the badger, is behind you, and pokes you to get you moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 90 seconds, you see Sally finish her pudding and quickly take the first seat near her. She's yet again noticeably bigger - but you can't tell by how much. When you look down, you too are showing a major change all over your body. Your stomach slowly oozes out slightly with every swallow, while your arms and legs both add millimeters gradually. Just seconds later, your hose empties as well, and you take a seat. The tiger follows, leaving just the husky and the badger left. Both finish their pudding at the same time and begin pushing and shoving to get the final chair - and the badger wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Frost, and thanks for playing!\", Cal says, as the husky is ushered away as well. \"You might be wondering, by the way, how much you're gaining in this challenge,\" he continues. \"Each pudding serving will equal 25 pounds - the final winner of this game will add 100 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you want to proceed?

Why the hell not go as hard as possible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, the next round of the game begins. As soon as you can, you start gulping down as much pudding as you can possibly swallow in one mouthful, allowing your already-swollen belly to extend even further. Continuing the game of musical chairs, you can see how each of your opponents are playing. Tina, the badger, seems trepadacious, content to drink her fattening snack at a slow pace. The hippo is able to use her natural size to gulp down normal amounts, but Rip, the tiger, is grabbing his hose with both hands and swallowing as much as he possibly can as fast as he possibly can. Seeing that you've got competition, you follow suit, and the two of you quickly empty your hoses and take seats, each one of you another 25 pounds more swollen. Surprisingly, though, Tina takes Sally's spot, as she started slow but ended strong, catching the hippo off guard. The swollen badger girl, uneasy with her new gain, sits heavily on the last chair, with the hippo lead by assistants back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third round is much more competitive than the others, you find. All three of you are desperately, continually slurping away at your hoses, letting your entire bodies grow quickly with fat.

They'll need to keep drinking, and try to do so as fast as possible - when they all tap out, the one who drinks the least is going home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as possible, more assistants guide you to a massive chair, where there's a table full of milkshakes in front of you. It looks like every one is a different flavor - you can see chocolate, strawberry, banana, vanilla, mint, cookies and cream... your mouth waters as you survey the offerings in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... begin!\" With that, you gleefully grab the nearest milkshake, a raspberry one, and chug it down. It's absolutely delicious, as you expected, and you're able to finish it in just moments. The story's the same for the second, third, fourth, and so on - you're having so much fun tasting the different flavors that you're not noticing your belly slowly fill with the concoctions. You're pacing yourself, of course, but all the food you've had so far has been specially fattening, and you know these won't be any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast-forward a half-hour, and you're somehow still drinking, dozens of cups surrounding the bottom of the table. You'd been half-paying attention to your competition, only enough to know Tina had drank enough twenty minutes in, and Sally had finished just one minute later. The badger girl appeared to have gained about 40 pounds, while the hippo had gained just a bit more - until Tina remembered her chocolate bar. The now-huge hippo had been led off-set after the badger added another 40 pounds to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you've blown past both of them. At this point, you've lost track of how many drinks you've had, but the effects are massively noticeable on your already-massive frame. With every gulp, your distended (only somewhat painfully) belly lurches forward another few millimeters, now well past your knees and sliding further downward as well. You've been drinking so much that you're getting wider all over, too. Eventually, you finally decide to stop the challenge once you're...</span></div></div>",

It stretched out far, wide and down, at your knees if not farther. Your arms are starting to look like sausages in your suit - it'll hold but it'll strain from now on.

Not completely - she looks at her schedule and then at her watch, muttering to herself - but she looks back up at you. \"Sorry, forgot you were a newbie,\" she says. \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks you into the studio and directly to Stage 3A, where a large stage awaits you, complete with a studio audience. You're whisked backstage as you try to take stock of what's on stage - looks like a few podiums on the right and about fifteen feet by fifteen feet of space on the left, where stagehands are furiously working to slap the pieces of what looks like an obstacle course together - before you find yourself in a green room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside are two other furs, a 300-or-so pound jackal and a 400-pound lynx. They're both wearing the same jumpsuits you are, though theirs are blue/black and green/white compared to your red one. The jackal's name is Terry, he's a stand-up comedian, he tells you. \"This'll be great,\" he says. \"Fat jokes kill with this crowd.\" The lynx, Holly, is a pop singer. \"I'm trying to get bigger so I can stand out more,\" she says. \"I'm only the ninth-fattest singer on the charts, and the record companies give the bigger ones the better songs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you get to know each other for a minute, Cassy explains the rules. \"OK, you'll be flying blind a little, Cherry, but you'll do fine,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince all of you are wearing the same suits, the studio has made weight gain easy, Cassie explains. The first round will be trivia at the podiums, multiple choice questions with five possible answers. Terry and Holly will have 30 seconds to answer 10 total questions in this round. Getting a question right adds 10 pounds, while answering wrong means no gain. They each have one token, though - when they cash them in, the player makes you answer the question. If you get it right, you gain five pounds; wrong, ten pounds. It then gets  Whoever gets more right at the end takes the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second round, the players each run an obstacle course in the built side of the stage. Whoever finishes it faster gains forty pounds. Pretty simple, and you just watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final round is an eating challenge, where the two players face off until one of them loses. The victor, who gains more wins $50,000 for their charity of choice, then challenges you as a bonus round. If they can outeat you in three minutes, they win an extra $10,000 for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in other words, you're going to be gaining some weight every episode. Which, when you look back on your last time on TV, doesn't sound so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your first day on the job, TV hosting comes pretty naturally to you. You come up with some zingers that actually make the audience laugh, and both guests make fast friends with you. Of course, they both use their coins on you early - you get one of the two questions right, adding 15 pounds. Terry takes an early lead with 40 pounds gained, his shirt tighter, but Holly comes back in the second round, going from 430 to 470 when she easily beats Terry in the obstacle course. The final challenge, endless pizza, lasts nearly twenty minutes before Holly lays back after taking a one-pizza lead at the nine-pies mark and Terry gives up with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly and Terry's suits both automatically digest their huge meals - Holly's weight leaps to 500 - \"now the sixth-biggest singer,\" says a cue card you're handed and repeat on-air - and Terry goes from 340 to 370 pounds, both of them visibly larger than when they came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final round is right up your alley, it turns out - milkshakes. You're both seated in front of a dozen large milkshakes of all flavors, and you lick your lips, ready to add to the half-gallon currently settling down into your stomach. You both start chugging, but you can tell you've got a big jump on her. After three minutes, you're finishing your eighth, your belly quickly swelling, as she struggles with her sixth, suffering from brain freeze. Leaning back and patting your belly, you tease Holly, before the milkshakes too suddenly digest, showing themselves with instant weight gain. You're 30 pounds bigger just from today, just up over 400 pounds, while the lynx girl ends up at 515 pounds. \"Congratulations Holly, and we'll join you next week!\", you say, and just like that, your television debut is over, and the audience is on its feet, giving you a standing ovation.</span></div></div>",

The obese cheetah and scarlet macaw on screen are gushing all about you, your performance, and most interestingly your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have confirmation from the network that 'Bet Your Belt,' the new reality show from last night starring recent champion Cherry Sunday, broke several records last night,\" the cheetah says. \"Pulling in a 12.5 rating, it was easily the highest performer of the night and looks like it'll get to ride that for a while, likely thanks to its host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherry is completely unknown, which makes this a shock,\" the macaw says, \"but his recent win in 'Biggest Gainer,' as the show has been named, drew plenty of attention. Combine that with his natural charisma and he's turning a lot of heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey show video of you eating fast during the bonus round, then a montage of your past weight gaining challenges. \"Sunday also looks like he's quite happy with his weight, and wants more of it,\" the cheetah says. \"He's just over 400 pounds now, which doesn't even crack the top 50 in Zaftig City, but judging by last night, he might be on his way up the ladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two are ending their segment. \"Of course, the top 10 have a huge lead on him,\" the cheetah laughs. \"That's true, Phil,\" the macaw replies. \"Who knows, maybe he'll decide to climb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change the channel on the TV, first surprised you're a sudden celebrity and second confused about this \"top 50\" and \"top 10\" they mentioned. Little did you know you'd stumble on another TV show, this one called \"Watching The Top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant, nearly-700-pound husky greets you. \"Welcome to the show, I'm Champ Trant,\" he says, \"former football star turned acting star, and number 47 on The List. That, for any newbies, is Zaftig City's list of its 50 fattest superstars, all of whom receive a stipend from the city government in support of the famous 1965 Weight Mandate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the rest of the program in confusion and awe. Champ is massively fat, but he's only 47th-biggest. As the show goes on, the furs get bigger (and a lot richer) - there's number 25, Miss Zaftig City '11, a lioness standing at 913 pounds, and number 11, a comedian who's at 1,093 pounds. The top 10 get even bigger - you turn off the TV but the number amount for the biggest apparently nearly reaches a ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see two roads here.</span></div></div>",

A few blocks later, you're in front of a restaurant, Big Ending, with a Help Wanted sign on the door. Walking in, it appears to specialize in desserts, and large ones at that - all around, there are furs sitting in front of huge pies, massive ice cream sundaes, giant cakes. Serving them are various furs, all of them looking stuffed in their black restaurant shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreeting you at the hostess's table is a young female fox, about 300 pounds and in a tight server uniform. You ask about the Help Wanted sign, and she calls her manager, a wolf who's easily 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that the restaurant's hook for the meals being so big is that they're specially meant for fattening people, fitting for Zaftig City, and whatever the patrons don't eat, the servers need to finish. Which explains why the workers seem like they're getting slightly bigger with taut stomachs. Thing is, the rate is good - $20 an hour, as many hours as you can last - and you can start immediately, he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having many other options, you agree, and he puts you in a uniform - an extra-large shift and baggy sweatpants, both black with the restaurant's logo on the front and back of the shirt and on the pant leg. To start, he only gives you one table, and you first serve a crocodile well over 400 pounds, his belly almost pressing into the table. He grins when he sees you and orders two large desserts, and while he eats slowly, by the time you hand him his check he's only finished half of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out the weight gain aspect is a special feature of the restaurant, and your new boss guides you to a special seating section where you and your fellow servers clear the excess food in front of some of the patrons. Being hungry, you start eating the chocolate sundae, with about a football's worth of ice cream left, and you're feeling a bit full by the time you finish it. At which point you're handed the half-piece of vanilla cake, nearly a foot tall. It takes you over an hour to get the last bites down, and after a few minutes of rest, the wolf sends you back out on the floor, your belly a bit swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next table is a group of three college girls, each one at least 300 pounds, all in their sorority gear. The hyena laughs when she sees you, and nudges the tiger and the jackal. They order a total of five desserts and leave almost three of them by the time they leave, only they walk down to the viewing area (adding a big tip and one of their numbers to their bill as they go). They leave after a while - and somehow, almost two hours later, you choke down the last of the peanut butter pie, your belly fully distended. As well, you can feel a big pudgier in your extremeties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss, knowing you're broke, hands you your pay for the night as you slowly waddle home, looking to gain more than 10 pounds in a single night. The $120 in your hand is better than you expected, and while the wolf welcomes you back tomorrow, you're uneasy about an extended career with this business.</span></div></div>",

You don't do much when you get in the room, other than unceremoniously passing out on the bed, rubbing your packed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you're suspiciously hungry and your belly's completely empty, though it's gained a bit of girth that wasn't there before. The rest of your body is the same - you just feel slightly puffier here and there, guessing you've gained a little more than 10 pounds. You made good money, though, and it's an easy gig for now. You might even be able to land better tips today, now that you know how to serve and respond to your customers. As a result, you decide to take a risk and head back in for another day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings go easier today since you're there early enough for the tail end of breakfast. You meet your coworkers while you wait for your first table - they're all young and working there as their first job in Zaftig City, using it to gain weight for free to make the rest of their stays easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour passes before your first table, and it's a mother and young son, both lions, who are only about 50 pounds over weight. They only order one ice cream sundae and finish the vast majority of it together, meaning you only need to take a few bites to finish things. Of course, that allows you to be free just in time for a group of two hippos and an elephant, all of them meeting their species' average size requirements. And appetites, too. You shudder as they each order four desserts, needing four trips to bring the dozen massive plates. Luckily, they each finish three plates; unluckily, that leaves three more for you to down. The cake is easy, but the pudding sticks to your ribs, and the ice cream makes you feel very bloated, about as full as you were yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf comes over to you, more than willing to let you off for the day so you don't make yourself sick. Unfortunately, you've only made $60 on the day. If you stick around after a short break, you could make a good amount more - but you run the risk of getting another table of leftovers, which wouldn't just make you choke down more fattening meals but leave you nearly catatonic for who knows how long.</span></div></div>",

You can see your stomach start to make a slight indent in the XL shirt, but the plus size is that you're willing and able to take your next table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour decision to take this table ends up paying off in one way, but is a terrible decision in another. Your next customers are two female tabby cats who are absolutely massive, each at least 600 pounds, and they take a quick liking to you. They ask you to chat for a few minutes before ordering, asking you how you like working at the restaurant so far. When you get to the pill, their eyes go wide, and they look at each other with a smirk. \"Your boss didn't tell you about that pill's effects, did it?\", one asks. \"Well, not really,\" you say. \"Well, we'll get one of... well, let's get six desserts each,\" she says. Her sister chimes in - \"actually, I'll take seven,\" she says. You dutifully take their orders and deliver the smorgasbord of desserts to them quickly. Each takes one bite of each dessert, then say in unison, \"I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you with 13 desserts to eat yourself. There's no way you're going to be able to do this, is there? You ask your boss, who laughs. Some customers like to do this to employees, he says. And then he says you've gotta get started. He'll give you a $40 bonus for every dessert you eat. You clear the table and bring all of the desserts to the employee eating area, and the cats quickly follow. You start eating... and find your stomach passes the food immediately, digesting it within seconds of you swallowing. It seems the pill's effects are still in effect. So you have to keep eating, the wolf reminds you as he checks up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes almost two hours for you to feel full again, and you've in that time cleared almost every dessert, finally scraping the last pieces of pie and sighing as you finish the 13th. On the plus side, you've made $600 today; on the negative side, your automatic digestion has caused you to gain more than 80 pounds, now completely filling out your work uniform, stretching the sweatpants' rope string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf congratulates you and hands you another set of clothes.

Everyone's respectful and the vast majority of your customers are very nice. Plus, you've managed to sublet a nice apartment for a few months at a low price, so you can kinda put down roots - it'll be better to keep making money so you don't get screwed again. If you have to eat a ton of free food every day, is that really such a bad thing to ask? You pat your belly, look around at the happy customers in the restaurant, and decide this works for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day goes surprisingly well. You never get more than two desserts at a time, and while the wolf is keeping an eye on you the whole time, he knows he has to hold up his end of the deal. You walk home quickly after another five desserts, holding more than $1500 in your pocket as the day's pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you again find your weight gain process slows, and you start enjoying life in the city, now at 350 pounds. You're big enough that unless you get more than four desserts at a time, you're able to recover quickly and keep your shifts going longer. And your weight gain has slowed, too - sure, there's still a few pounds on your waistline every time you overeat your boundaries - but you're rising slowly, just a few pounds a week, a more manageable pace.

It was hilarious! One of the challenges made them write a song together! Great television!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this a show I can be on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can! We just need to find the right opposite for you, and I think we have a concept that will bring in the ratings!\" The elephant sounds incredibly enthusiastic about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would I have as an opposite?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can pull some strings, I might be able to sign, get this, Brian The Binge King!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the elephant for a moment. \"Umm...who is Brian the...Binge King?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion crosses the elephant's face. \"Have you been living under a rock or something? Brian the Binge King! The Lion Lord of Lard himself! He's only one of the greatest competitive eaters of this or any other generation! Last week, the guy devoured 107 hot dogs in under five minutes! It was a new world record!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this doesn't make sense. I'm the opposite of a competitive eater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant let out a loud laugh. \"You haven't seen the guy, have you? He's absolutely massive. Easily, what, ten times your size? Brian doesn't bother getting weighted very often. I think he past a half-ton about two years ago. But that's where you two differ: Super skinny and super fat! Opposites... Attached! What do you say, pal?\"</span></div></div>",

We need our booth set up in just a few minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the pig- apparently named Mark- turn around to see an even bigger porcine lumbering towards you. He towers over you, and has a few inches on the smaller pig. There's little doubt this one's a full on razorback boar; large tusks jut out from under his mouth, and his leathery skin is covered in wiry brown hair. A gut bigger than your entire body bounces with each ponderous step, preceding the boar by a good foot, making the boar nearly as wide as he is tall. But his arms, legs, and chest look solid as oak trees, and nearly as wide. There's not a lot of definition, but the slightest bend in his arm makes rock-hard biceps larger than your head surge up. He arches his brow quizzically as he sees you; he's actually pretty handsome, with chocolate-brown eyes and a large, manly chin, his hair in a military-style buzzcut. The way he carried himself, he had an air of authority, and you felt yourself standing up straighter the longer he looks at you, like he's a drill sergeant about to start bellowing orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, bro, I was just making a new friend- look at him! He's all sticks and bones!\" Mark says, patting your shoulder as his soft gut presses against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger boar glares, placing his hands on his wide hips. \"Mark Densin, get yer fat ass in that van of yers, and get those hot dogs and burgers down here, or I'll tan yer hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry!\" Mark says with a small salute, giving you an apologetic look as he rushes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger boar shakes his head. \"Ugh... little brothers, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I wouldn't know, I think...\" you mutter, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar eyes you, then juts out his thick, leathery hand. \"Name's Trevor Densin, but most people 'round here call me 'Tank,' on account-a my time with the city defense force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, sure, <i>that's</i> why, you think as your gaze glances again at his huge tankard of a gut. You take his hand, which completely envelops you; your whole body jumps as he shakes. \"I'm, uhm...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll feelin' alright?\" Tank asks. \"My brother ain't lyin', ya look deathly ill, friend. Here, let's getcha somethin' to drink at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank's huge arm presses against your back as he guides you, like he's afraid you're about to fall over. \"Keep with me, Red,\" he says, on account of your red fur, you suppose. \"Won't do none to have ya pass out on one-a Zaftig City's best holidays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holiday?\" You echo, quirking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psht, don'tcha know? Summer Festival starts today!\" Tank gestures ahead, where the city's huge park has been taken over by a colorful array of tents and booths. Rides have been set up- most of them, you notice, curiously low to the ground- and a huge stage dominates the center of the festival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wouldn't know,\" you mumble, still being guided by the boar. \"I'm from out of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, that explains it.\" Tank chuckles, nodding to the people around you- he's caught you ogling the plus-size citizens, ranging from a little tubby to outright landwhales, huffing and puffing to move under their own power. \"People 'round these parts a little heartier than where yer from, ain't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that...\" you concede, trying not to stare as you spot another fox five times your size greedily devouring a gallon bucket of fried chicken, holding it as dearly in his fat-swaddled arm against his heavy, doughy chest as if it was his firstborn child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Tank leads you to his own booth, which has rather cutesy cartoons of Tank and Mark's faces flanking big, bold lettering that reads \"Densin Bros. Eats\" \"Well, Zaftig City's a good place. Good people. Densin family's been here from the start. My great grandaddy was the tenth mayor during the city's bicentennial, and <i>his</i> grandaddy was mayor before that,\" Tank says with pride, smiling and tugging at the lapels of his long-suffering shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where is Zaftig City, exactly? Worldwise?\" You ask, cocking your head as Tank steps behind you, preparing something from a vat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, ya really are lost, ain'tcha Red?\" He comes back with a huge glass of lemonade, setting it in front of you. \"That should perk ya right up. Zaftig's an independent city state, sandwiched right between the US and Canada. Best damn farming anywhere, and there ain't no better place for food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... is that why everyone's so...\" you puff out your cheeks, holding your arms out in a circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Tank gives you a mysterious smirk. \"Drink yer lemonade, Red, it's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that gnawing feeling in your stomach, and take your first sip; the taste is almost overwhelming. It's almost too sweet, but that sharp, lemon-y tang, and a sprig of mint, you think, has you finish off the whole glass, feeling oddly refreshed, if still starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks so much, Tank.\" You grin up at the boar, nodding, then you feel like the wind's knocked out of you as Tank slaps you on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" he grins, helping you to your feet. \"Now go get some vitals in ya, Red. Ya still look like stiff breeze'll knock ya down. Go to any ol' booth, take yer pleasure. If they ain't handin' out free sample, ya'll just tell 'em ol' Red sent ya. But I want to see ya back here with some room in yer gut- yer gettin' a genuine Densin bros. burger if I have to hunt ya down and force it down yer gullet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble out of Tank's booth, then shrug as you look around, craning your neck for something that strikes your fancy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, little dude! Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye catches a huge stag, but a very different kind of huge. He was a towering mass of muscle, with arms nearly as big as Tank's, but far more defined and sculpted, made up of vast rolling shoulders, swollen biceps, and a huge chest you could bounce a quarter off of, all packed into a tank top straddling his massive bust and solid torso. He wasn't entirely ripped; not competition ready, certainly. He was like an off-season bodybuilder, with a bit of healthy fat marring his sculpted form; apparently no one got out of living in Zaftig City unscathed. He was also a handsome devil, with a strong chin and sculpted face, and a giant pair of antlers speaking to his virility, but the dullness in his grey eyes marked him as remarkably dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by the sight of him, you move closer, and he smiles. \"Awesome! You're our first customer of the day, bro. And you look like you could use a piece of cake or three.\" You can spot some similarly well built and musclebound guys, busy unpacking all kinds of snacks behind the stag, but he was the biggest by a good margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you guys, and what're you selling?\" You ask, clearing your throat and trying not to stare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the Beta Upsilon Phi frat, man!\" He flexes his arm, his bicep swelling up to a monstrous size. \"B, U, F! Spells buff, hah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buff has two F's, Zach, you meathead,\" one of the Frat brothers shouted from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pft, whatever, man.\" Zach smirked, then gestured to the counter, laden with all kinds of delectable baked goods; cookies, brownies, pies, and cakes. A huge chocolate cake caught your eye in particular. \"We're doing a bake drive, bro. See anything you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach grumbles intensely enough you have to grip it, your mouth watering. \"T-tank, Tank Densin sent me, said he was good for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Tank?\" Zach brightens up. \"Oh yeah dude, he's cool. Take whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are <i>starving,</i> and the tantalizing smell is driving you crazy as you snatch up the entire cake, the desert larger than your head. You shove some of the moist, gooey, sinfully rich cake into your mouth, relieved to have some real food at last. \"How'sh a frat sho good at baking?\" You ask, your mouth full of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, training, man.\" Zach responds. \"We all gotta do our part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, man, for the city. Zaftig's gotta keep growing, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zach, dude!\" One of the frat bros, a buff bear that was carrying considerable more paunch in his middle than Zach, punches the stag in his arm. \"Shut up! Can't you see he's out of town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You're about a third way through the cake, your muzzle covered in frosting. Your pants feel a little tight as your gut is packed with cake, but you're still starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... don't worry about it, bro,\" Zach said quickly. \"Boring... politics stuff. How's, uh... how's the cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'sh great!\" You nod emphatically. It takes a few minutes of intense gorging as you sate your hunger, and the various frat bros begin peaking over Zach's huge shoulders to watch. When you're finally finished, you're sinking down to the ground, licking your fingers and rubbing your distended gut. \"Ugh...\" Best. Cake. Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, dude!\" Zach chuckles, leaning over the counter, shading you with his pecs. \"That was <i>awesome!</i>\" Some of the other frat bros cheer, two pairs of muscular arms hoisting you to your feet. \"You gotta come to the frat house and do that again, cakebro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly light-headed from the gorging, you stagger away from the BUF bros as they slap you on your back. Well, at least you're getting popular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Zach was hushed up, though, has you suspicious. Where do you go next?</span></div></div>",

Mark is back, a small mountain of patties and hot dog links piled up on the table beside him as the doughy pig fires up the grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, back already, Red?\u201d Tank grins at your approach, nodding approvingly at your taut gut. \u201cGot yerself some good eats already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the BUF bake sale... by the way, uh, Tank... I came away from there with a few questions about the city...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boar held up a finger before setting down a massive burger in front of you, bigger than your head. \u201cMark\u2019s been toyin\u2019 with this, feels like you might like it... two patties, sliced up hot dog, two different types of cheese, spinach instead of lettuce, onions, and our patented Densin Bros. Secret Sauce, heh.\u201d Tank\u2019s tugging on his lapels again, his gut pressing against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa almost forgot the fries! Chili-cheese, \u2018course,\u201d Mark added, placing a plate practically cracking under the weight of so much potato, smothered under still sizzling chili and goopy cheese. The blubbery pig beams at you, eager to see you take your first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... thanks, guys, but about my question...\u201d Tank cuts you off again, leaning on the counter, his sheer mass making it buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen, Red. We\u2019re doin\u2019 this \u2018cause we like ya, and ya need a break. Don\u2019t turn your nose up at our food after the way we helped ya. Ya\u2019ll can answer any question you want, but you gotta <i>eat.</i>\u201d The boar pushes the burger and fries closer to you. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt my baby brother\u2019s feelings, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to Mark, who\u2019s smiling nervously, anxiously hovering over Tank until you try his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \u201cAlright.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to wrap your paws around the massive burger, and already an orange-ish sauce is seeping out, but you take a bite. \u201c...<i>Wow.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh!\u201d Tank smacks is brother on the back, making him wobble. \u201cTold ya he\u2019d like it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d Mark asks eagerly. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod emphatically. The cheeses and sauce make a great blend, and the meat has clearly been mixed in with spices, giving it just a little kick, but incredibly tantalizing and juicy on your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Red. Ask away.\u201d Tank grins, looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMph...\u201d You have to force yourself to pause, gulping down a big bite. \u201cThe BUF guys said Zaftig City has to keep growing, or else. What\u2019d he mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all cities gotta keep growin\u2019, Red,\u201d the boar scoffed. \u201cOtherwise, they just stagnate, y\u2019know? Like Detroit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019tsh not what I mean, an\u2019 you know it, Tank,\u201d you murmur, your mouth half full of fries and chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark glances nervously to his big brother. \u201cTank...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar holds up his hand. \u201cYer a sharp one, Red. So I\u2019ll level with ya. My family\u2019s been here since the beginnin\u2019, and they were there when the original founders made... a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA deal?\u201d You frown. \u201cWith who?\u201d Mark approaches with another lemonade, which you take automatically. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone pow\u2019rful enough that we ain\u2019t gonna cross that deal three hundred years later,\u201d Tank said, his voice low. \u201cLook, if the city elders caught me talkin\u2019 about this to a non-resident, I\u2019d be hog-tied. All ya need to know is, somethin\u2019 in the soil makes our crops grow like nowhere else, and somethin\u2019 in the air just makes a man want to eat, and eat...\u201d He nods across the way, to a morbidly obese cheetah wearing a tank top that was practically a bra for his doughy, pillow-like chest, his massive, soft gut stretching and warping his spots as that mound of fat bounced with each plodding step, thighs wider than your waist rolling off one another, and a round, bulbous posterior spilling out of gym shorts two sizes too big. His mouth had a bear claw in it, and about a dozen other baked goods were clutched in his fat-swaddled arms. \u201cTake Roy Sparrow over there. He\u2019s out on his morning jog. Became an official citizen a year ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops. You know that name. \u201cRoy Sparrow? He won gold in track at the last Olympics! He\u2019s a total fitness guru!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he still runs,\u201d Mark nods. \u201cHe\u2019s faster than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s faster than you, Mark,\u201d Tank rolls his eyes. \u201cBut being big in Zaftig, it\u2019s a status symbol. Gotta show off how much you can afford, how rich you\u2019re makin\u2019 the city, because that\u2019s the deal we made- the more we eat, the richer the city gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo what end?\u201d You ask, absent-mindedly polishing off your fries; the burger was long gone. \u201cWhat does this... thing you made a deal with get out of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank and Mark exchanged looks, then shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. The Elders do, but they don\u2019t say why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the BUF guys? They\u2019re not fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank chuckles. \u201cYeah, but they eat like locusts, Red! Buildin\u2019 muscle\u2019s hungry work.\u201d The boar flexes his own mighty arm, his meaty bicep rising up considerably, and rock hard. \u201cThey train hard to keep us safe, then when they retire, they can unwind and still eat as much as they want. I always thought it was a good trade,\u201d he grins, tapping the crest of his swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself shaking your head, especially when you see your hand come up empty, and you stare in shock at your empty plates and glass. \u201cThis... this is crazy.\u201d You mutter, standing up. \u201cI gotta get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd go <i>where,</i> Red? Do ya\u2019ll even know if you\u2019re from the US r Canada? \u2018Cause those are the only two countries on the way out of Zaftig.\u201d Tank\u2019s words freeze you in your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar sighs, coaxing you back, then swinging that massive, gorilla arm of his over your shoulders. \u201cListen, Red. I like ya. And ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to fear. Most people in Zaftig are the god-fearin\u2019, upstandin\u2019 type. But, there\u2019s one thing I gotta tell ya...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Outsiders aren't just people from out of town. Ya popped in here, no idea where ya come from, feelin' like ya don't belong in yer own skin.

But then there's Outsiders, like you.\" The boar gestures for your hand, then flips your palm up, scraping away debris of chocolate frosting from the BUF cake. You gasp, looking at a brand you hadn't noticed before. It's a simple design, with two crescent moons coming together to form a circle, looking not unlike a reptilian eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell is this?

It really was the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Mark offers a weak grin. \"We don't serve anything less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod curtly, then take your leave. Your skin's still crawling by what Tank said- if you weren't a fox, then what were you? You grunt a bit, your middle sloshing a bit from all the food you ate, pants still feeling a little snug. You wanted to get a place to stay sooner than later, but perhaps a snack will clear your head, first...</span></div></div>",

That last thing she said resonating through your mind, the bubbly feeling in your system growing. She cupped her hands over her muzzle with wide eyes. You saw her lips form the word \"sorry.\" You tilted your head in confusion. The bubbly feeling pulsating through your body very slowly. Suddenly you felt slightly off balance for a moment, like your center of gravity took a sudden shift. You wobbled around for a moment trying to regain your footing when you saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doughy belly was starting to form beneath your shirt. The growth ached in your stomach, a unique pain as your skin stretched. You clutched your midsection, groaning as the pain grew. Begging inside for it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately things only got worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the belly continued to grow, the transformation spread. That same ache found its way around your body. You watched in horror as your chest began to swell beneath the t-shirt you were wearing. The view of your feet disappeared beneath your new formed moobs and gut. Though you could still imagine just what was going on down there, grimacing as you felt your thighs begin to touch. Your arms suddenly started feeling weighed down, you looked down at your fingers as they looked like they were filling into thick sausages. Your bones ached, suddenly taking on all this new weight was not the best for them. You tried to take a step forward, your muscles unable to take on the new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, the transformation completed itself with some final touches. A poofy round face, a second chin. Suddenly you regained movement as the transformation added density to your bones, your muscles growing to take on the weight. Making the doughy weight on your body look and feel much more solid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a sight you were at this point. Your pants strained to the point where the seams were about to give, the button long since popped off. Everything was held aloft by your girth alone. Your shirt riding so far up your gut that it could only act as an improvised bra for your massive moobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halfheartedly pushed your hands into the new girth. Your chubby hands sinking in deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness I'm so so sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what just happened?\" You groaned, still trying to settle into your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just put on probably over 100 pounds in a matter of minutes.\" She frowned. \"Because of how many of those mushrooms you ate...and the fact I called you fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards her, shivering as the rest of the weight shifted. It felt like you were wearing a suit made of gelatin. Very packed, heavy gelatin.  \"Can I fix this at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we've got a few options, ideally we could try and find some more of those mushrooms.\" She replied as she scratched her chin deep in thought.  \"If all else fails you could try and diet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you diet off magic weight gain?\" You mutter grabbing at the rolls of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...is a good question.\" She nodded. \"Regardless, we should probably get you out of the public eye...and some new clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great idea, would never have thought of that.\" You snark at her. She simply rolls her eyes and starts walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you coming or not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and start walking, grunting with every step as you waddle behind her.

You continue waddling behind her, panting with every step you take. Your stomach isn't exactly in pain right now, but there is a slight uncomfortable feeling somewhere in there. \"Hey, just wait up for a second!\" You sit down on the grass as she stops to look at you. \"Come one, we've only been walking for five minutes. You can't seriously be tired already?\" she says. You rub your stomach to try and get rid of that uncomfortable feeling, but it's still there. Suddenly, you shirt rips from the sides until you're left sitting there wearing nothing more but your pants, which doesn't look like it'll last anymore longer than your shirt. \"Oh boy...I think you're still growing.\" \"Gee, you think?\" You rub your stomach as you try to stand up, but your knees give before you could get your blubbery behind off the grass. \"Help! I'm stuck!\" you say, looking at the girl. \"Stuck? How could you be stuck?\" She walks over to you and grabs your hand. The two of you try to get you back on your feet, but your belly just won't budge. \"*pant* Man, you're getting heavier by the second!\" \"Well what am I supposed to do now?\" You look at your bigger than a beach ball belly and grimace at the thought of becoming stuck on that spot for the rest of your life...Which isn't exactly that long, since you can only remember what happened up to the moment you woke up today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, stay here and I'll go look for the mushrooms by myself.\" The seams of your pants burst, leaving just the top half intact. \"Right, I'll just go now.\" She's about to take off when you stop her for a second. \"Wait, I haven't even asked you your name!\" \"It's Sammy!\" She says as she leaves. You're left there on the grass, wondering if there even is any more of those left around here. You try playing around with your stomach for a bit, feeling a bit content at how soft it is to the touch. You lift it up and drop it, feeling it jiggle on your lap. You even try hugging it a little, feeling the warm mass around your arms. \"Heheh, well I guess being fat isn't exactly all bad, I guess.\"</span></div></div>",

Every couple of seconds or so you could feel the mass pile on. Little by little. Like sand in an hour glass. The breeze in the air was nice, wafting between the newly formed rolls on your body. It was a welcome sensation against the formidable blubber insulation now coating every inch of you in droves. It was nice to know you could still life your arms, the extra poundage making things a little more difficult though. Would you still be able to lift and move them when Sammy got back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that rate, mobility in your finger tips was questionable. Your chubby digits swelling bigger, and bigger. Your right bicep was already as thick as a chubby fur's thigh. Your forearm fairing about as well. Yet what strange feelings now filled your body. More pleasant ones. You took those chubby hands of yours and explored your ever growing figure. Taking a handful of your own titanic moob. The pudgy flesh oozing between your finger tips, sending shivers up and down your body. You squeezed a little harder, but found it more difficult to do so. Your fingers got fatter, the moobs got bigger. But you held it there, waiting until you could no longer take a handful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the grass rustle and crunch beneath your rear end. The thousands of tiny pricks only magnifying the odd pleasure you now found in your size. Were the mushrooms changing your mind as you knew it? Or was that all you at this point. You rubbed your belly, feeling the massive blob in your lap ripple. In your mind you fancied yourself a big furry hill in the midst of the grassy knoll you now sat. Growing bigger and bigger with each second, relishing it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you squirmed a little to compensate for your swelling thighs and rump. It was becoming quite a cushion now, more comfortable than any chair you had ever sat on. In your haste to adjust, you accidentally threw off your balance. With a yelp your upper body slowly tumbled back. The weight of your body now pushing down upon you at full force. In your mind you cried \"timber\" as you struck the ground. Sending tidal wave like ripples all throughout your growing frame. And it was still going, and going. Your belly pushing ever upwards, your moobs rolling to the side, your third chin beginning to form. Your tongue lolled out in ecstasy as your thighs now spread open a little, letting a draft breeze through the rather warm lower region.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I found some and...oh dear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear Sammy approach your now humongous form. Your modesty was the least of your problems now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...you are.\" You grunt, the combination of pleasure and extra girth making breathing a bit of a chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's get you back to normal.\" She says, running over to your head, three mushrooms in her hands. \"I brought some extras just in case the effects were too strong to negate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach roared the moment you laid eyes on the mushrooms. Devious thoughts floated in your mind. You reach out to grab one, but to your horror, your arms are too fat to move. With a gasp you squirm, but you end up just jiggling around like a big pot of jello. \"Just...pop one in my mouth.\" You wheeze, the heat in your body rising as you felt a your chins swell a little more. Your cheeks poofing up like a chipmunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not need to tell her twice, she placed one in your muzzle, to which you heartily scarfed down. A wave of pleasure now greeted your body, that familiar feeling you had when you ate the mushrooms before now entered your system. You could become whatever you wanted and you just had to say it out loud. But you were torn between two choices at the moment. Without a moments thought, you blurted out the first sentence that came to mind. A strange sense of pleasure and claustrophobia now played into your response.</span></div></div>",

Why isn't anything happening?\" Sammy muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still as fat as ever, and still growing. But the new sensation can't exactly be described, other than a weird tingling feeling in your body, especially your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel something happening, but I dunno what it is.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...You said that you want to be able to move and breath, so...Try moving around.\" Sammy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and lift your arm...With total ease.

Obviously, no muscle can penetrate that amount of blubber. You bring your other hand to your arm, and you can feel something there. It's very slight, but if you push down deep enough, you can feel rock-hard muscle underneath all of that fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow...You're growing too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Sammy say that as she takes a step back.

You look down at her and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess things worked out pretty well, huh?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. We still need to get rid of that body fat from you.\" Sammy said, already holding one of the two mushrooms left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a soft hand on your much softer stomach, fondling and massaging it. It was like cotton, only better! The feeling of your hand gliding over the surface of your bulbous stomach was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? What do you mean no!? You didn't exactly want this in the first place!\" Sammy said, looking at you with a bewildered expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kinda like it. I mean, I'm huge, my own blubber can keep me warm, my now super-strong muscles can protect me...And the feeling of being so big...It's just...So...Good...\" you say, kneading your own doughy belly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mushrooms...I think they're changing your mind.\" Sammy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, maybe it's just me accepting this new body of mine...Mmm, and just imagine if I was bigger...\" you say, almost a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy gives a small gasp that you almost missed. She looks at the mushrooms, thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These mushrooms are dangerous. I'd better find a way to turn you back to normal.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart almost sinks from that sentence. Someone wants you to shrink back to that scrawny creature you were before? You feel a twinge of anger at that. You look at the mushrooms in her hands, your stomach grumbling, and a thought pushing its way into your mind.</span></div></div>",

Transformed into a fox, thrown into a parallel universe were everyone were anthropomorphic animals, and getting into trouble with the fuzz for being stark naked in a public park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDam, you really needed to quite drinking. It was giving you some odd nightmares. You yawned, reaching with your hand to scratch an itch on your head when you froze, noticing that there was something very wrong with your appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovered in orange fur, padded with dull claws, your hand was far from looking like a human's. Your heart began to race in your chest, and you threw away the covers, studying your body. Yup, you were still a fox, dressed in the same clothing you had stolen, minus the black hoody, which you couldn't locate anywhere, but that was the least of your problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, this isn't happening,\" you whispered in horror to yourself, \"This isn't real!\" But unfortunately it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw that you were in a cell, which meant that they had probably taken you downtown, like the police officer had said. A window, covered with bars, provided you a glimpse of the outside world. Looking outside, you saw a bunch of police cars parked in the parking lot and a sign above the main entrance of the building that read \"Zaftig City Police Department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared, feeling the odd sensation of your ears pressing flat against your head and your bushy tail going between your legs. To calm your nerves, you decided to wash your face in the sink that the cell had. After doing that, and watching the water drip off your wet fur, you heard boot striking the cement floor heavily, keys jingling and someone whistling a happy tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your attention to the noise and beheld a obese rhino, swinging a pair of keys around his stubby finger, coming to your cell's door and unlocking it. He was dress in a ill-fitting police uniform, stretched across him like a second skin, the buttons on his blue shirt straining around his potbelly and exposing his ash colored skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, kid,\" he said in a friendly tone, opening the door, which screeched on its hinges, \"We're gonna ask you a few questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could you do? With no where to go and no one to depend on, you obediently and silently did as he said. With your eyes firmly fixed on your furry feet, you were escorted away by the corpulent officer, wishing that you were anywhere except here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're telling me that you don't know any relatives, where you live, or who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, saying, \"Y-yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth officer Smug, the same grey dragoness that had apprehended you, and officer Claude, the rhino that had escorted you, gave each other a questioning look. The dragoness shook her head, reached over to a box that contained a few donuts, and popped one into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she chewed it, she spoke, sending crumbs flying into your direction. \"Listen kid, I got a bullshit meter and right now it's telling me something ain't right here,\" she said, \"So, I'm gonna ask you again, tell us the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in frustration. This was the third time that you were going to tell this story and you were getting annoyed. \"I'm telling you the truth!\" you exclaimed, feeling tears coming to your eyes, \"I woke up in the park, I was naked, I tried ducking for cover and that's how you caught me, ok. I don't know anyone, I don't know where I live, I don't know my dam own name. I don't know what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, calm down,\" said Smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, leaning back in the plastic chair, which creaked under her weight. The dragoness was obviously trying to figure out what to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Claude spoke. \"Sounds to me like a bad case of amnesia,\" he said, shifting his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it to me too,\" said Smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long moment of awkward silence lapsed before you decided to break it. \"So, what are you going to do now?\" you ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Smug shrugged. \"I guess we could perhaps try and help you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you aren't going to give me jail time for streaking?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmug shook her head. \"We could put you before a judge, but there's a good chance that they would pity you more than sentence you, so what's the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness leaned forward again to snatch another donut when she noticed you staring at the box. You were rather hungry, something you noticed after things had slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmug sighed, reluctantly pushing the box to you, saying, \"Here you go, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said, and you began to eat the remaining pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you did this, you asked, \"So, what are you going to do to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could book you in at a place for homeless people,\" officer Claude suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, if your uncomfortable with that,\" officer Smug said, \"you can stay at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost chocked in surprise. \"Really?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmug shrugged. \"Sure, I'm looking for a roommate anyway,\" she said before leaning in and continuing in a intimidating voice, \"That is if you behave yourself. So, what would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you decide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You watched her go, uncertain of what to do, but a hand dropped on your shoulder, starling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you volunteered to be our new test subject for the great or good of medicine, hey?\" the badger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" he exclaimed, reaching for a clipboard and pen, shoving it into your face. \"Sign here and here and here,\" he indicated with his finger at blank spaces on the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked like some sort of contract, and you really wanted to know what it was all about, but you decided against it, for this wasn't your place to ask questions. You took the risk, making a few random curls on the paper, for you didn't have a hand signature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased, the badger held the clipboard to his chest and said, \"Thank you.

The pea-sized pill slides down your throat with ease as you take up gulp of a glass of water placed before you. It takes a few moments for it to take effect, but you soon feel a warmth spreading through you starting in your stomach, and spreading all over, it gives you a mild sense of tingling comfort, as though you were being caressed by warm hands on your fur. After a moment or two or this, you feel it wearing off a little in some areas but becoming stronger in others. Your chest, thighs, and backside are the most potent of these, you begin to pant heavily as a sense of panic spreads through you, you can feel the flesh under your fur shifting and changing, getting hot. Your chest feels heavier, and your ass begins feel tight in seat of your shorts, with your thighs thickening too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation feels very strange, you look down and yourself, but it is difficult to make out the changes occurring due to the baggy clothing you had chosen for yourself, but it felt like your chest and butt were dough rising under your clothes.

You lower your shorts, perhaps a little more embarrassed than you had been before, as you realize you had not grabbed any underwear, and while your junk remained those of a male, your hips, thighs, and buttocks could fool anyone into thinking that you had been born a girl.

You look from the mirror, to the door, and back again, not knowing the outcome of refusal, and fearing what they might do to you now that they had the ability to make you feel tortuously hungry or full, you comply and throw it back, and wash it down with the last of the glass of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the effects are not as immediate and obvious, you sit back in your chair and wait, a few moments pass you and begin to feel yourself growing lazier, and craving food... but not in the same way as before. It was not as though your drive to eat came from hunger, although you were a bit underfed, it came more from a sense of greed. As though you wanted to eat, not to sustain yourself, but for the pleasure of eating.

You blink and wonder if perhaps it might have been a good idea to have read the forms.

Before you can say anything, another video begins to play, with the same friendly Ewe, dressed in a corporate-looking suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for visiting the Morph Institute, the world's leader in body and mind modifying pharmaceuticals.

Making your way out of the room, through the first room you had entered and back into the lobby. Heading up the reception desk, you note the change in your steps caused by your more feminine hips, and you like it. You come face to face with the wolf once again, she smiles and glances you up and down, clearly recognizing you from your face and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now, all finished up?\u201d She asks with a smile. \u201cIf you would care to give me some details, then...\u201d she begins to rummage with paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm interested in the testing program.\u201d You blurt out, the words leaving your mouth before you can even think about the consequences, the presentation's promise of free food was all you could think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, very good!\u201d The lupine lady says, almost as if she had been expecting you to speak about it. \u201cRight this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she gets up and leads you further into the facility, through several long corridors which were all completely sterile white, with the occasional splash of color in the arrows and signs directing around the building. The receptionist makes idle chit-chat with you and you try your best to reply and not get distracted by your intrusive thoughts of eating. After a short while, you reach a room with the sign announcing \u201cTesting Program \u2013 New Intake\u201d, and the wolf opens the door for you and gestures for you to enter. You pass her, thanking her, and then she closes the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is completely white on every wall and the floor, being totally empty except with one wall taken up mostly by a large flat screen, and the center of the tiled floor has a large raised metal plate. The screen flicks on and the voice of you ewe narrates over the top of an animated logo with the letters MI, the symbol of the institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for signing up for the Morph Institute's in-house testing program.\u201d It says in the same friendly tone. \u201cTo begin, please remove your clothes and step onto the scale.\u201d speaks the automated progam. You obediently pull your clothing off and discard it in a corner before stepping onto the metallic plate in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job!\u201d The voice of the ewe says. \u201cNow, please stand still with your arms by your sides. This will only take a moment.\u201d You do as instructed, and watch as two beams of light scan down your body, they only take a few seconds to do their work. \u201cGreat! Now we have everything we need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen flashes up with a 3D model of your body which is perfect down the the smallest detail, by the side of which is displayed all of the information the scanners picked up about you, you're taken aback by how thorough they had been in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SUBJECT #4340<br>\r\nSpecies: Fox<br>\r\nSex: F<br>\r\nGenitals: M<br>\r\nHeight: 5'1<br>\r\nWeight: 104lbs/47.1kg</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead, as the 3D Model of you spins around on the screen.

On it sits a neatly folded pink jumpsuit, lifting it, it feels smother than anything you had ever felt, like a mixture between rubber and latex. On the chest it says #4340, and as you're looking it over, the ewe's voice speaks up and instructs you to put it on. You do as instructed, and it glides over your fur as you pull it on, it hugs you very snugly but does not feel tight in the slightest, it feels as though it's been tailored to your exact specifications and you almost feel as though you're nude wearing it. It covers from your ankles to the base of your neck, leaving only your feet, hand-paws and head exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have almost completed the sign up process.

Getting in line for the \u201cCandies\u201d stall, you find yourself behind an enormous horse's ass, quite literally, her fur is while and she is dressed in a pink jumpsuit just like you, but her waist is easily as wide as you are tall, and she towers up above you at about eight feet in height, you stare up in awe and look her all over. You shudder as you find yourself envying her sheer size, the thick tree-trunk thighs which curve outwards to meet the base of her butt, which was as wide as a car, the tight jumpsuit which hugs her body is very revealing and you blush at the fact that you might as well be staring at her naked. Even by the standards of the inhabitants of the rest of the room, this girl is big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line moves painfully slowly as the fat animals in front and behind you waddle slowly forwards as each of them makes their choice and then heaves their weight off in another direction to where there is a comfortable seat. A couple of times a clumsy camel lining up behind you bumps you with his gut and you have to use all of your resistance to not fly head-first into the horse's butt. While you await your food, you look around for a place to sit once you get it - there are a large number of seating areas scattered around the place, all of the seats are backless and heavily cushioned, wider than park-benches to accommodate their users.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you watch as the towering horse orders up, and is delivered what amounts to a crate of candies, you can't see over the top of it as she is too tall, but you can't miss the mountain of candies which overflow the outer edges. She glances down at you curiously before making her way off into the crowds. You step forwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d You stare at the menu board behind the plump goat guy manning the stall. It is overflowing with different options, but you feel your heart sink once again as you see dollar values beside each menu item. You think to yourself that you may never end up eating. You speak up, defeated \u201c...sorry. I don't have any money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...#4340...\u201d The goat speaks up as you're just about to turn away. \u201c...we're showing a $20 dollar credit to your account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment and suddenly it dawns on you that you had been paid $40 for the drug tests, and the ewe had said something about a $20 dollar processing fee. Perhaps they transferred your payment straight away once you joined up? It didn't matter, you were going to eat! You stare up at the menu once again and scanning through, the names are all so alien to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll take... three Rainbow Astroblobs ($9), a bag of Ultracreamy Fudge ($3), two bags of Jellycremes ($4), aaand... an Ultravanilla Supermallow ($4).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goat piles all of the food into a box for you, and deducts all of the money you have from your account, but you don't care, as each treat he piles into the box looks more delicious than the last. The Astroblobs are stored in large pouches and look soft and squishy, almost like large nuggets of nougat, glistening and rainbow colored, each one as big as your fist. The bag of Ultracreamy Fudge looks more like a sack than a bag, full up with marble-patterned golden fudge squares. The Jellycremes are in similarly sized bags as fudge, full of multicolored, soft candies. And finally, the Ultravanilla Supermallow is a sight to behold, it is easily as big as your head and is wrapped up in golden foil with a bow at both ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your box of candies and head off into the main seating area, you decide to sit...</span></div></div>",

Making you way over, you sit on a seat about ten feet away, facing towards the others, the seats being arranged mostly in circular groups facing inwards. You marvel at the fact that her huge ass spills over the edges of the seat, while yours  barely takes up a tenth of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the group, you see that most of the animals surrounding her seem to be of about average weight judging by the rest of the room, but by normal standards heavily overweight. Some are sat eating, whilst others seem to have taken to sitting and rubbing at the horse woman's gut, or helping her by standing on the seats beside her and cramming food into her mouth. It seems as though size was power in a place like this You watch on, impressed for a few moments before you decide to turn your attentions to your own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out the bags of small candies first, Jellycremes and Ultracreamy Fudge. They're each super sweet and very filling, you dig your hand into each bag in turn and take out heaped palms of each one after the other. Perhaps it's the fact that you haven't eaten in so long, or that you have no memories before the start of today... but you get the feeling that this is the best candy you have ever eaten. You let the sticky filling spill down your chin, you care so little, they just taste so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you unwrap the Rainbow Astroblobs from their packages and stuff them into your mouth one by one, they burst as you bite into them and a sweet syrupy mixture goes down your gullet with each one. It's bliss eating up the candies, all so filling but you find yourself unable to resist the temptations of the final one, the enormous Ultravanilla Supermallow. Rubbing at your belly, it feels tight from what you've eaten so far, but has not yet shown any sign of bloating. You take the Supermallow from its packaging and begin to tear pieces of it away... the soft candy tearing away easily despite it being of a thicker texture compared to usual marshmallows. Eating away at the candy, you barely notice your gut beginning to swell as it fills with the marshmallow, bigger than your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back with the last of it finished, you lay across the seat, using it like a bed and groan. Your eyes had been bigger than your stomach. Through your bloated haze, rubbing at your paunch, which sticks out about four inches in front of you, you hear the sounds of chuckling. The Mare and her entourage seem to have caught sight of you, and were openly jeering and cackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'm impressed.\u201d Says a chunky male boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe could barely even finish that tiny box full.\u201d Mocks a thickly build bear woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now...\u201d Said the enormous white mare, stifling a chuckle of her own, which made her belly, which almost sagged to the floor, jostle. \u201c...let's not mock the new girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush bright red and are about to open your mouth to speak when a voice from behind you speaks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... don't worry about them...\u201d The voice belongs to...</span></div></div>",

Nearly every one of the factories were surrounded by uninviting steel fences and barbed wire. As you walked along the cracked pavement road, you didn't see another fur around except for the occasional one waddling by a window inside these grey, unadorned buildings and eclipsing the light temporarily before finally waddling past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to lose hope. It didn't seem like any of these factories or offices or whatever they were seemed open to furs looking for jobs. That is, until you approached a structure far more inviting than the rest. Square and unadorned as the others, this building was a shade of bright white, giving the area a greater sense of liveliness. Light shined from the windows. And there was only a short chain link fence surrounding the premises interrupted by a gate. And at the security gate sat a rotund polar bear in the booth, lazily flipping through today's newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large sign hung from either side of the gate.

While you walk over to him and give him a closer look over as you approach. The large creature like the other dwellers of this place has not skipped out on his share of meals, in fact he looks like he almost never puts down the fork! His huge stomach pushes against the bar and then some sticking about three or four feet in front of him with about three small rolls on top of a large one on both sides of his gut that are evident through his clothes. His legs are thunderous and stretch his Jeans which you previously thought wasn't possible, his calves not at all missing out on the party as they even out the rest of his wide form. His arms jiggle as he eats a plate of chicken casually with the faintest of hints of muscle under all that flab, even his hands look like tubby mitts! His face and neck which attracted you before are round and smooth, you can clearly see his dark moss green scales and muddy yellow neck which leads I his under belly. The gators ass looks like someone took two overly large basket balls and shoved in his pants but upon seeing how much they jiggle you knew those hips did not lie. His neck has three chins, the first having a scruff of black hair (you assume that's where his chin should be). <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He is wearing leather jacket and a red and black plad button up with the sleeves ripped roughly off, the shirt being covered in food stains from many large \"battles\" with lunch and his gut peaking through the buttons. His aforementioned jeans are tightly stretched on his legs and the bottoms of the legs are covered in mud and what looks like cooking oil? His black hard toed boots look worn and somewhat ragged but still usable for him but maybe not your fashion standards (considering you don't have anything on you to call your self fashionable). He has a gold necklace around his neck though it looks like as it goes higher up more and more links were added to keep up and give some growing room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 picking up your courage yet again you pluck your naked rear down next to the truckers stool and think about a way to start the conversation, but you feel tiny next to him small and helpless next to this behemoth of a man. You almost feel aroused until you realize that doing so in your situation would probably not be wise, you try to hide the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Just before you get a chance to say anything the large trucker/biker cuts you off in a rumbling voice. <br>\r\n\"Little feller, I am willing to hear out what ever you got going on but perhaps you might want to consider listening to me first. You look lost and afraid and not at all like the local image so I am going to ask that we move to a more private place so your not targeted by any unfavourable members of this here establishment.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He smiles warmly and you look around, you can see the eyes of other patrons and realize going with this guy might be better than what might have happened if you stayed. You nod and he gets up out of his chair leaving cash on the counter and walking towards the door. Seeing him at his full hight you can accurately gage him to be about 6 foot 5, or maybe a bit more. He grabs your hand roughly and you both walk out the door. Maybe going with him was a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your now outside leaning up against a large truck wearing the gators jacket and borrowed some of his briefs, both are way to big for you.

Thanks for this, I didn't know what I was doing back there to be honest. I didn't catch your name, or really anything to be honest.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"The names Cory, I work as a trucker and I like to bike in my free time. When I saw you I couldn't help but feel as though you needed some good old hospitality and some one you could call friend.

How about this, you can come with me and learn more about this place, but you'll have to keep the cab clean and help me out with my job.

Other than a few scars across her face, her features are nearly flawless, which is only somewhat marred by the frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" she says, looking you over. \"And why the hell are you coming into a place like this looking like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not from around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound about right.\" she says, smirking a little bit. \"....So, ah, why did you come over to me, then?

Don't scare people like th-\" he began while turning around. The wolf was silenced by your appearance. \"Woah, you're the first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I know.\" you say. \"Can we go somewhere to talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nods. The two of you continue along the street until he spots an alley where you two duck away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and him exchange introductions. The wolf's name is James. And, much like yourself, he too found himself in this city for unknown reason. Unfortunately, James woke up in a dark alley in the middle of the night before in between a couple of racid smelling dumpsters. Keeping to the shadows, James kept out of trouble until, at dawn he found a laundromat where he had swipped the tent-like clothes he was wearing now. The only apparent patron was a tubby tiger who had dozed off waiting for his load to dry. James snagged an outfit from the dryer before the guy woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe a few bucks from him too...\" said James, pulling out a small wad of cash from his sweatpants pocket. \"He shouldn't have fallen asleep at a laundromat if he was carrying all this cash on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you begin, \"you need it more than he does, clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and if the chunky butt need money, he could just skip a few meals.\" said James. \"Speaking of 'chunky', have you seen the size of some of these people here? Massive, humongous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to tell me. I stole these from a clothing store and it wasn't even one of those special big-and-tall stores.\" You tug at your shirt for emphasis to show how incredibly baggy it is on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know about it.\" James held open the waist of his sweatpants. Easily, two more furs his size could comfortably fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen anyone else that was...well, not gigantic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. You're the first. I did see a couple of guys who were more on the muscular side, but still they had plenty of pudge on them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck for them nobody seems bothered to be obese here,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" said James. \"Hey, do you want to stick together for a while? We're both outsiders here, and I like to think that I can trust a fellow skinny guy like you rather than one of these lardos. What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

James takes it and you two shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, cool,\" said James as he looked to the sky. The sun was heading towards the west and the blue sky was turning hues of orange and red. \"It looks like it'll be night soon. We better find someplace to stay for the night. Come on, follow me. I think I saw a motel a while back. Looked cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. I guess I'm glad we just got the single bed,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe E-Z Dreams Motel had plenty of vacancies when you and James arrived. To save money, you booked a room with a single bed for a few nights with the money that chubby armadillo gave you earlier in the day. James figured you both could easily share a bed considering how large motel beds are anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two had forgotten you were in Zaftig City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed was massive, easily eight or nine feet in either direction. It was practically the centerpiece of the entire room. It was flanked on either side by nightstands with lamps on each. A TV stood opposite of the bed, and the room was furnished with a clean bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames leapt on to the bed, bouncing up and down. \"Wow, this is the biggest bed I've seen!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well this town has some of the biggest furs that I've seen,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true. I'm starving. Is pizza okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't care what's on it. I'm too tired and hungry to care right now. I just want a hot shower and a meal right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grabbed a phone book from nightstand. \"Cool, I'll find a place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, don't spend all our money! We got to make it last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you expected to take a nice, long shower, it got cut short as the bathroom was filled with the delicious odor of meat and cheese when the pizza arrived, and your stomach panged with hunger. You rinsed off, turned off the water, and shook yourself dry. Wrapping a towel around your waist, you exit the bathroom to get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on your oversized bed were two pizza boxes, each holding a pizza around three feet in diameter. James was sitting cross-legged in front of one tearing into what had to be his third slice. His grey and white muzzle was stained with grease and tomato sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" you say, gesturing to the second pizza, \"I thought you were going to get something cheap like a personal pizza! We can't splurge our money in food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chopped down the rest of his slice. 'Relax. This is a personal pizza! I even asked the delivery guy if he screwed up our order or something. Apparently, that's how they make them here. And they were pretty cheap anyways. Now, sit your butt down and dig in to your pizza. It's really amazing! It tastes great! Oh! And I found a channel that's playing Knives of Justice 2! I love that movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was right; the pizza was absolutely amazing. Easily some of the best you've ever had. You two ate your respective pizzas in silence while watching the movie. Well, you ate in silence. The occasional burp and moan of pleasure escaped James as he practically inhaled his pizza with reckless abandon. His fur was stained with dots of red and grease and crumbs. His black shirt was balled up on the floor, so all the mess landed on James chest and noticably swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, James let out a low, rumbling belch. \"God, that hit the spot...\" he said as he lazily rubbed a paw against his pizza-filled gut. \"Say what you will, but these fatties know how to make a good pizza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had only eaten about two thirds of your pizza and you were already painfully full. And, unlike James, you were careful not to mess up your clean fur with sauce and grease. The food was great. But you didn't want to eat yourself to the point of vomiting. You closed up the box and laid back in bed noticing your own stuffed belly, though it was not as round and full as James'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the movie, but James eyed your remaining slices like the wolf he was. The pizza, you thought, would make a decent breakfast tomorrow. But it looks like James is really eagar for more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stick your leftovers in the mini fridge of your hotel room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsiness from your meal is hitting you hard, so you hop back into bed and pull the covers over you after unwrapping your towel from around your waist. Sleep takes over you as James continues watching television, the occasional burp escaping his sauce-stained muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dreamless sleep is ended when you suddenly find yourself awake in your room which is completely dark aside from beams of streetlight filtering in through the room's closed blinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to the other side of the bed, you see that James isn't there. Before you can wonder where he went, you hear the sounds of cardboard rustling from the other side of the room. You look over in that direction and see the dark silhouette of the wolf's bare backside and grey furry tailing swaying happily left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greedy creature seems to be helping himself to your food. Or, at least, he was helping himself to your food. You hear the sound of the mini fridge's door shutting as James stands upright, an empty pizza box in one paw and the crust of a slice in his other. He stuffed the final bit of pizza into his maw has he lazily tossed the box in the direction of the trash can. As James quitely stepped back towards the bed, you catch a glimpse of his rounded belly which looked even more bloated than it did hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed jostles slightly as James slides back in. Rolling on to his side, you hear a final rumbling burp come from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're annoyed that he stole your food. This might just be a laspe in judgment for him, or it could be a sign that James has some problematic behaviors.</span></div></div>",

A surprised yelp confirms your foot hit its target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What was that for?\" yelled James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For eating my pizza!\" you yelled back. \"You know I was saving that for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! But I was still hungry!\" explained James. \"Look, I make it up to you tomorrow, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" you said dismissively. Rolling back over, you draw the cover close to you and fall back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you're woken up by someone jostling your shoulder. Wiping the sleep from your eyes, you see James is standing over you on your side of the bed. He's holding open large pink box. Inside were donuts, though significantly bigger than usual. You quickly counted nine of them and assume that James must have eaten some while you asleep. That suspicion was confirmed when you noticed the crumbs on his shirt and a stain of what looked like blueberry jelly still on this muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\" announced James. \"See, I told you I'd make it up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" You grab a maple bar that you swear is a few inches longer and rounder than they're usually made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, take them all!\" James hands you the entire box. You sit upright in bed and rest the box in front of you and you start on the maple bar. \"Well, unless you want to share...\" the wolf suggested. \"I had a couple, but how can only a couple of donuts count as a decent breakfast, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you consider sharing them with James. But then again, you want to teach this greedy wolf a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\" you said melodramatically. \"I mean, I'm so hungry this morning. Maybe if I had some pizza or something, I wouldn't need all of these.\" James averted his eye with the obvious jab at him. \"Besides, you're absolutely right. A couple of donuts isn't a decent breakfast, and it is the most important meal, after all!\" With that, you tore into the rest of your maple bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned on the television to distract himself from the treats he's missing out on. Yet you're not done making him suffer just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this one has sprinkles! I love sprinkles!\" You take a huge bite of the donut. \"Dohft yeh lahk sprinklughs?\" You ask just with your mouth full; he ignores you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man, lemon! My least favorite filling!\" James ears perked up. \"Oh well, waste not want not!\" His ears go back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!  Bavarian cream! My favorite!  No way I'd share this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each donut, you mercilessly tease James about how tasty and delicious they are and what he's missing out on. Judging by the look on his face, you can tell you've gotten under his skin. By the time you swallowed the final chunk of the ninth donut, you're suddenly aware of how much you've eaten and how incredibly full you are. Your gut, which had been deflated slightly from last night's dinner, is back to being tight as a drum and looks as if you'd eaten an overinflated basketball. Pain radiated from your belly, and you kicked the box away and laid back down in bed as your paws gently rubbed your bloated abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your soft moans of pain, James looked away from the television and saw your extremely stuffed form. The wolf couldn't help but smile knowing your evil little plan backfired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...poor baby,\" he cooed. \"Does your tum-tum hurt from all that sugar?\" You threw a pillow at him which he easily dodged. \"I'm actually impressed you ate them all. Those donuts were huge. I've never seen a bear claw the actual size of a bear's claw.\" He got up from the bed and wandered next to you. \"Well, I was going to suggest we go out hunting for work. But I guess you'll have to sit today out because, well...\" The wolf gave your belly a pat which made you moan a little in pain as you weakly nod. \"Then I guess I'll head out on my own. If you're feeling any better, try and find work. The sooner we get a steady flow of cash, the better.\" Again, you nodded weakly and James exited the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep is probably the best option for you. So you rolled over onto your side, feeling the contents of your completely stuff belly shift, and closed your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Tossing the blankets off your nude body, you saw that your swollen belly has shrunk considerably. In its place, however, was a thin layer of soft pudge. No belly, by any means. But your midsection did carry a bit more plushness than it did because.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense,\" you said to yourself while poking and prodding your flabbier abdomen. \"The pizza, the donuts, the fact that I hardly left the bed since yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later and you're standing under in a hot shower, letting the water rinse away the crumbs and sugar left in your fur from this morning. Certain that your fur is free from debris, you unhook the detachable shower head from its handle to give the rest of your body a rinse. Then you hold the shower head so the steaming hot water is directly pointed at your belly which hours ago felt threatening to burst. The hot water felt amazing on your stomach, and your free paw started gently rubbing your midsection. Small circle rubs became wider and wider until you realized your paw was headed pretty far south. Dirty thoughts danced around in your dirty mind, and you got hot and bothered in that hot shower. \"James is gone, and I have the place to myself...\" you thought to yourself. \"Might as well release some stre-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slamming of the door to your hotel room rudely interrupted your thoughts. You sighed in frustration and quickly finished your shower. \"Note to self,\" you thought while drying yourself off. \"Don't get yourself worked up unless you know you're going to be alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a towel wrapped around your waist, you left the bathroom to see James lounging on the bed watching television. You immediately noticed that he was clad only in a new-looking pair of black boxer briefs that he didn't have yesterday, and several shopping bags sat on the floor next to him. You also saw a small roll of fat pouring over the waistband of his underwear. He was munching on a cheese Danish the size of a small dinner plate when he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, feeling better?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, yeah. Any luck finding a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck, oh man I got lucky today,\" James began as you joined him on the bed. \"So, get this. I'm heading back to that bakery I got breakfast from today because I was still a little hungry and <i>someone</i> wouldn't share. So when I got there, the whole place was in panic mode. All the employees were freaking out. Something about all of their oven malfunctioning. As soon as I walked in, the manager grabs my arm and drags me into the back. Here's the thing: All of their electrical equipment was malfunctioning and they needed someone to slip between some of their huge machinery and work some switches on their breaker panel. But, surprise surprise, everyone who works there's is a gigantic fat ass. But me and my slim frame easily fit in there, so I flipped a few switches, dialed a few knobs, and everything's fixed. I'm the hero of the day! The owner personally thanked me and asked if I need anything. I told him what I needed was a job, and the rest is history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's is really lucky. Wait, you know how to bake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. \"No, but they'll train me in a few week. I'll be working in the back doing some physical labor at first. Then their train me in the kitchen, and eventually I work the front. They want another guy there who can really be a jack-of-all-trades. They also gave me a bit of a 'signing bonus', so I was able to pick up some clothes on my way home. Do you realize that we have to go to a specialty store to get some clothes that'll fit around our skinny butts? I had to go to three stores before I found place that sold underwear that fit.\" He snapped the band of this boxers of emphasis. \"Oh, and another benefit of my new job: Dibs on the day-olds!\" James scarfed down the last bits of his Danish and reached for a brown paper bag on the floor beside him. \"Baklava?\" he asked you, holding up a piece the size of your paw. You nodded and he hands it off to you before reaching back in to pulling out a chocolate cake about ten inches in diameter. He pulled off it's plastic cover and starts devouring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like James was in a good place. Now you needed to find a way to make money for yourself. You could ask James if they're hiring at the bakery. But that might be putting all your eggs in one basket. If anything happened, you'd both be out of a job.</span></div></div>",

You rolled over and drifted back off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you and James dressed in the clothes you acquired yesterday and left your hotel room to look for work. As you two dressed, you noticed the distended curve of his belly. Clearly, the wolf was still slightly bloated from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After breakfast!\" said James. \"I can't go job hunting on an empty stomach!\" Feeling a little peckish yourself, you agreed with the wolf. Apparently, your hotel was a few blocks away from a popular bakery. James offered to get breakfast, so you waited from him as you sat on a park bench nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround fifteen minutes later, the grey wolf came back carrying a bright pink box. He placed the box on the bench and sat down opposite to you. James opened it and inside were a dozen large donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\" James said enthusiastically. He reached in and grabbed a maple bar several inches longer and wider than you remember them being. You reached in and took a cruller. The two of you ate in silence, but you couldn't help but be aware of the rate James was scarfing down the donuts. By the time you finished your second one, he was biting into his fifth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we should really take care of what we eat around here,\" you said to James as he shoved the last of his fifth donut into his maw. \"I mean, all we've eaten since we've gotten here are pizza and donuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax,\" replied James. \"Are you worried that you might put on a little weight here? Even if we did, both of us together would still weigh half as much as some of the tubs of lard here.\" He reached into the pink box again and pulled out a bear claw. James held the confectionery up to your nose. \"Now, eat up. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!\" </span></div></div>",

This include unloading deliveries, keeping ingredients stocked, and doing some prep work for the chefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! I call dishwasher!\" James said enthusiastically.  You gave James an odd look. He leaned into you and whispered, \"Given the size of the fatties in this city, I don't expect anything but plates licked clean coming back.\" You understood his logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther turned to you and asked, \"Interested in working in the storeroom, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, work is work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" the panther exclaimed. \"I'm Mark, and I guess I'm your new manager.\" He gave both of your outfits a glance. \"Since you'll be working in the back, there really isn't any sort of dress code so long as you keep yourself clothed. But I suggest spending your first paycheck on something that isn't sweatpants and basketball shorts.\" The panther gestured at your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of first paychecks...\" James injected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get paid cash at the end of each day. I don't normally do this, but consider it a favor for filling it on such a short notice.\" Mark said. \"Now, let's get you to the back and acquainted with everything before the lunch rush hits...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early in the evening when your shift at Di Ravioli's ended. James was already outside the restaurant waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for a day's work,\" said James, holding up a small wad of cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad instead,\" you said, holding up your's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. How was work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Lot's of lifting and I'm on my feet all the time. You won't believe how much mozzarella this place goes through in a day. But at least I might put on a little muscle here.\" You rolled up the sleeve of your skinny arm and flexed a non-existent bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might develop permanently pruned paws working here...\" James whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were the one so eager for the job,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true. And it has some added benefits. Some customer sent back a pizza they complained was burnt. It wasn't; they were just being picky. Anyways, they wanted me to throw the whole thing away. And I did...after snagging a few pieces for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at him. \"Pizza, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hungry! Besides, I'm a growing boy!\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you will be if you stuff yourself full of pizza everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stuck his lounge out at you. \"Anyways, give me some of your cash. Yesterday, I found a store that might sell clothes that actually fit us. We're pretty much the same size, so I'll pick up stuff for the both of us. You go get dinner since I got it yesterday. I think there's a grocery store around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed with the plan and handed James some of your money. The two of you went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, you found the supermarket James mentioned. Wandering up and down the aisles, you looked for what to bring back to your hotel room for dinner. Unfortunately, your options weren't that great since you don't have kitchen to work with. The supermarket sold some pre-made dinner salads and wraps. They also had a full deli that sold the usual: Corn dogs, potato wedges, deep-fried burritos, and chicken strips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that these are pretty much your few options for dinner, it's time to decide what to have. Those salads look good, and it would probably be the healthier choice. James will probably whine about salad for dinner, but you two need something to counter how poorly you two have been eating. On the other hand, maybe today is a day to cut loose a little and splurge on something less healthy. After all, there is reason to celebrate: You and James managed to find a job in a single day.</span></div></div>",

And we can always check in tomorrow if nothing pops up today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true,\" James agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, you two wandered the streets of Zaftig City searching for work. Unfortunately, every single establishment you approached wasn't hiring. You and James were getting worried that the job market was really tight here until you saw a help wanted sign hanging outside of a warehouse. Painted on the side of the building was ZAFTIG CITY METROPOLITAN IMPORT-EXPORT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two entered and saw an open building filled with boxes of various shapes and sizes. Dozens of furs were carrying boxes around, loading them onto trucks, putting new boxes where there was space. Each fur was very beefy with thick pecs and bludging biceps, but all were sporting substantial ball guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only take a few steps in before you hear an intimidating yell. \"HARD HATS AND SAFETY VEST ON AT. ALL. TIMES.\" The voice was from a girthy cheetah who was angrily approaching you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah. We're here because of the help wanted sign outside. Are you hiring?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are? Good,\" the cheetah said. \"We're hiring for a delivery assistant. It's simple. You help load the trucks. You help unload the trucks. Pays cash at the end of the day, and it pays well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A</i> delivery assistant? As in, just one?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just one. The higher ups are complaining about how much is spent on labor, otherwise I'd hire a dozen and a half more people. For now, we're only hiring one because the eggheads upstairs think that we'll have just enough people to meet our quotas. But I don't see them down here working their butts off. We're always barely meeting deadlines. Seriously, I can hire one of you today, right now, just as fast as it can take you to fill out some paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked to you and said, \"It looks like a decent job.

You don't oppose doing hard labor, but you felt that this place doesn't exactly have the best working environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and take it,\" you said to James. \"I'll keep on looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good luck. I guess I'll see you tonight.\" James turned to the cheetah. \"So I'll take the job, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic;\" the cheetah said jovially. He placed a paw around James' shoulder and led him upstairs. \"Okay, let's get you set up with HR. Oh, and we'll get you a hard hat and safety which must be worn at all times...\" The cheetah's voice trailed off as he and James went up to the offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later and your feet are aching from pounding the pavement. Sitting on a park bench, you had taken a break from job hunting. Every single place you went into wasn't hiring. Disappointed and exhausted, you began thinking about where else to look for work when your stomach let out a loud grumble. It was then you realized that you hadn't eaten anything since that morning. You dug into your shorts pocket and found that you had a few bucks on you. No enough for a meal, but maybe a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled that a couple of blocks away was some kind of ice cream place. The old fashioned interior had caught your attention as you walked by. It looked exactly like one of those old timey malt shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some ice cream would cheer me up,\" you thought to yourself as you got back onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice cream shop was empty sans a very overweight zebra wiping down the counter that ran the entire length of the store. Red vinyl booths lined the opposite wall and tables and chairs filling in the space in between. In one of the far corners stood a jukebox; it appreaded to be in working order. Photos of celebrities and musicians from generations ago filled the walls. You could tell that this place was very nostalgia-inducing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, come in!\" the zebra said, gesturing to the empty stool on the opposite side of the counter to him. As you approached, you saw he was wearing white pants with a black belt the former of which clung to his bubble butt and tree trunk-like thighs. You could practically heat the seems of his pants scream as they strain to contain his weight. A tail plump as a sausage hung lazily over his rump. His white button-up shirt was struggling to contain his girth; white and black stripes of fur poked out between the overworked buttons. Two mighty slabs of flab rested on the gargantuan belly. A smile was on his face though it was slightly hampered by his puffed up cheeks. A thick collar of pudge surrounded his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, welcome!\" he said as you sat down on the stool, which you noticed was far wider than expected probably on account of the size of the patrons who come here. \"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the mood for ice cream,\" you said. You looked at the wall behind the zebra but couldn't find a sign or board saying the flavors in stock. \"Umm...what do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra slid a laminated menu over to you which listed all of the flavors. It was a long list, probably over a hundred flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, that's a lot,\" you said. \"How can you have so many flavors in stock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a pretty big freezer in the basement. It's able to store hundreds of flavors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you go down to the basement anytime someone orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. We have a mechanical system that picks out a particular tub and brings it up. Its pretty nifty! I'll show you! Pick a flavor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Chocolate Catastrophe? Nah. I think I want something fruity...um...Bananafana? Maybe...Umm...I think I'll have two scoops of the...ah, Blueberry Kaboom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, good choice!\" said the zebra. \"That's...Number 113, yes? It should say right next to the name.\" You nodded and the zebra punched a couple of digits in a keypad mounted to his side of the counter. Suddenly, you could slightly hear the whirring of machinery coming to underneath, and in a few moments a panel in the counter opened up and out popped a large container of light blue ice cream freckled with plump frozen blueberries. The zebra grabbed a glass bowl from behind him and placed two large scoops in the bowl each the size of softballs. He stuck a spoon into the bowl and slid it over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" you said as you ate a large spoonful of the ice cream. \"Wow! This is really good! I love the blueberries in it! Really gives it a kick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's good. Oddly enough, it's one of the least popular flavors on the menu. I'm not sure why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess everyone else is missing out!\" you said between spoonfuls of ice cream. \"Oh man, I needed this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rough day? he asked as he wiped down the already pristine counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long day, more like it.\" You swallowed another big spoonful. \"I've been on my feet all day looking for work. I, uh, just...moved here, and I need to make some money. But it seems like hardly anyone is hiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra's ears perked up. \"Oh yeah, the job market has been pretty tight recently. What kind of work are you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe even working in, say, an ice cream parlor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing,\" the zebra began. \"During the late afternoons until we close, this place is completely full. I need someone to help do things like clean tables, run orders out, run the dishwasher, pretty much all the other stuff I can't do because I'm too busy behind the counter. I hired this young guy a few weeks ago, but he only shows up half the time and I have the feeling he's probably not going to come in again. If you're reliable and want work, the job is yours. You can even start today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to think. Your job prospects have been pretty dire, and you need a work soon. This is a golden opportunity you don't want to throw away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I'll take it!\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the zebra. \"I'm Jeff, and I guess I'm your new manager! Oh, and...\" The rotund zebra grabbed your now empty bowl and put three more large scoops of Blueberry Kaboom in. \"Consider it a 'signing bonus'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished your ice cream, Jeff put a sign on the door saying \"Be Back In 15\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like it'll matter. This place is dead until the post-dinner rush,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff brought you to the back and got you a uniform: White shirt and slacks with a black belt to match his uniform exactly. Unfortunately, even the smallest size he had in stock was too big. But with safety pins and creativity, Jeff made it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours, the zebra trained you in all your duties just in time for a rush of obese furs. The entire place was packed until closing. You zipped between tables, cleaning them off only to have more furs occupy them again. You made sure Jeff had enough clean bowls and glassses and he served up ice cream and sundaes and milkshakes at a speed that astounded you considering his immense size. The frantic work pace kept until the doors shut. After sticking around to help Jeff with some of the closing responsibilities, he paid you and sent you on your way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow!\" he said, waving a flabby arm in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 10pm when you got back to your hotel room. Crumpled on the floor were James' clothes soaked in the sweat. The grey wolf was laid up in bed moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was the first day of the job?\" you asked James, pulling off your own clothes. Jeff let you store your uniform at the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I'm in so much pain. Every single muscle aches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ice yourself with this.\" From a brown paper bag you had with you, you pulled out a large container of ice cream. Jeff let you take some home with you as a sign of appreciation for your hard work. You tossed the container to the wolf as well as a plastic spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, sweet!\" he said. \"Wait, where do get this from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I landed a pretty nice job at this ice cream place,\" you said.  \"Wages are good, the owner is nice, and I get to bring ice cream home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I feel like I need an ice cream hook-up working at that warehouse.\" James looked at the label on the container. \"Cookie Dough Apocalypse. Huh. Weird name.\" He shrugged, tore off the lid, and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled your own container out from the bag: Blueberry Kaboo. You leaped onto the bed and began eating; the whole thing was gone in few minutes. Pretty soon you were asleep, deep in an ice cream induced coma.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It early in the afternoon when you strolled into the ice cream shop feeling rested and refreshed after a long night of sleep. The store was set to open in about an hour, and Jeff was at his usual spot behind the counter wiping a rag against the immaculate surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" the tubby zebra said. \"Good to see you! Come and sit! What are you having today?\" He gestured to the stool on the opposite side of the counter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I wasn't planning on getting anything,\" you began. \"Besides, it's a bit early for ice cream, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" he said. \"Come pick out a flavor, on the house! What better way to start a long hard day of work than with something sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your shoulders. A little ice cream wouldn't hurt. And if you are going to be working here, knowing what some of the flavors taste like would be helpful. You sat down on the stool and glanced at the menu. \"Umm...Marshmallow Madness sounds good!\" you said after a few moments of glancing through all of the flavors. \"It's number...067.\" Jeff punched the digits into the pad mounted into the counter and, in a few moments, a tub of ice cream appeared from the counter. An off-white concoction with miniature marshmallows frozen in it. The zebra grabbed a glass bowl from behind him and served up three large scoops for you. As you dug into the sickly sweet ice cream, Jeff punched in a few more numbers and a new kind of ice cream appeared. He scooped up a half a dozen scoops into a bowl for himself and waddled over to the stool next to yourself. His fleshy rump spilled over the sides of the seat as he sat down. You could have sworn you heard the stool groan under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind did you get?\" you asked in between bites, eyeing the ice cream in Jeff's bowl. It was white with many streaks of brownish-black rippling throughout. \"Is that some kind of fudge ripple or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's a personal recipe,\" he said. \"I just make it for myself. It's too good to let just anyone have it. 'Ambrosia,' I call it. Wanna try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, you dug your spoon into one of the many lumps of ice cream. A sly grin came across the rotund zebra's face as he watched the ice cream disappear into your awaiting maw. The taste, you realized, wasn't exactly clear. But it wasn't the taste that make this ice cream incredible. The moment it touched your tongue, your entire body is filled with a feeling a euphoria, an excited tingle running from your head to your toes. Your eyes closed in bliss as you savored the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, isn't it?\" Jeff said. You nodded silently. \"You know what? I think you'll enjoy this more than me.\" He slid the bowl over to you. \"Besides, I've had plent-\" But before he could finish his sentence, you were already devouring the small mountain of ice cream. The obese zebra watched in delight as you mindlessly devoured it all in a matter of minutes. Jeff gave you a pat on your back as you licked the bowl clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Jeff said. \"That's enough for now. Change into your uniform, we'll be opening in a few minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several hours at the ice cream shop were just as busy as your first shift yesterday. Perhaps it was even busier. Your day was a blur of rushing around the shop clearing tables and running the dishwasher to make sure Jeff had enough dishes to serve ice cream at the lightning fast pace he was working at. At one point the day, Jeff flagged you down as you were rushing into the back with an arm-load of dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I made a bit of a mistake,\" he said. \"I left it in the back. It'd be a shame if anything went to waste.\" Jeff gave you a wink, though it was obscured by his puffy cheeks. In the back you found a bowl full of Ambrosia that Jeff had scooped up for you. Throughout the next hour, you shoveled mouthfuls of the stuff into your mouth, each spoonful as incredibly blissful as the last. You worked on it throughout your shift, though a few more scoops made it into the bowl every time you though it was almost done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dead on your feet when the last customer left. You spent well over ten hours rushing around all over the place. As you caught your breath while sitting at the counter, Jeff waddled over to the door and turned off the open sign. \"Not a bad day's of work,\" he said was he plodded over to the counter unbuttoning his shirt partly to expose his flabby black-and-white chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah,\" you said. It was bad enough that the place was so busy all day. But because of the ice cream he left out, you were working the entire shift with a belly full of sugar and cream, and now you were feeling slightly nauseous as your full stomach strained the buttons on your uniform. \"I can't wait to get back home and sleep...\" You got back up onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't you want some dessert?\" asked Jeff with a devious look on his face as he punched in some numbers into the digital pad, seconds later a tub of Ambrosia popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you did feel quite full, Ambrosia always sounds amazing. But you've eaten so much ice cream today that you should cut back a bit.</span></div></div>",

He grabbed a clean bowl and began filling it up with more softball-sized scoops of that amazing ice cream. As you take a seat at the counter, the rotund zebra slides the heavy bowl in your direction. Initially, you were unsure if your already tight and full stomach could handle that much more ice cream. But those concerns exited your mind as you shoveled more and more of the heavenly ice cream into your eager maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff took a seat next to you, his rump spilling over the sides of the stool which looked comically small for a but his size. The zebra had made himself an equally large bowl of Ambrosia. \"I hope you don't mind,\" Jeff began as he unbuttoned his tight white button-up shirt, exposing a cascade of soft black and white colored flabby rolls to the cool air of the shop. \"I get a bit sweaty on busy days like this!\" You glanced over to see the zebra's gigantic belly, but you simply gave an dismissive grunt as you focused back on devouring the rest of your bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you finished stuffing the last bit of ice cream into you, you were painfully reminded of how incredibly full you were. You audibly groaned as you rubbed your swollen belly which was now straining the buttons on your shirt and resting on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, having just finished his own ice cream, chuckled at the sight you. \"I guess I shouldn't have tempted you! You look like ill. If you want, you can lay down and rest in one of the booths. I've got plenty of cleaning to do before finally closing up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awoke to find yourself in a room with all white walls and no doors. In the center of the room was a small table and perched on top of it was a bowl with a single scoop of Blueberry Kaboom ice cream and a silver spoon. Cautiously, you walked over and picked up the bowl and spoon. Taking a bite of the frozen treat, your taste buds danced and soon the lone scoop was gone. Suddenly, the bowl, table, and spoon vanished, leaving you very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain erupted from your stomach and you doubled over. Was it the ice cream? Were you poisoned? Are you going to die? These questions raced through your head as the pain dissolved into numbness and that numbness spread out from your stomach out to your entire body. Then, that numbness turned into an intense tingling sensation starting at the tips of your paws and feet. You looked down and saw that your fur, usually a shade of bright red, was now turning light blue, then a deeper blue, then a dark violet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked as you watched your entire body change color, and when the last inch of red fur turned deep violet, a loud groan sounded from your belly. Placing a paw on your stomach, you immediately noticed that the once-flat surface of your stomach was now rapidly rounding out. In a matter of seconds, you looked nine months pregnant. You gave your belly a slap in disbelief and the mass wobbled while you heard loud sloshing inside you. As your belly grew and grew, you could feel your thighs swell up and press against each other, your arms soften, and your tail fighting for room with the ballooning orbs that was now your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you began running around the room to look for a way out. But the added weight was too much for you to carry around, and you collapsed onto your inflating butt exhausted and out of breath. Your blue-furred gut, now the size of a large boulder, forced you onto your back. You struggled to get up, but all that did was make your massive body jiggle uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and your body was entirely spherical. Your arms and hands were swallowed up by your round body, your feet pathetically stuck out, and your neck and cheeks were so swollen that you couldn't even move your head. Your vision was taken up by a vast horizon of blue fur and the white walls which appeared to be getting closer and closer. You felt your right flank press up against one of the walls, then your left flank. You realized you were getting to the size that you were outgrowing the room itself. Whimpering, you felt yourself fill up every single inch of space in the white room yet you were still filling out. Pressure built up, and you were sure that you'd pop any second. Another moment and you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in your bed, covered in sweat. You threw off your blanket and ran into the bathroom. For the next several minutes, you splashed cold water on your face until you felt your heart rate result to normal. Now calm, you reached for a towel to dry off. That was when you noticed it: The very tip of your nose was a shade of blue now instead of its typical red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to panic. The dream felt so real, and now your fur might be turning blue. Is there something wrong with that ice cream Jeff gave you? Are you having some sort of allergic reaction? Should Jeff know about this? Or maybe you're over reacting. Perhaps it best to keep this from Jeff. You don't want him to think that the fox he just hired is insane.</span></div></div>",

Better make sure you have plenty of energy before we're slammed!\" The zebra gestured towards the bowl piled high with ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks...\" you said, giving a half-hearted smile at the Blueberry Kaboom, hoping that your boss wouldn't notice the slight twing of blue on your muzzle. As Jeff scoped himself a huge bowl of ice cream, you sat on the stool, only taking a few nibbles of the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" asked Jeff as he sat down on a stool next to you, his flabby butt hanged over the edges of his seat and you could have sworn you heard it groan under the weight of the quarter ton zebra. In front of him was a bowl full of bright white ice cream with loads of dark ripples in it. It may have been the same flavor he had yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm...\" you stammered. \"I was, uh, hoping to try a different flavor today. That's all.\" It was a lie but a decent one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry! I should have asked what you wanted instead of assuming.

Until then, it'd be a shame if I had to throw out that perfectly good ice cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you grabbed your spoon and dug in.

You were so blue, so big, and only swelling bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ate your ice cream in silence, you tried to figure out what to do. You might be able to pry some information from Jeff about what's in the Blueberry Kaboom. Maybe that will help you figure out what's going on with you.

You should really be thinking forward on how to make this last until you secure an actual source of income. You look over the options for the cheapest snacks. Below all the expensive snacks with the weird numbers, you spot a row of unmarked bars. They look like protein bars, though the brand you haven't heard of, each marked with 'Product of Abis Inc'. However, they are far cheaper than the stuff above. Your stomach growls and you decide it'll have to do, and at 50 cents a bar, it'll hardly put a dent in your limited wallet.  You put in a dollar, and put in the number for one of the Abis bars. It drops into the bottom, and there is a jingle of your change as it drops into the coin slot. You fish it out, and notice there is a gold colored coin in your change. At first glance it looks like a souvenir coin or some sort, so you put it in your pocket and put the next 50 cents in the machine, and get another bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jingle from the coin slot catches you by surprise, and you look to find another of those coins. Looking closer at them, you see 'ABIS PRIZE TOKEN' engraved on the edge. Curiously, you put in another dollar to get your third bar, and check the coins again.  Sure enough, another of those tokens comes out in your change. Maybe this is some sort of promotional gimmick for the company brand? You're not sure what you can use these tokens for. You look over the coin, then the machine looking for some sort of instruction, but you don't really see any type of explanation. It has to have something to do with the machine, so you put the token into the coin slot to see what happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the typical sound of a coin dropping into place, then three stars pop up on the small display that would usually display the price. One star is filled in with two others remain as outline. You put in the second token, and the stars flash again with the second star filled. You think you get it, it's like a 'buy three get something free' type deals. You put in the last token, and the third star lights up. The machine plays a short jingle and you hear something drop into the bottom. You check and fish out a fourth Abis bar, this one with shiny reflective lines on it and 'ABIS PLUS' emblazoned on it. Neat, free stuff. With all your bars, you think about what to do next, should you spread these out? Or are you hungry enough to just eat it all?</span></div></div>",

They are thick and fudge, especially the free prize you got, but you don\u2019t bother much with savoring them since you are so hungry, wanting to alleviate the empty feeling in your stomach as soon as possible. As they slide into your stomach, you feel much more relieved, giving a short sigh of relief before walking away to contemplate your next move. You need a job, and a place to live. Obviously you can\u2019t really afford an apartment or hotel, so a job is the main focus for now. You could probably get a part time job or something at one of the stores along main street, so start heading that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass out of an alley, you huff a little, before a small belch escapes you, and you realize your feeling a little full. You guess those bars were a lot more potent then you realized. You look at the stores along the street, plenty of restaurants. You doubt that you could get a job at one of those fancy places, but a fast food place would be easy to get and solve the short term issue of money. You check the windows for any 'help wanted' signs, and spot one at a Pizza place. That would be perfect, you could probably even get some free pizza if they have left overs at the end of the day. You head over and walk in, and see a lion bent over behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say, and see him rise up, for a moment wondering how the sun was rising inside the store, before realizing that that was merely the lions golden stomach spilling out from under an apron. \"Hey, he says back, \"What can I get you today?\" His face looks friendly enough, with wobbly checks surrounded by a thick mane. You notice a name tag on his shirt, Lionard, and briefly wonder if that was a result of lazy naming, or if it was an intentional play on his species. \"Um... I saw the help sign, I was wondering if the position was still open?\" you ask. Lionard smiles, and you see his sharp teeth for the first time, and suddenly reconsider, wondering if his size was due to eating his employees. \"Oh, I've been hoping for some help for a while. People get really intimidated by me, so I tend to scare off customers and potential employees.\" he says, and you feel a bit bad for thinking the same thing. \"If your interested,\" he continues, \"I'll take you right away, I need someone working the counter while I cook in the back!\" His tone is enthusiastic, and your surprised at the strait forward offer and acceptance. \"Wait,\" you say, a little blindsided, \"Don't you want to ask me any questions, I mean, you don't know anything about me.\" It's an immediate offer, and your not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but generally people at least asked for a name before hiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion laughs a bit, belly shaking, \"I get it, but I've had that up for a year now, and you look trustworthy enough, and quite frankly, I'm too desperate to ask questions. I need a friendly face, and a fox looks far more charming and less intimidating then a sharp toothed lion.\" You have to admit, he has a point, the store looks pretty empty except for a few people in the back, the furthest place from the counter. You can imagine he's struggling to make a profit if he's scaring away everyone. \"So if you want the position, you've got it.\" he says, opening the counter and waving you in, \"We'll get you into a uniform and you can start right now.\" You have to blink a little in surprise. That was much easier then you thought. You step through and he leads you to the staff room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 4 hour shift, in which a number of people come in, and from the Lions reaction, was a drastic increase in the stores productivity, he hands you an envelope. You check inside and find a load of bills, \"Wait, this is far too much for a paycheck,\" you say, surprised. \"Call it an incentive,\" he says, \"This was the best day in I can't remember how long, just keep coming back, and I'll make sure your taken care of.\" he says. \"In fact, here's a special thank you gift just for you,\" he says, and stacks three pizza boxes into your arms. You hardly know what to say, but obviously this seems like a great position. \"Thank you,\" is all you can really say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to change into your cloths, thinking you'll now be able to actually buy some instead of stealing. As you tug up your pants, you have a brief weird feeling. Do they feel a bit... tighter then before? You look in the mirror, turning this way and that. You are thin as a rake... well, at least you thought that was the case, you hadn't really examined yourself in a mirror till now, you look normal, not the malnourished skin and bones as you originally thought you must be. Of course, these are new clothes your not used to, so it must be your imagination. You finish getting dressed and take the pizza, then head out and check into a hotel. Thankfully your 'paycheck' gives you plenty to work with for a while. And hey, you have free dinner to boot, which you have your fill of before you go to bed, ready to go back to your new job the next day...</span></div></div>",

Things go swimmingly, you man the front counter and dish out pizza without incident. Lio even gives you a free slice for lunch. Not much, but good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work, you look for a grocery store, eager to stock your pantry. The first one you find is B&amp;L(Bulk and Large) which seems good enough. The prices are pretty good for a bulk store, allowing you to get almost 3 times the amounts you would have expected. Waiting in line you can't help but notice that the other customers more often hen not seem... uh hum... 'Horizontally challenged'. The guy in front of you is so wide you would not even be able to see the line... if not for the even fatter guy in front of him. You guess some people have moderation issues with the low prices here. When your items are scanned, the cashier offers you a store card, which would save you even more money, which you eagerly sign up for. When you get to your apartment, you stock your shelves and finish off the last of the pizza for dinner. Then you head to bed for the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week seems uneventful, you go to work, now with lunch in tow. The pizza place becomes more popular with you behind the counter, just as Lio expected, and you and he get along just fine as you spend afternoons familiarizing yourself with the area before going home and preparing your dinner from one of the frozen microwave meals you got from the store. Despite being tasty, it doesn't seem particularly filling at times, leading you to sometimes dip into a second one, or top yourself off with some of the snacks.

Work is great and all, but you would get bored with just that. So you go out on the town to see what else you can do in this city. Your explorations into the surrounding area have yielded one thing... people here are really into food. The number of restaurants, grocery stores, and food stalls around here means you can't cross a street without being offered a free sample, not that that is a bad thing. If you had known this beforehand, you wouldn't have been so worried about food, because a free lunch is easy to find. But more evidence of the love of food here is the sheer amount of 'ample' individuals, the store owners who obviously sample their own wares a bit too often, and the customers who are more often than not munching on something as they buy something else to start on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such the most obvious pastimes around here revolve around food. Eating competitions, restaurant sampling, cooking competitions, and other such events are practically plastered on every billboard. Of course, this also seems to mean gyms are sparse, as the calorie enriched denizens seem to indicate. You'll have to be careful if you don't want to end up spoiling your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, aside from this, you find another avenue in which you could spend your energy, as you find a small street of video game stores. Obviously, this doesn't seem as popular as all the food-related events, but it's something that you can easily enjoy. Though not as prevalent, they do have the latest in games and gaming consoles, which cries out to your inner geek as you see they even have virtual reality headsets for sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you seem left with two options, the only question is will you dive into the more prevalent culture, or into the gaming one...</span></div></div>",

You have left over pizza on the side table, so grab that for an easy breakfast, taking a bite as you head to the bathroom. You pass by the mirror to relieve yourself. Something nags you a little as you do your business and flush. You hop in the shower and wash, then dry yourself off and head to the mirror to get yourself ready. It\u2019s only then you realize something is off. As you brush your teeth, you suddenly catch sight of your body. At first you didn\u2019t notice, but them, your hands go to your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not much, but you defiantly manage to cup a double palmful of flesh. Looking over yourself, where yesterday you were skinny, now you defiantly put on a thin layer of pudge. Your not fat, but you defiantly have the physique of a couch potato. Pizza wasn\u2019t that fattening, there\u2019s no way that caused this. Could it? You don\u2019t really have time to investigate further, you need to get to work. You get your cloths and pull it non, noting that this time there is definite tightness, as you struggle to button your pants, with your flesh bulging out as you manage it. Even the shirt feels a little tighter, and you can see the fabric stretching slightly around your middle. Even so, you head to the pizza restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat job,\u201d says Lionard, after another day of increased customers. After replacing him at the counter, it seems his business has started booming, with the store at least half full for most of the day. You are keep busy enough to momentarily forget this morning, at least until lunch time where you hesitate about eating the complimentary slice offered you. Eventually you settle for a slice of veggie thin crust. After work, the events of the morning catch up with you, and you take a quick... tour of the kitchen, just to check on what exactly went into the pizzas. Lio is happy to give you the tour, and goes into detail about every single thing in the kitchen, from ingredients to equipment, to the point that you almost regret suspecting the pizza. It's clear Lio has had no company for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, when you go to get changed, you eyes immediately go for the mirror, as a cold sweat hits you, as you see that once again you look... thicker then before. As you pull on pants, you have to suck it in, the button straining now to contain your stomach which hangs slightly over it, and peaks out from under your shirt. As you head out, Lio hands you another couple boxes of pizza. You try to turn him down, but he is insistent. You stop by the clothing store and by some larger clothing before heading to the hotel. After you eat dinner, you examine yourself in the mirror again, noting your face is looking slightly more pudgy. You think back on what happened, and wonder what was in those bars you ate, which are the only other thing you can think of that may be the cause. Of course you've never heard of Abis Inc, but maybe you should look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at the desk in the hotel room, a laptop chained to the desk as you open it to access the internet. You type in the company name, and immediately come up with a result\" Abis Inc, a nutrition company that manufactures the latest in body satisfaction products. You dig in your pocket for the wrappers of the candy bars you ate. You look at the nutritional information, expecting a high calorie count or something. Surprisingly, there is normal nutritional information. You check over the ingredients, which also seem normal except a few chemicals you don't recognize. Except that is the last one, the free prize you got for the tokens. The list on that one covers the entire back of the bar. Suspicious, you type in 'ABIS PLUS' and hit enter. An ad comes up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you tired of standing out in the big crowd? Feel like no matter what, you can't put on an ounce? Do all your friends call you 'beanpole', 'the skinny one', and 'lightweight'? In Zaftig city, bigger is better, and nothing helps you more then ABIS PLUS.

What hit's home though is 'Formula may be compounded by additional Abis products, use caution when combining.\" You swallow a knot in your throat, wondering what you ate.

You look at yourself in the mirror, just in time for the bottom two shirt buttons to pop off, followed by a snap as the pants button give out as your stomach rolls out over it. You are defiantly fat at this point having ballooned a good three inches at least since this morning. You\u2019ve developed love handles, and your chin is starting to produce a double, with rounded cheeks starting to frame your face and muzzle. You are shocked, did just the pizza at lunch do this? No that didn\u2019t make sense\u2026 wait, you think about what happens when you skip meals, suddenly realizing that not eating can actually make you store fat more easily since your body thinks your starving. Did you make things worse? Hurriedly you change into the next size up, managing to hide the torn uniform in your locket just before Lionard, comes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright\u2026\u201d he says looking you over, looking a little puzzled. \u201cYou should probably lay off the pizza, you look a bit\u2026 bloated. Anyway good job today. You\u2019ve really saved my business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 sure, no problem,\u201d you say, hoping he didn\u2019t decide to check in your locker. You can\u2019t believe you outgrew the uniform after you had already sized up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d you say hurrying towards the door. \u201cWait up,\u201d says Lionard, handing you a pizza box. \u201cI know I just said to lay off, but, I know how difficult it is to stay thin in this city, so maybe I\u2019m being too unreasonable, I don\u2019t want to scare you off or anything.\u201d You then realize your expression of worry could be interpreted as fear, and Lio may be thinking your scared of him. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he says, stacking another two boxes in your hands, \u201cHelp yourself, it\u2019s the least I can do, and it\u2019s not like you're the only big guy here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo really, it\u2019s fine,\u201d you say, but end up taking the pizza anyway, too distracted by your sudden growth to argue all that much. Your trying to figure out what to do, obviously \u2018fasting\u2019 made things worse, so you need to eat regular meals. You change into your regular clothes, which by now won\u2019t fit over your ballooning body, you can barely get your shirt halfway past your gut, and the only thing keeping your pants, too small to button, from falling down is the belt which is now at it\u2019s last hole. But now your getting so fat that you are starting to feel the weight, as you waddle out the door and down the street, huffing with each step. Your stomach growls as the new \u2018work out\u2019 burns your energy. You collapse onto a bench, breathing heavily. Well, you have food, and you need to eat. So you open a box and have a few slices before grunting and getting back up. You head to the clothing store, buying even more clothes, baggy ones this time, before finally giving in and calling down a taxi to drive you to the hotel. When you finally get to your room, you collapse on the couch, the unaccustomed weight exhausting you.  Your stomach growls again, and you feed it with more pizza, several boxes now in the room from the last three days, with plenty to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you settle for bed, you check the mirror once more. A double chin has formed, your arms look thicker, wobbling as you lift them. Your chest has swelled, resting on top your belly, which hangs down to the top of your legs. You lift it in  your hands, feeling it squish in-between. Your thighs look bigger too, and you can feel your rump has swollen out as well. It\u2019s been a couple of days since you had those bars, so this should settle down tomorrow, right?</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t have to guess about wither are any fatter today, you can feel the weight on top of you has you strain to shift your bulk, which wobble on top of you, and see your belly blocking your view of your feet as you grunt to budge it, finally managing to turn and roll out of bed, landing with a loud plop on your front. You push yourself up slowly, not used to the feeling of shifting gravity as your flab shifts it\u2019s position as you manage to get yourself to your feet. you begin making your way to the bathroom, huffing and puffing before you finally lay eyes on the full scope of the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwollen cheeks merge with the tire of flab of your non-existent neck, chins resting between two hills of fur that form your chest that prop up two arms that sag with gravity, but dwarfed by the huge belly that hangs almost to your knees, your legs hugely swollen and rub together as you attempt to carry yourself. You are a blimp of a fox, barely even able to reach over your stomach to reach the faucet and splash water in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are glad you bought the baggy clothing, there is no way you could have hoped to get anything else on, though now it is not so baggy. You struggle to pull on the pants, having to basically lift your stomach as you strain to stuff your lard into each leg, leaving flab hanging over the tops you attempt to contain your rump. Even the baggy shift leave your stomach hanging out underneath it. And just getting dressed leaves you panting like you've run a marathon. If this keeps up, you may not even be able to get out of bed soon. You look at the clock, you need to get to work, and in your condition you may get their late as it is. Then again, you won't be going anywhere if you don't lose some of this flab, or at least do something about carrying it all, a trip to the gym may be more important...</span></div></div>",

And your SURE that the gaining has to stop soon, it can\u2019t possibly be much longer. You think. You mentally reassure yourself that you can make it through this, even if you probably resemble a giant donut more then a fox. The thought makes your stomach grumble, and you realize that you haven\u2019t eaten, and go for the pizza boxes, finding yourself even hungrier today then yesterday, going so far as to finish everything you have left. You really need to get some proper food, the pizza can\u2019t be helping this at all. Still, you manage to fill your stomach before lumbering through the door\u2026 which is starting to feel a little claustrophobia inducing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnused to carrying this weight, you have to stop every feel steps to catch your breath, straining with each footstep, but finally make it to the elevator. The door opens and someone almost runs into you as they exit, as you block a good portion of the door. Embarrassed you step to the side trying to suck in your gut as they sidle by. You ride the elevator down and catch a taxi, knowing you\u2019ll never make it if you attempt to walk to the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get to your job on time, but as you walk through the door, feel a sudden tug at your hips. You look down to see them wedged in the door. \u201cWow\u2026 you really let yourself go.\u201d says the Lion as he spots you struggling to push yourself through, popping free within a few seconds, but red\u2026 redder in the face. \u201cYou were like\u2026. skinny when I hired you three days ago, right?\u201d he questions as he walks over and examines your new physique, as if doubting his memory. He pokes your gut with a finger, the entire digit disappearing not your soft frame. \u201cUm\u2026. yeah, kinda\u2026 ate something that didn\u2019t agree with me.\u201d you say, unable to come up with anything to actually explain any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike an allergic reaction?\u201d asks the lion, \u201cThis looks like a bit more then just a bit of swelling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping it stops soon,\u201d you say truthfully, wondering if this would get you in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m complaining\u2026 nice  not to be the biggest guy working here.\u201d says the lion, as you realize that you\u2019re now wider then he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah,\u201d you said, waddling back towards the staff room, getting an even bigger uniform then yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is even busier then yesterday, with you behind the counter, business have improved greatly, with patrons much more at ease, you catch scant comments about you, how friendly you look compared to the last guy. You can\u2019t help but feel a little guilty. You try to focus on your work, your size is making the area behind the counter feel much more cramped, and you have difficulty with the register as it tends to get slammed shut against your gut before you have put the customers money in, or before you\u2019ve gotten change. And your uniform feels tight, you\u2019re at the largest size the Lion has, and it\u2019s tight around the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch, you\u2019re legs are burning from standing for so long, your feet are sore, and you go to the break room for lunch. A pizza box is on the table, the Lion figuring that a slice just wasn\u2019t going to cut it for you today. You go for a seat and sit\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of bending metal hits your ear as soon as you let your weight down, your rump spilling over the sides, and the chair collapses under you. You fall to the ground, and feel your body deform like a water balloon as it hit the ground. the front button of your shirt pops off on impact, before you fall back, your stomach sloshing on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you ok?\u201d asks the Lion as he rushes in to check on the commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 heh\u2026\u201d you gasp, as you slowly roll off the ruined chair, \u201cJust\u2026. pant\u2026. an accident.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026. you should probably\u2026. not demolish the furniture.\u201d he says, looking somewhat annoyed at the destruction of property. \u201cBe more careful in future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, out of breath, then help clear away the broken chair. You get two more, and carefully position one under each of your sore butt cheeks to distribute the weight more evenly. You never though you would get so big that you take up as much space as two people. And your stomach pokes out of the hole in the front of your shirt as you grab for the pizza, easily devouring the whole thing in your embarrassment and increased appetite before reminding yourself that your supposed to be avoiding gaining any more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, you feel embarrasses as you struggle to get your regular clothes on, feeling like your limbs are sausages you\u2019re trying to stuff into soda straws.  You barely manage, but find your shirt has ridden up on your stomach, and can feel the lions eyes on you as you waddle out. You feel like your face couldn\u2019t get any redder as you wobble with each step, and can feel the floor shaking under your tonnage. You move through the door, and feel your self wedge in-between like this morning, and push to free yourself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly this time, you don\u2019t budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push as hard as you can, at first feeling the frame slide against your fur and clothes, but then suddenly you stop, stuck halfway through. You try to back up, to maybe come at it at a different angle, but your flab bunches up the other way, and you find yourself unable to back out. You push forward with your hands on the frame, while pushing against the floor, but your muscles aren\u2019t strong enough to free yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling, you give up, \u201cHelp!\u201d you yell, hoping that the Lion is still around. You hear footstep behind you before you hear the Lion behind you say \"Sure\u2026</span></div></div>",

Heck, at the rate you've been growing you'll probably be too fat to fit through the door by lunch. You reluctantly give your boss a call, getting his voicemail and leaving a message that your \"condition\" has flared up and you need to take care of it. Then, with nothing else ready to eat, you down a few slices of pizza, convincing yourself that you just need it for fuels and to keep you from entering starvation mode before waddling out the door which is looking particularly confining today. You begin heading to the elevator, then stop, realizing that the situation demands that every chance you have at this point must be made with losing weight in mind, and the elevator... well, not exactly the best way to burn calories. So instead you look for the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd think going down the stairs wouldn't be so difficult, but you've never tried descending stairs with a pudding filled beanbag stuffed under your shirt. You have to grip the railing hard, unable to see around your bulk to where your feet are landing, and feeling your weight shift which each step, each decent like a sudden wave as you body wobbles, threatening your sense of balance as you try to keep yourself toppling forward as your belly pulls you down before bouncing back, your weight shifting to the rear to make you almost sit back. You don't dare sit down in case you can't get back up, or start rolling. All the while your huffing and sweating, your grip feeling slippery, and your heart pounding at the real fear that your legs could give out and send you careening down the stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat feels like an eternity later, you finally reach the 1st floor and waddle out, feeling some small sense of relief for that ordeal to be over, wobbling on shaky legs out the front of the building, trying to start a jog but devolves quickly into a 'power waddle' as you exert yourself, pumping your arms, which sag and bounce like their own individual jello molds, though nothing compared to the massive sacks of flesh decorating the rest of your body. You feel red with embarrassment as you pass by others on the street, wondering what they were thinking about the red water balloon currently bouncing down the street, pulling down on your shirt as it starts riding up from the motion of you heaving your bulk. Finally, you stop, out of breath, and look to see how far you've gone... about a hundred feet from the building. Wheezing in disbelief, you gulp and swallow down hard, feeling your cheeks wobble with the action, before pressing on again. You can't afford to get discouraged, if you give up, you may as well say goodbye to walking at all. Or standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force yourself along one step at a time, swearing that each step feels harder then the last. It very well may be, your probably getting even fatter with whatever metabolism slowing cocktail still running through your system, as you hear your belt creaking against the weight of your stomach. Pulling your shirt down for the umpteenth time, you swear more and more of your stomach rolls are showing. Still, with no other course of action, you plop onward, until you find yourself in another part of the city, drenched in sweat and looking at the first gym you\u2019ve come across. A sigh above the door reads \u201cHusky\u2019s Gym\u2019. You would laugh at that if you weren\u2019t so out of breath. You push through the double doors, thankful that the wide entrance is available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a number of slim and muscular individuals working out on the machines. It looks like a typical gym, and you feel embarrassed looking down at your blob-like features. You don\u2019t see anyone at the counter, so you decide you\u2019ll just get started and sort out the details of a membership whenever they come back. You look at the machines, groaning a little at the treadmills, which you\u2019ve decided you\u2019ve done enough of that just getting here. Maybe some weight lifting. You look at an empty pull down machine, and head towards it, adjusting the knee brace to it\u2019s widest, setting much to your chagrin, before trying to climb into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey hey! What are you doing!\u201d a voice says, just before you can lower your rump into the much smaller seat. You look around to see, surprise to no one, a husky coming from the front. Husky is the right word, though defiantly a weight lifter, his arms are jacked, but sports a round stomach. \u201cUm, just trying to work out?\u201d you say \u201cI intend to join.\u201d The Husky snorts and pushes you off the machine with surprising ease, \u201cNot that, this is is the lightweight room, the machines aren\u2019t built for your physique, you want the pachyderm room in back! You\u2019re about to snap that seat in two!\u201d You feel embarrassed now being confirmed to be comparable to a hippo in stature. \u201cSeriously, you\u2019ve got to be a newbie, everyone else knows that you have to work out by weight class around here. And you are definitely no lightweight.\u201d he pokes you in the stomach, finger sinking in like the worlds biggest stress ball. You hear another creak as he does, and your belt finally snaps, the pressure the straw that broke the camels back, the sound like a gun shot as the buckle flies off, ricocheting against a few machines before the Husky catches it in one hand. \u201cGeez, you overdose on those gaining bars or something?\u201d he says, looking at the belt buckle in disbelief. \u201cMaybe? You say, surprised that the guy would easily guess something like that. \u201cYeah, serious newbie move.\u201d he says, tossing the buckle into a bin across the room. \u201cOk, let\u2019s get you fixed up blubber ball, I\u2019m not rolling you home or anything.\u201d He walks to a door in the back, and you follow. trying not to let your shorts fall down while trying to reach around your massive frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back you seem much large equipment, and appropriately, bigger species. A few elephants lift barbells that are probably bigger then you, which is saying something. But the Husky leads to to a bar, picking out what looks like a shake mix, tosses it into a blender with some ice, and makes a shake, pouring into a cup before sliding it to you. \u201cHere, you\u2019ll need this\u201d he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you ask, not sure about drinking another weight themed product. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExtra strength protein builder.\u201d he says, \u201cUsually I\u2019d say work it off, but that won\u2019t do any good if you max out and can\u2019t move in the next few hours, don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been on the stuff, so I\u2019ll make an exception if your up for it. Or you can just do it the old fashion way, and maybe you\u2019ll be fine. Your choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He said mega protein builder, protein builds muscle, yes, but isn't excess just the same as stuffing yourself with a bunch of meat?. You push it away, \"Uh... I think I'll just stick to old fashion exercise.\" you say. The Husky shrugs. \"Whatever works,\" he says, putting the shake into a mini-fridge behind the bar, as you turn and waddle to one of the oversized exercise machines, adjusting it and the wright and settle yourself into the seat, grabbing at the pull-down bar. You grunt, pulling down hard... and it comes down as you begin your first set, huffing and puffing as you sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later your muscles ache from all the effort you've put in. You would ask for a towel, but your sure nothing is big enough as you look in the mirror against the wall. You've gotten bigger, though not the way you want, looking even rounder and wider. Your stomach was down to your knees this morning, now it covers them, though it's hard to tell as the flesh of your legs makes everything look like it's sagging. Your 'baggy' shirt now looks stretched over your chest like a tube sock, your arms bulging around the sleeves. Embarrassed you try to pull it down over your belly, only to hear a RIIIIP as the fabric tears, the seams at the shoulders splitting, and flesh pushing through like playdough. Wincing you turn to your side, gazing at the massive love handles like the tire of a monster truck. The only positive thing is you don't feel like you're about to collapse, despite all the muscle ache, you think the work out helped, however minutely, though you are famished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle out of the door, slowly heading back toward the apartment building. As you do, you feel an additional rip as the back of your shirt finally gives out, followed shortly by the seams of your pants. A few people stop, and you hear some chuckling as they look at you in amusement. You feel the heat in your wobbling cheeks as you try to reach back to over the hole in your pants, not even managing to stretch past you love handles, the motion only resulting in a further RIIIIP, as several holes tear in your shirt front, turning it into a mesh that bulges of fat poke through. You would run if you could,  but your undulating form can only manage its slow waddle as you head to the nearest clothing store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave feeling no less embarrassed. The man inside informed you they had nothing in your size, suggesting a plus-size store downtown, but never the less helped you find something so you wouldn't go about in next to nothing. The Hawaiian shirt he gave you would probably double as a tent but barely manages to get around your shoulders leaving everything else hanging out. It feels like little more than a cape, but at least is loose enough to where it is not going to rip any time soon. Likewise, the shorts he gives you are elastic, stretchy enough for you to squeeze into, but make your look like an overfilled ice cream cone. You don't have to pay anything, as he says these were donated by a hippo to reuse for fabric. The fact that clothes for a hippo barely fits you now only serves as fuel to the fire of your embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of everything else, by now you are starving, but looking about, all you see is a donut shop. Not the best option for a diet. But then all you have at home is pizza, and you are too tired to even try scouring the city for a healthy restaurant. So donuts or pizza, which should you go for?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then look at Shiron and notice that he's the second biggest wrestler there. The biggest was a green dragon, who by your guess is Master Sikoron himself. You and Shiron approach Sikoron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Sikoron, I brought a new student who wishes to learn the ways of sumo wrestling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, explain to me why you want to become a sumo wrestler small fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see the only thing I can remember at the moment is my name.

Other than that I'm sure that if you train hard you'll be as big and strong as the other wrestlers here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's fill you up little buddy.\" Shiron said as he put his meaty hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then load up your plate with as much food as possible. Shiron, however, grabs three plates of food. Your amazed at how a 850 lb. lion could carry that many plates at a time, especially one on top of his head! Yet Shiron gracefully lowers his plates down in front of him and begins eating like he hasn't eaten in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you able to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean balancing those plates. Lots of training and discipline. Eating isn't the only thing we do here. We also lift weights and do flexibility exercises. The fatter you get the more muscle underneath you want to have. The way we train is to eat two large meals a day, but we skip breakfast and then eat brunch. After that would come sleeping or just relaxing if your not too exhausted. After the nap the cycle repeats again. The overall result is a lot of subcutaneous fat is gained, yet by gaining all that weight a fraction of it winds up being muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Shiron in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a mouthful to take in. Can you clarify that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simply, train, eat, sleep, and repeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes a lot more sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing your plate you couldn't eat another bite. After everyone is done eating you are shown to where you'll be sleeping.

Both seem too engrossed with their shopping to share a minute, let alone money, on a naked fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind a clothing rack, you continue to scope out any other customer who might give you a hand. As your gaze turns towards the back of the store near the fitting rooms, you see the head of a orange kangaroo with chubby cheeks and a thick neck roll of fat peak out from curtain leading to the rooms. He's frantically looking around the store for someone. You and the 'roo make eye contact, and he mouths the words \"Help!\" as he gestures you to the fitting rooms before disappearing behind the curtain again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you sneak your way to the back of the shop and slip behind the curtain which leads to a hall of stalls for patrons to try on their clothes. The 'roo is nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" you ask out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" said a voice. A pudgy hand with sausage-like fingers opens up the door to a stall at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the stall, you see the kangaroo that beckoned you. He seems to take up most of the space in the stall. Easily over five hundred pounds, the 'roo is naked from the waist up. A hefty moobs sit on his sizable cream-colored belly. But from the waist down, the guy was gigantic even for Zaftig City standards. Each thigh was so big you were unsure you unsure you could wrap your arms around just one of them. His tail was just as plump; you never thought a tail could get as fat as his. But the 'roo's rump was absolutely massive. It was as if someone had stuck a pair of beach balls filled with pudding onto the beside of a moderately chubby 'roo. Yet his bottom half was covered up by a pair of suit pants that looked skin-tight on him even though they were unbuttoned and unzipped. The poor guy might as well have been stuffed into a sausage casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help!\" the 'roo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...with what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get this off of me!\" he said while gesturing towards the pants he was currently stuffed into. \"Preferably without destroying them! The manager will be furious with me if he sees that I ripped apart another pair of pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, alright,\" you say. \"How exactly can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" he said. The 'roo used both hands pressed against his lovehandles which were flowing over the top of his pants. \"See if you can pull them down, if even just a little bit!\" You position yourself behind the orange kangaroo. Grabbing both sides of the pants, you are able to shimmy them down a couple of inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said the 'roo. \"Let's keep going!\" Using both hands, he pressed against the flab on his right flank enough for you to pull down the pants another inch or two. The same process is repeated on the left side. After a couple of minutes, you get the pants down to the point where you can start seeing his buttcrack. Squeezing the right upper part of his buttock, you yank down his pants a couple of inches and the 'roo lets go to work on the left side letting soft doughy fat spill over the top of his pants. Inch by inch, more of the 'roo's gigantic butt is freed. Seeing his rump released from the confines of those pants was like watching a marshmallow expand in the microwave, and you wonder how he was able to stuff himself inside these in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten more minutes of hard work, the 'roo's rump is free. You hear the kangaroo sigh in relief as you marvel at the two massive jiggly orange globes in front of you. Perfectly round, not a trace of cellulite on them, and they looked as if they were soft as a cloud. You have to resist the urge to reach out and see just how far your paw will sink into one of those plump orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the task is simple by comparison, and soon the 'roo's bottom half is just as bare as your's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, man. Thanks a million. Seriously, I couldn't have gotten these things off without your help.\" said the kangaroo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you said. \"I was amazed you could get those on you by yourself in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really wanted to make them fit,\" said the 'roo. \"They were the biggest size the store carried, and I need some dress pants for a formal work occasion soon and I didn't want to have to order them online or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? They don't carry your size?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in pants,\" he replies. \"Shirts are fine, but they don't carry the size of pants I need because...well...\" He gestured to his humongous butt. \"I'm a bit thicker in some areas. I'm Devon, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two shake paws. \"Nice to meet you. Hey, Devon, can I ask you a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I owe you one anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Umm, I need some clothes. Don't ask why. Is there any chance you can get me something to wear from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, no problem!\" said Devon. \"I was going to ask why you weren't wearing anything when you came in, but I guessed that I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Speaking of which, I better cover this back up with I'm going to buy you something to wear,\" he said while patting his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've pretty much already seen everything, but I guess not everyone is keen to see a big ol' 'roo butt,\" you say jokingly. Devon puts back on his stretchy red basketball shorts that cling to him tightly and a tank top that just covers his belly. He squeezes past you and waddles back onto the sales floor as you watch his huge ass wobble and shake with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of waiting in the fitting room, Devon comes back with a shopping back in tow. \"Here, they're the smallest sizes I could find. And they're not exactly fashionable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up the bag to fit a white shirt and blue jeans. \"No worries,\" you said. \"I'm more concerned with just covering up.\" The white shirt hangs loosely off of you, and the jeans are far too large for you. Luckily, Devon was considerate enough to get you a belt for them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky skinny fox, able to get clothes that fit him!\" Devon joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue out at him. \"Sorry that I don't pack as much in the butt department as you do.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, do you want to get something to eat? My treat. It looks like you've been starved for months anyways.\"</span></div></div>",

You gaze out a nearby window while you wait on the 'roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a heavily laden plastic tray slamming down on your table startles you. Dozens and dozens of foil-wrapped burritos are carefully piled on top of it. Your mouth waters as you can smell the seasoned beef through the wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're pretty quick today!\" said Devon as he drags over another chair from an empty table nearby. He carefully positions the two chairs before plopping down to sit, each cheek of Devon's expansive butt practically engulfing its respective chair. \"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a burrito, unwrap it from its foil, and take a large bite. Perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of cheese, a great blend of beans, the burrito was simply amazing. A few more eager bites and it's gone. You reach for another and swallow that one just as fast. Then another and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon is helping take on the mountain of burritos. A quick glance over and you see the 'roo has a burrito in each hand, alternating bites. He's easily able to eat the things twice as fast as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere ten minutes later and that pile of burritos is no more. You lost count of how many you had after ten; Devon didn't seem to bother counter at all. The table is covered in discarded foil wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, feeling a tad uncomfortably full but nevertheless satisfied and glad you got a decent meal in you. You give the distinct curve of your stuffed belly a rub with your paw to sooth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon, too, is rubbing his gut, a paw under his tank top caressing the dome of his gut. \"That was pretty good. Ready for Round 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round 2? You mean more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course.\" said Devon. \"I can easily eat what we just ate on my own. I do it pretty often actually.

Sure, you might be able to handle a little more, but feel like you're close to your absolute limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, suit yourself,\" said Devon as he pushed himself away from the table. The two chairs supporting his girth screeched against the floor. \"I'm getting some more then. I had a light breakfast after all,\" he said getting onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I only had time to eat a half dozen doughnuts this morning. Serves me right for oversleeping, I guess. Better not do that again. Breakfast is the most important meal, after all.\" Devon gave you a wink as he waddled back to the front counter of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like every meal is the most important meal for you,\" you say under your breath as you look over your shoulder and watch Devon's well-padded haunches jiggle and wobble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a courteous guest, you decide to clean off the table while you wait for Devon to return. You crumple up the foil wrappers littering your table onto the tray and walk it over to one of the garbage cans. As you dump your trash, you notice your paws are stained with sauce. So, you head over to the bathroom and wash up. Before you leave, you lift up your shirt to see the damage lunch has done to you. Your white-furred stomach, once flat, now is considerably convex, no doubt because of how bloated you are on burritos. It's nothing compared to Devon, let alone many of the big-bellied furs you've seen in this city. But you figure you'll deflate back down once lunch is digested. You give your stuffed midsection a quick rub before pulling down your shirt and exiting the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come back to your table, Devon has already returned with the second half of his lunch. Quesadillas are stacked one atop another on a tray, each filled with gooey cheese and various meat like pork and chicken and steak. As you sit back down, Devon is taking an entire quesadilla, folding it in half, and devoring it like a slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in awe as the heavy kangaroo sucks down quesadilla after quesadilla. Your silent stares catch Devon's attention, and he coyly smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....God, these are so good!\" he says melodramatically. \"Ah, absolutely delicious!\" He takes a massive bite out of the quesadilla he's holding and slowly chews it, occasionally giving off an exaggerated moan of pleasure. More bites, more moans, and the quesadilla is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon picks up another one off the tray. \"Steak! These are my favorite! They smell so delicious.\" He holds a steaming quesadilla up to your nose. \"Doesn't it smell great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a whiff and the 'roo was right. That smell alone got your mouth watering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon quickly pulled the quesadilla away and chowed it down in a few bites. His already rounded cheeks bludged out considerably as he chewed in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really missing out, foxy!\" he said after swallowing. \"But I get it, skiny guys like you can only eat so little.\" He grabbed another from the pile in front on him. \"Too bad. More for me then.\" He gave you another wink before folding that quesadilla in half a biting deeply into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch Devon eat and eat, he continues to tease you. While your stomach is telling you that you're really full, your brain is making you want even more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon sees the conflict in your face and decides to strike. He hold up another quesadilla to your muzzle, chicken, this time. A devious smile is on his face. \"Don't you want a bite? Just one? Just a taste?\" </span></div></div>",

Just one bite...\" His meaty hand waved the quesadilla an inch from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeduced by the allure of gooey cheese and greasy meat, you tilt your head forward and open your mouth wide. Before you can bite, the 'roo shoves as much of the quesadilla into your mouth as he can. This catches you off guard. Yet to your surprise, you don't find yourself gagging or spitting it out. Rather, you find yourself mechanically chewing it up. The 'roo continued pushing the quesadilla into your eager mouth. Your body filled with a mixture of lust and excitement that peaked when you felt Devon's thick paw against your muzzle, forcing the last bit into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" said Devon as he watched you struggle to chew all that food. \"Just one bite wouldn't hurt!\" You try shooting him a look though it's hard for you to do with your comically full cheek bludging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, you managed to swallow down the last little bit, adding more pressure into your already packed gut. Rubbing your distended belly, you give out a slight moan of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, warn me before you try to choke me with a quesadilla,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the surprise made it so much fun!\" replied Devon. \"Besides, it didn't look like you hated it very much.\" That was true. It felt slightly thrilling, the feeling of being made to eat, the idea that a grossly overweight fur is stuffing grease and fat into your maw, being unconformably full yet forced to devour more. You feel the rush of blood to your cheeks and try to change the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, at least I can handle all that,\" you retorted. \"I haven't seen you do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon nonchalantly reached over to over of the last quesadillas on the tray. He expertly folded it, folded it once more, and shoved the entire thing into his greedy mouth. A few seconds of chewing later and he swallowed the mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you were saying?\" Devon asked coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, I should have guess you could do that,\" you jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice makes perfect,\" said Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I should practice more,\" you said back to Devon while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we should do this again sometime,\" Devon suggested. He raised him arms up to stretch, causing his tank top is rise up exposing a couple of inches of his furry belly. \"I gotta get home so I can nap this off.\" The 'roo gave his bloated stomach a light tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nap sounds so good right now,\" you said. \"Maybe I can find a park bench or somewhere to lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the kangaroo asks. You go to explain how you ended up in this city. Waking up naked in the park, with memory of what happened to you, no money, no clothes, and no place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's bizarre.\" Devon says. \"If you need a place to stay, I got an open room in my apartment. My roommate moved out last month and I haven't found anyone who wants it. He even left some things like his old bed and a dresser, so you won't need to go out and buy those. I won't make you pay for rent at first; I don't need it that bad. It'll give you a place to live while you get on your feet. What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

In only minutes, another tray was emptied. The 'roo smiled in satisfaction as one of his greasy paws slipped under his tank top and started gently massaging his stuffed belly. Again, to be courteous, you cleaned up the table and returned the tray while the orange kangaroo groaning slightly while digesting his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you doing alright?\" you asked the 'roo. \"I hope you didn't overeat or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine.\" replied Devon. \"I've eaten way more before. I probably just ate a bit too quickly. I tend to eat really fast when I try to impress a guy.\" The 'roo gave you a wink, and you blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly did impress me,\" you said. \"I just wished you didn't have to impress me in a way that gave you indigestion or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I think I'll be fine,\" Devon assured you. \"Especially when I get home. Ice cream always soothes my stomach and I have a ton of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow, that does not surprise me...\" you said teasing the 'roo. He stuck his tongue out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but would enough ice cream to fill full an entire freezer surprise you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An entire freezer? How did you end up with so much? Got a sweet tooth on a shopping spree or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" began Devon. \"A friend of mine works in management for one of the grocery chains in town. He gave me a hot tip that one of the stores nearby me was shutting down completely for renovations. They're gutting the store, so they need to get rid of everything absolutely everything. I found out what day they were going to slash prices and made sure I was the first fur there when they opened in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, guess it pays to have friends in high places.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it does!\" the 'roo said enthusiastically. \"Say, do you want to come over for dessert? Ice cream, specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are still a bit full from your meal, a bowl of ice cream does sound nice. And you'll probably have room in your stomach by the time you reach Devon's place. On the other hand, it seems like you have spent most of the day with this 'roo, and there is so much for you to do. You need money, some place to stay, and (hopefully) answers as to why you ended up here in the first place. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour later and you're sat down on a couch in Devon's living room. Mounted to the wall across from you is easily the largest television screen you have ever seen. Remote in hand, you flipped through the channels searching for anything interesting. You landed on \"Watchin' 'em Go!\" which appeared to be some kind of dance-themed reality show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to your right, you saw two considerable dents in the couch cushions that were sunk a couple of inches lower than the cushion you were sat upon. \"Probably Devon's spot...\" you thought to yourself. Each indentation looked roughly the size of a particular rotunded 'roo's buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of ice cream do you want?\" Devon yelled from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, what kind do you have?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots! Just name a flavor, I probably have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself for a moment and decided to just go for a classic. \"Strawberry!\" you yelled back. A few minutes later, Devon waddled out of the kitchen with a carton of ice cream in one paw and a spoon in the other. His vast, cream-colored belly shimmied and wobble as the overfed kangaroo lumbered through his apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon had stripped off his stretchy shorts and tank top the moment he walked back into his home, tossing them onto the living room floor. \"Just making myself at home! Besides, it's nothing you haven't seen already.\" It was true. After all, it was only hours ago that your face was inches away from his globular rump in that changing room. \"Feel free to make yourself at home, too.\" That why your outfit laid on the floor next to Devon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" said the 'roo. You took the carton of ice cream and spoon from his, and he turned around to get some ice cream for himself. You admired his spherical, hefty butt and plump tail as he plodded away. When he invited you over, you were thinking you'd just have a bowl or two of ice cream but not an entire carton. Upon further reflection, you realized that was a silly idea. A fur the size of Devon probably stopped bothering with bowls a couple of hundred pounds ago. Tearing open the carton, you began eating the treat while watching the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo returned to the living room a couple of minutes later with a carton of ice cream of his own. Positioning himself just right, the fur lowered his weight right into the butt-shaped indent in the couch. Devon open his carton of ice cream and started wolfing it down. You glanced over to see what flavor he picked: Chocolate Catastrophe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're a third of the way through the carton, you started feeling full again. Devon, on the other hand, was just about finished with his. He was scraping his spoon against the walls of the container getting any and all of the remained ice cream. When the spoon was no longer helpful, he lifted the carton to his muzzle. The liquid remains of the ice cream dripped into his mouth although a couple of drops landed on his flabby chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of pleasure, the 'roo tossed the empty carton and spoon onto the coffee table. He looked over and noticed you were no longer eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with the ice cream?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's actually really good. I'm just getting full again. I guess I'm not used to eating an entire carton of ice cream!\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't if you quit halfway through!\" said Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quitting! I'm just...taking a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, skinny,\" teased Devon. \"Just admit your tiny tummy can't handle a little ice cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it can! Some of us just can't inhale ice cream like you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuses, excuses...\" The 'roo continued to taunt you as he heaved himself off of the couch. \"You know what? I think I'll go for seconds! Gosh, I can fit so much delicious ice cream in <i>my</i> belly!\" He gave his vast gut a slap before waddling back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Devon came back several minutes later, he brought with him a carton of birthday cake flavored ice cream and another clean spoon. He was greeted by the sight of you digging back into your ice cream, struggling to get more and more of the strawberry treat into your already distended belly. The 'roo smirked to himself as he sat back down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to tell you that I'm a bit of a bad influence,\" he said as he stuck his spoon into the carton.  You ignored him as you just wanted to focus on showing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround fifteen minutes later, your carton of ice cream was finished. Tossing the empty carton onto the coffee table, you leaned back into the couch, your paw rubbing your incredibly swollen belly. Your once-flat abdomen now looked like a red furry basketball. Devon finished his second carton shortly after you. He, too, tossed his empty carton on the table and gave his enormous belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'roo looked over and admired your bloated state. \"Hey foxy, I guess you can eat an entire carton of ice cream!\" said Devon. You said nothing back but rather gave a moan of pain. The 'roo grabbed the television remote and changed the channel. \"Let me have that. I think Channel 77 is playing Knives of Justice 2!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were far too tired to watch the movie, and a couple of minutes in, you closed your eyes and fell asleep with your paws resting on your balloon-like belly. </span></div></div>",

You gave the new roll of fat a poke  and watched your midsection jiggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to your right, you saw that Devon wasn't there. You placed a paw on one of the indents in the sofa caused by the massive 'roo's weight. The couch was still slightly warm; he must have gotten up recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard grunts and groans. You looked over your shoulder and down the hallway of the apartment. At the end of the hall, a door was open ajar and a slice of light poured into the hallway. You guessed it was the kangaroo's bedroom. Another grunt and groan echoed down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Devon in trouble? Does he need your help? If he needed your help, then he probably would have yelled for you. </span></div></div>",

Step by step, you made it closer to Devon's bedroom. As you got closer, you heard a quite hissing noise followed by an obvious grunt of pain. Inches away from the door to the bedroom, you peaked your head forward and looked in from the slightly opened door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of agony was on the kangaroo's face joined by an occasional aching wince. The source of Devon's pain was obvious. His belly, loose and flabby hours ago, was now entirely spherical and looked tight as a drum. It appeared like Devon had devoured half of a grocery store, or ate a feast meant for half a dozen furs, or as if he consumed his entire freezer of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Devon blew up like a balloon,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize how accurate that statement was. In front of the massively bloated 'roo was a large bicycle pump; its plunger was halfway down. From the base of the pump, a thin black tube run along the floor over to the kangaroo's backside, where it disappeared between the two furry orange globes of fat. Devon took a deep breath and pressed the plunger all the way down. Another groan bellowed from the 'roo and you swore you saw his already expanded stomach grow ever so slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon's face expressed intense concentration for a minute before he sighed. \"Okay, that's good for tonight...\" he quietly said. The 'roo reached behind him and yanked on the black tube. You had to hold your mouth closed to keep from laughing as the longest fart you've ever heard in your life erupted from Devon's vast ass. As air escaped, the 'roo's stomach deflated and eventually returned to roughly the size it was last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo smiled in relief and took a few deep breaths. Your heart sank when he gaze turned in your direction. \"Are you there, foxy?\" he asked. You panicked, paralyzed with fear. \"Oh, you can come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously walked into Devon's bedroom, embarrassed that you got caught peaking on him. \"I'm sorry! I woke up and heard something and thought you might be in trouble or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries. Thanks for checking up on me,\" Devon said reassuringly. \"Umm...I guess you're probably wondering what I was doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Seriously, you looked huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Devon gave his deflated belly a pat. \"Then I suppose that means I'm doing something right! I was just forcing lots of air into my belly. It's pretty simple. You just stick the hole...in you...then pump away. When you feel ready to burst, hold for as long as you can. When you can't stand it any more, yank out the tube. It's a way of increasing you're stomach capacity. I started doing it a few months ago, and I can eat way more than I used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now you can eat several cartons of ice cream in one sitting?\" you said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you put it that way, it sounds like something you really need,\" replied Devon with a naughty smirk on his face. \"Want to give it a try?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He raised up the plunger of the bicycle pump and very slowly pressed. Deep inside you felt air rushing into you, although nothing much had changed visibly. It was only until Devon got to the sixth or seventh pump that you started to see your midsection fill up, a ever-so-slight curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing alright, foxy?\" Devon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I feel perfectly fine!\" you replied. The 'roo smiled and went back to pumping at a slow yet methodical pace. With each pump, your stomach bloated out more and more. And while more air filled your belly, there was no pain at all. You placed your paw onto your belly and felt the skin underneath groan and stretch with each pump of air. In about ten minutes, your previously somewhat-flat abdomen was now heavily distended. It appear as if you were carrying around an overinflated basketball under your fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon stopped pumping and waddled over to you. He put a meaty paw on your stomach and gently rubbed. \"Wow, when's the baby due, sir?\" he jested. You gave one of his sagging moobs a pinch. \"Ouch! Alright, I think you've had enough for now. I don't want to blow you up or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you did feel pretty big, you didn't feel any pain at all.

It made a dull thud much like the sound of a rubber ball bouncing off a hard surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm not in pain or anything! It doesn't hurt at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? This is your first time, right? The first time I pumped up, I felt ready to explode after only a couple of minutes. And my stomach could already handle a lot. But you're so skinny! How are swelling up like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous much?\" you asked slyly while seductively running a paw along the curve of your gut. \"I guess it's my turn to impress you this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over yourself,\" the 'roo said back. \"You saw how enormous I can get! Way bigger than you are now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll never see how enormous <i>I</i> can get if you don't get back over there and keep pumping!\" you shot back at the 'roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright,\" said Devon as he waddled back over to the bicycle pump. \"But we're going really slow. And I want you to tell me the moment you feel any pain so I'll stop. I haven't popped a fox before, and I don't want to start today. You waved your paw dismissively as Devon raised the plunger. Bit by bit the plunger lower as you watch your tight, round belly swell a little bit and a little more until the plunger was fully presed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I keep going?\" asked Devin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Just keep pumping until I say stop,\" you barked. The 'roo went back to pumping at a slow but methodical pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>pump pump pump</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly stuck out yet another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>pump pump pump</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan from you stomach as it get further stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>pump pump pump</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down and realized you could no longer see your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>pump pump pump pump </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and focused on the feeling of growing bigger and bigger, essentially filling up like a balloon. You felt yourself swelling, ever so slightly, your stomach pressing outward taking up more and more space. Your paws rested on your belly and were spread farther and farther apart as more air is forced into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I'm stopping here,\" asserted Devon. You snapped out for your trance-like state. Your gut, which was moments ago the size of a basketball, now was comparable to a overinflated beach ball. Shocked, you run your paws against the vast expanse and now is your midsection. Due to the sheer enormity of your gut, you can't even reach the most distant parts of your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon approached you again and touched your belly to see if it was real. \"Wow...\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think I could get this big, huh,\" you said teasing the 'roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Honestly, no.\" His eyes were glued to your extremely bloated stomach. One of Devon's paws was conveniently caressing the underside of your globular belly that was beyond your reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how much the 'roo was enjoying your inflated form, you stepped towards him, your tight spherical belly pressed against his flabby abdomen. Devon smiled as he bumped his belly upon yours, his girth forcing you back a step. You chuckled and bounced your gut on his again. Once more, the 'roo checked you with his stomach. This time, you we're almost knocked off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair! You're way bigger than me....for now.\" You glanced over Devon's shoulder at the bicycle pump, its tube still in your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Devon a second to catch on to what you were getting at. \"O-oh, oh no,\" he stammered. \"Serious, that's enough for day. It's amazing how round you've got, but we can't keep going. I don't care if you aren't feeling any discomfort. We need to deflate you, not inflate you more. Maybe we can try blowing you up a little bigger tomorrow or something. I think you need to let you stomach rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Devon was right. You shouldn't push your luck. It's a miracle you didn't burst already. However, you feel perfectly fine. So what if Devon wants you to stop? You know you can handle going even bigger.</span></div></div>",

But nothing was leaving your bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....nothing's happening,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Let me see if I can help.\" Once again, the 'roo laid a meaty paw on your rounded stomach. He pressed down hard, yet none of the air was escaping your swollen midsection. Using both paws, he squished your belly once more. Again, nothing left your stomach; it returned to its dome-like shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, has this ever happened to you?\" A slight tone of concern was on your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it hasn't,\" said Devon. \"But let's not get too freaked out here.

Maybe another time, then.\" Devon grabbed the bicycle pump and placed it back into his closet. He then yawned loudly and looked over at the digital clock on his nightstand. It read 2:09am. \"Oh, man. I didn't realized it was this late. I think we need to get to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling pretty tired too having been abruptly woken up in the middle of the night. \"Yeah, I better get back to the couch then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The couch? Nonsense,\" replied Devon. \"Why don't you bunk with me tonight? You're my guest and you shouldn't have to sleep on the couch. Besides, I feel bad about waking you up in the middle of the night because of my...well...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over to the 'roo's bed, you wondered if it could fit the both of you. \"Okay, if you're offering,\" you said. \"Just hope there's room in there for the both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon chuckled again. \"I think there is. Now, go ahead and hop in. I'll be a minute. I just want to make sure everything is turned off and locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Devon left his bedroom, you leaped onto the right side the bed close to the edge to make sure the obese 'roo have enough room. After of a couple of minutes, he returned, shutting his bedroom door. The 'roo plodded to the left side of the bed, slowly lowering his vast rump onto the edge of the bed. The frame creaked under his weight. Devon then swung his legs up while rolling onto his back. Due to the sheer weight of the fur, the mattress sunk deeply. The depression was so deep it surprised you as you suddenly found yourself rolling into Devon, your scrawny body colliding with him. His soft flab oscillated briefly from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I guess I didn't take that into consideration...\" said Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'll just...\" you tried rolling back over to your edge of the bed. But each time, gravity forced you back into the 'roo, each time bouncing off of his pudgy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't really mind,\" said Devon as he laid an arm around your shoulder, gently pulling you closer to his pillow torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't mind...\" you cuddled against the 'roo's body. Using his pudgy arm as a pillow, you rested your head against his moob as your arm draped across his belly. Within minutes, you were deeply asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke the next morning to the sight of the rolls and rolls on Devon's back as he laid on his side away from you. Hearing the giant 'roo snore, you quietly yawned and stretched out. Daylight poured in from the nearby window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Devon has been so nice to me,\" you thought to yourself. \"Maybe I should do something nice for him. Breakfast in bed?\" Your eyes glanced lower on the 'roos body. You were greeted by the sight of the two orange globs of fat that made up Devon's backside. Gently placing a paw on his rump, you grew excited watching your paw sink into his plushy rear. Suddenly, you remembered the night before and the bicycle pump. \"Or maybe Devon would appreciate waking up to something else in his belly...\"</span></div></div>",

Slightly shaking your head in frustration you turn but as you do you feel a hand grab your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up revealed it to be the kind lioness from before. Her face then took on a more serious look. I must warn you about this place because i believe you feel a bit uneasy being here, Amy Says in a matter-of-fact tone. Your ears perk up in attention before nodding your head in understanding. Well to put it plainly this ENTIRE city is dedicated to both the celebration of fat and getting fatter... whether you want to or not. But that's not all, there are many furs more than happy to \"help\" you get to a bigger size in dozens of ways. How big is at times better left unsaid. Its a kind of a unspoken law in this area. The slim are practically second class citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your dread she adds quickly that there are some furs who believe in freedom of choice or are much more gentle about spreading the weight around which she is a member in the same group. I may like heft but i prefer \"willing victims\" if that makes sense. Listen i can't help you right now but i could direct you to a trustworthy co-workers of mine. Okay there is a big German Shepard with dark blue eye's his name is Adam, he is a real sweet heart and if anyone could help you its him, plus he is the manager. He should be near or in the employee's lounge, which is in that direction she said pointing to her right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give the lioness a quick handshake and thank her before going off on your way.. for only about 12 steps.Wait!

She is even in charge of the fattening squad of this district ,She is a Sliver fox with bright green eyes and maybe a few inches taller than you. If you see her stay away from her.

You watch the chair, convinced the metallic creaking was a death knell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, it holds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam scritches his exposed flesh.

A heaving middle that scrapes the floor, doughy chest rolls that sag over the sides of his belly, a neck too fat to be recognized as nothing more than a stack of chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, hearty laugh shakes you from the fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, sorry I'm staring again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not offended.\" He smiles.

He wanted to hear it. And you wanted to say it. You didn't. Instead you horked down the remainder of your food to keep your mouth busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you come to it on your own time then.\" He said. \"I think we're off to a good start, you and I.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans over the table as best his gut lets him as he prods your distended middle. You groan as a belch forces its way up. You blush and rub your temples as the two of you relax there in the associate break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looks to a digital clock hanging from the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'bout time for me to get off lunch and get back to work. I think I spent more time watching you than actually eating. God I'm going to lose my figure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're not leaving me here alone are you? What about that Beth person...\" You say, trying best not to whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy should be getting off her shift pretty soon. I take it you've got no place to stay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be correct.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Just tell Amy to bring you by my place, and I'll meet you as soon as I get off work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam tucked his shirt back in to the best of his ability and smoothed out any wrinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Adam...just one thing before you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot?\" He smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why help me? I don't have anything to pay you back with, and you don't even know who I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I wouldn't even be a fifth of the dog I am today if not for a little help I got when I first moved here. Hang in there. Amy will be here soon. See you after work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pat your shoulder and shuffled past you. You got a good look at him from behind: his khakis cupped his posterior into perfectly round shapes. It was mesmerizing to watch all of him move at once. Your stray hand pat your belly, wondering how long before you started looking like him. You tried your best to imagine it. What shape you'd actually be, how heavy you would get, all that jazz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed your lack of imagination -- all you could do is see yourself with Adam's physique. Then again, part of you hoped you won that genetic lottery. He was a lucky guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes while you relax, a few workers shuffle in and out, until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A light pat on your shoulder pulls you out of your aimless thoughts. You look up to see Amy smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like you're doing a little better,\" she says. You nod. \"Anyways, Adam told me he got you a place to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, yeah, that's right.\" You scratch behind one of your ears. Hey, that feels kinda nice. \"Um, Adam told me to ask you to take him to his place. Is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There's a subtle shift in her smile, but you can't quite tell what said shift is. \"Sure, I can do that. Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a mumbled \"Yeah,\" you get up--which isn't so easy thanks to your stuffed gut--and quietly follow Amy out of the employee's lounge. The sight of the store confuses you for a moment, but then you remember it's a clothing store. Being around Adam and that enticing bakery-like smell of his must have made you forget that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While you're better off than before, you can't say you feel all that comfortable wearing nothing but an over-sized shirt. It hides your gut pretty well, but based on what Amy told you earlier, that doesn't exactly help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have some questions you really want to ask, but something tells you not to ask them out in public. Paranoia, perhaps. Of course, it's hard not to feel that way in an unfamiliar city with no memories except your name. Honestly, the questions you want to ask most are the ones nobody's likely to have an answer for. As tempting as it is to dwell on all this, you really don't want to with people like that Beth lady around. Not until you know you're safe, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It doesn't take long for the two of you to reach Amy's car. You have no idea how to classify it aside from big, white, and expensive-looking. Still silent, you get in and buckle up. Everything looks clean up front; either it's a new car, or Amy just really cares about keeping it clean. Regardless, you don't pay it much thought and turn to stare out the window. Wow. Turns out big cars is the norm here. Not surprising, but still quite the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you think you'll be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The question is asked with such a low voice (not to mention the suddenness) that you don't register it at first. Once you do, you look over at Amy, concern in her eyes. The veil of gloom over you lifts slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...think so,\" you reply slowly. \"Adam seems like a guy I can trust.\" After a pause, you quickly add, \"And you too, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy giggles and begins to pull out of the parking spot. \"You've already taken a liking to him, I see.\" You don't answer, instead looking back out the window to hide your blush. It might not be visible beneath your fur, but you'd rather not take the chance. She giggles again. \"Yeah, he's a real sweetheart. There's just something about him that makes you want to trust the guy. And then there's that big, soft belly of his...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can feel your blush deepening. You swear it burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean, I've never actually felt it myself, but it sure looks soft. And did you get a good look at his chubby cheeks? It's almost funny how cute how cute they are! You know, considering he's such a big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wow, this blush is not gonna go away anytime soon, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy sighs. \"But in all seriousness, I can tell he likes you too. I can tell you'll get along well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\" you mumble quietly. You try to focus on looking for any notable landmarks to help you remember the layout. Everything just bleeds together, though. You forget the names of places as soon as you pass them by. Maybe you'd have better luck if you just went for a walk. Then again, you're still not sure if you're willing to risk going out by yourself just yet. Maybe after you've put on some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn to her. She spares a glance back at you. \"Does, um...\" How should you put this? \"Does anyone know...<i>why</i> this place is the way it is? Like, with all the fat stuff, and people randomly showing up naked with no memories of where they came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She doesn't immediately answer. The question hangs in the air for what feels like a good long minute. \"No,\" she finally says. You can't help but notice a slight bitter edge in her tone. \"Nobody know anything, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not an unexpected answer, but still unsatisfying. \"Really? Nothing at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing at all,\" she replies. \"Every 'newcomer' asks that question. I did, too, when I first got here. Nobody ever gets an answer that isn't 'I don't know.' After that, they do one of two things: they give up and learn to adapt to their new life, or go poking around for answers. And I'll tell you this right now: the second option never works out. Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gulp. \"Does that...\" A chill runs up your spine. \"Do you mean they...'mysteriously disappear', or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thankfully, no.\" Amy's tone is a bit lighter now. \"There aren't any chains of disappearances tied to some shady corporation or anything. I just meant everyone hits a dead end eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You let out a breath you didn't know you were holding. \"Oh. You made it sound a lot more ominous than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckles wryly. \"Sorry. It's just a bit personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah.\" You decide to leave it at that. She's still mostly a stranger to you, so prying seems a bit rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the ride carries out in silence. The questions still buzz about in your mind, but knowing you won't get a solid answer sours your drive to ask. So instead, you once more try in vain to make note of any important-looking places. Every now and then, though, your thoughts drift back to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam's house seems big from your perspective, but you get the feeling it's pretty average in this city. It seems well maintained. Not pristine, exactly, but still far from a ratty old mess. The tan paint job looks somewhat recent. And two stories tall, from the look of it. The benefits of a manager's salary, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're waiting by Amy's car as she unlocks the front door for you. She's back in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" she says, \"you're good to go. Be sure not to eat all his food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh yeah, you still have that incessant urge to eat. Shrugging, you say, \"Somehow, I doubt I could match his appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy grins. \"Fair enough. Well, I better get going.\" She starts for the driver's seat, then stops. \"Oh, and be good to Adam. No taking advantage of his hospitality, or you and I are going to have a talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll, uh, keep that in mind. Thanks, Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nods, and the two of you wave goodbye. She's already long gone by the time you're through the door. After locking it, you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Might as well get comfy,\" you mutter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You venture further into Adam's home. A whisper of vanilla air-freshener tickles your senses. Stripes of sunlight creep between the blinds. A silhouette of a tabletop lamp catches your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamplight reveals shapes and color. Earthen greens dominate the theme of the room. A plush couch the color of evergreen forests sits before a monolithic television. Speakers and electronics enshrine it. Abandoned soda-cans bask atop the midnight black coffee table. A crumpled red bag once full of chips rests beside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA marble bar separates the kitchen from the living room. A trio of stools watch their post dutifully. You walk past them; a blanket of dust coats the black leather seats. You wonder how long its been since Adam fit them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's fridge droned deep. You peeked over the counter top to see it. Grand metallic doors littered with kitschy magnets. A calendar with a picture of mountainscapes perched near the top. Curious, you amble around the counter and tug open the fridge door. True to your imagination, the fridge is loaded. Everything is bulky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble dozen egg cartons, a two-gallon milk jug, tall cans of \"Adipop\" soda, just to name a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your lips feel dry. Adam won't mind if you take a can. Hell he'd encourage it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop the tab, carbonation hisses. A sweet rush of sugar rinses your tongue. You recognized the aftertaste, but welcomed the cool liquid on your sandy tongue. A burp rushes up your throat. You excuse yourself, despite no one being there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown a corridor beyond the living-room/kitchen, you discover a flight of ascending stairs on your left and two doors to the right. An open door reveals a soap-white bathroom. You peer inside. Like everything in this world, it resembles a normal bathroom with accommodations for extra-large individuals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spacious walk-in shower dry as desert bone. A thin haze of dust lingers in the air. A sudden sneeze parts your lips. The only sign of use is that someone left the toilet seat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and check the other door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcrete steps descend into dark. You smell the air -- stagnant water, toilet cleaner, and sweat. You enter the basement, one hand firm on the guard rail. A washer and dryer unit huddle beside one another, mounds of laundry surround them. You glance around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weight bench?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA solid bar rests on metal guards, ready for bench-presses. A rainbow of metal plates scatter the floor around the bench. A half empty water-bottle lays on the floor. Accolades are displayed proudly on a wooden shelf. The largest is a silver trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Dog second place.\" You read under your breath. Might have to ask Adam about that one later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat on the weight bench and look over the other accolades. A picture catches your eye. You lean down at it and squint. It's a picture of two friends against a reddish wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize Amy in seconds. A smile on her lips with a pair of red sunglasses perched on her forehead. Her cheeks are a tad leaner, but not much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a second to realize that Adam is standing next to her. Seeing her so big beside him only makes him look smaller. He's broad in the shoulders still, and the beginnings of a belly tumble over his boardshorts, but he's unrecognizable all the same. A meaty mitt-like hand is on Adam's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost have to double take when it hits you. The wall is actually a whale of a husky that fills out the frame.  His bloated face curled into a jovial smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People get that big here?\" It would worry you, if it didn't excite the animal part in your brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell and truly shocked, you exit the basement. Questions for Adam brewing in your mind. You debate exploring the rest of the house, when a yawn parts your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe after a break on that plush couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake to the sound of electro-pop. The television is on and an advertisement is playing. A doe is strutting on stage with a two liter bottle of pink bubbling soda in her hand and a microphone in the other. Her t-shirt and shorts struggle to contain her. Fat engulfs a thin belt at her waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adipop helped take my career to the next level.\" Her exotic voice narrates off screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops, puts the bottle to her lips, and knocks it back. The pink fluid swirls, her throat flexes. The camera pans over her body. She swells out inch, by inch. Her belt explodes off and her belly cascades in slowmotion. Her thighs explode out of her pants legs. The t-shirt rides up her gut, then her boobs, until it rips in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once it rips off and falls to the floor. A much more revealing outfit in its place. The crowd cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adipop: success in excess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your half empty can of adipop, then at the screen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chortle draws your attention away from the screen. It's Adam leaning over the bar. He's watching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that stuff really do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. It's false advertising really.\" Adam shrugs. \"It helps pack on weight though. A good supplement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up and stretch. \"How long have you been home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half an hour now. I would've woke you, but you're adorable when you sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thanks.\" You blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your legs over the couch and sip your drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the house?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's nice\" You start. \"Never expected you to own a weight bench.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. You saw the gym. It's how I maintain mobility at my size. An old friend taught me some tricks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld friend? Speaking of the gym...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why, you don't think that deserves a trophy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In a city where big dogs are easy to come by?\" You snort. \"You'd have to be a lot bigger than the rest to get a trophy for that.\" There's a brief pause in the conversation, letting your words sink in. Realization comes just a couple seconds later. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bingo.\" Adam, grin widening, waddles around the bar and plops down next to you. His couch must be pretty heavily reinforced, because it doesn't creak or anything. Must be another necessity of living here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you... Oh wow.\" You look Adam over top to bottom. It doesn't take a genius to realize he's big, but big enough to outdo all the other dogs around? Wait, no. His trophy's only for second place. And considering that photo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A chuckle pulls you from your train of thought. Adam's not looking at you; he seems to be staring off into the distance. His grin's shrunk down to a smile. \"Thought I had first place in the bag...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It takes a second, but it's not hard to piece together what he's getting at. \"But it went to that big guy, didn't it? The one in the photo, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm?\" Adam turns to you. \"Oh, you mean good ol' Woodrow?\" He leans back and looks up at the ceiling. \"Yeah. Real swell fella, that guy. Helped me get some solid footing when I first showed up here. And damn if he doesn't make fat look good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His last comment gets your mind going. Memories of your meeting with Adam earlier today replay in your head, except he's replaced with that gigantic husky-- with Woodrow. \"S-Sure wish I could meet him,\" you mumble, your blush returning full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam hums thoughtfully. \"Too bad he's a bit out of our reach right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your ears perk up slightly. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shrugs. \"Exactly what I said. He's living in the high society part of town now. Hard to get in, even for just a visit.\" A short pause. \"Hard to get out, too, according to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ah, so they keep in contact. There's something reassuring about that. \"Have you ever thought about living there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam nods. \"Quite a bit, actually. 'Course, there's people down here I don't wanna leave behind either.\" He turns back to you, his smile gentle and warm. \"People like you,\" he adds with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your heart flutters. \"I-I... Uh, gee. Thank you Adam. I'm, uh...\" It feels like there's something else you want to say, but you're not sure what. Maybe something to show your appreciation? Yeah, that sounds good. You clear your throat. \"I'm sure you'll be to me what Woodrow was, or I guess still is to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes widen for a split second. It's hard to tell, but he might be blushing too. \"I'd like that,\" he says, his voice soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's no surprise Adam's dinner is the size of a feast. Every type of steak, every type of sausage, a wide assortment of potato-based dishes, and giant pitchers of ice-cold water cover the expansive dinner table. That incessant urge to eat has become an unstoppable force driving you to eat everything. And there's so much of it all! If Adam weren't here, you'd probably eat it all yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gorging flies by in a juicy, tasty haze. Everything's cooked to perfection, so much so you barely even notice that weird aftertaste. Maybe your table manners look more than a little poor in front of Adam, but you hardly care at the moment. He'd most likely just encourage you to keep it up anyway. So you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's no doubt been well over an hour since you started by the time you're finished. With a loud belch, you lean back and rub your distended gut. Even the tightness feels pretty good. It's still too early to say, but this whole getting fat thing doesn't seem all that--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A louder, huger belch shakes the table. You turn to Adam. He's doing the same thing as you. His belly is pressed up against the side of the table. You both belch again, at the same time. He turns to you, and the two of you exchange grins.</span></div></div>",

Anything more than a light touch hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Occasionally, you glance over at Adam to see him being a lot more grabby with his own. Despite eating far more, his belly's still malleable enough to grope and knead like a pile of clay. You linger a few moments longer with each glance. By the fourth time you look at him, you can't tear your eyes away. He's like a master sculptor, carefully molding his next masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He catches you staring and flashes a grin. \"You'd be surprised how fun this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blush for what feels like the millionth time today. \"It looks fun. I mean, it looks like you're having fun,\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam just nods. \"It's gonna take some time before you're totally comfy with all this fat business, huh?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You grunt some vaguely affirmative noise. \"You'd think that wouldn't be a problem, but... I dunno, you think it might be something leftover from my old life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Probably,\" he says with a shrug. \"Not like we'll ever know one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right...\" You lean back and stare at the ceiling. Hey, he's got some pretty nice tiles. Not enough to take your mind off things, though. Maybe a change of topic will help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, hey,\" you say, readjusting yourself as you turn back to Adam, \"if you don't mind my asking, what exactly happened at that Big Dog competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a frown on his face, but he brightens up at your question. \"Oh, I don't mind at all! It's nothing super exciting, though. Just to give ya fair warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You smile back. \"I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well in that case, I guess I better tell ya 'bout the competition itself first. See, it's not just a contest to see who's the fattest dog. If anything, it's sorta like--\" he gestures at the air around him \"--well, no, it <i>is</i> a modeling competition. Just one made specially for fat dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your head slightly tilts to one side. \"Why specifically dogs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam throws his arms out, making them jiggle. \"Hell if I know. It's like that for every species. Heard the reasoning's 'species-specific standards' or something like that. Never made sense to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel inclined to agree, though that might just be the way he's explaining it. \"So it's supposed to decide the Mr. Adipose of dogs, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best way to put it, really. It's not just about how big you are--\" he pats his gut \"--but how good you look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And for you to win second place...\" You give a low whistle. \"You must've been quite a hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still am, thank you very much,\" Adam says, his wide grin betraying the mock offense in his tone. \"But yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments in my time. Maybe a few too many for my own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You raise an eyebrow. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hint of embarrassment slips into Adam's expression. \"Remember how I said I thought I'd win first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your jaw drops a little before the realization fully hits you. Received too many compliments, assumed he was a shoe-in for first... Not hard to figure out where he's going with this. \"Ah,\" is all you can think to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam's grin is more wry now. \"Yup. Pretty sure that's why Woodrow joined in the first place, mostly cuz he told me so himself,\" he adds with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your brow furrows. Something about the phrasing seems off to you. \"Wait,\" you say, \"joined in the first place... So he only joined to beat you? He wouldn't have otherwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, he's not one for the spotlight. Never got a straight answer why.\" Adam looks down and lightly shakes his belly. \"Kind of ironic when you think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He doesn't like attention?\" you ask. \"Then why'd he get so fat when he lives in a city like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam pats his hips. \"Prob'ly the same reason I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shakes his head. \"If you're anything like me--and I get the feeling you are--you'll understand after a hundred or so pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hundred pounds... Maybe not <i>too</i> much compared to everyone else in the city, but to your thin little self, gaining that much would be close to doubling your body weight. Your throat's suddenly feeling a little dry, your heart rate's picking up. It doesn't feel like fear, though. More like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ah, there's that increasingly familiar heat in your cheeks. It's only going to get even more familiar in the coming days, no doubt. You avert your gaze to the direction opposite Adam. All you see is a window with the curtains shut. They look pretty thick, perhaps excessively so. Then again, isn't that the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But anyway,\" Adam says, \"back to Woodrow: he's a pretty sweet guy when he's not being a tough lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your head whips around to face him. \"Wha-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam's face screws up like he's holding back a laugh. \"Not like that, ya silly pervert! We never did anything like that!\" There's a pause. His expression softens, then he sighs. \"Not even once.\" It's hard to tell, but it almost sounds like there's a tinge of disappointment in that last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Regardless, you feel relieved. Doesn't make you blush any less, though. \"Oh,\" you say quite lamely, \"uh, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't be,\" he says, waving a hand dismissively. \"All I'm saying is he's a nice guy, but he's not against taking you down a peg if necessary. Anyway, it's getting late. We should clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he gets up, you move to do the same. A sharp pain in your gut forces you to yelp. You groan, your hands hovering over the dome of your belly, too scared to touch it. How'd you forget about this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh boy,\" Adam says, stopping mid-reach for your plates. \"Want me to get you some pills for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please,\" you hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam then sets his stack of plates down and hurries off somewhere. While the pain is at the forefront of your mind, a part of you still takes a second to appreciate how attentive he's being. You can't help but smile at that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You tilt your head back and down three hot pink pills. A few moments pass, then a soft bubbling sensation warms your stomach and numbs the pain. It lulls you into a daze. Plates clink and water rattles against the metallic basin of the kitchen sink. You crack an eye open and you peek over your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's broad figure obscures most of the sink. His sleeves are rolled up past his elbows, his thick forearms dark and slick. The dishwasher is loaded with neat rows of plates and bowls; what doesn't fit there is stacked on the counter. He towels his arms off then raises them above his head. A deep yawn rumbles the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, not used to cleaning up for two.\" He says. The hound wobbles over to you and leans over the now spotless table. Adam reaches over and pats your shoulder. \"Those pills are good stuff right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My insides feel like a bubble bath.\" You stretch your legs forward. Tension eases out of your lower back.  You stare at the pile of clean dishes. A sigh ekes between your lips. \"Jeez sorry for not pitching in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it a welcome to Zaftig City gift from yours truly.\" Adam says. \"Better enjoy it, tomorrow you're doing all the dishes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both share a chuckle as you scratch the slight curve of your middle. \"I'll do all the dishes you throw at me if I get to eat like this every day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful. You end up eating like me and you'll be in here for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it together at that point.\" You smile up at him. His ponderous frame casts a wide shadow over you. You glance at the sink, and your medicine dazed mind lets your thought slip. \"We might need a bigger kitchen by then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" You almost hear the smile in Adam's voice. \"How long do you plan on staying here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I-I didn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I don't mind the company.\" Adam says. He clears his throat and rubs his thumbs together. \"Speaking of company. You wanna go hang out in the living room? We can veg out to some late night TV and eat snacks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez I don't think I could stomach another bite.\" You drum your fingers against your taut belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab some just in case. Appetites have a habit of returning after those pills wear off.\" Adam says.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou scoot away from the kitchen table and attempt to stand. Adam helps steady you as you find your balance. To call the feeling 'weightless' would be inaccurate. The food in your gut pulls you forward. It just doesn't hurt any more. You follow Adam to the pantry and grab your choice of snackfoods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pulls open the fridge and hauls a case of soda from a shelf. He catches you staring and shrugs. \"In my experience, one can isn't enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two or three isn't either, apparently.\" You playfully stick your tongue out at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You laugh, but you'll thank me later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're both seated with your legs spread to accommodate your bellies. Adam pops the top of a can and sifts through channel after channel. He sips his soda, stopping every few channels to gauge his interest in the program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops at an infomercial of all things. Adam stifles a belch and points his noise at the screen. A fur so massive you can barely tell he's a feline is reclined in a mattress. He's naked, his groin covered only by the flesh apron of his stomach. A sea of chins wobbles as he speaks. You manage to regain your thoughts on his last sentence. \"-that's until I got a Mobi-cart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene switches to a vibrant colored scene of many furs of different sizes stationed around the park. The spokesfur now center frame in a scooter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam clears his throat. \"I'm probably the last person who should reprimand, but we're going to try and avoid getting you one of those. Just...trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the smiling actors puttering around, enjoying nature without all the fuss of actual movement. You can't help but ask: \"why? Seems to be the natural order of things here. Bigger is better and we can't carry all that weight forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd agree if I never met someone like Woodrow. I don't know where we came from, you know before the city, but you know it in your gut that people that look like me weren't the norm.\" Adam's nose twitches thoughtfully. \"I think bodies couldn't handle it there. Here it seems...different. Like somehow we're built for bigness now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you understand. Every fiber of your brain knows the feast from earlier should have burst you open. Yet here you are eyeballing a bag of chips with ravenous intent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy to get lost in it. Get fat fast formulas that blow you up in a few months time. Heck, I wager sometime in the near future someone your size can look like Mr. Mobicart there in a few days. People love that here. The immediate satisfaction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you lose mobility if you grow too fast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Our bodies want to get used to it now, but if you go too fast it never gets a chance to catch up.\" Adam nods. \"Woodrow can move around just as well as you and me. Well, so long as he has the space. He out grew his apartment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Just trying to imagine outgrowing your current get-up is difficult. Outgrowing your living space even more so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough of me rambling. Just know I won't ever mess you up and leave you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flips the channel again. This time to a sitcom. It stars a big fat family, except the teenage son who is thin. No doubt to rebel. A novelty from, well, wherever you're from. Here it could only be the norm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull open your chips and start to snack. Between hokey laugh tracks that drink up the fat dad's bad jokes  and crunchy snack food, it's hard to pay attention. You glance at Adam off and on and wonder if he does the same to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe catches you one time. \"Thirsty?\" He wiggles his can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Yeah.\" You look away and lick your teeth of salt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam plops a chilled soda on the coffee table. You sip it to deflect his attention. Hoping he's paid no mind to your awkward voyeurism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness you're about as bad as me when you first got here.\" Adam laughs aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. We've just met, but I know how you're feeling right now.\" Adam reaches his arm across the back of the sofa. His furry arm brushes against the back of your head. \"Big first day in a world you literally woke up in. You feel differently about things here than you would other wise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go silent and clasp your fingers together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're an okay guy so far. Hard to tell on the first day, but you remind me so much of a fresh faced me, it's like I've known you forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of Adam's arm rests on your shoulders. He brushes his finger through the fur on your cheek. You quiver at the sudden touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that trusting of a total stranger?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the fun thing about this city. We're all strangers from a world we don't remember. For all we know, we could have met on the street in a different life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean your face against his palm. \"Good to know that the Big Dog runner-up doesn't mind a twig.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to change soon.\" Adam pokes the light curve of your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm tugs at you gently. You scoot close to him and lay your head against his chest. His moob feels plush and warm against your cheek. You reach over and pinch a handful of his love handle. You feel his body shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been wanting to do that all day.\" You mumble. He squeezes your hip with his fat paw. You lay your arm across his stomach and embrace him as best you can. \"I hope I look as good as you when I'm this big.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll look like you.\" Adam scratches behind your ear and hugs you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're enveloped in warmth and soft chub. Deep within you feel a hint of firmness. You close your eyes, then let yourself relax against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a distant laugh track while fantasies play out in your head. You imagine yourself enveloping Adam in your own sea of girth. He's struggling to wrap his arms around you. Heat rises to your face. You want to hold on forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam holds you in his arms your until exhaustion finally sets in. A yawn contorts your maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's time for bed.\" Adam releases the hug. \"The guest room is all set up for you upstairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder the option a moment before you decide:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as you'd rather stay with Adam, it's only a matter of time before you fall asleep on him, and it wouldn't be fair to make him carry you upstairs. He's done plenty for you as is. \"See you in the morning, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course you'll see me; it's kinda hard not to.\" Adam flashes a smirk. \"Anyway, guest room's on the far end of the left side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay.\" You pause to let out another yawn. \"G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"G'night. Hope you sleep well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, me too,\" you mumble, mostly to yourself. There's a lot to take in right now. Way too much, especially in your sleepy state. And the last thing you need is nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Past the living room kitchen, through the corridor, up the stairs and down the left and sure enough, there's the guest room. The first thing you notice is the big bed on the far side. No doubt meant for people closer to Adam's size. Hopefully you won't end up literally lost in the sheets come morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You give the rest of the room a quick once-over. Sizable overall, of course. You can't make out much thanks to the darkness, but what you can see tells you it's a pretty plain room overall. The bed and dresser and desk and such look nice, but more in a generic kind of way than anything. There seem to be a couple paintings as well, but you're just too tired to try and make them out in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So you just plod over to the bed and slip under the cover and sheets. Ah, nice and soft. So is the pillow. Your worries melt away as a soothing warmth envelops you. With your biggest yawn yet, you close your eyes and sigh in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yeah, you'll get used to this no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waking up is a much better experience this time around. No blinding light, and no headache either. And it certainly helps that you're not naked in some park again. But that goes without saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can safely say your sleep was restful, for the most part. No especially bad dreams, at least. There was one part where that silver fox lady, Beth, had you strapped to a chair and was about to feed you hyper-fattening goop. Thankfully, Adam bailed you out just in time. The rest was just a collection of goings-on based off what you currently know about the city; people rapidly fattening up from massive meals, meeting hyper-obese Mobi-cart riders, a much fatter you taking part in a modeling competition called Foxy Fatties, Adam personally feeding you and rubbing your growing fat all the while... That last one went on noticeably longer than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shake your head and give the bed a once over. Brown cover with white sheets. Not bad. They decently fit with the rest of the house. Same for the dark green blinds on the window. Seems Adam put some genuine thought into his interior design. Well, that would make sense; he is the manager for a clothing store, after all. Good understanding of color schemes comes with the territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A dresser sits to your immediate left. Dark brown with a nice wooden finish. To your right is a work desk of similar appearance. Its wide surface is bare and lightly coated with dust. The accompanying chair bares the same wood finish as the other furniture, and is padded with soft, light green cushioning. It's pretty big as well. Two of you could fit on it no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the far wall are the two paintings you noticed last night. The one directly across from you depicts a hill overlooking an expansive grassland. A lovely piece, though now it has you wondering how much greenery is in the city. Or what lies beyond it for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Those musings are cut short once you focus on the other painting. It's a full length portrait of a grey wolf man clad in an blue army uniform. A general or some other high-ranking officer, judging by the decorations he's wearing. He carries a confident demeanor about him. A grin graces his muzzle. One hand rests on his hip while the other holds a shotgun, with the weapon's barrel resting on his shoulder. But his most striking feature has to be his overall figure. He's definitely got some serious muscle, going by the curvature of his limbs, but his torso is unmistakably fat. No way a bulbous gut like his wouldn't fill out his lap. And those pectoral bulges are definitely moobs. You have to hand it to the artist, even from a distance the detail put into the painting really pops out. The shading, the coloring, the texture... This has to be a master's work. The wolf looks like he could jump out and give you a big bear hug any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That idea sounds a lot more appealing than you'd openly admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A loud growl disrupts your thoughts. You look down and lightly pat your stomach. It growls again. That incessant desire to eat is stronger than ever. In one fluid motion, you pull the covers off and hop off the bed. Hints of a tantalizing scent tickle your nose. Breakfast. You grin and move to leave the room, only to pause when you notice a certain pressure a little ways below your empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right. Better take care of that first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully there's a bathroom one door down from the guest room, so you don't have to go far to do your business. And man, does Adam have an eye for quality toilet paper! This stuff is soft! The hand soap feels a bit strange for some reason, though. Maybe it has to do with your fur? It does still feel \"wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eh, you'll adapt. Right now, you need to take care of your poor stomach; it's been begging for food all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The intoxicating smell of breakfast leads you down to the kitchen. A sizable sprawl--consisting of every hot breakfast food imaginable--covers the table. Adam (who's wearing a tight-fitting white shirt and dark grey boxers) sets down a plate of breakfast burritos, looks up at you and smiles. \"Morning, sleepyhead,\" he says. \"How're you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty good, all things considered,\" you reply, eyes darting between him and the feast. \"Where'd you get the time to make all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam chuckles. \"When you eat like me, you learn how to make big meals in a hurry. Plus it's actually kinda late in the morning. Quarter after ten, in fact. Been working on all this since eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You give a low whistle. \"You sure know how to treat yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, it's for you too. Gotta start your first proper day in Zaftig on the right foot. Just remember it's your turn to do the dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fair enough,\" you say, licking your lips as you look over the feast. You turn to Adam with an eager look in your eyes. \"When do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He chuckles again. \"How 'bout right now?\" </span></div></div>",

I'll also workout a bit in my own personal gym and just eat. We could play some videogames if you like little dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would of spent a whole day at a buffet, but you're still too small to be left alone,\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Adam eat breakfast. After breakfast you begin washing the dishes while Adam grabs a massive pie and begins eating it while watching TV. As you wash the dishes you gaze at Adam as he consumes the chocolate pie whole. Who knew he would be hungry after such a large breakfast. You were still full from all that food you ate. Man you were totally envious of Adam's size. You catch yourself daydreaming about a \"Woodrow-sized \" Adam eating to his heart's content and with riches won from several Big Dog competitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your daydream once you notice that your nose was bleeding. Fortunately, you had already cleaned all the dishes. You do a double take and sigh in relief that Adam was still watching TV. It would be embarrassing if he caught you gawking at him like a total pervert. Though you do admit that you are somewhat bisexual you still didn't want to admit that to someone else. Well, not until you got to them better that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go take a shower and then join Adam on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just finished the dishes. What do you want to do? We could go work out or maybe we can eat pizza or something all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planning on working out now. After lunch at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Adam do you have any goals you would like to meet such as gaining weight and stuff? Have you considered bulking up and participating in another Big Dog Competition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looks at you and scratches his belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After feasting on breakfast for what felt like hours, you were once again stuffed to the brim. Your belly was just as expanded and engorged as it was last night. Or maybe it was slightly larger? At the other end of the table was Adam. You noticed that he held back a bit during the meal. Not like that makes much of a difference; he still probably ended up eating more than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you say while leaning back in your chair and running a hand along your swollen gut, \"what's the plan for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to head off to work in a few minutes.\" said Adam. Your face must have drooped noticeably. \"Don't worry, I won't be gone that long. Besides, there's plenty of stuff for you to do around here. I've got all the television channels, a bunch of video games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fully-stocked kitchen...\" you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam smiled as he got up from the table. \"Yep, and a fully stocked kitchen. So feel free to make yourself something if you're feeling peckish later. But for now, I need to leave otherwise I'll be late for work, then they'll fire me, and then I'll have no way to cover all the food you...I mean we, have been eating.\" He walked over to the front door and grabbed his keys off the nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adam,\" you yell from the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BURP</b> You belch loudly from the kitchen. That caused Adam to chuckle to himself. \"And don't forgot: You're doing the dishes. You promise!\" Adam left the house. After a minute or two of recovering from your meal, you waddle back upstairs with your swollen belly, make your way into your guest room, and land on the bed for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, you wake up. Once more, you belly is somewhat swollen but you are not feeling as full as did after breakfast. You scratch your gut from under your blanket. \"What to do? What to do?\" you ask yourself. \"Eat,\" you reply to yourself. After all, Adam is essentially paying for you to fatten up, so it's only fair to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen, you roam around looking for something to refill your belly with. Opening the freezer compartment of the refrigerator, you immediately notice a full carton of ice cream. Birthday cake flavored. Your favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday to me...\" you say to yourself, pulling the carton out and placing it on the counter. You begin searching the kitchen for a bowl when you realize that won't be necessary. Rather, you find a spoon, rip off the top, and eat a large spoonful. Your tail slowly wags as the ice cream coats your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the container and carry it with you. It's only been a day since you came here, so you figured that you might want to look around Adam's house again to get acquainted with the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering around for a quarter of an hour, you find yourself back in the room with Adam's weight set. You sit your foxy butt down on the weight bench as you admire all of Adam's trophies again. As you shovel more ice cream into your mouth, you eye catches that photo again. Adam, Amy, and the unknown massive husky. You walk over to the photo encase in a frame with glass and marvel at the husky. How did he get so big? Can he even more around? How does he know Adam? Adam warned you about about amateurs and jerks who might blow you up to immobility. Was this husky such a victim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you examine the photo, you catch your reflection in the glass protecting it. Adjusting yourself a bit, you move the reflection of your face on the glass over the face of the husky. That forces a giggle out of you. You puff up your cheeks and now the image of your bloated face on the glass covers the pudgy jowls of the husky. Another laugh comes from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you examine the photo again. Your face on that massive husky's body. You can't help but imagine yourself in his place. Instead of a husky, a red fox is there blown up to massive proportions. Your own meaty paw around Adam's hip, and you start to think about what a life you two would have with yourself that fat. Adam, the bulky German Shepard, and you, the ultra-massive fox. Adam would have to spend nearly all day cooking for you to make sure that you don't start to slim down. He'll have to help you bath since you won't be able to clean all your fat rolls. And stairs? You'll have to move your bedroom downstairs. Scratch that, we'll have to move <i>our </i> bedroom downstairs. And speaking of bedroom... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your imagination continues, you don't notice that you're scrapping the bottom of the ice cream container. Thinking about getting as big as that husky got you so excited you aren't realizing that you finished your sweet treat until you are pouring the last drops of ice cream into your mouth. You notice that your belly feels just as full as it did after breakfast. But there is an immense urge inside of you to keep eating. Eat and keep growing. As big as Adam. As big as the husky. No, bigger than the husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you think to yourself, \"Adam agreed to help me put on some weight. I don't know how he'll feel about dealing with a half-ton fox...But, there is a lot of food in his kitchen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

A squat tower of flapjacks, plush, warm, and tender. Breakfast sausage plumper than Adam's fingers, drizzling delectable juices that puddle on your tray-like plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach mewls, your fingers twitch, unsure where to start. You work left to right. At first trying to savor each bite. The eggs slide down your throat and bring their warmth to your gut. They flavor sticks to your teeth, lingering on your tongue. You lick your lips clean and jab the pancakes with your fork. Though, something's missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam could you,\" a sudden burp interrupts you, that sickly sweet aftertaste heavy on your breath, \"could you pass the syrup?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunts an affirmative between his own mouthful of food. He suckles the syrup from his fingertips and wipes his hand on a napkin before passing you the pitcher of amber colored delight. The handle is warm to the touch and steam trickles off the surface. You slather the pancakes, the syrup that gleams like liquid jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's tempting to forgo the fork and use your hands, but you aren't that much of a pig. You cut large segments with the flat of your fork, spear a handful, and jam them into your waiting maw. They practically melt in your mouth. Your stomach churns, the chunks of pancake rest heavily in your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Adam say nothing amid the gorging. He looks up at you from time to time and you smile at him with cheeks stuffed full of food. There are only the sounds of muffled breathing, cutlery clicking on dishes, the satisfied grunt that follows a delicious bite. The breakfast your host graciously prepared dwindles each passing minute. Between the experienced veteran and the ravenous greenhorn, there is little left in your wake. Your stomach churns, the skin around your middle taut and bloated. You lean back in your seat, idly massaging the aching distension above your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a single slice of quiche on the far end of the table. Yellow and speckled with spices. Your mind says no, you're full, your stomach begs to test its limits. You lean forward and gasp. The aching pain in your middle pins you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam dabs food debris from his chin, eyes on the distant quiche. \"You want that?\" He rests his hands on the peak of his belly. The chair creaks beneath him. His ill-fitting white t-shirt rode the curve of his belly. Exposing the furry flesh for all to see. He tugs it down, but his gut forces it back up. He gives the beast a gentle pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" a hiccup catches you off guard, you cover your mouth.  Breakfast sits in your gut like a ball of lead. \"Or maybe not, you can have it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shrugs and shimmies back a bit. The chair grinding the floor, the sound echoes off the ceiling. He wobbles to his feet, his plump biceps flex as he steadies himself on the table. He grabs the entire dish with the quiche and waddles to you. A grin lights up his muzzle. It's a hungry face, though not for food. He sets the plate in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to pop,\" you whine, your ears flatten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't let that happen, trust me,\" he grabs a fork and carves bite, \"besides, I've got belly to spare. You need all the help you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hovers in front of your face a moment. Every waking thought in your mind screams for you to stop. Your mouth didn't get the memo. The hinges on your maw loosen, your tongue unfolds. A bed that awaits the morsel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pops the fork in your mouth and you muzzle clamps shut. An alien sensation fills your being. There's a pounding warmth in your chest. Your legs feel limp. His meaty mit-like paws reach under your shirt, experienced fingers knead the tension out of your gut. The warmth spreads up your spine now, your neck relaxes and your mouth opens to accept the next bite. You don't even register the fullness anymore, it's less about eating now. Bite after bite, you guarantee that Adam will have no leftovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetal fork meets empty plate, a soft ding sound tickles your ears. He's panting, his ears pert and his tongue lolling out. Adam clears his throat. \"Knew you had it in you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum softly. The reality of your decision weighing heavily on your middle. You groan and hug yourself. \"It's not going to be in me for long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam grimaces and waddles to the nearby cabinet where a familiar bottle of pink pills awaits. He tugs the seat of his boxers free of his rear and taps the pills back into your hand. \"I promise someday you'll have enough room to handle any meal without really worrying about using these,\" he fills you a glass of water at the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force the pills down, praying it all stays down. The pain fades and your face relaxes. Adam stands beside you a moment, gently rubbing your back. \"Sorry, shouldn't have pushed you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've said no,\" you smile up at him, \"and you have to go all in to get big, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Adam's cheeks dimple. The corners of his maw turned upward. \"So, last night I got to thinking, it's gotta be boring being stuck in my house all day long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you shrug, \"I'll find ways to entertain myself.\" The refrigerators hum becomes more apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could come to work with me,\" Adam says, a little faster than he might have intended, he puts a hand on his hip and leans on the table. His tail swishing rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idly massage your stomach. \"Won't, you know,\" an uneasy feeling wells in your chest, \"'others' find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure they don't do anything.\" Adam stares at you with the biggest puppy eyes he could muster. The lightning blue pigment in his eyes glimmer. He licks his lips and clasps his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'll tag along,\" you sigh, gripping the table's edge and forcing yourself to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Adam helps you to your feet. \"Now speaking of which, I need to slip into something a little more presentable,\" he shakes his belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, the pills are really kicking in now. Adam's jiggling middle seems to move in slow motion. It's hard to turn away. \"You do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pats your back. \"Alright, I'll be back in a bit.\" Adam waddles from the kitchen. His tree-trunk thick legs brush one another, the curve of his rear shifts with his steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to see you go, love to watch you leave,\" you mumble to yourself, trying to remember where you heard such a thing. You stretch your arms over your head and yawn. The spread of spent dishes ever imposing. Time to make good on your offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><i>A/N: Got a little carried away with this, that's why it got split into two chapters.</i></font></span></div></div>",

The kettle seat affords you tons of room, though just plenty enough for Adam. He's dressed in a similar outfit from the previous day. Now doubt the store's uniform. The pastel blue polo clings to his frame like a thin sheet. Sparse bits of fur peek where the fabric runs thinnest. He looks down at the shirt. \"It's an older one, my bigger ones are all in the wash.\" He shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean your head against the cool glass of his car window. The morning crowd is already bustling with life. Hefty furs in motorized carts take up the largest sections of the sidewalk while others struggle to stay in the lines. Adam's car passes the park you 'arrived' from. A tall metal sign with tin floral sculptures decorating it reads: \"Adventus Memorial Park.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foggy memory of a life long lost tickles your brain. Adventus. Adventus. Advent. You remember the chill of winter air and the nip of snow on your...skin? It hurts your head to think of it. A calendar with compartments comes to mind, a day of the week with little candies in each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Adam's voice reaches in and tears you from the scant memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" you rub your temples, \"do you guys celebrate anything during the winter here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! We've got this thing called the Saturnalia Festival. Really you could say the festival is like the last three months of the year, but it's a big deal round these parts,\" Adam chuckles, \"y ou think we all gorge now, wait until the season swings in, hoo boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturnalia,\" you let the word sink into your brain. No, that wasn't the name you were looking for. \"So, it's like a feasting holiday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter was the time when our ancestors would pack on a bunch of weight to fight the cold, so I guess they made a festival of it. These days, no one starves come winter, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drum your fingers on the armrest. Claw tips accidentally stick the leather fabric. You grimace and hope Adam didn't notice. Adam hooks a corner and pulls into a parking garage a few blocks from his store. A camera scans a sticker on the windshield of his car. Green light flashes, a bar lifts, and Adam is permitted parking. He scours the vast expanse of blacktop in search of a spot. Finally, he parks in a 'reserved' parking space. The trucks AC rumbles to a halt as Adam pulls the keys from the ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reserved parking? Didn't realize you were that important.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All employees at the 'Strip' are allowed reserved parking,\" Adam says, he points the sticker on his windshield, \"some of the stores here don't have a lot of space for parking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours does, though.\" You cock your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get my daily walk in somehow.\" Adam presses a button on his key fob and the truck chirped in response. The headlights flickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cardio and lifting,\" you shake your head, \"and how do you stay so big again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat.\" Adam pats his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wobbles at a decent pace through the dark parking lot. Flickering fluorescent lights buzz and tingle your ear drums. You scratch your cheek. The pair of you stops at lift enclosed in glass. It's far wider than any elevator you've ever seen and looks more apt to carry cargo than people. Adam's ponderous hips bump you as he steps inside, reminding you the necessity of larger than life elevators. He presses a button on a panel and the elevator whirs to life. The glass walls flicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFish float around you like you're surrounded by an aquarium. A deep voice speaks: \"the sea calls to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft sitar music plays and the images of fish flicker. Furs of various sizes are raiding a buffet of seafood dishes. An obese otter dressed in a toga rolls on screen in a chariot. \"Poseidon's Bounty awaits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe advertisement flickers off and you rub your eyes. \"That place any good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never been, maybe I can take you,\" Adam smirks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddles off the elevator onto the street level. Where once you were a car seat spectator, you're now in the fray. Wide hipped furs hog the sidewalks and you're stuck behind Adam as he carves you a path. You feel insignificant, cradling your beginner's belly in your oversized clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite his ponderous size, Adam outpaces you with his gait. It starts to dawn on you that the only thing really holding him back is the bulk, not the weight. No one can walk all that great when your thighs constantly touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertain members of the crowd look at you. Some seem to understand the situation. You're the new guy and Adam's 'adopted' you. Others laugh and whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're not the ones you're worried about. You keep your eyes peeled for a silver fox with green eyes. No doubt massively obese, maybe even Adam sized. You wonder if she drives a Mobi-cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nerve-wracking few minutes, you finally reach \"Urban Trends.\" The sign for the store is styled after pop-art, with the letters in gritty stenciled text. Top forty hits play on the speakers above. You listen for lyrics you recognize to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no one thinks it's weird that I'll be your little shadow today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New arrivals need help, people understand that,\" Adam holds the door open for you, \"and I volunteered to help you. It's kind of like an unwritten code.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stands at the cash register, inspecting her claws. The store is mostly vacant, save for a few plump teenagers carrying armfuls of clothes into a fitting room. A beleaguered fitting room attendant leans against the wall, looking ready to quit his life at any moment. You stick close to Adam's hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the big boss,\" Amy looks up from her claws and beams at the two of you, \"and the new guy actually came back outside again. I'm impressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep an eye out, alright,\" Adam leaned close to Amy, \"Beth should know better, but people like her aren't right in the head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" the lioness looks down at you, \"you two look like you're getting along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make an honest citizen out of him yet,\" Adam rubs your shoulder, \"he's got the appetite for it, that's for sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy leans over the counter, her bulbous cleavage bunched by her shirt. \"So what's the plan for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to stick with me while I work, maybe pitch in and help a bit,\" Adam waddled around the counter toward a backroom, \"and if you're up for it, we could try a restaurant tonight. It'll be like old times. Minus 'you-know-who' of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy offers a knowing nod. \"You sure the newby'll be safe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between the two of us, he's got nothing to be afraid of.\"  Adam stretched his arms over his head, his polo became untucked and he mumbled curses beneath his breath. He reached over the girth of his gut and tucked the offending bunch of fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures for you to follow him to the back, only for you to notice a plume of fabric is untucked at his rear. The waist of his gray boxers peeks above his snug khakis. You reach over and tuck it for him. He yelps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed a spot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy bursts into laughter and Adam's face turns bashful. The two of you make your way to the back of the store. Maybe going out wasn't such a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day is mostly uneventful but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Option 1: What looks like a whole group of 'New Arrivals' shows up in the store. Thin furs that stick out as bad as you. However, they look familiar with the lay of the land and dress in foreign attire.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Option 2: You and Mr. Big Dog runner-up himself get into some antics at Poseidon's Bounty. May the biggest eater win. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>Option 3: Beth rears her ugly head and her twelve chins your way. She confronts Adam and things aren't looking good.</i></span></div></div>",

You figured that you must still be digesting dinner as well as the fact that your stomach is not used to eating as much as Adam can. You toss off your blankets and gently rub the still-taunt dome of your belly while your quitely moan. After dinner, Adam had brought you up to his guest room to bed after he had recognized your indigestion. It still feels as if you swallowed a bowling ball, so you can only imagine how stuffed you were after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, there must be something that I can have to settle my stomach,\" you think to yourself. You won't be able to sleep at all if you don't take care of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly fling your legs off your bed and sit up. Your heavy stomach sloshes onto your lap and gurgles. \"Better get used to it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you make it to your feet, realizing that your movements are going to have to take into account the weight of your still-full belly. On the floor of the bedroom is the large white shirt Adam gave you earlier in the day. You consider putting it on but don't bother. \"It's nothing he hasn't seen already,\" you say before realizing that Adam is probably asleep, so either way he won't mind a nude fox roaming around his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the bedroom door slowly to make sure that it does not creek and step out into the hallway. Downstairs is the kitchen, full of food. Maybe there is something in there that you can make to ease your stomach? Down the hall is Adam's bathroom. Perhaps in there is some medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Medicine sounds like the best option right now. Another bite of food and you might just pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tiptoe down the hallway, you can feel your belly wobble a bit from your steps. It's still firm with food, but it also has a bit more jiggle to it than before. At the end of the hall is an open door that, even without the light, you can make out is the bathroom. You step inside onto the cool tile floor and switch on the light. The bathroom is massive for you, but it probably fits a guy as big as Adam. The room had a bathtub, twice as wide and deep as a standard bathtub, a sink with a medicine cabinet over it, a wide toilet (presumably reinforced for Adam's large rump), a full-body mirror, and a cabinet filled with towels and toiletries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the medicine cabinet and open it. Aside from the standard items like toothpaste and floss, there was a bright green bottle on the top self. Taking it down and looking at it, the bottle reads \"Bloat-B-Gone\" and depicts what can best described as a deflating kangaroo on the label. \"This looks like the right stuff,\" you say. You unscrew the cap and take a few mouthfuls of the thick liquid inside. It runs down your throat and feel it coat your stomach. Relief comes instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, that feels so much better now,\" you say as you replace the cap and put the bottle back onto the shelf. You are about to turn back to your room when you glance the mirror. You walk over to it and see the damage that one night with Adam has caused. You still look like your skinny, foxy self. But your gut looks swollen and distended. Were you a girl fox, some might guess that your six or seven months pregnant. Your paw reaches around to your front and your finger traces your belly button which looks wider because of the state of your belly. As you turn to your side, you see that your belly sticks out several inches and is already starting the sag (though that may not be so tomorrow when your done digesting dinner). Your paws reach around the sides of your belly, lift it up a bit, and drops your gut. You laugh as you watch it wobble and shake as it resettles. Several times more you lift and drop your belly, giggling even more as you watch it giggle. You face the mirror front on again and begin to shake your body to see how your gut reacts. A small jump causes a series of short ripples. A quick slap causes a dull thud to ring out. Slowly shifting your hips around makes your belly wobble left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" you hear from the doorway of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn and see Adam standing in the doorway. He's wearing some pajama pants and a sleeveless shirt that exposes half an inch of his belly. Instantly, you feel your face turn a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you mummble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughs out loud. \"I'm glad,\" he says as he smiles. You notice his eye drift down slightly. \"Lost your shirt already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what he means as your tail droops down to cover up your bare bum a little bit. \"Uh, I guess so,\" you say. Your face is still red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughed again. \"Well, as much as I like seeing a little bloated fox dance around in my bathroom, I need to pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Yeah. And I guess I have to go back to bed.\" You walk towards the bathroom doorway. Adam turns to his side to let you slide by. You side-shuffle through the door when both of your bellies brush up against each other. You walk back down the hallway to your guest room and you swear that you can feel Adam's eyes watching you. Your foxtail lifts up slightly again, exposing a bit more of your skinny butt. \"Just in case he is watching\" you think to yourself as you go back into your bedroom and shut the door behind you.  </span></div></div>",

Is this how I'm going to get big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam yawned and leaned back, letting his shirt ride up on his belly a couple of inches. \"Well, that depends on you.\" He tugged his shirt back down over his swollen gut. \"That's one way of doing it. Overeat, don't exercise too much, repeat. And considering how much you just ate, keep it up and you'll be a pudgy fox in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just pudgy?\" you say as you give your full belly a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, that depends on you. Taking it slow, you can put on as much as you feel comfortable with though it'll take some time. Pudgy fox, rotund fox, freakishly fat fox, it's up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at the last suggestion. \"I don't know if I want to get 'freakishly' fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastically fat?\" asked Adam. \"Formidably fat? Foundation-shaking fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou playfully stick out your tongue at Adam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughs back. \"Well, there is another way besides the traditional way of getting fat...\" You tilt your head to the side inquisitively. \"You see, there's this guy I know. He's named Stephen. He works at this research facility right at the edge of town. The Subcutaneous Society or Institute or something like that. I forgot. Anyways, he has approached me and some of the other guys who usually show up at the Big Dog competition with a offer. Apparently, the Institute Stephen works for developed a way to put on massive amounts of weight in a fairly short period of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you take him up on that offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Remember, being a Big Dog requires having a nice combination of beef and flab. The Institute is more interested in the later. Stephen assured me that he could bulk me up, but it would be all fat. That's why myself and none of the other guys agreed to be one of his test subjects. You're not even allowed to exercise while on the program. Except for some leg exercises. Squats and stuff. They don't want your leg muscle to atrophy so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how it is that they suppose they can fatten someone up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Science,\" replied Adam. \"Really, I'm not sure. But they can do it with something called the Functional Adipose Tissue Agitator Sucrose Supplement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment about that. \"...FATASS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever, isn't it? It's part of an inside joke in the lap, according to Stephen. Apparently, their first subject, this kangaroo guy, came out of the program looking like he was smuggling two beach balls full of pudding in the back of his sweatpants. You should have seen it. It was amazing; Stephen showed me a few photos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at the thought. How would a kangaroo with a rump that big be able to waddle around? Where would his tail go? If you went to the Institute, is that how would you end up? Your hips are already slightly on the wide side. Would you even be able to get out of the building? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you still there?\" Adam asked. You have been staring off into space for the past minute thinking about that FATASS kangaroo. \"What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

I know that Stephen will be thrived to have a test subject. If I wasn't focused on being a Big Dog, I'd love to try it myself. I can't wait to see how you'll do. I'll call him tonight and let him know.\" He gets up from the table and walks to the kitchen refrigerator. He opens it up and pulls out a large cheesecake. \"Dessert, fatass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you and Adam have breakfast. Eggs, toast, bacon, so much bacon, and coffee cake. When you both are done eating, you feel just as full as you did the night before, though you swear that your gut extends out just a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Stephen said he'll swing by here today to talk with you about the program,\" said Adam while his right hand absentmindedly rubs his belly. \"I'll be at work at the time. But don't worry. He just wants to give you some of the fine details, get your information, all that jazz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" you reply. You get up and help Adam with the dished. Shortly afterwards, he heads out for work but not before giving you a quick hug. You manage to lightly squeeze one of his large love handles. He gives your distended belly a quick rub. After he leaves, you head over to couch, plop down, and flip through the channels until you daze off for a quick nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awoken several hours later to the sound of someone knocking on the door. You head over to the front door, noticing your gut bounce along the way. As you open the door, you are greeted by the sight of a large, handsome lion. He's roughly the same height as Stephen and has a fair share of muscle on him since his biceps are making his t-shirt tight around his arms. Yet this guy was significant fatter than Adam. A large, round gut hung out in front of him and sagged several inches over the waistband of his silver basketball shorts. It looks almost as his someone made him swallow a huge waterballon. You also notice his thick thighs which filled out the rest of his shorts giving him little room. He face was cute with puffy cheeks and a hefty second chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said the lion, sticking out his right hand. \"I'm Stephen from the Subcutaneous Research Institute. Adam should have told you that I'm coming by to talk with you about our bulking program?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake his paw. \"Yeah, he did! Come on into the living room.\" You guide Stephen into the living room. He sits on one of the sofas; you think you hear the chair groaning a little bit. \"Can I get you anything to eat or drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no thank you,\" he replies. \"Actually, I'm on a bit of a diet. Shocking, I know. But since I didn't have any test subjects, I did a little 'self research'.\" He patted his paunch. A few small ripples shook throughout his chubby body as you sit on another couch in room. \"Now that you're on board, I might be able to slim down a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know your program works!\" you say. \"Speaking of which, what does that all entail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Really, the research program is nothing to complicated. High caloric food every day. Almost no movement. You'll be required to stay in bed all day. Our staff will take care of your bathroom needs, and they'll assist you in some light exercises to ensure that your leg muscles don't atrophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I sit in bed and eat like a pig all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen giggled at that. \"Almost. That's where my supplement comes in. It'll be administered twice daily, once in the morning and once at night. My supplement will force your fat cells to go into overdrive. They'll absorb as much as they possibly can and engorge themselves far more than they usually can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's different. But so what, I stare at the ceiling until my next meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No at all, you'll be given plenty of entertainment. Any book, movie, television channel you can desire. We want to make sure our test subjects are as comfortable as possible. We are even able to provide...um, relief of other kinds of desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen avoided your eyes. \"Well, you know. A 'special' kind of release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment before you understand. \"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we have a few people on retainer in case you start feeling arouse. And before you ask, that kind of exercise is acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at that comment and the mood in the room lightens a little. \"So, let me ask you this. I'm just in a bed, eating, and whatever. Do I have to do it at the Institute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically no,\" Stephen says. \"I mean, it would be helpful for me and my team if you were there. It would be easier to get up-to-the-date measurements. But so long as there is a space big enough to house you and a few monitors, you can be anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even here? At Adam's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. Where would you stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. Adam's weight room might be big enough, yet he probably doesn't want to go months without lifting. The living room is spacious, but it's oddly shaped and might not fit Stephen's equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...maybe Adam's bedroom?\" you ask. Adam might not be okay with this, but it's easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see the room?\" asks Stephen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, It's upstairs at the end of the hallway.\" You follow Stephen as he heads up the stairs. As you walk upstairs, you can't help but notice Stephen wide rump. Right at your eye level, it wobbles and shakes hypnotically like two flabby basketballs. The material of his shorts are strained tight against his bum, his lion tail lazily swaying left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, project FATASS?\" you say. Stephen looks slightly over his shoulder and catches you glancing at his bubble butt and smirks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I guess I should have thought about that before trying out my own supplement on myself. Now these are the only pants-like thing that fits. Oh well, the things I do for science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both reach the door to Adam's bedroom. \"Yeah, science. I'm very into science,\" you say. Stephen opens the door and examines the room. Adam's bedroom is fairly empty. There is just a nightstand, a few drawers, and a closet. Most of the room is taken up by a large bed, maybe large enough to comfortably fit three or four Adams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of examining the room, Stephen says that this could possible work. \"That bed will do. And all my equipment should fit in here. But where is Adam going to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" you say. \"We'll figure it out later. I'm not that big,\" you say as you place your hand on your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen gave you another devilish smirk as he turns to you. \"Yet.\" He slowly walks towards you, gut and rump bouncing with every step. \"I hardly used that supplement on me and look at what a big cat I am now,\" he says, lifting up his shirt a little to expose his vast gut. You step back a bit as Stephen takes another few steps towards you. \"Think of what I can do to you.\" Your now up against the wall of Adam's bedroom, and Stephen is right in front of you. He leans in and says into your ear, \"Just think of what a foxy balloon I can turn you into. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Now let\u2019s get started, please undress completely while I set up my equipment\u201d Stephen began by placing his feeding equipment and breathing apparatus in the corner of the room and connected it to me on my mouth and nose while I undressed. Luckily I wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt at the time, though I was a little bit uncomfortable showing my body, and especially my penis to a huge guy like Stephan on the account that he and most of the furs in the city have covered those parts up with their bellies. Stephan gave me a nod of reassurance &amp; I continued to lay down and get myself comfortable for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m no doctor or scientist, but the technology he used was incredibly advanced, although it was very bulky, quite fitting for the bulky populace of Zaftig City. The breathing apparatus looked like it did in the movies, but there was also compressed gas tanks full of what was hopefully oxygen and relaxants should the feeding get frisky or painful. Then came the tanks of FATASS Serum in the feeding machine with powerful pumps, liquid food almost resembling lard, &amp; assorted restraints for the bed so I wouldn\u2019t need to move. The restraints were an unnerving thought for anyone else except me, as I was gaining into the future for my health and status in Zaftig City. Next came the mini toilet/cleaning robot that would keep my nether regions hygienic and flushed from my waste. \u201cAhh I see you\u2019ve taken an interest in my service drone. I call it B.lubbery, U.nder-region, T.oiletries for, L.ipid, E.xpansion, R.obot, or BUTLER\u2026 I designed him personally to take care of us fatter animals when we are reaching our limits of mobility &amp; beyond. It takes care of hygiene and basic maintenance of the nether regions and the soon to be huge FUPA. Plus, it allows other sorts of\u2026 activities for pleasure.\u201d Steven stammered nervously while fiddling with the restraints &amp; controls. The robot itself looked like a hovering orbital drone in the shape of a chicken egg, with many edges and outlines for robotic arms. However, all of its compartments were also compressed into the body and designed for cleaning and sexual stimulation of the anus, penus, and the FUPA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was gently laid down as Stephan was trying to adjust me for my feeding session with the restraints in my reverse supine position. As my pillow was fluffed &amp; my head gently tilted forward to see my new body, my breathing was slowly but surely accelerating into deeper wheezes. Thankfully, Stephan began to turn on the breathing gas tanks &amp; it seemed to taste not only like fresh air, but laughing gas. \u201cIs this *yawn* part of *sigh* the experiment too Stephan?\u201d I slurred through my feeding mask as the jaw opening gags and feeding tubes were set in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay friend.

Then, it inserted itself into the rectum along with the plastic, vibrating tube for my cock, much to my surprise &amp; arousal.

You have a feeling that this husky may be a friend of his and probably the same friend that he mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That husky is a childhood friend of mine. His name is Bartholomew Reddock. We used to compete in weight lifting meets together. He's a sumo wrestler now. I believe he's a yokozuna and the world's heaviest athlete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in awe at the revelation, yet it didn't surprise you that sumo wrestling would be a popular sport in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your friend is a sumo wrestler? How does he move at that size?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bartholomew's training as a sumo wrestler has helped him pack on a lot of muscle. He even showed me sumo techniques, yet I would rather stick to the weight lifting meets that are held a few times a year though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour drops in disbelief. If sumo wrestler grow ginormous in this city then there are many who are close to Bartholomew's size. You start blushing profusely as you daydream about being sumo sized and all the ladies who would admire your bulk and the envious men who look on as your walk by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still here buddy?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately snap out of your fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. I was just thinking about sumo wrestling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam chortles at your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem bro. Yet we may have to wait a while before you two can meet. Bartholomew lives in a luxurious part of town and the gate keepers there aren't too keen on seeing people who weigh less than 300 lbs. Also, he's a busy man. I believe he's currently dating a female sumo wrestler by the name of Susan Mc'Howl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pulls out his phone and shows you a picture of a larger Bartholomew with a slightly smaller female Rottweiler. Your jaw drops as you notice that the couple in the picture appear to be posing with a few gold trophies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean? You would be lucky if he had any free time to stop by for a visit. In the meantime...\"</span></div></div>",

What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam chortles at your apparent cluelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else would I throw a party? It's your welcoming party. By the time the party ends you'll definitely be closer to filling out that shirt you're wearing. Now let's do some get this place ready, little dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours you and Adam go on a literal cooking spree. The dishes that you two cooked could literally feed an army, but given that three more guests were expected the amount of food may not be enough depending on how large the other two guests were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be plenty of food for now. Looks like we managed to almost clear out the fridge. I'll have to buy more groceries tomorrow. Fortunately tomorrow's Saturday which means I should have off unless the police station calls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the doorbell to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Amy and the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam waddles to the door and opens it. Once the door was opened you spot Amy with a tiger and a wolfess. You also noticed that they brought a lost of food with them. Probably enough to feed someone of your current size for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in guys. Just place the food on the tables in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, the tiger, and wolfess enter Adam's house. As the tiger and wolfess place the food they brought on the tables you get a greater sense of their actual size and appearance. The tiger looked to be about 7'2\" and looked like he was pushing at least 700 lbs. He also had noticeable muscle definition as well. His fur was white with black stripes and his eyes were of a hazel hue. The wolfess on the other hand was at least an inch shorter than you and was probably the second skinniest person at the party. It was obvious that she weighed at least 250 lbs. The wolfess had black fur and grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure which of Adam's friends that you wanted to speak to besides Amy, but you finally decided to talk to the wolfess since the tiger was too busy making out with Amy at the moment. You quickly grab some food from the table, enough to fill your plate, and take a seat next to the wolfess. After taking a seat next to the wolfess you begin to strike up a conversation while eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that fox that Amy mentioned. I'm Melissa Wildhunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Melissa your name too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too. So I guess we're both sort of new to this city. It took me three months to gain 100 lbs. Yet it doesn't help that I have a super slow metabolism. So what occupation do you want to pursue once you reach a normal sized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have no idea yet, but a friend of Adam's is a sumo wrestler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumo wrestling sounds cool, but there are so many options out there too. I'm currently a scientist. I've been trying to find a way to up the flavor in food and get rid of the weird aftertaste that's currently in the food. By doing so it would lead to an increased in the average weight gain of they entire city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think what Melissa is saying is awesome wait till you hear this.\" The tiger interjected. \"I just started a new bulk up program that should help several underweight people attain their dream body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what your new foundation has been up to, Max?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be correct. The name's Maximilian Prowl. I'm Amy's husband by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then introduce yourself properly to Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you too. Hey let's play a party game. The party games in this town are always a great way to build your appetite and lower the metabolism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do these party games entail?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adam, can you fill the new guy on the details of party games that we play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Max.

I can show you how to play these games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adam let's start with a game of Food Warrior.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food Warrior? What type of game is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food Warrior is a type of eating contest invented. Unlike other eating contests participants must complete a challenge before eating. Once participants begin eating they have two minutes to eat as much food as possible before they are required to do another challenge. The cycle repeats until there is no more food, or if one participant remains. Everyone gains some weight, but theirs extra incentive for the winner.\" Max said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What incentive is that, Max?\" You asked in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I invented the game I'm offering the winner a chance to experience my bulk up program with a friend of their choosing. I myself can't win this prize, but I can offer two people of my choosing if I win. It's a win-win scenario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mighty generous Max.\" Melissa gasped in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me. My sponsors need proof that my program works and therefore insist that a person who's already fat and a skinny person to test the program before they allow me to market it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's your takeaway. You need funding for your program.\" Adam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct Adam. Plus if you win I can help you grow as big as your sumo wrestling pal. You two did wrestling together before and it may be time for the world to see the return of Big Dog. Yet whether you pursue sumo or regular wrestling is up to you, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see if I decide to return to my wrestling days, but right now I'm cool with where I'm at now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the game to begin. You and the other party goers had to do challenges such as hit a bull-eye's on a dart board or do a certain number of reps of a certain exercise before eating as much food as possible. Surprisingly you found the game to be a blast since the physical activity made you hungrier. After a few hours only three of you were left. You were surprised that Amy wasn't in the top three, but it was obvious that she was winded by the exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet by your judgement it seemed that everyone gained at least 10 lbs. Adam and Max were shirtless since they ripped them off a few challenges ago. You only made it far due to your new found hunger urges. You were currently attempting an apple bobbing challenge. As you attempt to bob for an apple Adam and Max were currently chowing down like madmen. After bobbing for an apple you attempt to eat it, but you find that you're too stuffed and bow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceed to watch Adam and Max try to out eat each other.

This fit me last week!\" Your eyes widen in surprise as you can't recall Adam or  Amy mentioning anything about other friend or roommate of Adam's. You decide to investigate the mysterious fur carefully as you don't know if this fur is a 'consensual gainer/fattener' or a random citizen who would blow up any thin fur he or she could get their hands on!  You decide to slink upstairs and then through the 2nd story hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are able to figure out that the noise is coming from the last door on the right, You walk quietly passing by what seems to be Adam's room, Considering it has rack of huge designer clothes that looks like it came from the store he works for.

But judging by the voice it seems to be a male. You almost get cold feet but you still press on, having come far too close to give up. You get closer to the door and thank you lucky stars that is opened up about a foot. You then peer through the opening carefully and then almost immediately get an eyeful of the unknown fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what an eyeful! This guy is huge! You see a Red Panda who has scarlet colored fur with dark brown colored limbs and belly, a cute white face and ears. His tail having pure white rings traveling down the entire length. You then you take in his entire size and see he is easily bigger than Adam (if that was even possible!) in more ways than one! Adam was a tall 6'10 while this giant was easily 8'6 if not more! As for his size he was probably pushing around 1,000 pounds! But that is were the differences start. While Adam looked like an Ex-Jock this guy still looked like a power lifter still in his prime, you check him out for anything other attributes to discern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body type was quite different from Adam's as well. While the German Shepard seemed to be a bit top-heavy this Red Panda was defiantly packing more 'down stairs' His hips, legs and er.....  derri\u00e8re were defiantly bigger and thicker than his belly, chest and arms. You blush from staring at his lower exterminates and decide to distract yourself by looking for what he was doing. You see a pair of pants around his legs and see his thick strong arms bulging from effort to slide the pants over his rather generous back side and wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twisted and jumped in various ways to to get the pants on but nothing seemed to be working. All he manged to get on were grey boxers and a tight black shirt that had the word security on it and a name tag with the name Junjie on it. \"Is he a bouncer or something?\" You continue to stare and then notice his eyes are a stunning mint green.... and are looking right back at you! You are frozen from shock and fear as the red panda forgets the pants and lumbers toward you with a neutral expression on his face and opens the door and he.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't want to run the risk of anyone in the front of the store seeing you without clothes, so you sneak out the back door. Immediately to your right you see a bright green dumpster with the name of the store on it. You lift up the lid and see scores of discarded clothes. Some have gaping holes, others have stains, but all of them must have been unsellable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking through the dumpster, you find something that will cover you up: A pair of grey basketball shorts (meant for a fur easily three times your size, so you have to hold them up yourself) and a red t-shirt that just hangs off of you (again, clearly meant for a fur hundreds of pounds bigger than you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beggars can't be choosers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing down the alley, you're heeding Adam's advise. Just by looking at your slim frame, any resident of Zaftig City will immediately know you're an outsider. Though some of these people seem nice, they might have ulterior motives. Adam was a great example of that. He seemed willing to help a total stranger until he started getting pushy about fattening you up. So by sticking to alleys, you're less likely of running into another fur than walking around on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time wandering through the alleys of Zaftig City, your stomach starts to growl. When was the last time you ate? You cannot remember. But the pains in your stomach are intense; you need food right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeaking your head out of the alley, you scope out the area. A print shop, some accountancy firm, some government offices, but nothing food-related. But if you squint your eyes, you think you see a supermarket a few blocks down the road. It appears to be one of those large chain grocers and not a mom-and-pop store. You have no money on you, and you don't want to go down that route of pleading to strangers again, but you might be able to swipe something of the shelves. Your shorts have no pockets, but your clothes are so loose and baggy on you that you can easily smuggle something out of that supermarket. Hell, you could probably sneak an entire feast out with your tent-like clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, you might get caught stealing, and you're not in the mood to develop a relationship with the Zaftig City police.

You try and get yourself free from his grip, but the size and strength of the dog is far greater than you can overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here,\" said Adam, staring directly into your eyes, his face inches away from yours. \"I'm trying to do you a favor here. I'm not saying you should get as big as me. But just make it look like you've eaten something in the past year. Otherwise, something bad might happen to you. Some freak might still a hose up your butt and blow you up like a balloon. A crazy scientist might use you like a lab rat and use you to see just how a fat a fox can get. Or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or some psychopathic fat ass of a dog might hold me hostage in a clothing store.\" you retort. \"I'll take my chances. So, let me go. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sighed in frustration. \"Okay, fine. You wanna be like this? Alright, by all means. But you know what a quarter ton of a fat ass dog can do? This!\" He body-checks with his entire weight. The blow knocks you backwards so hard you end up rolling a couple of times before you finally stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe German Shepherd walks over to and picks you up by your arm. You're still too dazed and confused from the blow to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor fox. Maybe he wouldn't have be hurt so much if he had a bit of meat on him,\" said Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then drags you over to a nearby wall and pushes you into it. The German Shepard then pressed his gut into you. Your entire torso is pinned to the wall by soft pudge of Adam's belly. Struggling to move, you find that your arms are stuck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, am I squishing you? teased Adam. He presses his girth into you even further, making it even harder to breathe. \"And I'm not even that big of a fur for Zaftig City. Imagine what'd happen if you came across a true fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheezing for breath, you try to wiggle yourself free.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wait, what do you mean that I'm going to get fat 'sooner or later'?\" you asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something about this city that just makes people, well, blow up. Maybe it's the food, maybe it's the culture. I dunno. But what I do know is what I've seen. Every once in a while, a skinny fur like you pops up in town. They say that they're going to stay trim and fit. But it's always those ones who blow up the biggest. A couple of years ago, I met this guy about your size, maybe a little taller. He was so put off by the sheer fatness of everyone who lives here. The guy kept going on about how he'll go to the gym everyday and watch what he eat and all. Well, last time I saw him, he pushing well over six hundred pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so some people lose control and get fat. But what do you mean that someone might try and blow me up?\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people here are okay with skinny furs. Others are not. And the ones who aren't tend to be a little...aggressive when it comes to making skinny furs bigger,\" Adam said. \"And, well, I should know, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam! Where are you? The cash register is malfunctioning again!\" shouted a voice from across the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, not again,\" the German Shepherd said. \"Give me some time to fix this.\" He pointed down a hallway. \"Until then, go down the hall, and go through the second door on the left. In there, we keep all the clothes we can't sell. Irregular fits, minors tears, you know. Go in there and find something to wear. I'm sure nobody will miss anything that you take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADAM?!?\" the voice shrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gotta go! I'll join you when I'm done!\" The bulky pup turned away from you and sped-walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting any of the other employees to see you in the nude, you quickly ran down the hall and into the door Adam indicated. The room was very dark. You rubbed your hand against the wall until you found a light switch. You then saw that the room was filles with boxes of unsellable clothes, and you went to work finding something to cover you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, you managed to find something to wear. You pulled out from one of the boxes a pair of black sweatpants, one leg significantly longer than the other. But they were designed for someone much taller and wider than you, so you rolled up the legs to make sure they wouldn't drag on the ground. You tightened the sweatpants' drawstring as much as you could which luckily made the waist small enough so they hung albeit loosely from your hips. To cover your torso, you found a simple white tank that flowed almost down to your knees. You didn't look exactly fashionable, but you weren't naked anymore and that's what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on one of the boxes of clothes, you thought about your situation. Adam was pretty adamant that, like it or not, you'll end up fat in this city. But you had your doubts. A city that made its citizens obese sounded absurd, even if some maniacs were running around fattening furs. And although Adam made it sound as if he was being kind in offering to help plump you up, who said that you wanted to be fat? And how fat was fat enough to be \"safe\" here? And what if Adam was actually one of those psychos fattening people against their will?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam walked through the door around ten minutes later. \"Sorry about that,\" he apologized. \"There's a stupid button on the register and if you hit it the only way to fix it is to go through this whole messy process. But I fixed everything.\" The German Shepherd eyed your new outfit. \"Going pretty... causal, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no longer stark naked, so these clothes seem to serve their purpose,\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true. So, have you thought about what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and still have lots of questions,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. Go ahead.\"</span></div></div>",

'Adonis Adam', then used to call me!\" He then lifted up his arm and flexed. You could make out a fair bit of muscle hidden underneath layers of adipose. \"300 pounds of solid muscle! 7% body fat! Unfortunately, I slipped while lifting and got a nasty injury. So no more body building for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what? You moved here and discovered a love for cheesecake or something?\" you jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughed. \"They make some pretty good cheesecake here! I'll be sure to make you try a slice or three. No, when I got here I landed a job at a research facility. But not as a researcher. More as a test subject. The doctors wooed me, saying my physique was perfect for their lastest experiments. They signed me for a sweetheart deal. I really should have been more careful. I still beat myself up over how stupid I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the first day of the trials, one of those damn researchers drugged me. I woke up tied to a bed hooked up to a bunch of machines. They had this hose secured to my mouth and they forced this sickly sweet slurry down my throat. Five times, everyday. They had kidnapped me for months. Each day was a cycle of chugging down that stuff and fading into unconsciousnes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were they experimenting on you for?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. But whatever the doctors were filling me up with blew me up bad. When the investigators busted into the institution to arrest everyone, I was getting close to 800 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" you exclaimed. \"They fattened you up that big?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. What's worse is that since I was tied down 24/7, all my muscles atrophed. I was pretty much a helpless blob. Nearly a half ton of blubber. I was all but rolled out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you aren't now. So what did you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Adam. \"I went on a bit of a diet. The first couple of hundred pounds were easy to shed. Without that sludge being pumped into me everyday, those pounds just melted off. And it wasn't like I could waddle down the street and pig out on burgers or anything. My leg muscles had wasted away so much that I need help getting around. When I got to 600, I was able to start doing some lifting at the gym. It helped me build my leg and arm muscles back up. Eventually, I got down to 475 but I just could lose anymore weight. The food here is just too damn good, I guess. That, and I got used to the size. A good mix of beef and blubber, I think. I have put on a little more muscle. It helps carry the weight around. I think these days I'm hovering around 530.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you said. \"I'm really sorry that happened to you. It must have been traumatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the past now,\" Adam said dismissively. \"But that's why I think you can trust me. I know what some of the crazies here can do. And I wouldn't inflict what I went through on anyone else. I consider it a kind of promise to myself. So while knowing my history may not make you wholely trust me, I sure hope that it shows that I have nothing but good intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving listened to Adam's story, you got the sense that he seems genuine about wanting to help you. So while you got the sense that you can't quite entirely put your full trust in him yet, you started feeling a bit more safer around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" you said. \"I can see why would want to help someone in a situation like mine. But I still have one more question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam nodded. \"Okay. Shoot.\"</span></div></div>",

I might want to get back up there again. I might even go bigger. But if I do, it will be because I want to. And I'll be sure to do lots of squats along the way so I can haul my big self around this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine...but, I....I mean...it's just that...\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" the dog said. \"I think you're just nervous. Come here, I want to show you something.\" You carefully began approaching Adam. \"I'm not going to hurt you or anything. Just stand right in front of me.\" You stepped up to Adam, who towered over you. You saw as one of his paws yanked up his shirt, exposing his hefty, brown-furred belly. \"Let me see your paw.\" You cautiously raised a paw up, and Adam took it in his. He placed your paw on his belly; it sunk a couple of inches. \"How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels...soft, like a marshmallow. And really warm...\" you replied. You brought up your other paw and placed it on Adam's belly. You then began moving your paws in small circular motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liking it?\" Adam asked. You said nothing but your cheeks burned brightly. \"You also know what's great about being a quarter-ton fur? I just take up so much space now...\" Adam reached for your paws and dragged them over to his fleshy flanks. Due to the size of the dog's gargantuan giant, this yanked you forward and soon you body was hugging tightly against Adam's pudgy gut. \"Hey look! I'm so big that you can't fit your arms around me!\" You ignored him as you were too busy nuzzling your face into his pillow-like abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think now?\" Adam asked. \"I'm big, soft, and wide.

A strong, anti-septic smell clouds your sense of smell. You look around yourself, you recognize the room. Or you think you do. You feel like you remember dreaming it. It's a hospital lobby. Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick chill races up and down your spine. This cold is very real. It might help to find something to cover up with.  You take two deep breaths, then tuck your hands into your armpits for warmth. Your soaked fur leaves a translucent trail wherever you walk, you take a mental note to inform the staff. If you find anyone that is. You approach the main desk, only to discover a seat with an abandoned sweater hanging off the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anybody there?\" You say between bouts of chattering teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. The rumble of the rain deafening in the silence of the hospital. With nothing to lose, nor anyone to tell you no, you walk around the counter and scoop up the sweater. The fabric swallows your thin arms and dangles low to the ground. The owner of the sweater must be at least three times your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ID badge dangling from the collar confirms your theory. A positively cherubic fox smiles for the camera. His plump cheeks dimple with the curve of his lips. His loose jowls caught in mid jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony Gaines? Security?\" You read the black text beneath his picture. \"Like this guy is stopping anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for warmth, you throw the billowing sweater over your naked body. The thick fabric dangles past your groin and rubs against your knees while you stand. The faint smell of sweat and grease emanates from the fiber. You grimace a little, better this than nothing you suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne cursory glance at his desk and you realize the great big security guard left his sandwich half-eaten. Not to judge, but you figure a guy of his stature never left a bite behind. Not unless something urgent happened. You gulp and jiggle the mouse at the computer terminal at his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen saver leaves to reveal he started a game of mine-sweeper. He started it four hours ago, with the clock still ticking. You minimize the window to find nothing else interesting on his desktop. A sigh escapes your lips while you try and click around for something helpful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHospital Intranet? That piques your interest. You double click it to reveal his e-mail minimized in the task tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonygaines@zcgh.net: strange happenings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fellow security staff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone else hear the stuff going on in the East Wing at night? I thought it was the graveyard shift moving cadavers at first, but the morgue downstairs stayed untouched when I checked later. I might just be getting paranoid, but someone's sneaking in after hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re:strange happenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIDK Tony, I don't hear it on my shift. Could just be the pipes. This place is old as sin after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scroll through message after message, much of it the same. Tony seems convinced of something though. You check the garbage bin of his e-mail, it hasn't been emptied that day. The e-mail is addressed to him, from himself, and deleted. Curious, you click it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat dope,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep this East Wing business to yourself or there are going to be consequences<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- J\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thunder clap shakes the air outside, and causes the lights to flicker, then go out. The computer terminal shuts down and leaves you in the dark. Thankfully, your natural night vision begins to set in. You can see, but not well enough to navigate your unfamiliar surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search the desk and find a penlight. Once more, better this than nothing. You click the light on and make your way to the front door. Much to your surprise, a police officer awaits you. Much like Tony, he appears to be thrice your own size..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, you freeze in place. You've never been one to break the law. Yet it seemed all to convenient that someone show up when you learn a little more about this Tony fellow. Rather than risk meeting whatever fate he did, you bolt in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer attempts to follow you, only to slide in the water you tracked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe falls to the ground and cries out in pain. He lays there and groans for a moment. This is your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash down the hall. The baggy sweater catching your feet ever so often. You stumble, but manage to keep some balance. You check door after door in an attempt to hide. Your paws fumbling over the knobs in the dark. Finally one door works. You throw open the door and run inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness stares back at you from the depths of a stairwell. Heavy panting and lumbering footsteps echo down the hall. Someone's on your trail. Cautious, but deliberate, you move into the darkness. You hunt each step with your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nagging thought came to mind. How far will this lead you? Some part of you is convinced it might lead out. The same part that drew you to the hospital for shelter, perhaps. The scent of formaldehyde stings your nose the further you walk along. You point the penlight ahead and notice a metal door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morgue is just ahead. You gulp and peek over your shoulder. The chances of you making it in one piece might  very well be in the hands of the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the metal door and lock it behind you. That might keep some pursuers at bay. At least for awhile. You pace around the chilled metal room. Rows and rows of the dead rested before you. You focus the light on a stainless steel table. Judging by the instruments and tools surrounding it, you figure someone used it not too long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few discarded syringes dotted an empty dish. An empty IV pouch sat beside the table. Odd, in that the dead had little use for life preserving measures. Someone operated on a living patient, you are certain. A pile of clothing is folded with care on the floor by the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection they appear similar in size to the sweater now draped upon your body. What exactly happened to this Tony fellow? Perhaps you did not want to know. You take a few steps back, when a bright flashlight beam lit up your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop from earlier somehow got through the lock. You look in his paw and notice a key ring dangling from his wrist. Who gave him that, you wonder? You hold your hands up and sigh. Your first day you remember in the city, and it's going conclude in jail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I found you first. There are others trying to find you.\" The cop held ups his own hands. \"I thought I told you to get out of the city first, why did you come back to the hospital.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't remember you talking to me. I don't even remember you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, not even my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I don't even remember my own name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's best we speak in private. Just come with me and I promise I will get you out of here in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's small and sparsely furnished with a desk, a couple chairs, a cot, some filing cabinets, a poster board, and so on. Basically what everyone might expect to find in a typical small office. Outside the storm seems as terrible as every and the few trees that can be seen through the window sway heavilly under the wind and the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to regain your composure and try to get your head together but that nearly goes out the window when you feel a hand thump down on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, heart pounding, mind filled with cliches from slasher movies, but the figure is dressed in tan pants and a green shirt overlaid with an orange vest and topped with a wide-brimmed green hat. It takes you another moment to notice the figure is a rather jovial looking gray furred wolf. The wolf was quite stout, looking almost as wide as he was tall, as his belly, which was like a great ball, was barely contained by his uniform and only lightly squeezed by his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to frighten you like that,\" he smiles with a very faint southern accent, \"But I don't get many guests in my office, especially not on a day like this. And <i>especially</i> especially not naked as the day they were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this you look down and blush as you realize you are indeed completely naked, though the fur of your privates seems to hide them well, you still duck behind one of the filing cabinets out of embarrassment as the wold just laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, no need to be so jumpy,\" he smiles, \"I'm not one to judge. Besides, you aren't the first one to show up completely naked and looking confused and lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particularly gets your attention, as it seems others might had found this place much the same way you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" the wolf pulls out a towel from a nearby closet, \"You look like you could use a warm shower, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf leads you through the door in the back of the office into a small bedroom, though the bed is little more than a double mattress on some blocks. Through another door is a nice bathroom which he ushers you into, \"get nice and warm and clean. We'll talk once you're feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly you hop in, glad to feel the warmth leach the chill from your bones. You spend maybe a bit longer in the shower than you mean to, glad for the heat, before finally, reluctantly, getting out and toweling off. When you get out he has a nice hot meal waiting, mostly park foods of hot dogs, burgers, popcorn, pretzels, soda and a nice big hot fudge Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The concession stand is right next door,\" the wolf smiled, \"I was able to make a quick dash from here to there and back with some food for you. Don't worry, it's all free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eat the wolf began explaining that there had been a odd occurrence over the years of beings showing up in the park, naked and with no memory of how they got there. nobody had seen how they arrived, and there had been no records of them in the town before. it was as though they just appeared there for some reason, and yet no one had ever seen it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes it gets busy too,\" the wolf chuckled, \"Had at least half a dozen appear in near the exact same spot on the same day just hours apart. Took us a week to get them sorted out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ranger finished you couldn't help but yawn, having been more tired than you thought. With a smile the ranger lets you snuggle into his bed for the time being. \"I'm sorry, you yawn as you drift off, \"I don't even know your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smiles, \"It's Rodger.\" Though even as he says it you drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later you yawn and stretch, memories slowly coming back about that had happened as you slowly get up and spy a stack of clothes in a nearby chair. As you pull them on you glance in a nearby mirror and are surprised to see your formerly lithe body now sported a small belly. True, you had pigged out a bit before you fell asleep, but it hadn't felt like that much at the time. It wasn't a large belly though, barely sticking out four inches from flat. Cute and shapely though far from a burden. Though it is a little unsettling as you slip on the remaining clothes that they all seem a tad large even with your slightly rounder middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Rodger comes back and smiles, \"Good to see those clothes fit, I honestly had to guess your size and I wasn't sure if I got it right. They're lost and found items, and don't worry, they've been missing for a while so it's unlikely anyone is going to come for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly you wonder for a moment what events could have caused one or more individuals to loose their shirt and/or pants in the park, but shake it off quickly not needing the imagery in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm seems to have stopped and so you feel you're ready to face the day. Before you leave Rodger gives you his number in case anything happens and you need his help as well as some numbers of folks who might give you some help also. Once more thanking the wolf for his generous hospitality you step boldly out of the cabin into the bright sunshine of a new day full of promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where to go....</span></div></div>",

Her belly sagged like a great water balloon which was being gently squeezed by the belt on her dress. Her breasts were watermelon shaped monsters twice the size of the very fruits they were shaped like. Her butt was like2 bean bag chairs with the fluffy tail coming out. Her face was that of an angel with no neck as her second chin covered it it so well and her cheeks challenged even the chubbiest cherub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she smiles in a sing song type voice, \"would like anything special today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I'm broke miss,\" you blush somewhat, unsure where to look as you glance over her large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny gall nods, \"That's alright, if you're low on cash I actually have some old stock we were going to throw away. It's not bad, just a bit pass being 'fresh' since it's more than a day old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offers you some doughnuts shaped like breasts and takes a very suggestive eclair herself sucking on it till the cream was out of it and says you can have as many as you would like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to have as many as you like dear,\" she smiles, \"No charge, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to eat the breast shaped goodies and suck the cream out before swallowing the soft doughy outsides. She then offers you a chocolate bunny cake that would soon be expired. The cake was like the bear but it was an obese rabbit fem bigger than the bear. She watches as you eat it piece by piece, blushing as you eat the more suggestive parts.

This must be the luckiest day of your life! ...Or at least the luckiest day you can ever remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, it's the only day you can ever remember as well.

There might be \"Better\" places to have a good time, but also could tell that you'd probably be able to go wild with the money at this place and still have plenty ofmoney to use later.  Not to mention with a free buffet and the description of some of the large ladies, how could it go wrong?  You tried not to appear over eager, the last thing you want to happen is for one of the bouncers to ask for your ID thinking your some peppy teen who only 'looks' old, not to mention you would really not like being thrown out into the poring rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the blacked out doors was like having someone slap you in the face with a dirty wet towel, the slight drowsy ness caused by the rain was wiped off, and in it's place a kind of greasy residue that felt low quality and filled with empty calories.  The music did not help the atmosphere any better as it was the usual pop star dribble that's constantly being played on the radio.  Though you did hear lots of cheering and hollering suddenly, you wish you knew what it was for though as there was a black wall right in front of the front door way so that no one could sneak a peak at the show as the doors opened.  Going around your small bodied self came face to face with a very hefty bulldog with a large billowing gut that stuck out of his shirt and hung over the crotch of his pants, and ripped arms that were crossed.  He gave you a sinister look, apparently having a bad day seeing as he was brandishing both broken sunglasses and a black eye.  You might not have an ID, but money is just as good if done correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, looks like you had a rough day man\" you said as you quickly began to pay the entree fee for the club and the free buffet coupon, and then with a quick handshake (if not slightly forced handshake that you swore could have crippled your hand) you left a fifty, which you hope was as much as you thought it was seeing that the entree fee felt a little too cheap.  \"Why don't you get yourself some good sunglasses and a good meal on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work as the bulldog gave you a small smile before letting you through into the dimly lit club where you immediately noticed the spotlights on the pole front and center stage.  Spinning around on the pole was the Golden Retriever that went by Butter, and it was quite an appropriate name as she slipped around on the pole, not to mention the color similarities.  Mesmerized you watched as the massive belly flailed about unconstrained, occasionally slapping at her knees.  Her massive cheeks on display while her tail wagged happily perched on top, the two tan furred masses not even having the convenience of underwear, though with a tennis ball kept in her mouth you might add.  Then you realized what the audience was cheering about as Butter climbed up the pole and hung herself upside down as her legs held on tight to the pole.  Gravity quickly took it's course as the huge belly flopped into her face, including her bloated breasts.  With the apron of lard now out of the way, the dog's pussy was on display for everyone to see.  It didn't last long as the song quickly ended with butter spinning on the pole and sliding to the front of the stage, dropping the tennis ball and getting into a  begging position, her belly obscuring her thick legs and her fat arms squishing her breasts together while she looked cute giving puppy dog eyes.  There was plenty of cheering as the people close by took bills and stuck it in the rolls of her fat while she waddles off with the tennis ball in her mouth and a heavy swing in her step to emphasize her preposterously proportioned posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your pants suddenly looking like a tent, it was easy to tell that you were going to like this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your mind began to swim with ideas.  Normally you would just have compromised by eating at the buffet and watch morbidly obese women flaunt their rolls and folds about.  Though, with the massive wallet that still felt as heavy as you originally found it, you were starting to get more ambitious.  If some public swing around the pole got you this aroused, what would a private one on one performance be like?</span></div></div>",

Though bowing outwards giving the impression of a full belly.  The legs were engulphed in a cone of lard, the cankles partially covering up her tiny feet while her beach ball sized ass hung down to slap against the back of her non existent calves.  A big lazy fluffy tail would wave behind her, but would slowly rest within the massive canyon her two cheeks created.  The fox's fat back seemed to create a bloated stair way up to the back of her bloated neck, arms that would have normally been normal sized for a morbidly obese fur turned her tiny arms into sacks of fat that oozed and propped them outwards, tiny clawed fingers swollen to where she'd have difficulty picking up utensils.  Large flabby breasts that may have appeared normal on a larger fur, hung heavily to each side, slightly flattened and immature looking.  And up the cascade of chins rested a slightly plump short muzzle flanked by basket ball sized cheeks, topped with massive ears that 'would' have made her four feet tall if they stood upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly became erect, watching as Stevens waddled slowly towards you with each huffing breath, legs now obscured by her tan and creamy expanse of belly.<br>\r\n\"My my, I never knew that there would still be someone so skinny before\" She said, her very mature voice constantly throwing you through a loop as her appearance was very child like, \"this is so fun, someone almost twice my height and yet I'm probably... *huff huff* three times your weight.\"  Steven's gave a very girlish giggle at her suitor while you nervously smiled back, your erection now growing rock solid.  The Fennec Fox spotted this and brought herself up as close as she could to you, the massive belly squishing against your legs while your penis was tip to tip with her muzzle.<br>\r\n\"Look like we match\" you said with a smile, seeing the lust in Steven's eyes.  She began trying to reach out, but her tiny arms were too short and clogged with lard to undo your pants, though she did try, whimpering slightly in desperation as she flailed about slightly.  With one swift motion you unzipped your pants and pulled down your trousers to expose your throbbing staff.  Stevens murred, leaning forward as her rough tongue wrapped around your shaft and began to swallow it, appearing massive compared to her small muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon began to travel back and forth, tongue dancing across the shaft, but you were already in heat.  Bending over slightly you grabbed her fat head with both arms and began thrusting into her the Fennec's eyes swelling with delight as this continued, her tiny arms trying desperately to grab at whatever she could that might help stimulate her more.  The thrusting sending Stevens in a wild shake that caused her flab to undulate and her rolls to slap against each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat soon beaded across your forehead as you tried as hard as you could to hold it back, but with one last thrust the dam broke, your seed pumping itself into the short fox.   She meeped at the sudden influx of spooge but quickly swallowed it up until the tap went empty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd... *wheeze* that... was amazing\" she said, her chest violently rising and falling while she tried to catch her breath.  She then collapsed backwards, her body oozing to the sides as she tried to wipe the sweat off her forehead, her belly swelling out forwards as it tried to engulph her stubby feet.  You kneeled down and then began wrapping your legs around her, bringing her into a sitting position and holding her there in your arms.<br>\r\n\"I... I think I love you\" you promptly began kissing her, the huge jowls and cheeks on her face growing bright red under her fur as she apparently was having similar feelings about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

You'll <i>find</i> it, just fine.  You just don't know when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  Maybe there's a place where you can inquire as to the whereabouts of such places?  You certainly don't want to start asking random furs on the street where you can find the best and cleanest strippers.  Maybe you can find a town directory.  Yeah, that's what you'll do; look at a directory.  Or a phone book, if those still exist...  But where are you going to find one?  You run all of these thoughts through your head as you're walking down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the answers come to you, though, as you walk by a pair of glass doors.

You look about the surprisingly small lobby, hoping to find a pay-phone with a phone book hanging off of it, but all you see are a couple of chairs and a rather imposing rhinoceros security guard.  You'll just have to ask one of the tellers if they have one...  And while you're at it, you might as well open an account; you get the feeling that this whole \"situation\" isn't going to be a temporary thing, and you'll be here for a while.  You're about to get in line when you notice a new teller opening up a booth next to the goat.  You wait a moment, seeing if someone else wants to abandon the line and speak to the new teller, but nobody does; either they don't notice it, or they just don't care, for some reason.  You shrug, and walk up to the new teller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a rather thick orange fox; while you can't see her from the chest down, you can tell that she enjoys her food just as much as everyone else in the city.

You take a moment to count the number of white-furred chins she has running down her face, but realize that you're already being awkward enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hello,\" you say in a subdued manner.  \"I...

How much would you like to deposit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out your wallet and grab at least half of the bills.  Thumbing through them, you count out $3,200.  You're still surprised at how much you have.  \"Uh, I'd like to deposit $3,200, please.  ...  Do you need my PIN?\" you say, grimacing in your head.  You forgot you had amnesia (whoa, meta!); you don't remember who you even <i>are</i>, much less your pin number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that won't be necessary, sir!  I know who you are; no need to trouble you for your PIN...\"  You hand her the money, which she promptly place in a drawer under her desk.  She types some numbers into a computer.  \"Thank you, sir!  Your account is now at...\"  She stops to read the screen. \"...  $57,604,454,134.03.\"  You gasp, and she smiles.  \"Yes, it's a lot of money.  Even if I were as rich as you, I'd still be shocked by how much I had!  ...  Can I help you with anything else,  sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  I don't suppose I could set up debit account?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir!  How much would you like to put in it?  I think...  $300,000.00 would be a good amount, yes?\"  You nod silently.  She punches a few numbers and other bits of information (too fast for you to see, though), and gives you a form.  \"Sign here, please.\"  You do as instructed, and hand it back to her.  \"Thank you, sir!  Be back in a moment.\"  She hits the ENTER key and lifts herself from her chair with a grunt.  You watch her bulk quiver as it fights gravity, orange- and white-furred flesh seeping out of her top and a cavernous navel and lovely tummy-pooch peeking out from above her exceptionally-tight pants.  She walks with a juicy little sway to a machine a few feet away from her desk; you eye the ass-flesh sloppily jiggling as she takes each plodding step.  She holds out her hand and catches a card as the machine spits it out, and waddles back over to you, panting.  \"He- *wheeze* Here you a- *pant* are, sir...\"  She hands you the golden piece of plastic, which you accept eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" you say courteously, trying to conceal a burgeoning erection and a wicked smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have...  Have *pant* a nice day, sir...\"  She exhales.  \"I need a break...\" she says under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, ma'am!\"  You're about to turn around and leave when you realize that you forgot to ask for what you actually came here for.  \"Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...  Uh, yes, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you have a phone book or directory I could borrow?\"  You ask, sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...  Of...  Of course, sir...\" she says, equal parts winded and exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" you say.  She shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...  It's quite alright...\"  She lifts herself up, once more, and waddles a few sluggish steps over to a shelf behind her.  She balances herself on it, nearly knocking over a tiny potted cactus that sat on top, before bending over deeply and looking through an assortment of books on the bottom shelf.  Unbeknownst to her, however, her pants have ridden quite a bit lower than they were a moment ago...  She wobbles a bit as she bears her nearly-bare buttocks at you, two big, orange-furred bags of soft, juicy, dimpled ass-flesh, on display for the whole bank.  She sways back and forth, perusing the books in front of her, as her bushy orange tail swings left and right, accentuating her jiggling ass and the white fur that lined her butt-crack just beneath it.  'Twas a sight to behold, indeed; your erection certainly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thoroughly-exquisite minute, she found the book she was looking for.  \"Ah, here it is...\"  She pulled it out, slowly righted herself (\"Oh, mercy me...\" she said, under her breath), and plodded back over to you.  \"Here...  Here you *gasp* are...\"  She hands you a phone book, as per your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it back to you in just a moment, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no!  ...  Er, that *pant* won't be necessary...  Jus- *wheeze* just keep it...\"  You could see that she just didn't want to get up again, so you took her up on her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...  Thank you, miss!  You have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...  You, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away, you decide to thumb through the book.  Looking through it, you're surprised to see a section devoted entirely to the \"adult entertainment\" you were looking for.  Skimming through the listed \"businesses,\" you see a few that catch your interest.</span></div></div>",

The rain isn't actually all that cold, but you would rather not be soaked completely through anyways. The distant thunder seems to hint at more coming no matter what you want. Moving down the street, you pass by all number of places. The streets are mostly clear of people except for a few going from place to place. You pause in front of one window, getting a view of a massively fat woman strapped down with a huge funnel in her mouth. A number of people surround her, pouring things down the funnel into her, and there seems to be a bit of a line to add. It's hard to tell what species she is so swollen up, but you think maybe a cheetah. Someone seems to notice your free show as the curtain is pulled in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause at the corners to check the street names, and are pretty sure you're heading the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I can remember that map, but nothing about myself,\" you say to yourself as you dodge a steady stream of water coming off of a rooftop, and keep moving.</span></div></div>",

You reach the address, and check it several time against your scribbled note. Yep, this is the place. Looking more like a park or something, a wide grassy expansive is bordered by a tall wrought iron fence, small trees and bushes dotted here and there. On the hill in the middle is a large multistory manor house, all windows lit but with curtains drawn. There's room for parking in front, but there aren't many vehicles at all. Though considering the hovering units that you saw some of the people using earlier, that might explain some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing the large gate open, you start up the path. As you get closer to the door, you see that the path is lined by a number of topiary, all of them consisting of extra large fattened people of various species in suggestive poses. You finally reach the door, and are pleased by the porch awning, glad to be out of the rain that continues to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and are about to knock when you see a sign next to the door: \"Pull rope to ring bell, and wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mentioned rope hangs right next to the sign (how did you manage to miss it?), and you give it two steady pulls. Two long gong-like rings can be heard from within. A few moments after that, steady thumps can be felt in the floor. You can actually almost feel yourself bouncing in time with the thumps.

Please, do come in,\" the person says, respect obvious in the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it's female, but it sounds deeper than you might think. As the huge double doors are thrown open, you see why.  Standing in the doorway is a true mountain of a woman, a cow you are almost certain. Her massive stomach stretches out far in front of her, flowing over the front of her legs and nearly reaching the ground. Two huge fleshy breasts sit atop her stomach, nearly ready to slide off either side. Her face is round and flabby, and her neck is nearly impossible to see as her fat chins and cheeks flow into her meaty shoulders. Her arms are swathed in flesh, upper arms seemingly wider than most people's shoulders, maybe even two. Her lower arms are hard to move, the fat from her upper arm flowing across her elbows, while the lower arm fat similarly restricts her wrist movements. Even her hands and fingers are swollen with fat, looking like overfilled sausages.  Her globular butt can be see on either side of her stomach even, flowing down into her huge thighs, each cheek and thigh likely weighing more than most average size people (though you think the average might be a lot higher in this place). Her calves are just as fattened, pressing down to nearly cover her wide hoof-like feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is wearing a black dress that would likely make a nice tent for someone your size, but it is still pulled tight across the vast expanse of her flesh. It is low cut in front exposing a vast valley of cleavage, and as she turns to step to the side, you see that it is even lower cut in back, showing the huge plain of folds and chasms of her back fat. What fur you do see is the typical white and black pattern, and her black hair is done up into a bun. She has some tastefully done makeup on her fleshed face, with just one pair of simple earrings hanging from her long ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk inside, past her, and she shuts the door behind you. The entryway is two stories tall, lit with a high chandelier, with several wide doorways and doors on this floor, as well as two large gently sloping staircases leading up. She gives you a motion through one of the doors, into a sitting room it seems. Even that movement sends waves rippling through her form, overtaken only when she takes a slow rolling step then another, causing the thumps you felt before. Filling a whole wide couch by herself, you take a seat across from her. Now her stomach is reaching the floor, and flowing across it for quite a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before sir, it is very good to see you again. If you had called ahead that you were coming, I could have made preparations for your arrival,\" she said with a smile, bowing her head towards you. Totally stunned by her size and how yet another person seems to know you so well, you do your best to think on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just in the area and decided to stop by, had to get out of the rain,\" you manage to squeak out, mentally berating yourself. You then try again, your voice a little more serious and even, \"It's been a really off day for me though, so I'm out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir. I am pleased you decided to stop at my establishment in any case. Is there anything my finest patron will require before we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patron?\" you think to yourself, but you voice, \"Begin? Begin what?\"</span></div></div>",

Sorry, like I said before, it's been a really off day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still looks a bit concerned at you, but nods her head and reaches to her side. On a table beside her couch rests a couple of small hand bells. Picking up the small silver one there, she gives it a ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, girls, we have a guest,\" she calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like they must have been waiting for this, as within a few seconds, they start walking in. A dozen women, all in party dresses file in. They come to a stop facing you, with a break right in the middle for the madam cow on her sofa. And you can see some of the meaning behind the break. On one side the women are all in the plump range, while on the other the women are all various stages of fat, but none of them come close to the lady of the house. The species run quite a range throughout this collection. They are all doing their best to give you various seductive poses, which is doing little to help your situation in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now these are the girls that I have free right now, the others are a bit more occupied.

She slowly rises from her seat, it's like watching an avalanche in reverse, all of this shifting mass slowly lifting up and settling into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" she seems to respond to you, before turning to one of the larger girls, \"Looks like you are going to be in control here for the next day or two, and probably a while after that as well.\" The woman quickly answers, \"Yes, Madam Belledawn.\" The madam then slowly starts her rolling walk, tremors bouncing through the floor. \"Come along, sir, if you are still feeling up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you can detect a bit of elation in her voice, as you stand up and following the rolling hills of her buttocks.

Despite the short distance back into the entryway and to one of the doors in the back under the stairs, it takes her quite a bit longer to travel that distance. You don't really mind though, watching her flesh moving around within the confines of her tent dress, your body mirroring your thoughts as your erection continues to throb in your pants. Finally reaching the door, she opens it wide and shifts her body through the doorway with you close behind. Inside is a bedroom, as well furnished and decorated as the rest of the building you have seen. The bed is extremely wide and low and covered in silky satin sheets. The click of the door shutting causes you to turn back and see her behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think we need to be interrupted, do we?\" She says, an obvious smile coming to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope you knew what you were doing when you chose her.</span></div></div>",

It looks like a very large scale pump, judging from some of what you can see and the large diameter tube looped loosely and hanging from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour investigation of it is stopped when Belledawn speaks to you, a bit of lust and excitement in her voice, \"Hmm...I was wondering when you would choose me again. None of the girls out there were around when we regularly met like this. Though I think I might have put on a bit of weight since then, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a heavy rolling step towards you, her massive stomach pushing against your smaller body and flowing around you. You didn't think you could get any more aroused than you already were, but even that small action causes you to almost split your pants with your erection. Unable to speak, you just nod a couple of times quickly. She doesn't step back from you, but still turns slowly, dragging her fat frame along you standing there, nearly knocking you over several times before you can brace yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind helping me out here?\" She calls over her shoulder, one hand pointing down her back. It takes you a few moments for your brain to recover, but you are eventually able to see the large zipper starting at the bottom of the low cut back. Realizing that she was asking for help to undress, you slowly reach out, fingers trembling. Grabbing hold, you have to give it several tugs before it starts, and once it does start moving, her fat flesh starts pouring out in the newly freed space. Reaching the bottom of the zipper still leaves a good portion of the dress wrapped around her body, but she seems to know that. Putting as much sexiness in such a simple motion as she can, she slowly pulls the dress up and over her head, the material's stretchiness obvious as it slithers over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little moan as each huge roll is pulled loose from the dress and falls where it may, ripples traveling through her body with each slap of flesh hitting flesh.  Her breasts take some work, making the loudest slap and shaking every corner of her body as they come free. Soon enough, or perhaps too soon, the dress finishes it's trip and she drops it on the ground, a noticeable thump as that much material hits the floor. There before you stands who knows how many hundreds of pounds of bare cow flesh, and you nearly pass out from the blood rushing away from your brain. She pulls the pins out of her hair and lets it cascade down her back, Walking over to the bed slowly, her body quivering, she reaches up and takes out her earrings, before setting the pins and earrings on a side table.</span></div></div>",

When you turn back to her, she has already sat down on the edge of the bed, her body piled around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot about that part, didn't you?\" A knock comes from the door again, before she continues, \"Toss me my dress, would you?\" Upon seeing your quizzical reaction, she responds, \"Well, I don't give just anyone a free show, just you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, you grab the dress off of the ground, and toss it to her. She does a decent enough job of arranging it so that it covers her body well enough from a casual glance. The knock comes from the door again, more insistent this time. Opening the door a crack, you are nearly bowled over by huge food carts being pushed through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me, sir, I didn't realize you were right there. We've been working as fast as we could since we knew you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from the near accident, you see that the speaker is the person pushing the first cart, a short four foot tall raven in a chef outfit. The next thing you notice is that he is nearly as wide as he is tall, and nearly spherical. It almost looks like he would roll around on the ground if he fell over. Another three carts are pushed in by similarly dressed and shaped people of various species, before the raven turns to Belledawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize ma'am, the second course will take some time, but I think this should last you long enough.\" She responds with a nod before the raven turns to you, \"Had you called ahead sir, things could have been made ready for you before hand, but we will do our best, I apologize again for the delay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond as best as you can think at the moment, \"Very well, do your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bows his head to you, nearly falling over, before exiting the room and closing the door behind him and his crew. After the door shuts, you look over the \"first course\", each of the carts stand nearly to your shoulders, and each of their shelves are piled with food. Pastas, breads, you even see one of the carts is covered in deserts. And everything looks delicious as well as fattening, no wonder about Belledawn's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice stirs you out of your stupor, \"Well are you just going to stand there and look at it, or are you going to get undressed and feed me?\" The dress is tossed to the floor again, revealing her vast body to you again. She hungrily licks her lips with a lusty look in her eye. Operating mostly on autopilot, your still somewhat damp shirt and pants soon join her dress on the floor. Your erection springs free finally, and the relief is immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you still enjoy this quite a bit, don't you, sir?\" She says, eying your rod as it bobs in the air. \"I guess it should be obvious since you came back.\" She comments with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any more time you move over to the carts and start thinking about which to grab first.</span></div></div>",

You almost swear you could gain weight just be smelling it, though it does have such a wonderful smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelledawn gives you a smile as you walk over to her, \u201cYou know, you never have told me how you haven't gained any weight after all this time, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to figure out how best to reach her mouth with the food, you give as best an answer as you can think of, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, I just never seen to gain any weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually figure out that you will have to climb up on the bed and lean into her in order to reach her mouth well enough. You do so eagerly enough, her body feeling so wonderfully soft and warm, and her fur feeling so smooth against your own, as your body sinks into her flank. You dick throbs a bit as it presses into her fat, your arousal growing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks over at you with a grin, \u201cWe might have to do something about that sometime,\u201d before she opens her mouth for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you didn\u2019t see any utensils on the carts, though even if there was, you wouldn\u2019t likely be getting back down too soon after pressing yourself against her like this. Going for the more manual approach you grab some of the noodles and sauce and press it into her mouth. That small bit doesn\u2019t take her long to eat at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be going like that. Feed me like you used to, like I know you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then opens her mouth much wider, far enough that it might not actually be trouble for her to eat you. Throwing caution to the wind, you start shoveling the pasta into her mouth, and she eats it right up. The two of you quickly build a rhythm, food going into her mouth, and then down her throat. Too soon, the bowl is empty except for some remaining sauce pooled in the bottom. Seeing this, she grabs the bowl from you and uses her wide tongue to clear it up. You glance at your hand, now entirely covered in the sauce as well. She follows your gaze and sets the bowl aside before grabbing your hand and proceeds to suck and lick it clean. That nearly causes you to climax right there, but you manage to hold off for now, knowing there is more to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now, that was pretty good once you got started, but you better get moving, we\u2019ve still got more to go,\u201d she says motioning to the other carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing under your breath that you forgot to move any of the carts closer, you are forced to get down off of her. Your steps are kind of shaky, but you manage to get over to them. Thinking ahead, you move all of the carts much closer around her, before climbing back up across her. Grabbing another dish, you start again, shoveling more food into her waiting mouth to add to her body. She soon grabs another dish and feeds herself between your offerings, the rhythm building up on again. You can almost see her stomach pushing out with each dish adding to its girth, but you can certainly feel the pressuring building within as more food is packed away. Belledawn sometimes gives your toned butt a playful pat, and sometimes even reaches around to give your shaft a few strokes, trying her best to wind you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do something about this too, you know,\u201d she says with a lusty grin between huge mouthfuls of food; you merely answer with a grin back, nodding fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar too soon for you, the last of the dishes, a huge sheet cake with real buttercream frosting, joins the rest of the food within her voluminous stomach. She gives a little lady like burp, before a huge belch comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, now that was much better. You haven\u2019t lost your edge, sir,\u201d she says still licking the last off of her hand before turning to yours. \u201cI think we might have some time left though, before the next course is ready.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the tube, you notice there\u2019s a harness to secure the tube around the back of her head to prevent her from removing it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to give her the tube, she looks up at you, \u201cNot going to be using those this time, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her gaze as it travels revealing some padded cuffs hanging from the headboard, to restrain her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs master going to cuff me again for this?\u201d she says in her innocent voice again.</span></div></div>",

Running your hands through her hair, you reach back and secure the strap at the back of her head. Finding the on switch easily enough, you flip it, and hear the machine start to whirl up. A thick cream colored fluid can be seen surging through the pipe, straight into the gluttonous cow. Finding a handheld remote you missed, you look it over and find it\u2019s a wireless control for the pump. Grinning widely, you hope atop her huge stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the remove and find the control to turn up the flow; punching the button several times, you watch the flow, then hit it a few more times. Now the pump is steadily humming, the tube surging with the flow. Belledawn moans around the tube, but it sounds less like she dislikes it or is in discomfort, and more like she is increasingly aroused by your actions. You feel much the same way, watching her getting pumped full, and feeling her stomach slowly swelling under you. Reaching forwards, you start rubbing her fleshy mammaries, feeling the fat and fur flowing around your fingers, not even able to hold even a fraction of their girl in each of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of her warm fat beneath and around you, her breasts in your hands, and the sights and sounds of her being filled up, are all too much for you. You finally climax, shooting out against her belly and starting to pool in the indentation that you have formed in her fat. As you lay there panting, you hear a loud moan coming from her, a shudder passing through every corner of her body as she follows suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she comes down, she lays there, breathing loud and heavy. Looking down over her breasts, she can see a tiny portion of you basking in the glow. With more muscle control than you might expect, she sends her stomach rolling. The fat shifting around your body causes your crotch to recover and stiffen up again. You manage to find the remote that had almost become lost in the nooks and crannies of her body, and step up the pump again, the tube now visible pulsing from the increased flow. She gives another long moan, and you can feel her stomach deep within the layer of fat swelling from the pressure. You just lay there, riding atop her bulk as the rain and lightning continue unnoticed outside.</span></div></div>",

Most of them are pretty big guys, in various stages of putting on weight.  The smallest of them is still probably about 300 pounds, and next to any of them, you look downright tiny.  The building that they're marching in front of looks big and important, and it holds most of their attention... Perhaps the Mayor's office?  With your keen vision, you can see a shadow pacing behind a drawn curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure that feeders must be in high demand in a city like this... With everyone getting so big, if there's someone smaller and more mobile willing to cater to a big guy, they'd be snatched up in an instant... You think to yourself about that for a moment...  Even though you get the feeling that it wasn't how things were where you came from, you feel like you've always had a strange drawing to flabbier guys. <i>Hmm... Right now I'm pretty small, but that's no reason not to put on some weight like these locals... And maybe help one of them get bigger too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the back of the crowd to see what you couldn't see earlier, you spot an otter holding a sign that looks comically large when compared to his short stature that says \"Will eat for food.\" Though he's a short guy, overeating has clearly already had a profound effect on his body, which you see wobble slightly with every step he takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you get the feeling that you're being watched.  You look closer and you see another fur, further away, in a corner of the protest, and you realize he's looking back at you.  A tubby-looking, black furred brown-eyed German Shepherd, about your age.

And damn.  He's got some pretty nice curves...  Now that you're closer you guess he's probably approaching 500 pounds.  You find yourself blushing a bit just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turns around and you find yourself face to face with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you start. \"Uh- hello.  I'm wondering if you could help me out...  I'm rather new to this city, and well... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinks and says \"Hey little guy.  What do you need help with?  I'm Titus.  Honestly I'm kind of new to this scene as well.  Always have been kind of big though.\" He says, patting his big gut proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a moment.  You know it's going to sound ridiculous but... You can't help but think he looks trustworthy. \"Okay. It may sound weird but, well... Honestly, I just woke up here. And I don't remember a thing... You guys just happened to be nearby and I thought I'd check out what you're doing.  I don't know where to go or what to do... It's all just a blank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, Titus didn't look as surprised as you'd imagined he'd be to hear you say that.  He took a glance at City Hall and then back at you.  \"Well. You are a pretty lithe fellow.  And honestly... You would have had to be living under a rock, or be from pretty far away not to have fattened up, even just a bit.  Here in Zaftig, our food stores are packed and well... Some fellas think that there's something in the food that does it to ya.  But who knows?  Nobody seems to mind. In fact some furs are all about just getting bigger.  That's why we're here.\" He says, gesturing to the rest of the crowd.  \"We're actually looking for feeders. Someone to take care of us... With people getting bigger, some are doing it quite competitively. Hell, all the hotshot celebrities in this city are the biggest, and they've got troupes of butlers.  Takes a lot to get to that sort of level though.  What we're demanding here at city hall is a bit of equality.  If all of the feeders are going to the guys who are already the biggest, where does that leave the rest of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears twitch and your foxtail swishes as you listen to Titus tell about the state of the city.  Then you remember how your eyes had met for that one awkward moment.  \"I saw you looking at me earlier... If you don't mind, uh... What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus makes a face... Is he... blushing?  \"Well... Being a little guy like yourself, you're exactly what most of us are looking for, honestly.  I thought about coming over to talk to you, but well... Sometimes I just get a little nervous...  I was kinda surprised I was the first to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit at this. \"Well... All of that helps fill in a few of the gaps...

I don't have another bed, but I do have a couch! It's pretty comfy. I should know; I spend most of the day on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about Titus' offer for a second before ultimately accepting. It's true: You don't have any place to spend the night. But a couch is better than a park bench. And sure, you just met Titus. Yet he seems like a decent enough guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you reply. \"Sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! My apartment isn't actually too far away from here. Follow me!\" Titus turned away from City Hall and made his way out of the protest. You followed closely behind him, partially because you don't want to lose your new friend, partially to watch his plump rump as it wobbles almost hypnotically as the German Shepard waddles along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two make it out of the crowd and head in the direction of Titus' home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, feeders are a bit of a big deal here, huh?\" you ask Titus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Lots of folks here are big enough that they would essentially need to spend the entire day cooking just to keep themselves fed. Hey, practically most of my day is devoted to making sure I don't starve. Not that I'm complaining much. It just cuts into my work and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do you do for work? I'll probably need to find a job here eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I...uh, consultancy? With... technology? Yeah, technology consultant...\" Titus said before quickly switching subjects. \"If you need a job, you might want to think about working as a feeder! I'm sure that if you posted an ad, you'll get snatched up in minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Feeders are that on-demand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've known a lot of people who tried hiring feeders but they always get hired by other people first. There's only guy I know who managed to get a feeder. But he definitely needed one. He's hardly mobile these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" you reply. \"So, back in the crowd you thought I'd be interested in being a feeder. Is that because of how skinny I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, yes. Feeders sometimes come in on the fatter side. But some of the most sought after feeders are skinny. For obvious reasons. I mean, how useful is a feeder going to be in helping a huge fur get clean if they both can't fit into the shower together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tail twitched at idea of being in a shower helping soap up and clean the rolls and folds of a super obese fur. Of slipping slick paws over a seemingly endless belly, around tremendous thighs, all over a blubbery butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, feeders do more than feeding?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Feeding is just part of it. Housekeeping, bathing, anything a fur needs help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Well, I'll consider it. I just got here after all. I'd like to see what's what around town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better consider it quick before you discover all the great food we have around here! There's not much a market for quarter ton fox feeders!\" said Titus said while chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe then I'll hire you as a feeder then!\" you say jokingly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So Titus, have you lived in Zaftig City for a while?\" you ask the German Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I've been here about five years, I think. I moved a while back because I was kinda getting sick of living in my hometown. I guess I got bored seeing the same people, seeing the same buildings, hearing the boring small town gossip. That, and there wasn't much work there. So moving away just made sense.\" said Titus. \"We're nearly home! Just a block away now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm ready to get off of my feet.\" you reply. \"What made you choose to move here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. This place kinda called to me, if that makes any sense. And probably because it's so cheap to live here. Easily one of the cheapest cities to live in as far as I'm aware. You might want to take that into consideration if you're thinking about staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't figured that out yet. I'm really just trying to get my bearings here,\" you answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this place will grow on you.\" said Titus, leading you to the front door of an apartment building. \"It sure did in my case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" you ask as you both walk through the lobby towards the elevator. Titus pressed the call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that I may have put on a little weight since I moved here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door opened and you both step inside. It was massive, almost like a freight elevator. This, you suppose, is because of the sheer girth of the city's residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be pretty skinny, probably as thin as you!\" Titus continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, really? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I first got here, I saw how large everyone was. That encouraged me to put on a little weight. You know, bulk up. I got teased a lot for being so skinny when growing up. That's where the first fifty came from. I guess that spiraled into my first hundred. Then what happened? Oh, a bakery opened up nearby where I lived, so that probably where another 25 came from. I got into craft beers, so that's another 45. Carbs, you know. Umm...60 pounds gained from a couple of years ago when quadruple ripple fudge ice cream was a thing. It only was available for a few months, but I easily ate at least one gallon of the stuff everyday. Then there was that nasty breakup I went though. At least fifty pounds there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door opened on the 15th floor. Titus led you down the hallway as he continued talking. \"And I guess since then I just put on weight whenever. I like eating, I eat what I want, and if I get I little bigger, who cares? Ah, here!\" The German Shepherd stopped in front of a door with the number 1527 on it. He pulled a keyring out of his pocket and unlocked the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Titus into the living room of his apartment. It was spacious, big enough for a dog his size to easily move around in. There was a small bookcase, and a large television hung from the wall. Vintage movie posters and abstract art adorn the walls. In the center of the living room was a long black couch and a extra-wide recliner. The living room lead to a kitchen furnished with any and all sorts of utensils. You guessed Titus must keep everything in stock; the kitchen counter were covered in boxes and boxes of various junk food. You could only imagine all the treats he has stored away in the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home!\" said Titus. He tossed his keys in a table nearby the door. \"Ugh, I need to get these things off. It's too hot out today...\" he said as he started pulling off his shirt freeing his perfectly round brown-furred belly. It stuck out several feet yet didn't seem to sag much despite it's marshmallowly softness. His gut reminded you of a beanbag chair. Hefty moobs rested on top. You doubt you could hold one of his moobs in your hand without lots of the dog's fat spilling between your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reached under his gut to undo the button on his pants and zipper. Sliding off his pants, you got a look at the German Shepherds bare butt. Soft, bulbous, and wide, it was certainly a sight to see. Like two black furry beach balls. And much like Titus' belly, his butt also didn't sag down because of all the flab. In fact, this pup had quite the perky butt. His tail, also on the thick side, wagged happily and occasionally thudded against one of his butt cheeks. Titus' thighs, you saw, were thick and large, much like tree trunks. But where the rest of his body was soft and pudgy, his thighs looked beefy. That's a benefit of hauling around a quarter ton of dog, you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better!\" said Titus. He shook and his entire body wobbles and jiggled, his butt jiggling for a few seconds longer than the rest of him. \"Oh, sorry I didn't ask. I figured you'd be okay because, well...\" He eyed you up and down, and you suddenly remembered that you were as nude as you were this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, I forgot about that,\" you said. \"I'm surprised you or someone else didn't call me out on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, most fur wear clothes around here. Others don't. Especially the extremely fat furs since nothing fits them. If anyone saw you, they were probably more put off by how thin you are more so than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good,\" you reply. \"But I'd eventually like to find something to wear eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can dig through my closet later. I might still have things I wore before this happened.\" Titus gave his belly a light slap. Shockwaves rippled through the plush fat of his gut. \"Now, sit, sit and relax!\" He wrapped a doughybadm around your shoulders and sat you down on the couch. You sank deeply into the plush cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be starving! You just relax and I'll whip you up something to eat,\" the dog said. He then reached for the remote and turned on the television. Some action movie you don't recognize was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Knives of Justice 2. It's pretty derivative, but it's alright.\" The rotund dog plodded off to his kitchen where he searched through his cabinets and pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wait, you watch Knives of Justice 2 and try to make sense of the plot since you started watching about 45 minutes into the movie. On the coffee table in front of you is a candy bowl. But Titus' candy bowl is filled with full-sized candy bars. \"Help yourself to some!\" he yelled from the kitchen. You look in the bowl and one catches your eye: A bar of salted caramel coated in peanuts. \"Nutter Catastrophe\", the label reads. You rip open the package and start chewing on the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Titus again yelled from the kitchen. \"There are two 'house specialities I can whip up: My award-winning Big Dog Five Alarm Six-Bean Chili, or my patented Cheesey Mac and Cheese with Sausage and Bacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That one didn't win an award?\" you jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stern look came across Titus' face. \"No, and I'm still bitter about that. Anyway, what sounds good to you?\"</span></div></div>",

Belly stuffed to the brim, you struggled to breathe on account of how absolutely full you were. Initially, you were going to have maybe one bowl or perhaps two of the incredibly rich cheese and meat concoction the German Shepherd made up. Yet as soon as you finished your first bowl, the dog was taking it back to the kitchen to refill it for his guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't like keeping leftovers,\" Titus playfully said when he shuffled off to dish up your fourth serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog was sat in his recliner, feet up in the air and happily digesting his meal. \"See why I'm so upset that it didn't win any awards?\" he asked. You nodded weakly as you focused on your breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, if you cook like that, maybe you should be a feeder yourself,\" you said. \"I'm sure a lot of fat furs out there would love eating like this everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus chuckled to himself. \"Remember: being a feeder is more than just cooking well. It's all about taking care of another fur who needs an extra set of hands. It's all those other necessary skills that I'm really rusty with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like <b>urp</b> what?\" you asked while stifling another burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, giving good belly rubs, that's one. If I'm feeding a fur like I fed you, they'll probably need a couple of paws kneeding their belly to help them digest. And you can't get good at rubs practicing on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! You can practice on me!\" you volunteered, waving a hand lazily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus laughed again. He spotted the cheese and grease that remained on your maw and bare chest. \"And helping a fur keep himself clean.

Adjusting the knobs of the faucet, he finally found just the right temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Come in!\" said Titus, waving you in. You stepped inside craddling your still-full belly in one arm as you closed the shower door with the other. The shower, you guessed, was about 8' x 8'. Two walls were of glass and the other two were a moasic of beautiful rock. Some rocks stuck out front the wall to function as shelves, many of which held various kinds of shampoos. Titus easily took up little over half the stall, and you maneuvered around him to reach the shower head as you instinctively began rinsing yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, hey, let me do that,\" said the big dog as he detached the shower head from it's mount and starting hosing you down. \"Feeders probably aren't going to get much help in cleaning their fat fur, so just let me take care of everything. All you need to do is stand there.\" You nodded as Titus lifted up your left arm and spray warm water into your armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your fur was soaked head to toe, Titus turned off the water and replaced the shower head. \"No point in keeping the water on when you're lathering up.\" He reached for one of the bottles of shampoo. \"Ah, Ancient Spice. I'll use this. It's one of my favorite brands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fancy,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus squeezed a dallop of shampoo into his paw and worked it into a frothy lather. He then massaged the soap into your fur, starting first at the top of your head, then carefully around your ears, and along your legs. The big dog then soaped up both of your arms, flat chest, and bloated belly. Carefully, his paws worked in small circles along your taunt belly, expanding outward to cover the dome of your gut. You groaned quietly in pleasure from the rubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good, foxy?\" Titus asked. You nodded. \"Good. Maybe my belly-rubbing skills are up to par. Now, turn around. I need to clear your back.\" You spun around and the dog began lathering up your back, being sure to massage your muscles a little. He began with your shoulders, then flanks, and then your tail, and then the small of your back. You suddenly felt two meaty paws scoop up both of your butt cheeks and you gave a small yelp is surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I guess I should have given you a small heads up.\" Titus said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries. I should have expected my rump would get some attention too,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have. The butt is a really hard place for huge furs to reach. And it's very important to have a nice and clean butt,\" joked Titus while working lather onto your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know that from experience?\" you cheekily asked Titus. He laughed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I can get clean back there on my own. I have a special technique!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You'll have to show me sometime...\" you said suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, if I have a fox watching me bathe, the least he could do is help a guy out back there. Price of admission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! Soaping up a huge butt! What a terrible chore that must be!\" you replied sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it takes time to clean up a butt like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, you do realize that you've been lathering my butt for, like, five minutes right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry. I got a little distracted.\" Titus continued lathering your lower half. When you were totally soapy, he grabbed the shower head and turned the water. With one paw, he held the shower head and the other paw worked the water and soap. He rinsed you on in the same order he lathered you, being sure to give your butt a playful tap when it was clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinsed and free of soap, Titus shut off the water to let you shake off. \"Wait outside of the stall for a second.\" You exited the shower; Titus closed the door behind you. The big dog then shook the water off his fur, hundreds of water droplets flung to the shower walls. You watched as his entire body wobble and jiggled and oscillated for a whole five seconds after he shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitus got out and grabbed a clean towel. Unfolding it, it looked large enough to fit around your entire body twice. The big dog started padding you down getting the last of the water out of your fur. He then worked on drying himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a hand?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're offering,\" he replied. You grabbed another towel and began drying his back. Your worked the towel in between each of his rolls of fat, wiped down his love handles, and scrubbed his fleshy sides. Then you got to work on his gigantic butt. Rubbing the towel against the two globes of black-fuured lard, the mass shook uncontrollably with even the slightest movement of your paw. The dog's pushy rear wobbled hypnotically as you worked the towel between the cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about done back there?\" asked Titus. \"You've been drying my butt, like, five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \"Sorry, I got a little distracted,\" you said back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and the two of you were lounging in the living room again with you on the couch and him in his recliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can cook, you can clean a fur, and know how to give a good belly massage. Why is it again you think you wouldn't be a good feeder?\" you asked Titus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it had to with the fact that it requires so many skills that I haven't really tried. I mean, you're the first fur I ever cleaned, or even rubbed.\" the dog said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what other things do feeders do that you want to try out?\" you question. \"You've got a willing volunteer in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a bit aspect of being a feeder is...well, feeding. As in, bringing food to a fur's mouth. Some furs are so big or lazy or both to be bothered to bring a spoon to their mouth. I've never feed a fur before. But it's a super important part of the jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound too bad,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But there's feeding, and then there's <b>feeding</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some furs pay feeders to help them maintain their weight. Other furs, however, will shell out extra for a feeder that will be a bit more...forceful. These are for furs who want to sail past the half-ton mark. They want feeders who will make them consume thousands of extra calories, usually against their will, if it means they will grow to be mega obese. It's not a standard part of the job description, but it is an additional skill that is heavily, heavily rewarded.\"</span></div></div>",

After a minute the mayor pushes himself free and destroys the doorway in the process. You noticed that the mayor was wearing a tanktop and a pair of blue jeans.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're attempting to get your bearings when you notice something odd about the park. Not far away there seems to be a grove of big thick trees, barely more than fifty yards across. What's weird though is a path of the park leads right through them. And not just weaving between the trees either. As you watch, a couple of individuals follow the path right up to the base of one of the trees and walk right through it. A couple minutes later they came out a tree on the other side of the clearing exactly the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the strangeness of the situation this is the weirdest thing yet. Curiosity gets the better of you though and you carefully walk down the hill to the grove. Standing in front of one of the trees, you reach out to touch one. The bark feels warm under your touch, but otherwise the tree feels solid enough. You try pushing on it, and then leaning your weight on it, but the tree remains solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a neat trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but jump a little at the voice. You'd been so focused on the trees you'd failed to notice one of the locals come up to see what was going on. The individual appears to be a cheetah female, with long sandy blond hair dressed in a simple white sleeveless and red short-shorts. her weight is chubby but she looks downright thin compared to other citizens you've seen. Part of the reason it's startling to see her is she appears to be half inside on of the trees next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" she asks, seeing you staring, \"I said that's a cool trick you can do, leaning on nothing. Or are you practicing for being a Mime and can't talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No, uh, I'm sorry,\" you sputter, your blush matching your fur, \"And it's not a trick, at least, i don't think it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you an appraising look and smiles, \"I'm Cindy. Are you new to town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you nod still looking at the trees as you tell her your name, \"Tell me, have you ever noticed anything odd about this part of the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I swear I'm staring at a grove of old trees right here and yet no one seems to notice them, or even feel them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Cyndy asked confused, stepping a bit closer, \"There's never been a grove of trees here. Come to think of it, when this park was made this was the only spot where they didn't have to cut down any trees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I swear I can see them and feel them. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou demonstrate by placing your back against one of the trees and your feet up on the other. Cyndy gasps as you knew she would, since to her it looks like you're floating in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I've <i>got</i> to know how you did that,\" reaching out she grasps your wrist and gasps again, \"I... I can see them, I can see the trees!\" Slowly, tentatively, she reaches out with her other hand and touches one, he body making contact this time. Letting go of your wrist as you drop down to the ground she blinked. \"They're gone again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try something,\" you muse and gently touch her wrist again, \"Can you see them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she nods, still amazed, \"But how? Why is it I can only see them and touch them when I'm touching you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you reply, \"But I bet we could find some answers inside the grove. Do you want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment she nodes, \"Yes, to hell with that old saying about curiosity and cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to chuckle at that as the pair of you walk into the grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing seems far bigger on the inside than it did on the outside. The trees soon tower high enough to block out the light. Pushing past them though finds you in a small clearing barely ten yard wide and in the center looks to be a spring of some sort. The water looks clear as crystal and smooth as glass. As you both approach a noise like a faint breeze whispering through the leaves starts to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both you and Cindy are standing by the spring the noise is loud enough to hear, and speaks with a voice that sounds both ancient and ageless, as soft as a light wind or a gentile rain and yet as mellow as music. <i>I've been waiting for you</i> it seemed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you ask, unable to help yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am the guardian of this, the Spring of Power. I have waited for eons for the one who is to use it to change the world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Change the world' ?\" you ask, \"Isn't that a little vague? How do you know I'll make the world better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better or worse, such choices will lie in your hands. The Spring is a great gift, but only those who would not seek it may find it. Those deserving of power are the ones who do not wish it for themselves.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause to consider this. \"Suppose I do this, what must I do in order for it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Merely step into the center of the spring. It's power will become yours</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider doing so but look back as Cindy who seems utterly amazed by all this as she stares between the water and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do not fear. Your mate is beyond the barrier, she may watch if she desires.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to counter, saying she isn't your mate but something prevents the words from leaving your throat. Tentatively you let go of Cindys hand. She glances around but nods as she can still see everything. Carefully you step into the water. It's cool but not cold. Carefully padding to the center, you stand still as a beam of light from the tiny opening in the trees bathes you in a warm glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now, receive the power of the ancients.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden impact of the power feels like a battering ram in your chest, doubling you up with the immense force behind it. You watch as slowly the water seems pulled towards you, thin streams beginning to rise up around you as they encircle your legs, growing longer and thicker as they surround your body. The power thunders in your chest like your heart was desperately trying to escape. You can feel your body groan and strain under the immense energies flooding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a snap, and then another, fearfully you realize your form might not be able to contain such power, groaning you watch as your form seems to swell, bones cracking dangerously. The spring is more than half empty now but it feels like your going to explode any second. The light begins to fill your eyes as you wonder if this is death coming for you. You let out a scream as you feel the sudden surge of power begin to tear you apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not the end however. As Cindy watches in mute amazement, your old body begins to pull apart, but a new form seems to be growing out from inside. You're taking on a new form to suit the immense power you now contain.</span></div></div>",

Before you can understand it though, it fades away, slowly replaced with the sound of the wind quietly rustling the leaves above you, your own ragged breathing, and the pounding of your heartbeat in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you open your eyes, your vision swims before you before eventually resolving into a view of the grass boarding the spring, dark in the shadows from the trees above. The view of your muzzle \u2013 already feeling different than what it should have been \u2013 has changed, gone is the red fur with little black nose at the tip, and in its place is a long reptilian snout covered in tiny jewel like emerald scales. Raising your hand to brush at the protuberance, you are partially shocked to see your hand has been similarly changed, identically colored scales trace from across arm and down across the back of your hand and out along your fingers, fingers that are now topped by long almost talon-like claws. Dropping your hand back to the ground, you marvel at how easily you dig deep into the soil; breathing deeply, you can feel your body practically thrumming with the power contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, you see Cindy backed against one of the trees at the edge of the clearing. It\u2019s hard for you to read the expression on her face in the shadows, but it almost looks like a bit of fear across the plump cheetah\u2019s face. Struggling to your feet, you realize that you now stand more than a foot taller than her where before the two of you were nearly the same height, one wide wing stretching out with the matching mate spreading the other direction. You give a quick glance down before turning back to Cindy, before a dawning realization draws your gaze back down to your body, revealing another change to your body\u2026</span></div></div>",

Golden colored belly scale stretch lengthwise across your front, resembling 'scoots' that would line the underbelly of a snake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploration of your figure reveals you can't even touch your clawed fingertips over the dome of your belly. And feeling a little higher adds another couple surprises. A pair of soft sagging male breasts also adorn your front, each the size of a partially deflated football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is unexpected...\" you mutter, and are surprised by the change to your own voice. Deeper, richer, and overall sounding more powerful, which you're supposed to be.And that brought your thought process back around to the powers supposedly inherited by the spring. According to it there was supposedly nothing you couldn't do now. But where to begin and how to test it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain your eyes fall on Cindy who was just calming down and looking like she was curious to approach your impressive new figure.You could try changing her in some manor.

The slight breeze winding through the trees caresses your new assets, sending a shiver of pleasure down your back. A sudden whim makes you raise your hands and heft your breasts, and that is enough to almost make you let out a moan; it seems that in addition to their size, they\u2019re also rather sensitive. When you recover, you pass your hands down around the rest of your body and find it to be just as alluring as what you found above: round and shapely hips and thighs, with a plush rump bringing up the rear, while the stomach that lay in between was slender and toned. Though based on what little you saw of the city before you came in here holds true, your stomach probably won\u2019t stay trim for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snap of a branch makes your head whip around, you see that Cindy has come a bit closer, and her face is a bit easier to read. There is some fear there, but more than a little awe as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still in there, Mr. Fox?\u201d she asks with a slight quiver to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you respond, somewhat surprised at how your voice sounds. In addition to now being feminine in tone, there is a slightly resonant quality to it. \u201cThough mister and fox don\u2019t exactly seem to apply to me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes modesty still apply to you?\u201d she says while looking you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a slight blush behind her fur, but you notice something else in her expression. Is that approval or something more? Before you can figure it out, there\u2019s a brief glow that surrounds you and suddenly you are no longer naked. A blouse with the top several buttons undone and a pair of hip hugging jeans has appeared as if from thin air. Cindy jumps back just as quickly, her mouth dropping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nothing else happens, she relaxes slightly before saying \u201cYou\u2019re full of all kinds of surprises, aren\u2019t you?\u201d You can only nod dumbly; too shocked at everything that had happened in a short period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two you leave the clearing, you just barely hear a sound behind you. You are somehow aware that it was the so-called guardian, and it sounds almost like a sigh of contentment as if for a job finally done. Ahead of you the trees bend and twist so that a clear path is soon opened; it winds a bit so it isn\u2019t a straight shot out, but it much easier going than when you first entered. Along the way you glance out of the corner of your eye and cast your gaze down around Cindy\u2019s chubby form. You find her appearance somewhat pleasing, though you\u2019re not sure whether you would have enjoyed her plump before\u2026whatever it was that happened that cause you to lose your memories. Idly, you wonder what she would look like if she was even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in your tracks and can only stare as you see something odd: her stomach is growing larger, and then you see that it\u2019s her whole body steadily plumping up. Her shirt creeps up over her belly as it bulges further and further out, while the top is forced down as her breasts do the same. The shorts are pulled tighter around her swelling rump and thighs, quickly being swallowed by the meatiness of her cheeks. Even her face is not spared, quickly turning more cherubic in appearance. Her growth stops as quickly as it started leaving her nowhere near as large as some you saw outside the grove, but certainly quite a bit larger than she was just a few moments ago. You have to say that she looks good with the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy stops when she notices you have stopped as well. Turning to face you, she asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think of anything to respond, she follows your still staring gaze till she sees her newly bloated body.</span></div></div>",

You then give a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it. Now I have to work on fitting in. This may be one of the last times I see myself with bulging muscles. Once I start gaining weight they'll be buried under several layers of fat. So where should we go first?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll cover the costs.\" Cindy said as placed her own paw on top of your huge meaty paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes at least fifteen minutes to arrive at the buffet. The name of the buffet is Sumo Clash Buffet. Judging by the sign it seems to be a multicultural buffet despite the Japanese look of the building. You and Cindy enter the buffet. Upon entering Cindy pays a silver dragoness $10. You then follow Cindy to the buffet line. Once in line your stomach growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I suggested that we eat first. A big cat such as yourself must be starving after that experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly fill up three plates of food and find the table that Cindy is sitting. You then carefully make your way to the table. As soon as you sit down your eyes are drawn to the arena which is set in the middle of eating area. You noticed that the closest tables to the arena were 200 ft away and that from four angles there was a huge gap that lacked tables. You were about to ask Cindy of why a buffet would have a sumo arena, but it soon became clear as you spotted two sumo wrestlers walk towards the dohyo. You then spot a dragon who happens to be the owner of the buffet step to where the referee would usually stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! Boys and Girls! I Ken Sotomoto am glad to present this hour's sumo tourney! As you enjoy your time at our buffet I encourage you to get more helpings as the matches go on. There will be a total of six matches, with each match taking place ten minutes after the previous match. That should give you folks plenty of time to fill your plates and watch top quality entertainment provided by some of Zaftig's greatest sumo celebrities. Our contender is a favorite underdog turned pro. He is 8'5\" and weighs a whopping ton. Put your paws together for Terishmo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers as the 2000 lb. doberman step into the ring. After stepping into the ring Terishmo flexes showing off some hidden muscle under his flabby form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our next contender is a real big shot and a real top cat. Standing at 8'7\" and weighing 2200 lbs. I give you Nekodoran!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roars as a large tiger enters the ring. Unlike Terishmo, Nekodoran doesn't seem as over confident. He still gives off a huge presence even though both wrestlers are shorter than you. Then without warning Ken Sotomoto gives the signal for the match to begin. Both wrestlers are evenly matched, but in the end ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both wrestlers are evenly matched, but in the end Nekodoran wins. The crowd cheers as the massive tiger flexes. The intensity of the sumo match was so intense that you finished all three plates of food by the time the match was over. You quickly glance back at Cindy who was still on her second plate of food. You then proceed back into the buffet line to grab some more grub.Who knew that watching a sumo match while eating could help stimulate an appetite. Despite seeing the first match you want to see some more sumo action before jumping the gun and deciding to become a sumo wrestler. You figure that with you magical powers, new found strength you figure that life of a sumo wrestler may be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling up a few more plates with food you make your back to the table. You then notice an enclosed area the two sumo wrestlers who just faced each other enjoying some food with some other well-to-do patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with that area over there?' You ask Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the VIP area. It costs extra to eat there, but high ranking sumo wrestlers get a discount if they agree to wrestle for Ken Sotomoto. Other than that the food they have is the same. The only other difference are shorter lines.\" Cindy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then continue eating. eight minutes later you restock your plates with more food. You notice that your stomach is bloated. You deduced that you must have gained at least five pounds, but it seems that abs haven't diminished in definition. You then find your seat where you see Cindy enjoying her fourth plate of food. You then see two more sumo wrestlers walk towards the arena and Ken Sotomoto getting ready for the next match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now time for the second match folks. If you thought the guys were huge then you're surely mistaken. The intensity only increases as we present more famous wrestlers into the mix. For the second match our first contender is a real ladies man and actually spends as much time working out as he does eating to impress the ladies with muscle and girth. Weighing in at 2500 lbs and standing at 8'11\" I present to you Tsunamterro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers as a hulking wolf who is clearly exhibiting the best of worlds flexes for the crowds. You notice that he's even sporting an impressive twelve pack on his stomach, yet you also deduce that his fat rolls are uniquely toned that he was able to maintain them despite how much his body wobbled with both fat and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our next opponent is not one to mess around with. She's a foxy fighter and ironically Tsunamterro's girlfriend. Standing at 8'9\" and also weighing 2500 lbs. I give you Lotussaka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers as an orange fox woman gracefully curtsies before the crowd. Unlike the male wrestlers you noticed that females must wear a jump suit in addition to a mawashi, but even a tight jumpsuit only proved to be more revealing than if she was only in undergarments. It doesn't take long for the match to begin. Yet the dynamic seems different this time. While Tsunamterro is pure brawn in his fighting style it seems that Lotussaka moves with the grace of a lotus in a pond. In the the end and to your surprise....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a resurrection / tribute to one of my favorite interactive stories of all time done by NackFourTails AKA Michael Setzer. Unfortunately the original has been destroyed. However I plan to remake it bigger and better than ever here. If you like this at all, please add, please help this story grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n #1 - No gore or death. Characters should not be killed if at all possible. If, for example, you plan on having a plot revolving around mafia-esq characters who might be assumed to be killing others, keep such events off screen and not described in more detail than necessary. So short of adding drama to the plot, death should not factor in for the main character if at all possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 - Keep vore to a minimum. This might be a city of fat furs but I'm assuming most get that way by eating food, not others. I have Vore listed as minimal because there are other more interesting ways of voring individuals that could be used. Either way, for whatever reason, voring does not kill characters here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3 - No short posts. Any post added must be a minimum of three paragraphs or approximately two hundred and fifty words. Which is not as hard as some might think. Longer posts will be greatly appreciated though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4 \u2013 Give everyone an out. All chapters should have two options at the very least. Give everyone a chance to follow the story you want to see and a way to escape that path if they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#5 \u2013 Keep the flow. Everyone is entitled to interject their own ideas, however do not suddenly stop a story line for no reason to start a new one. So if there's a character given super powers, don't just suddenly strip them from him for some arbitrary reason and dump him somewhere to start your story. See point 4. If everyone is given an 'out' then everyone will get the chance for the story they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 \u2013 Keep the focus towards Weight Gain and Inflation of various kinds. Transformation can play a part too, as well as other changes, but WG and Inflation should be the main subjects of interest of the city for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#8 \u2013 Use of cubs/kits. I'm all for seeing fat child furs in such stories and making them fatter. But while adult situations might happen in this interactive, pre-teen furs are off limits save for expansions of various kinds. There should be NO INSTANCES OF YIFFING WITH CHILD FURS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#9 \u2013 Oviposition or egg-laying. Some furs like being expanded with hundreds of eggs, and I will allow this. However. All eggs laid must be infertile and not be destined to hatch into hundreds of babies. If having children is to be part of the story keep the number to a minimal amount no matter how many eggs are involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#10 \u2013 Lastly, have fun with this. This is a world to expand upon and grow huge with creative ideas. The rules above are guidelines rather than strict 'do not cross' guardrails. However, take note of each since anything falling into such categories may be removed if it is deemed inappropriate in one form or another. Such actions will not happen without the author being told though and giving them a chance to correct their chapter. Any abuse or rude behavior, including mean spirited posting, will be removed without such notification though, so 'play nice'.</td>",
