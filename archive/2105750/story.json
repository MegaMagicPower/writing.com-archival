C'mon 18, you can do better than that!\"  She said aloud, concentrating on her internal battery and trying to reroute more energy into her palms to deliver a more devastating attack.  While at one point 18 was one of the most powerful beings on earth in recent years she'd nearly fallen completely out of the runnings.  Not due to her own lack of power but simply due to the exponentially scaling threats and new super forms and interdimensional beings popping out of the woodworks.  Not to mention being a mother took a lot of her spare time.  Now however she had a day to herself and was trying to find new and improved techniques that would make her competitive again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting off her energy inhibitors, heat safeties, and routing full power to her hands amid a blare of warning messages and alerts filling up her optics 18 pointed her hands towards the valley.  \"Alright, let's try... this!\"  For a few moments a crackling sphere of crimson energy formed before her fingertips, violent arcs of red electricity crackling along its surface.  It grew to twice 18's height in a few seconds, a slow rumbling hiss emanating from the sphere as it expanded.  \"Now we're talking!\"  She said.<br>\r\nWithout warning the surface of the orb cracked like glass, a spiderweb of black lines spreading over the surface with blood tinted light pouring out of the cracks as the energy destabilized.  \"Oh, that can't be go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't. In an instant the ball exploded right in front of 18's face, heat and wind and smoke and lighting shooting past her skin as she tumbled out of the air.  With a clang she collided with the earth, her thoughts jumbled and her diagnostics going crazy.  \"Ugh, maybe those safties were there for a reason.\"  She grumbled.  \"Alright, lesson learned.  Don't turn those off.  Now then, let's try-\"  She tried to fly but found herself unable to move.  No matter how hard she focused she remained lying on the groubd facing up towards the sky.  \"Crap, don't tell me that I shorted my flight circuits!  Ugh, walking home is gonna be a-\" She stopped.  Not only could she not fly, but she couldn't move either.  Panicing 18 scanned her damage report and let out a shocked gasp.  \"I'm... I'm just a head!\"  She said, looking down for the first time and seeing her chin was resting flat against a rock, her body clearly not below her.  Looking back up she scanned the sky intently and soon enough she saw her body...</span></div></div>",

Dr Gero was the scientist, she was just the murder weapon.  The back of her hand brushes against another piece of wire hanging below her head, its end frayed and its thickness about the same as the one she was holding.  \"Maybe that's where that goes?... I think?...\"  She tries to tie the wires together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"  Android 18 blurts, static ringing in her ears and her vision distorting wildly as sparks shoot from her neck.  Dropping her head her body falls backwards, rubbing its severed wires and shattered pistons sorely.  \"Yeah.  No.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  Great.\"  She says with a sour tone.  She scans the area around her, seeing only the edge of a large crater in the ground where once there was a mountain.  \"Oh, and I landed facing the wrong direction.  Great.

While they hadn't been expecting any miracles, they'd all been hoping they'd be surprised.  Instead, they'd been met with exactly what they expected.  A crypt.  19 corpses lay partially thawed or frostbitten beyond recognition inside their tubes, the pods unable to keep their occupants alive for such a long stretch of time with such limited power supplies, no maintenance, and no recalibrations.  Only one pod contained a living occupant, pod #6, and while the computer readout still listed her as living a laundry list of errors filled the screen.  Whether or not she'd survive being taken OUT of the pod was questionable at best.  \"Thoughts?\"  The rescue team leader, a short dark skinned woman in her earlier forties, asked the medical officer sent with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical officer, a deceptively young looking Swiss woman by the name of Angela, studied the subject kept within the pod.  \"Moving the cryostasis unit out of here is out of the question.  These older units weren't designed for transportation and losing power for even a moment... well, you can see what happens for yourself.\"  She said, motioning towards the 19 pods lining the rest of the room.  \"That being said it's a miracle it's managed to last this long, and every second she spends in there at this point is another second that the machine could fail and... I don't think we have a choice.  We have to open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rescue team leader nodded, motioning towards the computer.  Angela typed in a few commands and began the revival process, her eyes narrowing as the pod hissed and hummed.  A few minutes passed, the ice slowly evaporating and color slowly returning to the pod's occupant.  Most of her, anyway.  The doctor noted that a thin line of icy blue flesh wrapped around the neck of Pod #6's occupant.  Even as the thawing process entered its final stages the blue line remained, the doctor growing more and more concerned by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Angela could say anything to her colleague the pod's door swiveled open, the process complete and the subject revived.  \"Ugh... where... who... wha?\"  The pod's occupant murmured, squinting as her senses returned.  She shifted awkwardly, her completely bare flesh rubbing against the pod's cool metal interior as she struggled to regain control of her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, you've been out a while.\"  Angela said, placing a hand on the woman's shoulder.  \"Do you remember your name?\"  She asked, ignoring the blue line for now.  The pod's occupant seemed to be responsive in spite of the frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mei.  Mei...  Mei-Ling Zhou.\"  She answered, struggling but succeeding in recalling her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Mei.  My name is Dr Angela, though you're free to call me 'Mercy' I suppose.\"  She said.  Turning towards the rescue team leader Mercy asked \"Can you hand me one of the blankets?  I'm sure our friend would appreciate some coverage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy... that... that's familiar.\"  She said, her thoughts still swimming but bits and pieces cutting through the fog.  Her concentration was broken as the woman standing beside Dr Angela held out a blanket for her.  Mei smiled, she'd almost forgotten that everyone on her team had had to enter the pods naked.  Then she remembered.  \"My team!\"  She shouted, leaping from the pod to see her old team, unaware that she was the only remaining member of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that shock could set in however another one did.  As her foot hit the ground the shockwave traveled up her body, through her flesh, and up to her neck.  The thin blue line that wrapped around her neck exploded, ice and frozen fragments of flesh spraying in all directions as her neck was broken off her shoulders.  Mei screamed as her head toppled off her shoulders and slammed into the ground, her body losing balance and falling in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy was stunned.  Not only did she just watch a woman get decapitated, but she heard a woman scream AFTER getting decapitated.  A complete impossibility.  Bending down she slowly wraps her finger's around Mei's head and turns it around.  Just as she thought, Mei's head was still alive. Still in shock, Mei asks \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy turned her head around to face her headless body.  \"That, apparently.\"  Mercy said.  Mei was speechless.  \"Can you sill move?\"  She asks.  While normally she'd consider the possibility of a severed head beig able to control its body completely absurd said head was currently alive and speaking so currently Dr Angela was willing to believe anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei attempts to move her body and...</span></div></div>",

Transforming people into creatures making the lose all of what they once were, but for Ellie she came to find out that she had an immunity to this virus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie lays there in her red tattered old t-shirt with a black long sleeve undershirt wearing dirty old jeans. She lays there with one leg bent and the other crossed over it swaying her foot side to side. She looks at the images of a magazine she had found along her travels in some rundown building somewhere. It wasn't just any magazine it was a dirty magazine with images of buff men in tight underwear and some without any. Flipping through the pages she comes across one of those pages that folds out of the magazine for one of those large images. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image folds out and Ellie's eyes open wide as she sees the man standing in a room wearing nothing at all and his cock dangling there between is legs, \"Woah! How...how the hell would he even walk around with that thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie kept looking at the image of the man's sexy body and his large cock, but eventually she gets bored and tosses the magazine to the side of the bed and lays her head back thinking of everything that has been going lately, \"man how could I be the one immune to this virus, why me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets that thought bounce around her mind for a few minutes before sitting up on the edge of the bed stretching her arms above her head and yawns, \"aaahhhh.....man I'm tired, maybe I need some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie stands up grabs her backpack and heads out of the room, she walks by the couch and sees Joel passed out. Slowly she passes by him and sneaks out the front door. Once outdoors Ellie looks around looking for a place to be safe from any infected and spots a tall enough tree, \"that should work fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie walks over to the tree and slowly begins climbing the tree, but as she does she loses footing and she falls to the ground landing on her back. For some reason when Ellie landed her vision kept moving all around even though she could tell her body was stationary. Eventually Ellie's focused again and she was like 15 feet away from the tree and she was laying on her side, \"what the hell happened did my head fall off or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to push herself up and she felt her body stand up, but her vision  hadn't changed at all, \"what the is...is that my body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Ellie's vision she saw her body stand up with no head on her shoulders standing there feeling it's neck stump, \"woah I feel that.\" she starts giggling as it starts to tickle. She tries to move her body towards her head, but she stumbles and falls over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this harder than I thought it would be.\" she said, but then she saw her body getting up without her doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...ohh, this can't be good.\" As she sees her body rubbing the dirt off its sleeves and pants then it takes off running away from Ellie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Come back you...you body! Wait am I yelling at my body, it's not going to hear me it has no ears, fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie just lays there on her side of watching her body run away and says, \"fuck me, what I'm a going to do now I need that. What am I going to tell Joel...\" \"Joel.\" Ellie repeats, \"that its he can help me.\" So Ellie starts yelling Joel over and over until she hears \"Ellie what's wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down here on the ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looks around and sees nothing but what looks like a ball, \"where are you Ellie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the ground I said.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel loos around and walks over to where Ellie's voice is coming from and when he got closer to the ball looking object he stopped, \"Ellie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup it's me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel runs over and kneels down and picks Ellie up in his hands, \"Ellie what happened...you're just...a...head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...I fell off that tree and well...as you can see my head fell off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel holds Ellie against his chest tightly while standing up, \"hey you're smothering me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ellie, how could have this happened, where's your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but this is so cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie, tell me where your body is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Joel can't you see how cool this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel just gives he a look of frustration and turns around walking back to the house, \"are you gonna say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm just trying to have fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Joel sets Ellie's head on the table and sits down on the couch looking at the bodiless head of the girl he's trying to protect, \"what am I going to do with you Ellie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....I have few ideas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ellie not that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ellie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie just glares at Joel, \"please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they're just staring at each other for a while until Ellie says, \"I'm bored.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't Ellie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on just at least let me see it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain they just stare at each other for a while until Ellie tries move herself off the table, \"okay fine Ellie you can see it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I've been waiting for this ever since I looked at that magazine earlier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What magazine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind I said that and take it out already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel just shakes his head and moves Ellie closer to him and proceeds to take out what Ellie wants to see. What exactly does Ellie want to see so bad?\"</span></div></div>",

Followed by letting them fall down around his ankles revealing the tattered black boxer briefs he's wearing, \"Ellie, why are you making me do this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Joel, let a girl see a real one.\" Ellie answers as she waits in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only get to look at it, okay.\" Joel tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I can do anything else, I'm just a head.\" Ellie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I show you this, we have to go find your body quickly.\" Joel tells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....I was hoping we could just relaxing and you know.\" Ellie teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ellie, we have to find your body.\" Joel tells her as he grabs the waist band of his boxer briefs and pulls them down where he sees Ellie's eyes dart towards his crotch. Where she sees his shaft starting to show along with a large amount of pubic hair, but Ellie just keeps on watching more and more of the shaft of Joel's cock show. Right up until it flops right out of his boxers at an impressive 10 inches which makes Ellie's eyes go wide, \"woah, that's fucking huge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like bigger than my arms.\" Ellie adds as she keeps staring at Joel's cock while thinking about the ones in that magazine and how Joel's makes those look tiny, \"jeeze...Joel why did you tell me you had that monster hiding between there.\" Ellie teases him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie.\" Joel says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm just looking at it.\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie.\" Joel says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh fine.\" Ellie answers as she stops trying to get closer to his cock, \"I was just trying to smell it.\" Ellie adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you can just look at it.\" Joel says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I smell it please?\" Ellie begs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel just looks down at Ellie and thinks about her situation of being just head and figures why not, so he takes a step forward. Forgetting that he has his jeans around his ankles, he trips causing him to fall forward and since Ellie was right at the edge of the table. His entire forth face planted Ellie's face, burying his crotch right on her as he fell forward onto the table. Where he caught himself from falling further with his hands, \"WOAH!!!\" Ellie screams before she says, \"its super smelly down here.\" As she smells Joel's crotch  which he can feel, so he was about to get back up slowly when he suddenly felt something wet against his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich made him jump up to see Ellie's head with her tongue sticking out, \"Ellie!!\" Joel says as she gets dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh come on Joel, I saw an opportunity and took it.\" Ellie says, \"and by the way, it smelled and tasted so good.\" Ellie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich makes Joel get dressed quicker and gather his things so they can head to find Ellie's headless body. While Ellie is just smiling that she made Joel actually do this and get so flustered, \"when can we do that again?\" Ellie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie.\" Joel calls out, \"what, I'm just asking.\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it's just silence as Joel collected all his stuff along a few of Ellie's things she left behind. As for Ellie's head, he tied a rope around her neck and left a big loop that he put over his head to let Ellie hang on his chest so his hands are free. From there the head out of the abandoned house where Joel looks around, \"okay Ellie, where did your body go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie.\" Joel says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...I can't feel it so I have no idea.\" Ellie answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember where it went?\" Joel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.....I think it went towards those trees over there.\" Ellie answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a start.\" Joel says and begins walking that way while Ellie just sways around humming some little tune since she can't do much else. They just keep going while Joel's keeps an eye out for anything that resembles Ellie's body or an enemy. However they spot nothing but animals and birds. With the occasional infected popping up which Joel shoots right away in the head, \"nice shot Joel.\" Ellie says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there thy just keep going and going until they reach the tree line where Joel sees small foot prints in the soft ground, \"hmm.\" Joel says as they look about the same size as Ellie's feet, so he starts following them into the woods. A trail of foot prints that seem very sporadic in nature instead of just going straight, they zig zag, loop around go in between small gaps in between trees. Almost like something else found Ellie's body before they did, but Joel hopes it's just Ellie's body trying to throw off whoever is following her. Joel just keeps on going, following the trail the best he can until.....</span></div></div>",

Always prone to kidnapping and abduction, very little surprised her about that part of mysteries anymore. On routine, she would've gotten up...if only she could feel her arms to do so! Lying sideways, Daphne opened her eyes, all puzzled. However, it wasn't until she felt a breeze below her head that she had any cause for alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...Jeepers!\" she exclaimed. Her entire body went missing! This felt too real to be a dream. Somehow, her pretty head got separated from the rest of her, leaving Daphne completely helpless. \"Uhh...help anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no clue how she got to her current location or even how long she'd been stuck there. The only thing Daphne could think of doing was inch her head around in each direction, mostly by pushing herself on her jaw. Not the most pleasant idea, especially for her hair, but the options were limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she got excited. \"Velma! Thank goodness, I was so worried about being stranded\u2014\" Immediately Daphne noticed the problem. Conversely, all of Velma was there <i>except for</i> her head!! The body laid in this position:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/c757/th/pre/f/2012/320/a/0/velma_by_jimsam_x-d5l5x61.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pre00.deviantart.net/c757/th/pre...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this stinks,\" Daphne added. She pictured Velma in a similar predicament, yelling out a variant of her usual issue; \"My head! I can't see without my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that laugh, Daphne wondered if she could communicate with Velma's body somehow. \"Velma...can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body stirred a little. She checked whether it understood her. \"If you can hear me, raise your hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma's body complied. Daphne pondered other commands to give it. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey friend's body made pushing gestures around where her head should've been, and then a falling motion. Whoever did this, Daphne deduced, wanted to make them both as helpless as possible. \"So then...can my body communicate with others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma's body simulated nodding with her torso. \"But then...why can't I seem to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body made a 'no' gesture. Daphne figured she might have misunderstood how this whole head-body link works. \"Weird stuff. Anyways, how about we get up and out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma's body responded positively towards that thought. It and Daphne finessed towards each other, one lacking vision and the other lacking mobility, until Velma's body finally picked her up.</span></div></div>",

She instantly assumed control of it...\"Eyeww, I feel all short and sweaty!\" Daphne complained. Still, this was better than no body...but not by much. She would never be caught dead looking this way. This outfit clashed too much with her fair, especially the baggy sweater. Velma was by no means ugly, but she never wore anything that showed off her body. But Daphne wanted this to be a temporary arrangement out of embarrassment. This body was plenty unpleasant...and Daphne shuddered at the thought of Velma having hers. She made a beeline for the door, a feat made easier by Velma's admittedly more practical footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wasn't the brains of the gang, Daphne knew a clue when she saw one. She recognized footprints from her actual body and decided to retrace her steps. She followed it down a corridor when she came across a mirror on the wall. Daphne took the moment to observe her current predicament. Looking at this borrowed body, she noticed how natural her head meshed with its neck. You would never suspect anything off about her appearance if you had never met her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the diva, Daphne couldn't help but check herself out. It wasn't the <i>worst</i> body she could've landed up with; and her name wouldn't be Daphne Blake if she couldn't give any girl a makeover. Daphne thought for a second about the most 'Velma' thing she could do.She straightened her legs, arched her back, put one hand behind her back and the other pointing a finger up. With a smile that held back all giggling, she uttered \"Jinkies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/d411/i/2009/232/9/2/headswap_02_by_natasha2000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://img00.deviantart.net/d411/i/2009...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't deny how silly and fun this little out-of-body experience was turning out. \"Daphne Dinkley?\" She also said. \"Nice little ring to that name.\" And so Daphne continued getting used to her friend's body. It's not like she viewed Velma's body as inferior...but, the grass did seem greener right then. But she did have to move on, and at least address her missing friend...and oh yeah, body.</span></div></div>",

She reattached it to her hand and it healed. It looked like as if it was never cut off to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne concluded, \"So this must be the device that decapitated Velma and me. No wonder I survived. It must be magical, or something.\" She put the piece of the blade in her pocket. \"Maybe I could find another clue that will lead me to Velma's head and my body.
