            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a warm autumn day at the Canterlot Courthouse, but it was anything but typical. In the streets outside the courthouse, two mobs were rioting two very different sides of a high class case. Inside the courthouse was order, with the presence of the Honorable Judge Order, who presided over the defense and the prosecution. On the prosecution was the cold hearted unicorn Counselor who could not be named since it could endanger his life, who was going over notes and evidence. On the defense was one of the best lawyers in Equestria, Moonstone who calmly brushed his black mane and straightened his red tie, wanting to make a good impression as his client sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis client was a short gray Pegasus stallion who was shaking in his seat, scared of the possibility that he could lose. If compared to Moonstone, the stallion was meek to his lawyer's strength that shined in the courthouse lights, along with his piercing red eyes. He was dressed in a cheap blue suit that clearly stated his lack of wealth, and wore small glasses that were slightly cracked on one of the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crime that the pegasus stallion was accused of was the murder of his wife.Both sides had argued their points for over a week and were about to deliver their closing arguments. Outside, the mobs were roaring their points, to kill the stallion as he killed his wife, or that he was innocent and being framed. But as the jury sat in their stand, the court and the mobs outside were silent, waiting for both sides to argue. The Counselor stood and walked in from of the jury, his plump face already turning red for his rant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mares and gentlecolts, you are gathered here today to decide of this stallion's life. You have heard testimony that the accused was angry at his wife and that his feather was found at the scene of the crime. You have heard from the guards who found the defendant in the crime scene after the time of the murder. So ask yourselves, do we want a murderer put on the fine streets of Canterlot? Think of your families at home, do we really want the defense to let this stallion off easy for his sins against Celestia and Luna? No! So when you think about this stallion, remember that he will commit the act again, thank you.\" The Counselor wiped his face and sat at the table just as the Pegasus started to cry, smiling smugly at the certainty of the jury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that is when everything changed in the courtroom, after Moonstone slowly comforted the Pegasus, he slowly got up and walked to the center of the room with such power in his step that the room was a buzz with energy and his sharp eyes looked over everything from the jurors to the audience watching his back, then in a soft but firm voice, he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I often find myself thinking back to my first time in this courthouse. It was the first time I felt the power of this courtroom. Unbiased, unprejudice... Fair.\" Moonstone stated as he looked up from his thoughts to find all eyes were fixed on him. \"You have heard the honeyed words of the Counselor here, how my client was supposedly at the crime scene and how he was angry. He is deceiving you from the truth, that he heard earlier in this case. This Pegasus was truly in a flower store, buying his wife flowers for their anniversary, not leaning over her dead body. He has admitted to being upset with his wife before she was murdered, but can anypony say in this court room that their marriage has never had a rough bump? Not only that, but my client has no history of any crimes, while a previous suspect the Canterlot guard held had multiple counts of assault but was let go not only ten minutes after being caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone then faced the jury. \"Now that you are presented with the truth facts of this case, can any of you say that this case is unbiased, unprejudice, or even fair? This case is a joke, made by the Canterlot Guards who know that this stallion is not the one who murdered his wife and let the real killer go free because of a bribe. I could not live with myself if an innocent stallion or mare goes into prison for a crime they have no committed. Could any of you?\" Moonstone finished and quietly went back to his chair as the court was left shocked, of the court were both Princess Celestia and Luna who had watched the entire case from start to finish.</span></div></div>",

Moonstone comforted the pegasus, encouraging him and his conscience. However it was cut short when he was summoned to the royal box, where both Princess Luna and Princess Celestia watched the full court's proceeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the week, Celestia was very angered at the pegasus for murdering his wife and that anger stayed with her as the royal guard in question was one of her greatest and most \"loyal\" guard ponies she had. However, Luna kept an open mind and heard Moonstone's arguments and understood that maybe the pegasus was innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone had to walk out of the courtroom and walk up a few flights of stairs and passed five sets of guards, each one of them giving him a glare of threats.  However, Moonstone dealt with the same thing in his first case in Manehattan, defending a widowed mare who was framed on the crime of murder and found the facts to prove the innocence of the widow and convict the actual murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then was stopped by a Pegasus Lunar Guard who had a smile on his dark grey coated face and then lifted the red curtain revealing...</span></div></div>",

There is no incentive that one of them to kill in cold blood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone then said calmly and respectfully, \"You say that the guard that I have accused for murdering my client's wife is loyal to you and your sister. However, I can learn more about a person by looking into their eyes and what I saw what he is deceitful, crafty, and has only a heart for himself. And I have plenty of evidence from witnesses putting him in the area that exact hour and that we found a tuff of his white coat on the deceased and in the bedroom where the murder occurred.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia then questioned, \"Who do you even work for? Most Lawyers are crooked and conceited egotistical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone just laughed and said, \"Princess, you just described the counselor.

THIS ISN'T FAIR, I'M INNOCENT!\" The Pegasus screamed as the Pegasus guards started to take him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pegasus guards stopped when they heard the voice of Moonstone, quiet but firm.

If that does not work, Ifile an appeal and we will come back. I will get you free, I swear it on the Sun and the Moon, and all of the strength in my body that I will get you free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny other pony wouldn't have believed their attorney with such a promise but the Pegasus simply nodded and cried as he was dragged away out of sight. \"You do realize that he isn't getting out of prison alive don't you?\" The confident Consular said with a smug smile as he appeared next to Moonstone. \"That little statement you made about the Canterlot Guards is sure of that. Why didn't you just agree to the deal? Life in prison isn't a bad choice when faced with the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone just stared into the Consular's eyes with his own. \"It is if he committed any crime, that stallion is framed, and you know that.\" To this, the Consular scoffed. \"Colt, I know, but where is your evidence to prove it?  The word of a good stallion means horseapples to hard evidence that ponies can touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find it, I will not let this go.\" Moonstone stated as he started to head out. \"That is a promise.\"</span></div></div>",

But to understand the meaning of why I am telling you this, we must start like every good story does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was a very young colt, a few days from reaching the age of 50 (which is about the age of 8-10 to a normal pony), The final plans for the new castle in Canterlot was almost complete and we were about to move away from the olden castle where my mother Luna and my father whose name I bear lived, married in, and delivered me in. My father was up in age but was still young and nimble in body. My mother was very excited for this day to arrive for me and she wanted to have a grand event for me at the new castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut weeks before, Celestia and Luna had a slight disagreement one evening afternoon and as the night began to cover all over the nation, my mother left her post and flew to every city in the nation of Equestria and took all the abandoned fillies and colts wait to a new paradise, where they wouldn't have to suffer with oppression or neglect. Celestia could only feel the disturbance, but could not make out what it was till later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week of my birthday came along, I was very excited and slowly frightened. For being nearly 50 year old alicorn and not having a cutie mark yet, it was kind of a big deal for me to try and find my cutie mark before my 50th birthday. I woke up near a hour after sunrise and saw that I fell asleep with my head resting on my mother's flank as she rested next to my father. I slowly tried to wiggle myself between them but felt like I was going to wake them up and I began to get off of them until my hoof slid and I fell off my mother's body and landed next to her. I then waited to see if she was going to wake up but she remained silent as I crept away and out the bedroom door and began to trot towards my room in the castle...</span></div></div>",

He had been waiting for the day to see his mother again as he had only seen her in dreams, visions, and some of the many art pieces that hung around the palace but never in her physical form as the last time he saw her like that was before she became the monster known as Nightmare Moon. His mind slowly began to drift into doubt, \"Did I miscount? My math could have been wrong...It wouldn't be the first time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon had miscalculated before in the past; the most recent being ten years ago... He stayed up the entire day and night waiting for a sign that she was going to reappear. The memory was very clear and when he finally realized that his calculations were incorrect, he had to find a way to distract himself from falling into the same pit he fell into when his father passed away. To do that, he took a small absence from Canterlot to fly around to areas that he had only read about. Celestia always wanted him to go out and see the world; so he took that almost literally as he went from each direction of Equestria and wrote about what he saw in his own journal. The only issue came after he returned home; he wanted to share what he knew about the world but that would expose the one thing that only a few ponies knew: the fact that he was an alicorn and in addition; the son of a monster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince then took a moment to pause as he stood a measly few hoofsteps away from his Aunt's door, almost feeling like the colt that he was a millennium ago as he stared at it before quietly speaking to himself, \"Please let me be right this time...\" With that, he slowly began to finish his trot to the door...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hypon was nicknamed \"the Good Samaritan Prince\" by some of the subjects in Equestria; mainly by some of the lower class ponies. Hypon's father, Moonstone, was just the same, but he couldn't do it as much as his son could today. Hypon cared for his poorer subjects just as the richest subjects and the merchants, but his heart was mainly for the poor. Hypon would occasionally visit several families that he had helped before. Hypon gave out from his earned profits as an investor, helping start people's businesses with a low interest rate that seemed very fair to many and turned out to be a great help to business owners and the poor in Equestria. Hypon knew what he did was right, even when others though otherwise. But one day, Hypon ran into a very old friend he had once helped when she was a filly and her family was suffering and she felt like she had sank back into the pit of no hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>One bright day in Ponyville</b>, Hypon was finishing a visit with a widow and her two small children. Hypon knew this widow worked very hard to keep her family from starving, since her husband died, and with both of them nearing the age of entering Ponyville's School System, it was getting hard on the poor widow to make ends meet. However, Hypon helped her by giving the widow one and a half month's supply of food, clean clothing, new books and school equipment, and whatever the widow needed to put her kids through school or anything they were lacking in their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon walked through the streets of Ponyville with a smile and would stop at the center of town, near a stone fountain that was placed since the settlement of Ponyville. Hypon smiled as he could hear the retelling of that tale by his Aunt Celestia, remembering every detail from memory. Hypon stared at the masterpiece of stone and smiled as he remembered the first time he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile.. in the Shadows of Ponyvile</b> A figure was scurrying through several trash dumps, looking for a meal to eat in the rubbish. It didn't seem to care about that the alleyway was brighten by daylight, expect at the back wall where she was. All the figure cared about was not getting caught by anypony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Hypon, he broke out of his marvel gaze at the fountain and began to walk again in the streets of Ponyville, looking for something to do,<br>\r\nsomeone to help, or anything in between. Hypon walked south, towards Sugarcube Corner, hoping partly that Pinkie Pie wouldn't stop him, since he would always try very hard not to laugh at her gimmicks or shenanigans. As Hypon pasted Sugarcube Corner, he took a quick sigh of relief as he made it pass Pinkie Pie's stomping ground, but could hear something faintly coming around the next corner; like somepony was moving around trash. As Hypon's curious nature got the best of him, Hypon slowly and quietly trotted toward the corner to see a bright alleyway with a darkened back.

And with two other cans here in this revolting alley left to search, Trixe's hopes doesn't seem to have increased...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then turned and put his back away from the alley, shocked at whst he had heard. \"Trixe?!\" Hypon thought to himself and then added, \"Why is Trixe back in Ponyville and why is she looking in the trash?\" Hypon remained very silent as he pondered of what to do next...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sombra knocked Celestia back with a dark mist where she fell victim to her fear while Luna watched as she was pinned against a pillar, but was freed after Celestina's missed blast wedged a large enough hole for her to return to the fight. However, Sombra was very cunning and as the fight progressed, Luna's sword was knocked away from her by Sombra's Scythe and was trapped in a cone of crystal where Sombra tried to tempt Luna with an offer he thought she would accept: a chance to rule without her older sister in her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Luna denied Sombra's offer and then broke free of her prison, charging towards the pony of shadow. Sombra thought he had the upper hand and did the exact move he did on Celestia and attempted to cripple her with fear, but in the end; he only awoken the darkness in inside her heart and slowly making Celestina's fear for her younger sister almost a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crystal Empire vanished that day, along with the very ruler who was sworn to protect it, who was the very first victim of Sombra's Rage: Princess Amore, who was changed into dark crystal and had her body dashed across the world. Many ponies believe that if one pony would be able to find all of her pieces, she could be brought back. But even if that was so, it would be too late for her to return and not have repercussions. And in the case of Sombra, he was dead; or was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Current Day Equestria</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was in his study, looking at scans of Sombra's secret journal, found by Twilight and Princess Cadence. Hypon was always curious about the past, especially around the time of his birth, but as he read each page of Sombra's writing; he couldn't help but feel some pity for the young colt who grew up as a social outcast as he grew up in the Crystal Empire. While Twilight was away, he was in charge of watching Spike, who was sleeping on his bed next to one of Hypon's old toys. Hypon occasionally would look at Spike to make sure he was comfortable, but would go back to his work and wrote in his very own personal journal, holding many facts and secrets that he didn't want any pony to see, even his closest friends, knowing that it could change how they would look at him. But after reading the end of scan number three, Hypon got out of his chair and walked towards the balcony to be in peace and speak out his thoughts to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a menace for what he did a very long time ago, but he was also someone who was an outcast by the very ponies who raised him. It makes some pony wonder why the events landed the way they did.\" Hypon then sighed and then added, \"Once Twilight gets back, I wonder if she will ask if I was able to find anything unique or odd from a second look.\" Hypon then frowned as he then thought back to an earlier reading of Princess Amore and her account of Sombra, she knew what was going to happen, but chose to do nothing during Sombra's upbringing that led to her own downfall and just walked back into his study, ready to dig deeper for any other knowledge of Sombra's past.</span></div></div>",

Hypon then hid his wings ever since, taking only the wraps off to train his wings at midnight, earning him the nickname; Nightshroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hypon was quiet for a different reason; a certain relationship with a close mare who was a guard. Ever since she heard the rumors, she tried to persuade Hypon from getting close to somepony who didn't know the truth about him, but that all changed when Celestia caught both of them walking through Canterlot at night and Celestia had to move the pegasus mare to a different post that Hypon couldn't get to, causing Hypon to feel betrayed from the lack of trust between them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was furious at the matter, but tried to let it go, but even with all his ways to calm himself down; it was almost pointless as this wasn't the only time that his Aunt got in between him and a mare.

Why shouldn't you try and see how he would respond to your request? You never know until you try, Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, \"Nightshroud\" was trying to remain calm and be as separated from his own thoughts. He wanted to help guide Applejack on the right path, but his feelings for her as a friend were trying to cloud his mind. Hypon had always cared for Twilight Sparkle's friends, making sure that they weren't dealing with any troubles of their own. However, he had always seen Applejack at her best most days not really seeing this side of her that often. This made him want to help her even more so but also nervous as he knew that his selection of mate could really paint a very black mark on him and more importantly; her. Hypon didn't want to put that kind of pressure on her but he knew if he wanted to help her think positively; he had to support her earlier claim rather than telling her that she should just forget about him being a proper suitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Nightshroud showed that he wanted to at least encourage her to try before assuming that the Prince would not be interested as he kept direct eye contact with Applejack, trying his best not to stare into her green eyes or her face as he could quickly see that she had a slightly raised eyebrow towards him after his blurted response that was beginning to lower after his explanation of what he meant to actually say.</span></div></div>",

It was a small little studio that he used on occasion as a small getaway from his life as a royal member of society. The building wasn't flashy or anything elaborate like Canterlot, but it was his home away from home and he treasured it like a precious jewel. Hypon had made sure that the studio looked like it was well-kept and orderly while also placing some of the lesser valuable and unseen trinkets that he owned within inside the sturdy walls of the studio. Once Nightshroud arrived at the studio, he simply brought out the spare key that he had hidden in one of the nearby bushes in a small blue box that had his symbol of a shield, the crescent moon, and three white stars that rested at the top of the shield. He then entered the studio and retired \"Nightshroud\" for the night before making his departure from the studio as his normal prince self, resetting the entire studio and placing his spare key back within the hiding spot that was in the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, in the cover of night; the prince had made his departure from Ponyville by using his teleportation spell to reappear back in his tower at the palace before finally retiring in his chambers, exhausted but delighted in the events that had occurred as he never expected to get that close to one of his friends before. Moonstone fell asleep quickly that night as the amount of magic to keep himself in his cover was very draining on him and the teleportation spell was the final straw as he passed out from a mild exhaustion on his bed...</span></div></div>",

The kiss was a completely random thought in her head that she acted on, but she didn't regret it, only felt like it she would be a little awkward about the next time she saw him. Yet the idea he gave her remained, and even though it was not easy, she managed to get Mac and Granny behind her as long as she kept them updated on who she was seeing. Even thought Applejack knew that she had her family handled for now, it was a little more difficult when she saw Rarity come over to her, immediately hoping that it was just to wish her a good day and not to talk about Nightshroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack, you're looking happy today.

What's the matter with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity however just seemed unphased, tilting her head slightly to the right. \"Darling, I'm only curious since he is a handsome stallion and you left with him after a night out having fun like you haven't had in a while. I spent most of the night wondering if you had let loose a bit with him or if he stayed gentlecoltly with you the entire time so forgive me for being eager to learn what happened.\" Once Applejack took enough breaths to calm down and give Rarity some space, Rarity continued. \"But you must like him somewhat if you kissed him or he must've given the best advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's complicated...\" Applejack sighed out as she could feel a sliver of truth in her gut, but shook her head. \"Ah'll tell ya everything at the boutique in a little while, just let mah shopping get done for Granny first...\" She also needed time to figure out her feelings on the matters of Nightshroud and how to obtain his idea of a relaxed relationship within Ponyvile as the white mare raised an eyebrow and slowly nodded. </span></div></div>",

We both want you to be happy and find a right partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then stopped and then asked, \"This is because I walked two friends home last night and one of them kissed me out of appreciation for helping her think about the problem that was on her mind the entire night? Mother, I can understand your concern, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna interrupted, \"Your friend had a dream about your alter last night. That could cause some issues if she were to find out from anyone else but you, Hypon. I just wanted to warn you that you shouldn't mess with her emotions like that. I know that she is a very close friend of yours and you care about her; I just want you to think about where going down that path may lie. Please tread lightly for me; I know Celestia would rather not try to cover up anything during the busy season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon just sighed, \"Alright, mother. I want to tell her that it was me; I truly do. The issue is that she may or may not already have feelings for me by how she spoke last night about me. But I will tread lightly as I possibly can. Is this all that you needed me to talk to me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna continued, \"Other than that, I just wanted to see if you wanted your friends any invitations to any of the upcoming social events?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation then went inside, but before they went back inside the palace; while Jade was finishing up her notes, she began to hum, <br>\r\n\"Moonstone's got a marefriend, Moonstone's got a marefriend.\" That caused Hypon to give a quick glance towards the dragon resting on his back where the singing stopped and seeing Jade's tongue stick about as she teased. Luna was smiling at Jade's remarks, even if she had her fears about her son falling in love; it was a blessing to see the dragon she got for her son to at least have some humor to lift the princess's mood before Hypon answered, \"I know that they might want an invitation to the Gala, mother.

It's been sometime since I've seen you both and I don't think I've heard about this...\" Hypon tried to put up a good face as he already knew what was happening, but for the sake of his cover he tried to appear out of the loop like if he wasn't a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity quickly picked up Hypon's question as she started coming up with ideas that could use Hypon to Applejack's advantage. \"Oh Hypon darling, I forgot that you didn't know. Applejack here is looking to put herself back on the market again.\" Hypon glanced at Applejack and saw her defeatedly sigh at her friend's gossipy nature, squirming in her seat like she wanted to leave the table and conversation behind. \"She had a good start earlier this week after we went clubbing, when a rather handsome stallion joined us after a brief misunderstanding. What was his name dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightshroud.\" The farm mare answered and without missing the beat, followed up before Rarity could finish. \"Since ya had to bring that up, it's not so good. Ah can't seem ta go past a date without being turned off from anything they say after an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Applejack settled in her seat, Rarity glanced back at Hypon with her eyes foreboding for the three of them. \"Say Hypon, that Gala is coming up isn't it? Why don't we try with a fresh crowd of suitors, and a little change in environment?\" Before Applejack could try to wrestle out of it, the fashionista put her hoof down. \"You said you wanted to try a relaxed relationship, well this is how you do it, so stop trying to find misses and see if maybe you find someone nice. Who knows, maybe you can bump into Nightshroud again there, since you enjoyed it last time ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, Ah'll try at the Gala to find someone, just knock it off Rare.\" Applejack motioned her friend to quiet down, but Hypon could see an actual smile forming as it seemed she considered the idea of seeing his alter ego with joy. It didn't exactly do him well as it meant either being honest at who he was or giving Applejack more ideas about somepony he created for himself while at an event that was equal parts business and pleasure. He was however distracted from his thoughts when Applejack waved a hoof slightly to get his attention. \"What do ya say Hypon? Would it be alright if we got some tickets for the Gala and tried to look around for someponies Ah like...?\"</span></div></div>",

Hypon decided to put full focus onto the Gala and making sure he knew which guests to avoid and which ones to introduce for Applejack. That information got the ears of both his mother and aunt causing them to discuss what they should do before deciding that Celestia would try and see where her nephew was coming from, knowing that he was a very intelligent stallion and that he must have his reasons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following afternoon before the Gala began, Hypon met Celestia in her chambers. Hypon was already dressed elegantly as he was prepared for the occasion after already knowing that he would have guests coming to the Gala while Celestia was getting her last few items prepared before fitting into her dress. \"You know that both I and your mother are worried about you when it comes to affairs like this one, Hyperion,\" Celestia stated as she turned to face her nephew that she treated like a son, calling him by his full first name to show how serious she was before continuing, \"So why don't you tell me your side of the story? What are you trying to get out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon took a moment to breathe and finally answered back, \"I want to see a friend of mine be happy. Applejack had been in a very rough situation and is looking for a relationship due to family pressure. I am just trying to help her as best I can before I speak my mind to her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia understood why Hypon would have any type of feelings for Applejack as she was a very down to earth mare with great values that came from her family's raising and background as a farmer and a sales mare and then asked, \"Do you think she is the right mare for you? You know that Luna and I have also been looking for you a suitor; we are just trying to think about your best interests.\" Hypon stopped his aunt there, walking by her and heading towards the balcony as he spoke, \"Not to be blunt, Aunt Celestia, but we both know that my father wasn't on any list of suitors. He proved his worth to my mother by standing up for what he knew was right and winning a case where everything was against him in the first place. I know that you both want to find someone that would be an excellent member of the family line and that you would prefer them to be a pony of class or came from a royal family; but when I look into their eyes, I can see their intentions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a pause to breathe as he tilted his head down to look at the balcony, hearing his aunt's hooves following him outside as he continued, \"I just want some pony who does not see this as a chance to step up higher on the totem pole of society or a chance to be ruler. I just want someone I can spend time with because I already know that I am going to outlive any pony I marry by centuries.\" There was a strong sense of passion in his words as he kept his head down before feeling his aunt's wing over him before feeling her hug him, speaking softly, \"I understand where you are coming from, Hypon. But you did not answer my question? Do you think she is the one for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon left Celestia's chambers moments after speaking his response to his aunt's question, gaining his aunt's blessing on the decision he would make at the moment as she knew where he stood on the matter. There was a lot on the young prince's mind as he walked down his aunt's corridor towards his own chambers to wait for when his friends would arrive as he pondered his decision and what he said to his aunt, knowing full well that she was going to pass it along to his mother. He just needed some time alone to himself as he had gotten worked up over something minuscule in the eyes of someone who would live for a very long time as his answer rung through his ear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>I do not know...</i></b></span></div></div>",

Twilight joined her friends Rarity and Applejack since she was expected to join Celestia while Rainbow Dash kept Fluttershy company after asking Hypon for tickets since Fluttershy needed more social practice. Rarity had focused on their outfits and looks to keep them in style but the more elegant look was reserved for their farm mare friend. Even Applejack was wearing makeup along with ditching her trademark hat for designer hair, even though she felt out of her element, Rarity insisted that it was help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other as the others drifted off, watching stallions pour through with their dates or partners, glancing around for their friend to greet them and take over for Rarity. \"Ah didn't think this through, look at all those fancy ponies with their partners, Ah haven't seen a single one on their own...\" Applejack felt nerves hit her, feeling out of place in a party for the upper class, but her friend joined her side and helped her walk away from the gates and into the main floor. \"Don't get second thoughts AJ. We came here on a mission and we aren't leaving until you are with someone who you like. Besides, we owe it to Hypon to see him for letting us in anyway, now come on darling. You aren't the only one who wants to look around tonight for a hunk.\" Rarity quickly responded to her friend's anxiety and pulled her towards the main stairway to wait for Hypon to come down with Luna with the other ponies, as they agreed he would come to them after his reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack tried to come up with another excuse, but realized her friend had already tuned her out, making her sigh as she looked around for familiar faces. She half expected to see Blueblood as he always seemed to find mares who were all alone, but a part of her wanted to see if Nightshroud was around. She had asked around if he had shown up and yet she seemed to struggle to meet up with him before he disappeared several times, almost like he was avoiding her. Applejack honestly wasn't sure why she was so intent on seeing him, a part of her appreciated his advice and wanted to thank him personally, but her other half was focused on the fact he represented everything she liked in a stallion if not for some appearance touch ups. In fact, she had been wondering for a while why she was nervous to be around Hypon with her feelings, even though she opened her heart to a stranger like he was one she could trust. Appejack assumed that it was easier to talk to Nightshroud since he represented what she liked but was neutral to her problems, where Rarity was far too involved for her comfort and Hypon was someone she respected too much to have him play matchmaker for her while he had to help host the Gala with his family.</span></div></div>",

The whole night you've been nothing but quiet and noncommitted , not like the AJ I know and care about, more like Fluttershy. You seem to be embarrassed by the whole concept of dating... or are we not looking at your type?\" Rarity continued, looking rather thoughtful as she also galnced at Nightshroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack raised an eyebrow at her friend and stopped walking to give the white mare a glare. \"And what do ya mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm merely suggesting we try... other options to see if you are more comfortable, more... feminine ones...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud.... Ah ain't that way, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you so resistant to being yourself around stallions like our friend here?\" Rarity countered quickly, digging into her friend for the truth she seemed to avoid telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshroud had already turned to see his friends during the conversation with worry that Rarity was being too nosy, only to see Applejack crack under the pressure and sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Ah'm not opposed to being around them, Ah just... Ah already like someone that way. But it's stupid, and Ah will be the laughingstock of Ponyvile and mah entire family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity simply started to think, understanding a bit more but wanted to get to the bottom of this. \"Applejack, nothing is stupid about a crush. Who is it? Is it somepony we know...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... it would be someone we know well, a stallion, someone different than the common pony for you to get so worked up about it... wait....\" Rarity thought outloud as they walked again to her boutique, before she stopped cold and was wide eyed at her orange farm mare friend. \"Oh! Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Applejack dipped her head with a completely red face, as they were almost there. \"Ah know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um... there's nothing wrong with it dear. It's just so... surprising that you feeling that way about him, and someponies might... take it the wrong way. I mean I understand the appeal, completely, it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just... just go home, Ah'm tired and don't wanna talk 'bout this anymore.\" Applejack interupted Rarity's stumbling on her words, looking completely deflated at her close friend's response and embarrassed it even came up.</span></div></div>",

Applejack rarely hung around other stallions expect her brother and himself. He wasn't anywhere near the standards of a common pony, even though he had their best interest at heart with any decision he made. In his mind, the pieces were pointing at him but he didn't want to put any positive thought that it was him being his friend's crush. Hypon did have a small number of feelings for Applejack as she was someone that she respected when it came to her opinions and point of view, but his status would cause a field day of issues for everyone in the royal family if he were to marry below him. He did not want to push all of that pressure onto his family as they had to cover up so much for him way back when he was younger and didn't know what he could get away with. And even after all of that to top everything, both Celestia and his mother were looking for him someone that he could be married to. He was in a rock and a hard place, not knowing how to get out of the situation he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightshroud then let out a sigh as he looked at both of the mares wondering if they would even dare to mention the name of the pony, but not going to even ask that question, but instead said, \"Sorry to step in and also to keep the subject going for your friend but I would like to speak my piece.\" He quickly saw a curious look from Rarity while seeing the embarrassed glance from Applejack before continuing, \"I have to agree with Rarity that there is nothing stupid about having a crush, that being said; I believe that she might need a small confidence boost if her crush is someone that would cause her to become this embarrassed and fearful. Love doesn't care about status or title, it only cares about if it is genuine or not. I believe that Applejack can do it as she seems like a very strong independent mare like her friend here and all of the support that she has. She just needs to believe in herself...\" He hoped that his words were going to help rather than to hinder as he waited for a response...</span></div></div>",

As a member of the royal family, he had to deal with being the center of attention, especially around members of the press or upper class. One bad step could end up with a story on the front page of any big name newspaper across Ponyville and Hypon especially was fearful of that happening to him when it came to a \"true\" story. He had been able to clear off any rumors before as he rarely did anything that would be considered awful for a member of royalty but couldn't handle people heckling him as a Prince as he wasn't anything like his cousin Prince Blueblood who was a public face to the upper class while Hypon was the public face to the lower classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon gently shook those thoughts off his mind as he wasn't out in public but he was with one of his friends he rarely hung out alone with who was a very good hostess from his first impression. He just didn't want to overstep a boundary that would ruin their friendship or leave a very black mark on it between them. All he wanted to do was to make her feel comfortable on her most hated night of the year and help out any way he could, deciding to let her choose if she wanted to talk about what was on her mind...</span></div></div>",

Celestia feared that the public would turn on the young prince out of fear as he was her child who had caused a great deal of panic which led to almost a thousand years of hiding the fact that Hypon had ever existed.

Hypon turned toward the bedroom door and was greeted with the sight of the timid mare, who had her wings slightly messy and a look that spoke volumes of embarrassment, but also a bit different than before. \"Oh.. thank you... for helping with those Hypon... let me join you...\" Fluttershy spoke softly as she stood by him and lifted the rest of the utensils up to clean with him, noticeably calmer than before, even so much that she happened to brush against his side and didn't recoil and apologize like she always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Hypon answered back, but started to realize that one of her wings had little marks, almost like she had bit it a few times. It was a little hard for Hypon to ignore the few thoughts in his head that told him a certain story of what Fluttershy was up to in her bedroom after she rushed to her room during their meal. He glanced at her as she polished some forks, wondering quietly if him being there had started something she tended to ignore, but knew vocalizing something like that to her would lead them down a conversation Hypon wasn't sure was a good idea for both of them.</span></div></div>",

I know that I and you haven't hung out a lot before with it being just us, but you don't need to be embarrassed because of my response. That being said, you might have been right about it being a little uncomfortable for the table.

Yet after his kiss traveled down her neck in a manner she did not expect to see from the Prince who had moved away from causal encounters, she started to weight the value of his words. Fluttershy felt a dozen of her previous situations she desired between them come to mind, making her blush and fidget more from the possiblity they could come to life, much to Hypon's amusement watching her. However, she took the moment he gave her to truly plan out what she wanted in that moment and decided to think beyond the feelings in her heart and body for something that protected them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy had learned a long time ago that what she considered at her top of the list would be risky for them both and unlikely to happen, with the possible unintended result putting them into a bind on several serious levels. So, she took a small gulp as she considered a distant choice with a lower risk, although she felt her face continue to hold it's bright red color as she voiced it to Hypon as she worried it may make him think of her weirdly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have something I do want. It's... well... I... want...\" The yellow pegasus choked up a bit as her shy nature prevented her from speaking clearly, making Hypon a bit confused as she let off a small exhale out of frustration. However, the fire in her eyes spoke the story about to unfold as she leaned in to kiss him once more and pulled back with a brief statement like she was trying to rush her intent before she choked up again. \"If I overstep with this... tell me as soon as possible and I'll stop... but this is something I want if you are ok with it...\" Hypon wasn't sure what to make of his friend until he felt her push him flat on the couch, wondering how exactly the shy mare planned the next move until he finally realize it with how she laid on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he saw was her yellow flank with the butterflies, before her tail moved and he was face to face with the flower of her garden, making him blush immediately. He could smell her scent and could easily see that she was turned on, but the next thing he realized was the feeling of lips on his shaft, knowing it was the shy mare on top that seemed to act in manner like she deeply wanted this moment. Hypon could only guess how red Fluttershy's face was, but the wings that flexed hard above his head signaled a guess as he felt his own body acting in response to her forward action. His first knee-jerk reaction was to signal Fluttershy to stop as a part of him felt like he was breaking his promise to himself. A second thought entered his mind and felt partly guilty to leave Fluttershy into this situation as it now seemed she had more than a bit of sexual tension built up with him as the focus point. As he felt her shift slightly to gently rub his nose against her slit, he took a breath, knowing that he had one hoof on the train and the other on the station with the conductor waiting for his choice...</span></div></div>",

He also caught the small occasional moan while he worked on her, which his shy friend tried to cover by muffling it with his spire, not wanting him to hear despite his awareness of her arousal increasing from contact with his aroused body or efforts on her.</span></div></div>",

Hypon had been working her flower with an expert ease and had eventually used magic wrapped around her wings to tease, making it harder to keep her mind in control. Half of her body wanted to give in and hit her climax with him where he was, but Fluttershy felt the pull of her fantasies to draw her into a riskier choice, which was harder to pass up with the fog of pleasure in her mind and his willingness to play along. It took a bit of work to detach herself from his spire, which her body drooled over since it began most of her fantasies, but once she did she attempted to get Hypon's attention while he tasted her flower's juices. \"Ah... H-Hypon... ah wait... a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black alicorn pulled his tongue out of her arousal, knowing fully that she was inching close to her climax as her sensitivity was growing and her body showed signs as well, curious what could get her to call for a moment before her desired end.

I was wondering if we could end... in a different way...\" When Hypon saw Fluttershy climb on top of him, he knew what she intended, even before he felt her lower her hips and connect her flower with his tip. The immediate flush of color to her face as well as well as a surprisingly delighted smile that flashed in reaction to feeling him at her entrance painted her face, but she didn't dare move him in more despite small wiggles of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fluttershy gathered her bearings and looked towards her Prince, who was one movement from striking her craving body, in the eyes, and felt her mouth voice her mind without any pause with a \"Please...?\".

Hypon however could tell that in Fluttershy's state, she was thinking less like she did earlier, and knew if he was to go all the way with her that he needed to prevent a mess from happening.

The kiss seemed to catch him off guard as Hypon expected Fluttershy to pull away and grew increasingly embarrassed about their exchanges, but something in the pegasus' eyes at the last moment spoke of the mare inside whom had other ideas. Slowly, the Prince felt Fluttershy begin to act just as before, rubbing her soft fur into his and nearly wrapping her body around his. Hypon couldn't help but feel some of his guard fade as she worked, his body reacting in tune to hers despite his mind wanting to remain collected, as his long period of keeping himself away from a mare's warmth was fighting against his intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy however pulled away from the kiss after Hypon began to look a bit dazed, slowly working the words out that her mouth felt embarrassed to say. \"You did nothing wrong. In fact... I think I enjoyed it a lot... but I... I think I want more...if that's ok?\" The yellow pegasus gently pushed back into their kiss, her face growing more red as time went along, but Hypon's grew in a quick flash when he realized what she implied by a sudden movement on top of him. The shift pushed Hypon's slightly stirred groin against a warm and damp part of her body, alerting him to just how much his efforts or his allowance in terms of letting her express her desires had done. Fluttershy's face remained red as she gently wiggled her lower body against him, making her voice small cute noises within their makeout as her body was teased with his, especially when his body reacted exactly like she had hoped in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his body slowly waking up a part he thought was closed for a while, Hypon returned control of his mind to the situation at hand, knowing if he did nothing Fluttershy would continue on her fantasy without fail. He considered redirecting her from such a serious event by addressing her needs directly, as well as the part of him that warmed up to having the yellow pegasus work her desires out on him. The Alicorn also thought to end this before they hit a line they couldn't go back from, even if the heated mare inside his friend would be disappointed. At the end of his internal debate, Hypon looked his friend Fluttershy in the eyes as she slowed to see his response, and...</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry...\" The yellow pegasus spoke softly to her friend, her hair going to cover her face once more, trying to hide the small shiver of her body to continue as she need to speak with her mind and not her body. \"You have been so wonderful to me and to help me express my feelings... like this...

He slowly glanced downwards and did see the small wetness where she sat that continued from where her arousal began, knowing it was probably not easily to hold down the feelings that had bubbled up between them, but what he did next could lead to more than either of them had considered between them from the moment he came to her door to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon could just let the stiff winged pegasus cool off before anything frisky happened, leaving everything in the air for their next meeting while also allowing Fluttershy much more to consider in terms between them.

Her wings relaxed as well, allowing Hypon to move one wing from around him to cocoon her in warmth like a blanket, adjusting Fluttershy so she still could rest on her side but allowed him to sit upright.

It was possible she would get a sneak peek from Fluttershy's possible dreams, although he knew that she would be formal about everything she saw when talking to him as she did not like airing anyone's private thoughts or dreams if they took certain spins.

Hypon was a nasty eavesdropper but he kept things to himself unless it was absolutely needed to be informed.

Just promise me that you will enjoy yourself and try to relax when you aren't in the public eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just smiled at his remark, knowing that he cared about her, but replied, \"I will try my best, Hypon, but it is still a diplomatic trip; I will be out in the public eye for a majority of the time.

Starlight still felt a small amount of embarrassment due to Hypon's words but understood where he was coming from.

Yet something drawed her eye, even though it was against her code to break formation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the royal family walked by, Celestia and Luna in the front as the pinnacle of what all ponies aspired to be, Amethyst was passed by Prince Moonstone who walked with Sparkle. She had seen him before at a distance, but never so close than the hoof distance that separated the two of them, which surprised her enough to watch him as they went. However she was snapped by by her Commander who slapped the side of her head in order to correct her, his look was not pleased in her rookie mistake. She twitched from the slap to her armored helmet, but kept her composure as the doors opened and a stallion was dragged into the hall pouring tears from their cheeks. The stallion was accused of neglect that caused the death of their filly, a case that was practically unheard of in Canterlot and brought intense pressure from the citizens on the royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order.\" Celestia demanded to the groups of ponies who were there to report or to see the case for themselves, who were whispering before turning completely silent. \"This session is now in order. Your case has been heard by all members of the royal family and your sentencing shall be commenced by the majority of these members. For the record, Twilight Sparkle has choosen to abstain from giving judgement so the judgements from us three shall be enough. For your crime, I would sentence you to the dungeons for an amount of two decades to three. Your habit caused the death of a filly, only punishment is just for such a disregard for life. Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stood over the stallion who tried to keep from squirming under the looks of everyone in the room, yet her tone was softer than her sisters. \"I would sentence that this stallion is treated for their habit, which is to blame for this unfortunate incident, with constant check ups and treatment. If this stallion was free of their addiction, these events would have never transpired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, we are at one for punishment and one for rehabilitation. Prince Moonstone, the floor is yours. What should befall this stallion who's actions resulted in the death of a filly?\" Celestia asked the young prince, catching everyone's eyes including Amethyst who watched him intently.</span></div></div>",

He had the power of someponies' life in his hooves, a feeling that has been a cold reminder of the years that he has lived through. He then took a step forward and spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I state my decision, I would like to say that this trial has been hard on all of the royal family. These events are tragic as it has resulted in the accidental death of this stallion's child. Punishment would seem like the obvious answer; one life for a life. However, Rehabilitation also is a very good answer as well. If his addiction was in heavy control of his mind, the daughter of the accused would still be alive today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon took a quick glance of the room as he paused in mid-sentence to get a look of the crowd that gather around to see the judgement of this one doomed soul. He could feel all the eyes focused on him, but he matched eyes with one of the guards during glance. He couldn't tell who they were easily as the armor did cover enough of their face, but could see the eyes of the guard that he didn't know that was Amethyst before continuing and looking forward to finish his address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that this stallion will suffer a fate worst that being in prison; knowing that the blood of his daughter will always be on his hooves. I would sentence him to go through rehabilitation as well. The pony in front of us is not the one to blame for this horrific accident, but it is his addiction that was in control that caused the sudden demise of the young filly's life. This stallion needs treatment more than he needs punishment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then went back to his orginal spot, embracing the brief silence as he looked directly forward, glaring towards the stallion in chains in way of a disappointed father; one that knows that they had done something wrong but also hides a small glimmer of hope that they will become better afterwards...</span></div></div>",

As my nephew stated earlier, this case has weighted a heavy toll on all of us. We each have spoken our positions in this matter and the final word is that this stallion will be treated for their addiction with the hope that this tragety shall not repeat itself in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst could see that Celestia was trying to keep her composure in front of the ponies as she had hoped to send a message but Moonstone had prevented such action, yet she knew that he only did what he believed was right. It was something she like most ponies, admired in someone of his position and status when his beliefs helped those who needed it most than those were more than well off. She watched as the stallion was dragged away again, not envious of the guard who escorted him around, just as the crowd began to thin out. Amethyst however was required to stay and watched Celestia and Luna talk while Twilight left Moonstone for what she assumed was her home.

However, once the crowd had finally dispersed and it was just him, his aunt, mother and the guards; Hypon took a quiet sigh as he was glad that he was able to get this over and done with. It was very noticeable that this case hit very close to home with the young prince as he remembered countless tales of his father's trials where he defended people who were accused of murder and most of the times, they were actually innocent. It was something he picked up from his father, seeing the good in others before seeing the bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then started to go down the stairs from where he stood, his eyes glancing towards Amethyst as he started to make his way past his aunt and mother, almost making direct eye contact with her before turning his face to go towards the exit, seeming like he was going to retire to his room to at least relax for the moment as his body language was beginning to show the stress that the case has put on him.

She imagined moments like the trial weighted harder on him than most due to his birthright and fresher face to the justice system than his mom and aunt. Amethyst instinctively started to step after him as she did whenever she saw something that caught her attention regardless of the area around her or what was expected of her. Before she got more than a few steps towards Moonstone after he passed her, her commander got in her face and separated the space between her and the Prince. \"Where do you think you're going?! Back in formation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst recoiled as she barely realized that he was trailing behind the Prince with her laser focus on Moonstone, immediately backing into her spot while keeping her head low, feeling the pressure he was glaring at her with. \"Yes sir, sorry sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will talk about this misconduct later...\" He growled at her before he moved to catch up with Moonstone, the glare of his eyes painting the chewing out she was to have. Amethyst bit her tongue as she knew she had made the mistake and the commander, while lacking manners on the best days, was just doing his job. This was to be her second time getting yelled at, the first was after she stopped a captain of the Solar Guard from getting physical on the maid staff. The captain made sure to put her name on the radar for her superiors to all managed her, only after dragging her name into the mud with accusations that were complete lies. If she got into trouble again, she would have a sit-down with Celestia about the nature of her employment, a talk that gave her nightmares.

He had plenty of guard training where he could easily take up the position of Captain if his assistance was required and cared about each pony who dedicated their lives to protect the royalty of Equestria and the capital. \"Who were you barking at this time, captain? Hopefully, you weren't being too harsh on them; today has been stressful enough and I wouldn't like to add anything on top of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone, when he was stuck to be within the capital, usually hung around the barracks when he wasn't doing his rounds outside of the palace. He always enjoyed seeing how the stallions and mares were doing and always checking in on how they were training for any situations, but he rarely got names right without seeing the face that went along with it unless he had a personal relationship with the pony. However, those days were very rare as he didn't enjoy being stuck around Canterlot due to all of the pressure of the higher class equestrian society that his cousin Blueblood seemed to bask in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone waited for the guard captain to respond to his question as he watched an off-white pegasi guard along with a brown earth pony in the same armor patrolling the halls, making sure that no nosy civilian was getting into a place that was off-limits to the public before directing his focus back at the stallion in front of him, his eyes showing the stress while also showing his general curiosity...</span></div></div>",

The Prince moved on to her personal details and started to copy relevance passages on her history, which included her mothers in Canterlot where she grew up along with her applying to the guard once she hit the recruitment age. Amethyst's psych profile stated a deep need to understand and investigate the world around her, along with a consideration to folks who may be left forgotten. However in the file, there was evidence that Celestia didn't think highly of her as the few notes she made seemed to have a negative view of a guard poking into her peers and superiors. In her file, there were notes of her being found in all wings of the castle, even in parts that belonged to Luna where Solar Guards weren't allowed.

Amethyst was sent to the garden for scheduled patrol, accompanied by a friendly unicorn Solar guard that she met when she first started out named Sabre. Despite her friend, Amethyst didn't want to pull her into her own mess, so she kept her out of the accusations and in return Sabre seemed to not acknowledge them during their time together. However this time Sabre seemed to focus on the purple mare more than usual, which meant a talk was brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that the Captain could take a breath once and a while so his face doesn't turn red shouting at you.\" Sabre chuckled slightly as she focused her pink eyes on her friend through her helmet, before turning into a deeper talk. \"This is nice, it would be sad to see the sights here without you, if things don't go well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst felt herself sigh as she knew the guilt trip was her way of getting the point across, but stopped in their walk to talk to her silver coated friend. \"It won't get there. I didn't do anything other than my job, and that is what will matter at the end of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... you really got the Commander upset. The truth may not be enough this time Amethyst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple solar guard felt a small bit of annoyance bubble up and snapped back at her friend's concerns. \"Then maybe the Commander shouldn't have rutted maids and beat those who rejected him into silence!\" After seeing a sad look on her friend's face, Amethyst changed her tone and spoke without a bite. \"I'm sorry Sabre, the pressure is getting to me a little, I didn't mean to take it out on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend slowly shook off her feelings and started to walk again before they were interrupted by a deep voice from the tree beside them. \"I don't see how any of my time off is your business Gem...\" They both turned to see a brown furred stallion sitting against the tree in his Commander uniform for the Solar guard, staring at the mares with piercing icy green eyes. The Stallion turned toward Sabre and nudged his head away from the gardens, staring her down as he spoke with a boom of authority. \"Leave us, Now. This is not meant for your ears...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabre however began to step forward towards her superior until Amethyst flagged her and shook her head, making the silver solar guard glance between them before eventually moving out of the conflict brewing. She was willing to remain in yelling distance if he pulled anything serious despite her friend's wishes to keep her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" The Commander Stallion spoke as he stood up, towering in size compared to the purple mare in front of him, turning his gaze to focus on her. \"I heard that you will be interviewed about the rumors of your misconduct by a royal family member.\" The Stallion walked up to his younger guard and started to get in her space, making her turn her head away from his stare and back up. \"Do you want to guess what you are to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst tried to keep a stone face to his textbook style of dominating their talk, but he had the weight to back up his bold manner, slowly feeling the pillar she backed into as he cornered her with no one around. \"I will tell the truth. I have only done what is necessary as a Solar guard and that you spread lies to cover your own deeds, Grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong.\" The boom of his voice rang in her ears, yet Grim got right in her face to press her harder, unrelenting against the smaller mare. \"You will admit they are all true, you will leave this post and abandon all thoughts about anything else as a guard. While you don't feel it now, your career as a guard is over, it's just how it is. You can kick and scream, but you cannot change your fate, so you should go quietly rather than drag it out and lead yourself into more pain than is necessary.\" He leaned in until she was forced to sit down in front of him or have his face connect and leaned his hoof against the pillar behind her, his tone threatening her safety without saying the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst abandoned her stone expression as she felt fear grip her body about what he could do to her in an isolated place, but pulled a piece from her memory to shake him up in hope she could appeal to the pony inside. \"While I can't condone you assaulting the maid staff as your outlet Grim, I can understand how frustrated you are, especially after losing your wife so soon. You need to see someone or that pain will consume you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't expect was when the same hoof right by her head slammed hard against the pillar, making a small impact site as the Commander looked more unstable than before, backfiring her plan and putting herself into more danger. \"NEVER talk about my wife again. If you do, I'll work my 'frustrations' out on you than just those skirts, or maybe even that dyke friend of yours and show her a real lay. Shut your mouth and back off, this is the last warning you will get.\" Commander Grim then growled as he walked away, leaving the purple mare shaking in her place as he went away, not even acknowledging the silver mare that ran past him to check on Amethyst. He could see the fear in her eyes, for herself or her friend, and that was enough for him to walk away. However, he held ideas in his mind for if she disobeyed as he went, wondering if he would share his efforts with the others...</span></div></div>",

He made sure that any guards in that section of the palace would be aware of her being there with his permission but was not to tell her for what. He wanted to talk to her on a more personal level but had a special plan in place to inhibit \"true conversation\" by using a special mixture of special chalks and magicial prowess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young prince did not want to scare her but he also did not want her to lie to him so the two items together acted as a way to allow him to gain more of an insight into the young mare guard, triggering a light red if she attempted to tell a full lie, a light yellow if it was a half truth/half lie, and would remain white or a light blue while active or if she told the truth. He already prepared the room for this earlier in the night and was dressed in his armored royal attire, showing both commanding marks of his aunt's and mother's symbols along with own royal blue and black crest with his own mark, proudly showing both sides of the lineage he was a part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hoping to get any information to help exonerate her past and maybe find someone that was doing something detestable and using her as a scapegoat to get away with it. But he had to put some amount of trust into the unknown with the guard he only read enough of in paper but had no idea who she was as an individual. All he had to do after sending that letter was to wait and see if she would meet his expectations, shatter them, or not even leave a dent in it as she showed her \"true\" colors...</span></div></div>",

Grim's words bounced in her head to the beat of her hooves, unable to shake the fear he gave him in the garden days ago, while also regretting that she didn't tell Sabre about the threat. She had hoped that it was just him making a point, but the way he acted once she mentioned his wife made her feel like he could actually assualt her and Sabre like the maids. Amethyst turned her mind away from her fear by remembering the humble feeling that Moonstone would see her in a possible one on one, having her curiosity stoked to see him up close again. There were questions she had for him, but she half expected them to melt in her mouth as they met or for him not to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clank of her Solar armor followed her as she went into Luna's section of the palace, feeling the serious gazes of her royal guard as she went by. Amethyst swore she felt some eyes travel her body, but she figured it was just her nerves at play, taking a breath as she slowly came to a stop in front the room which was blocked by two very large earth stallions in full armour. They seemed to shift to the side without breaking their stance, allowing her to move to the door before going back in place once she had made it inside. The room itself was rather large with windows that captured the night outside the walls, with vast collections of books that went from wall to wall. Amethyst slowly looked down and noticed a table in the center of the room where she was expected to sit, with a circle around the floor of it in chalk for some reason, yet no Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming. Please go ahead and sit down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmethyst turned and spotted Moonstone approach from one of the bookshelves in his royal armor, which she couldn't help but feel a bit stunned by the grace he held than when he was in his fancier clothes earlier. It took her a moment to realize she had been staring at him with her mouth open, feeling her face turn red as she stumbled to sit in her chair quickly as he stood at the table waiting for her. Amethyst felt embarrassed at how she looked in front of him, thinking that he saw her as just another fawning mare hoping to gain his favor, but turned to speak as he sat down on the otherside of the table in hope to recover some measure of dignity. \"My Prince, I have come as you have requested of me. I would like to humbly ask by what measure that a royal guard of Celestia can aid you?\"</span></div></div>",

However when he mentioned talking about her, she felt the fear return as Grim forced his way into her mind, unconsciously taking a breath as her shoulders tighten. \"I...

Luna stood in shock as she witnessed this happen and then quickly approached the mirror, looking into it's reflection and asking as she saw herself, \"Hypon?\" She waited a few seconds more before saying her son's name again before she started to get frantic, almost shouting, \"Hyperion Tiberius Moonstone, get thine hindquarters back here this instant!\" As Luna shouted, she used her magic to shake the mirror and pick it up off the ground, hoping that would bring Hypon out of the mirror, but with no avail and giving her the looks from one of the oldest servants who became the grounds-master of Canterlot Castle who everypony knew as Archibald.

Luna then spoke to the mane six, \"Good luck, I have faith in you will triumph..\" and then trotted back into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was worried as she looked deep into the dark caverns as Rainbow Dash stated before they entered, \"I hope there aren't any monsters in there..\" Rarity shared Fluttershy's look of terror as Applejack spoke loudly at Rainbow Dash, \"Why would you say that?

The streets of Ponyville was mostly deserted, save for a few pones here and there, and shopkeepers opening their shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a sigh of relief, his warm breath steaming in the cold air. Big crowds something the changeling never liked. The postal station where he had been working for the past year was all ready open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed inside, escaping the cold world outside. It was warm and crisp in the lobby room, and the air smelled like paper. \"Morning, Icarus,\" a black stallion, and fellow co-worker, greeted. \"Morning,\" he greeted in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back, Icarus got busy with sorting the mail.</span></div></div>",

The snow plummeted from the dark clouds above, a relaxing, silent, magical, but lonely sight for Icarus to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets of Poniville was incredible still. Everypony was most likely all ready inside there hollows, Icarus thought. As he made his way back towards his own, tucking his scarf tighter around his neck to ward off the cold, he heard a set of peculiar sounds. It was a cough, a sniff, and a sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he approached the noises, it became clearer, and the changling-pony pony could identify the sounds as one thing - somepony crying! He froze in his tracks, as of he was terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a bench sat a white-colored mare with a cherry-red mane. Her delicate noise was beet-red and every now and then she would sneeze, mucus flying out as well. Her eyes where bloodshot, tears spilling from them and soiling her pretty coat. She also shivered, but the cold seemed to be the least of her problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head perched up and she spotted Icarus staring at her. \"Go away!\" she exclaimed, burying her face in her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changling-pony jumped, but he didn't obey what she said. He didn't know why, but he wanted to comfort this pony, figure out what was wrong and help her overcome this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached her, slowly, careful not to startle her. \"What's wrong?\" he asked with the most gentle voice he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still sobbing, and Icarus was afraid that she hadn't heard him, but she suddenly stopped, lifted her head, and said without even looking at him: \"My stallionfriend left me,\" she sniffed, \"for somepony else. He told me that I wasn't worth it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words struck Icarus; how could anypony be so heartless? To revise such a beautiful mare? He climbed up with her, shuffled closer, and folded his wing around the pony, blushing as he did so. She was startled by this action, but didn't recoil. In fact, she scooted closer, escaping the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there in awkward silence until Icarus decided to break it; \"So, my name's Icarus. and yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherry Mint\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus smiled. \"Nice name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said, a ghost of a smile appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty cold out here,\" he said, \"Wanna go to my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestion was a little too blunt, and Icarus was afraid she would refuse, but she nodded, much to his surprise.

The mug that Cherry  Mint cradled between her hooves were steaming with hot coffee, and  every now and then she would take a sip of it. The scene was far  too...romantic for Icarus' taste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he took a seat next to the mare ten spite all this. Cherry Mint wasn't  crying anymore and her eyes lost all its ugly redness,  but her nose was  still beet-red and running.  She must have caught a cold while she was  out there,  but Icarus unfortunately didn't own any medication besides  tissues and hot drinks.  He truly wished he could have been more of  assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asked, nudging her side gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said,  but her tone was as dark as storm clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus cursed himself when another awkward silence descended on  them.  He was never a pony for conversation.  He blamed it mostly on  his childhood,  when it was either hold your mouth or risk being punished  or discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,  do...you  know...wanna  tell  me  what happened.  They  say  it  helps sometimes,\"  Icarus said,  hoping that this would go into the right  direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she only shooked her head,  saying:  \"It's  a  long  story.  I don't  feel  like  telling  it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O... You  know what, you should just forget about that jerk. If  he's  so  stupid of not seeing how beautiful you are,  then you should be glad that  he's out of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  shooked  her  head  roughly.  \"It's  not that.  It's  just  that  I'm...pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus wasn't sure that he heard correctly.  \"Excuse me,\"  he said,  shocked,  \"did you just say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  nodded  again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus was left speechless.  He was then thrown back into the wretched days of his childhood,  when he spended his time locked  up  in  a  attic,  piecing  the  tragic  tale  of  his  history  together.  In  those days  he  discovered that his father was a changling,  which impregnated his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was born,  his mother abandoned him at the doorstep of an  orphanage.  He  didn\"t  blame  her  tough;  who would want to raise an  abomination like him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe  was  pulled  back  to  the  present  when  Cherry  Mint  spoke again:  \"I  don't  have  job,  I'm  going  to  be kicked  out  of my house because  I  can't  pay  rent.  He  had  money  and  a  place  to  stay;  he  was  my  only  salition.  But  now  he's..and  I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  broke  down  crying  again.  Icarus acted on impulse rather than  choice.  He curled his wings around her and pulled her closer.  She  buried  her  snout  into  his  fur,  sobbing  hysterically.  This  went  on  for  a  while.  In  those  moments  Icarus  was  able  to  assemble  a  plan  together:  he  had  a  job,  a  paycheck  that was  enough  to  support  two  ponies,  and  a  house  that  he  bought  off  a  few  months  ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea he had was so whimsical that it almost made him laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen  Cherry  Mint  finally  calmed  down,  Icarus  said:  \"It's  going  to  be  okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How  do  you  know?\"  the  mare  said,  her  voice  muffled  by the  changling-pony's  fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I'm  going  to  help  you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up her head,  her eyes shining with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged him tightly.  And then kissed him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus was in a state  of shock,  but quickly gave in and imbraced the  mare.</span></div></div>",

In those days Cherry Mint moved all her stuff from her house to Icarus'. It amazed the changling-pony that she had so little stuff; only a few bed covers and clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cherry's belly began to show visible signs of pregnancy: it began to round out, inching closer towards the floor. She also had mood-swings every now and then and strange cravings, but it was nothing Icarus couldn't handle. He just enjoyed the fact that his house wasn't so empty anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere relationship between each other strengthened also, blooming into love. Though, for some reason, they couldn't muster up the courage to share a bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, ten spite all this, Icarus knew very well what he was; a changling hybrid, a freak of nature, and if Cherry Mint would discover this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had nothing to fear if he just kept this a secret, right?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEverything was going well...until one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened after winter wrap up. A lot was done to clear the snowfall, and to reward everyone's hard work a annual fair was held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually Icarus would have simply stayed at home (like he always did, not being much a fan of big crowds for obvious reasons), but Cherry Mint insisted they should go, claiming this was one of her most favorite event of the year, and he didn't have the heart to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the changling-pony found himself in the hassle and bustle of the fair. He felt like turning into a rock to escape the little attention other ponies were giving him, but Cherry Mint brought him back to his senses as she darted from stall to stall, dragging Icarus along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to play this game to win this stuffed animal, or she wanted to see this magic show. A good amount of bits were wasted on this day, but Cherry Mint and Icarus was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, and the duo were making there way back home. Icarus was carrying a small teddy bear, one of the few souvenirs they won from the fair today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were walking down the path, talking merrily to each other about the day's events, before a stallion suddenly stood in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a yellow coat with a black main and tail, and his eyes were a sharp green color. He wasn't ugly, but he had a smug expression on his face that Icarus didn't like one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we help you?\" the changling-pony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the stallion completely ignored him, walking past him and standing uncomfortably close to Cherry Mint, who only glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, babe,\" he said with a grin.\"How ya been? I was thinking that you and I should get back together again,\" he finished in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus frowned in anger. Who was this brute? Why did he want to steal his mare away from him in plain view? Or perhaps he didn't know that they were in a serious relationship, that he was just a good friend. Still, he was very rude, and Icarus had half the mind to give him a stern telling-off, even though the stallion was a few inches taller than him, but his marefriend was already doing that for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost, Shiny!\" Cherry Mint exclaimed, shoving past the arrogant stallion. \"I already got somepony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood close to Icarus, indicating who this \"somepony\" was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion raised an eyebrow. \"What? This guy?\" he asked, looking amused. \"He's a chump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcarus grinned his teeth. He was very close to lashing out to this pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Cherry Mint said, \"He's twice the pony you'll ever be. He's kind and helpful, and he doesn't leave his marefriend to fend for herself, especially when she's expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion looked confused. \"What do you mean?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he realized how swollen his ex-marefriend's stomach was, and his eyes grew wide with shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't know,\" he stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you didn't,\" she said, her voice dripping with bitterness, \"You ran off with that other mare and left me all alone. Well, here's a news flash for you, buster: I don't want anything to do with you anymore, and neither are you getting close to the baby when it's born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Cherry Mint threw her nose up in the air and trotted away. Icarus had no choice but to follow. He glanced over his shoulder at the stallion that stood frozen in shock in the middle of the road, and he had a feeling that this was far from over.</span></div></div>",

Celestia had brought her nephew, Prince Hyperion Tiberius Moonstone or Prince Moonstone in the situation, to see the procedure first hand as he wondered about why Celestia would ask the Dragon Lands for some of their own eggs. Celestia just smiled at his general curiosity before she did her inspection of the wagon of dragon eggs when they arrived inside the palace walls. However, Celestia also had a second reason for her request. Hypon had been going through a bit of a rough patch after having to deal with his inner demons after a rough encounter with a distant family member that would best be forgotten than remembered so she thought about giving him a little present in the shape of a green dragon egg with white spots. This was how Prince Moonstone acquired the one dragon who would be Jade.<br>\r\n____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the years, Jade became the Prince's assistant and the only friend around the castle that wasn't either a member of the royal guard or related to him. She was a light olive green dragon with two small white horn, a pair of freckles, yellow eyes, and a set of wings. She was a very adorable dragoness but never was given the chance to go outside of Canterlot as she didn't think about doing so until a few days after the return of Princess Luna where Hypon decided to allow her to finally get some much-needed rest and take Jade outside of the palace to show her what was outside of the walls of Canterlot, taking her to the small town of Ponyville<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Current Day, Canterlot</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was preparing for her trip with Hypon to Ponyville, packing a small bag of various items before facing the mirror to put in a pair of dark green ribbons around her horns and doing her best smiles towards a mirror. Today was the day that she and Hypon were going to visit Ponyville to see Twilight's new school that she had set up along with seeing some of the students. Hypon was slowly getting prepared as he was in the middle of fitting into his tuxedo, preparing himself and going through his checklist of items. He wanted everything about today to go without any major issues that could cause him and Jade to be tardy at the event...Jade could see Twilight's influence on Hypon as he had gotten more prepared for any situation during the years and wondered if he had any amount of feelings towards her but knew better than to ask him outright as he would turn that question around to ask her about how she felt about Spike. She just hoped that nothing was going to cause any embarrassment to herself or Hypon as they finished up preparing for the event...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade had finished getting the bows around her tiny horns and looked at her reflection in the mirror, having a moment of thought about the event they were going to attend and even the people they were going to see. Jade had been in Ponyville before, but that was before the school was built. She wondered about who was selected to be a part of the first class intakes as from the memo Prince Moonstone got from Twilight Sparkle that there were many different types of species in the intake ranging from the Changeling Empire all the to the Dragon Lands. She had hardly any contact with anyone from her home other than Spike and the few dragons that he had hung around, but she never got to see her mother, her father, or if she even had siblings as she was just an egg at the time. There were many questions that led to even more branching paths that it could grow a full forest of trees. Jade just sighed before turning to see Prince Hypon Moonstone, standing in front of a mirror in a custom suit that Rarity had made for him adjusting his bowtie that went along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had always enjoyed going with Hypon to visit Ponyville when they weren't both extremely busy with items of concern and each of his friends enjoyed her in different ways. Fluttershy was very excited to see another baby dragon, asking her many questions about her that Jade answered as best she could. Applejack was glad that Hypon had someone who could keep him in check at times, knowing that he had a tendency to jump around from subject to subject. Rarity was very enthusiastic about making a dress for Jade along with someone else she could hang out with it. Rainbow Dash was glad that she had a small flying partner as Jade had her wings already. Pinkie Pie...well, Pinkie had to be calmed after almost scaring Jade up a tree as she was still a young dragon who was jumpy to surprises. And Twilight was very glad to have a playmate for Spike, even if they didn't always get along; it was still very enjoyable to watch for both Twilight and Hypon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonstone then finally spoke towards Jade as he was finishing up, \"Are you all set, Jade? I don't believe we want to make any added trips back here.\" Hypon then walked over to where his satchel was that had a collection of items inside that was for the trip over for Ponyvlle as they were going to stay in town for a couple of days for the events at the School of Friendship and inside Ponyville. He had the house all ready prepared and set up for their arrival along with any added things they might need. The bag had a few of Jade's items of note; her special blanket that she took on trips, a small little plush of skunk, several scrolls and quills along with ink, and finally a small little box of dice. Jade then answered in a somewhat sassy tone, showing her playful side to the person she treated like a brother, \"Yep, that should be everything of mine, Moonstone. And I assume you have everything of yours?\" This caused a small smirk to appear on the Prince before he responded back, \"Already had sent over, Ribbons.\" Jade then was slowly picked up onto the Prince's back before he continued, \"Keep that peppiness, Jade. I know how you feel about meeting new people. Now hold on tight; I don't want to lose you on the way over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade got comfortable on his back before reminding, \"Don't forget the scathel, Hypon.\" The scathel was slowly being lifted and nuzzled behind Jade's tail before hearing the Prince respond before spreading out his wings, \"I wouldn't dream of separating you from your stuff, Jade.\" Hypon then began to channel a deal of magic as he was preparing to make a jump from Canterlot to Ponyville by magic. This gave the small little dragon on his back to ask, \"So are we going to fly there? Don't you think the clouds will mess up your suit?\" This prompted a response from the Prince, \"Clouds? How we're traveling we don't need to worry about clouds...\" After he said that, a large surge of magical energy went through both Jade and Hypon as he then transported them over to Ponyville, aiming to land near the center of Ponyville or at least close enough to where they were staying.</span></div></div>",

Most ponies in Ponyvile knew her but no one wanted this filth covered Pegasus as their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight Gale was abandoned as a baby and was placed in a Cloudsdale Orphanage, where her life was almost as bad as how she was living now. With all the stress and pain that came from the orphanage in Cloudsdale, it pushed her at the age of 8, to run away to a different area. Ponyville..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the years, Night Gale's once beautiful grey feathers mucked up with slime and dirt and made several of her feathers fall out or worn down. Without the guide of her parents, she did not know how to fly, write or speak, and even more, she did not want to. She saw her wings as burdens and wished every night when she tried to sleep to get rid of them. She saw words as violent and rude as most were when spoken to her, so she remains very quiet and refused to speak a single word out of quiet respect to others and did not learn to write as no pony would teach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight Gale frowned as nothing was found in the trash that was remotely edible, which she knows must do something she found somewhat sporting, steal. She was very good at it, but she also had a tendency to overdo it and get beaten up for her trouble. Now she just needed a suitable mark, Night Gale thought as she walked into the crowds of Ponyvile. She saw some pony who looked good and went over to swipe something to eat.</span></div></div>",

But whenever she does try to stand up for herself, she always takes it too far. Her good friend Discord though takes note of that and decides to help her the only way he knows how: with magic! After spending time actually crating a potion, with the help of Zecora, he presents his friend with it, not knowing the ramifications of it. It seems to blanace her out at first, giving her confidence and a more relaxed tone... but why does she seem so much more wild at night? Is there something else going on that others can't see? And can anything be done at all? <i>\"Actually, is it that bad to being with?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Remix the Remix-</i></b> The past for Fluttershy had always been harsh, so much pain and loss scarred her memories. She lost her parents at a young age breaking her poor heart and leaving the mark on her in her submissive nature. Now, as an adult, she has tried to move away from it... until the nightmares start coming back. It was an off chance though, a simple spell miss-casted by her friend Twilight, that brought to the plane of the God of Time, <i>Cronus</i>. He gives her chance to change her past and she takes it... but at what cost? Why is living with in Cloudsdale still and... why are there so many different things in her life now? Just what all has changed from that one moment? And can it be undone? <i>\"No... This isn't what I wanted! Change it back!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Never Smiled for Me-</b></i> Fluttershy has shown to be the most forgiving of her friends and having a nack for helping others understand themselves. She assisted with the reformation of Discord, and through it, as been given cerdit as a wonderful counselor for those with anger, depression, and/or emotional issues. For this, after a recent capturing of the Changeling Queen, Chrysails, Princess Celestia has tasked Fluttershy with being in charge of her reformation. With a mystic collar on her neck that prevents the use of her magic, Chrysails is to learn her wrongs and repent, but can Fluttershy really help the Queen see the error of her ways? What if something expected was to happen to the two?<i> \"I'm not sure... but I'll do my best to help her.\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
