She brought the glass up to her mouth, and put the glass to her lips. She tilted the glass up to take a drink. As the water hit her mouth, she tried to swallow. Instead a long, flat tongue jutted out of her mouth and nearly to the bottom of the glass lapping up the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you OK?\" asked Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I feel much better now.\" replied Margret.

Margret quickly cut the beef into bit sized pieces. Then her head went down, and her tongue came out of her mouth, scooped up a little beef chunk, and rolled it down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as his wife inhaled the steak.  It was like someone had made eating with a knife and fork alien to Margret, and made lapping up food natural for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the meal was finished. At the time, it was perfectly natural to eat that way, and the realization actually didn't hit Margret until she lapped up some more water to wash down the steak.  She paused with her tongue in the water.  She was drinking and eating like an animal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's happening to me?\" Margret asked.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they arrived home Jack opened the passenger door and Margret jumped out of the car.  As he stared down at Margret, something seemed different somehow.  He couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it, but she looked different somehow.  There was something odd about the way she was standing.  While her hands and feet were on the ground, her butt wasn\u2019t high in the air like he thought it should be.  It was sticking up, but not like he thought it would.  Jack slowly circled his love to get a better look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret noticed him staring at her as he walked around her.  This distracted her enough and caused her to sit down on the ground.  \u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d she thought to herself.  She tilted her head to the side in puzzlement.  This caused Jack to stop and stare.  Margret couldn\u2019t figure out what he was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked down at herself and froze.  Even though her ass was on the ground both of her feet were flat on the ground with her hands in between them.  Margret knew that this position should be difficult to get into or at least uncomfortable, but it didn\u2019t.  It actually felt natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d Jack asked with a quiver in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret wanted to say, \u201cI feel fine, but what\u2019s going on?\u201d  To her surprise, the only sounds she made was a canine whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued to stare as he realized that Margret\u2019s thighs were thickening, growing more muscular.  At the same time, her calves were shrinking and her feet were extending.  He couldn\u2019t say a word.  All he could do was point a shaking finger at Margret\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret looked down slowly to where Jack was pointing.  She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.  She could see her legs changing, but she couldn\u2019t feel a thing.  No tingling, burning, aching, no nothing.  She watched as her toes swelled, causing her toenails to fall to the ground.  What really made her stare was the sight of her big toe shriveling to a tiny nub as it slowly moved past what once was her ankles.  Once the swelling stopped, tiny black claws began to emerge from the tip of each toe.  Cautiously, she raised her left foot into the air.  Both could plainly see that her foot was now a hairless dog\u2019s paw.  Testing her new appendage, she raised it as high as it would go.  Margret surprised herself as she slowly scratched behind her ear.  In shock, she quickly slammed her paw to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was now as pail as sheet.  \u201cThis has to be a dream,\u201d he mumbled.  \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret tried to stand up, but her legs wouldn\u2019t move like she wanted them too.  All she could do was rise to a standing position on her hands and rear paws. </span></div></div>",

The tips of her fingers flared up in agony as tiny points slowly made tents out of her skin before finally tearing through the top. The holes made were small and tight enough that almost no blood came out, but the pain was unbearable. It felt as if her very bones were pushing themselves out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swelling built up in the skin surrounding each claw, but slowly spread to the entire digit. The top joints of her fingers swelled grotesquely while the rest simply shrank into her knuckles. Her thumbs almost completely disappeared; all that remained was a tiny little clawed nub. The palms of her hands swelled as well, drying and cracking as they gained mass. They felt like leather pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret now longer had hands, but a set of paws.  Paws: The very word makes Margret whimper in sorrow now as she knows they\u2019ve replaced her useful hands and possibly they have been replaced for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Lauren's legs still had a lot of the bulk of her human legs but they were thinning out to become more canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more disturbing to Margret was that she also noticed that Lauren's lower spine had extended and that there was the beginning stub of a tail that twitched from side to side as she examined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once inside he found a Poodle, who he knew was his mom, and what looked like his dad, partially naked on all fours and a ton of fur everywhere. \"Dad?\" His dad, now engulfed in fur and a tail growing, whimpered and ran upstairs, with his mom following closely behind. The truth was becoming overwhelming for him and Zach fell back almost fainting. A few minutes after his parents went upstairs, he heard a creak from his sister's room. \"Oh no! Is Lauren a dog too?\" he asked quietly. His question was answered as his sister, still human, came from her room yawning. \"Huh? Zach? What are you doing home? You're supposed to be at sch-\" She stopped as she noticed how pail his face was. \"W-what's wrong?\" Zach gulped and tried to become calm. \"I was going to school when dad came to me looking a little weird... He was running really fast! I mean it was almost unnatural, but then his tongue would flop a bit! A-and then he told me mom became a dog!\" Lauren laughed a little. \"Zach? are you alright? People just can't become animals. It's impossible!\" Zach knocked Lauren's hand away from his head as she tried putting it there to check his temperature. \"I'm serious! Dad told me that sometime before today, Mom cursed our family to become a dog once a day! Mom's already a poodle, and if we look for dad, he'd probably be a full dog now! Though from what I saw, I can't tell what breed he is, but it's not a poodle, so I guess that means we all have different breeds...\" <br>\r\nLauren, after hearing Zach insisting of this dream or thought, became upset. \"Alright Zach, if you're just gonna lie so you can skip school, then I'm telling mom!\" Zach groaned and left. \"Fine! Don't believe me! Just prepare! It could happen to us at any second!\" Lauren marched upstairs in case the part of their parents being home was the only truth in his story. She thought that even if it wasn't, there would still be a phone to call them with. Once she entered the bedroom, she called out for her mom and dad. \"Mom? Dad? Are you really here?! Mom? Daaadd?! Figures...\" Lauren was about to leave when she heard a whine. \"Did I hear a whine?\" Looking around more thoroughly, she tried to find the source of the noise until she looked under the bed. A fluffy St. Bernard whined, but came from under the bed. He looked embarrassed, but Lauren was too distracted that there was a dog in the house to realize it. \"A dog? Was Zach... No! It's still impossible!\" Lauren tried to forget Zach's story and instead tried to play with the dog, deciding not to call her parents. Her and Zach's dad, though mortified that his daughter was seeing him now, felt instinctively happy and began wagging his tail. \"Baroff!\" Lauren was so happy that the dog was there, even though it was weird how it could've gotten in. \"You're a good dog aren't you?\" The St. Bernard licked her cheek as his tail wagged more. He knew it was still his daughter, but the canine urges pulled him to lick her like a pet would to it's master or other people. Soon, a poodle came out from hiding, shocking Lauren. \"A poodle?...\" Why did the sound of a poodle seem familiar? Then it hit her. M-mom?\" The poodle nodded, making Lauren jump. \"Oh my gosh! Zach was right!\"</span></div></div>",

Jake was Zack's best and only friend, because of their shared hatred of dogs. \"Hey Jake!\" Zack greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zack, mind if I walk with you to school? This weird dog has been following me.\" Jake nervously glanced behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack followed his friend's gaze, and he saw the strange dog. It didn't look menacing, just creepy. \"Yeah, that dog looks like trouble.\" He then yelled at it. \"GO AWAY YOU STUPID MUTT!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! SHEW!\" Jake yelled. The dog just sat there, and tilted its head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, come on.\" Zack said as he and Jake started walking toward school again. As soon as they turned their backs, the dog followed, keeping the same distance between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling nervous, Jake turned. Instantly, the dog sat down again. \"Uh...Zack, the dog is still following.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack turned around. \"That stupid dog, can't it take a hint.\" Suddenly, the dog rushed them. Both boys screamed as they bolted toward an alleyway. The dog pursued them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept running until they reached a dead end. The boys quickly turned back for the way they came, but the dog blocked the only exit. They began waving frantically and yelling, \"Get back you mutt.\" The dog just sat their staring at them, so they started throwing anything they could at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog finally barked, silencing them. Before their eyes, the dog transformed into an old man. \"Hmm...I tried giving you a chance Zack. I figured that you were young enough not to be under the same twisted hatred your family has toward my fellow canines. I was wrong. And you, Jake. My curse was only going to extend to the Tampert family, but I have decided to add you in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" they both yelled. Zack continued, \"We never did anything to you? Besides if you are a dog, then that makes you just a stupid mutt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake continued, \"Yeah, now beat it.\" Jake threw a broken tree branch at the old man. The man was barely able to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled with rage, \"I have had it with you two! You two are the worst brats that I have ever...\" The man then grew a devious smile. \"I know the perfect way to punish you two. You two can share the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean!\" Jake glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one wave of his hand, Jake and Zack crashed into each other. They clothes began to dissolve away, being replaced with golden brown fur. Their muscles and bones began to rearrange, forcing them onto all fours. Their hands and feat quickly turned into paws. Their noses grew out, causing the mouth st stretch forward too. Their eyes turned dark brown. The ears also grew, and bent downward.  Jake's right arm and leg, and Zack's left arm and leg began to merge together. Their furry bodies then began to join. One tail shot out of their joined bodies. The transformation was finally complete. Jake and Zack had been turned into a two-headed golden retriever. </span></div></div>",

I...\" Lauren is cut off as her hands began to cramp up, and the tip of her fingers began to burn like fire. She held one up, looking at it. She was absolutely stunned to see that her nails were thickening and darkening into... claws! She couldn't believe her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lauren saw the palm of her hand start to swell up and darken, and her hand itself began to lengthen! It hurt like a bad cramp. Looking at her hands, she couldn't avoid admitting that they were looking less and less like hands and more and more like... paws! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lauren could think what to do about her condition, she was hit by a gut-wrenching pain and doubled over, grabbing her stomach. Something was going on deep inside her, and the sensation was indescribable. It was as if her intestines were actually rearranging and twisting inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she clenched at her shirt, her newly forming claws tore holes in her shirt, but she was too overcome by the sensations inside her to notice. When she finally realized what she had done to her shirt, she gasped in shock. What was happening to her? Could she really be changing into a... dog?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she was hit by a horrific pain in her shoulder blades, and heard her shirt rip in the back. What she had no way of seeing or knowing was that her shoulder muscles were swelling up and reforming, preparing the way for her shoulder joints to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in her back grew too much to take, so she began to roll over onto her hands and knees, a position that brought her great relief.  She panicked, realizing the the reason for this relief - this position suddenly felt too right and natural. She let out a horrified moan, \"Noooo!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren realized she had to stand up and get help.  As she got to two feet, she felt incredibly unsteady. And she was hit by a sharp pain in her feet. She looked down at her feet, and gasped. They too were changing! They had dark claws sprouting from their toes, and they were thinning out as well. Worse yet, she found it too painful to put any weight on her heels and instead had to stand on the balls of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to balance on the balls of her feet, but as soon as she took the weight off her heels, her feet began to change even more. Soon she was in a struggle to remain standing, her feet and legs forcing her more and more to lose her balance and fall onto all fours.  But finally her feet changed too much and she lost her balance, falling forward, going down... and hitting the ground on all fours, landing on her new front paws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized that she was now quite naturally standing on four feet. This terrified her, and she panicked - she realized that it really was happening to her - he was turning into an animal - she was becoming a dog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to get up off fours, to stand on two feet like a human again, but she couldn't do it.  Her shoulders popped and cracked, as did her hips, leaving her in sheer agony, her joints locking into for-legged position, trapping her on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and saw her reflection and let out a shriek that sounded scarily like a howl. Her ears were now pointed and had moved atop her head, and her face had changed - her nose was blackening, she could feel a pressure on her nose and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders began to itch, and she looked in the mirror, horrified to see the hair on her head growing down, invading the smooth skin of her neck and shoulders. The hair grew down further and further on her back, thickening and changing in texture, becoming more and more coarse, less like human hair, and more like... fur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fur continued to thicken on her back, her nose and jaw began to ache even more. She clenched her face muscles, refusing to let them betray her and reform any further, but despite her effort, her nose and jaw began to thrust slowly outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned once more to the mirror, and her heart almost stopped. As she raised a hand, which was now nothing more than a dog's paw, she looked at her face and her first thought was not \"me\", but rather, \"dog\"! Fur was already creeping onto her forehead and cheeks, her nose was now fully black, and her nose and mouth already formed a small but definite inhuman muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept staring, not usually this into these kind of shows, but she jumped a bit, feeling something cold land on her leg, and she glanced down, letting out a nervous giggle. \"Haha.. I must of really been bored to be so into this show..\" She said softly, realizing that she was drooling a bit. She wiped her mouth, and kept watching the show closely. Before long, she didn't even notice it, but her tongue started poking out past her lips, the tongue a bit larger then usual, and a couple slightly visible dark spots on it. Before long, she was openly panting, watching the dogs as closely as a man would watch models walk down a runway. A light dripping of saliva was dripping off her tongue as she watched, starting to turn to face the TV better, sitting on her hands and feet as she watched. </span></div></div>",

I guess there's no harm in that...\" And with that, Katie started walking. With each step Katie took closer to Lauren and Jester, brought excitement in their eyes. When Katie clipped on Jesters leash, Lauren was so excited that her tail came out of hiding and started wagging at like 90 to 100 miles an hour. It even got her panting, but she didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong. Since Lauren was acting normal, Katie decided not to say anything and see how far the changes would go before she realized this was bad. Katie knew that Lauren looked to weird to show in public, so she quickly came up with an idea. \u201cHey, what about instead, we go play out in the back yard?\u201d Even though it wasn\u2019t what she thought of in the first place, Lauren was still just as excited and happy. \u201cYeah!! Yeah!! Let\u2019s go play!!!\u201c Kate, then unclipped the leash, and Jester and Lauren raced out the door. <br>\r\n  As Jester and Lauren were in the backyard waiting for Katie, Lauren\u2019s senses changed. Her ears became fully pointed and moved at the top of her head while her nose was now a canine\u2019s nose. Her eyes changed and altered it\u2019s vision a bit and her human glow dimed down and were replaced with a canine reflection. Lauren then had the urge to sniff Jester\u2019s behind again and so she did. As she did, she also had the urge to let Jester sniff hers. With that urge came more changes to Lauren. Her hands and feet were now German shepherd paws and her whole backend looked like a hairless/furless dog. Both Jester and Lauren were filled with happiness because they were becoming friends, and their wagging tails proved it. Then Katie got to the backyard and was wide-eyed as she spotted Lauren. \u201cUh, Lauren are you ok?\u201d Then Lauren replied with\u2026</span></div></div>",

I am a human, Katie knows what I'm saying, right Katie?\" Lauren still thought everything was normal and that she could understand Jester her whole life, because of her dog instincts and thoughts influencing her mind. \" You know Laury, you are a beautiful German Shepherd!\" barked Jester with his tail still wagging from before. \"Um, Jester, I'm not a dog, and please don't call me Laury.\" \"Yes you are Laury, look at yourself, and Laury seems like a nice dog name for Lauren!\" At that moment Lauren finally realized things weren't right. \"Whoa, wait! I can't talk to you! that's not normal, and why am I at your height, Katie!! What's going on!!!

Katie then tied Lauren and Jester to a tree. \u201cStay here guys, I\u2019m gonna go see what\u2019s up\u2026\u201d As Katie got into the house, she spotted Julie. \u201cHey, your home early, what\u2019s up? I thought you had an interview.\u201d \u201cUgh, \u2026 I left early cause I haven\u2019t been feeling well. Where\u2019s Lauren?\u201d Katie was quick to respond. \u201cShe\u2019s in the backyard playing with Jester\u201d \u201cAs long as you get the dog out before our mom comes home, you know how she feels about dogs\u2026 AAAHHHHH!!!\u201d \u201cJulie what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Julie felt her spine grow and move in her body. \u201cUh, nothing\u2026  I just need to rest, don\u2019t bother me, I\u2019ll be on the couch\u201d \u201cWill do!\u201d Katie came back to Lauren and Jester and untied them. Lauren then felt the urge to sniff around. She sniffed all around the yard and came to the door.<br>\r\nLauren started to whimper\u2026 What is it Laury? Jester said. I don\u2019t know \u2026 replied Lauren. It seems as though something is wrong in the house I NEED TO GET IN THERE! Lauren then started to scratch at the door. Katie saw that Lauren could sense something was wrong and rushed over to open the backdoor. As soon as Lauren was inside, she bolted to the living room and saw Julie, but with patches of fur! She also had a tail just like what Lauren had when she was transforming into a dog! \u201cBark! Bark! Julie!! Wake up!\u201d Then Julie woke up, but acted as if everything was normal. She didn\u2019t look down, so she didn\u2019t notice her changes, but she started having canine urges just like Lauren\u2026 \"Ugh, I gotta use the bathroom!\u201d When Julie got into the back yard, she shed her clothes and went on all fours. It was ok that she didn\u2019t have clothes because she was covered in fur and her breasts were now reduced to nipples and more were sticking out of her stomach.  Soon, Julie put her newly developed muzzle to the ground and looked for the best spot in the yard, and when she found it, she then squatted and did her business\u2026 After Julie was finished, her body and legs were done with their transformations, and all that needed to be done was the rest of her face. Lauren rushed over to her sister to try and get here to wake up from this haze she was in, but had the urge to find out what Julie had been doing today (if ya know what I mean hint hint). Julie returned the favor, and then it was time for business. Julie! Don\u2019t you see? You\u2019re a dog!!! \u201cBark! Bark!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Are you still you?\" More fur grew and it was obvious that Lauren was almost finish changing into a German Shepherd. She nodded, and wagged her tail unaware that she was doing it, but tried to reassure her. Katie felt a little relived as Lauren responded, even if she couldn't talk anymore, but would Lauren just regress far back until she was like Jester? A dog that had no rational thought and only listen and obeyed certain commands? Lauren, on the other hand, soon became distracted by Jester's appearance again and they went back to sniffing. <i>Laury, do you wanna play?</i> Lauren doesn't think twice, and started a game of tag with Jester, nipping at his legs. Katie, unsure of herself, shakes her head and goes inside the house. Once Lauren and Jester's game of tag is over with, they played a few other games and became really tired. Lauren then began sniffing around at the ground mindlessly until she came to a spot that had a strange scent. As she focused on it, she realized what she was doing, but this time, her mind wasn't fighting as hard as it had before. In fact, even a part of her human side really liked sniffing it! <i>What is this? It smells really gooooood!!</i> Her tongue soon lolled to the side and her tail started to wag pretty hard, but she didn't care. As if on instinct, Lauren then began to roll her body all around where the spot was. Jester panted with a smile and soon both were rolling together. After they stopped, they both smelt the scent on their bodies and began licking each other's muzzles. Eventually, Lauren laid down and began to nap, tired at her recent activities, with Jester laying beside her. Back with Katie, she was beginning to lose it. \"Ok Katie, don't panic\u2026 Maybe this is all just a dream! Yeah! I just got to wake myself up!\" Katie pinched herself hard, but it was no use...</span></div></div>",

She'll forget about being Lauren and Jester and I might not see her ever again!! Ohhhh\" Katie was on the verge of tears, when she realized that she had to help Lauren no matter how far gone she was. Katie went inside not caring what they did since the yard had a fence. When she returned, she brought some bowls filled with food for lauren and Jester. Though Jester immediately dug in, Lauren, though was more of a dog in mind and body, still had her humanity and instinctively sniffed the food. As the smell of meat entered her nose, Lauren began to eat just like Jester. Watching Katie looked a little happy, but upset as well, while Jester was excited and wagged his tail. Once Lauren finished, she spied that Jester's bowl still had some food left and tried to sneak some. Even Katie couldn't help giggling to  herself as Lauren's actions were just like a regular hungry dog. Jester, though pretty protective of his food, didn't mind since he loved Lauren. Once Lauren was finished she licked Jester's muzzle thanking him. <i>Thanks for letting me have some... It was surprisingly amazing!</i> Jester licked back, tasting a little left over food that Lauren forgot to clean. <i>You're welcome Laury! Anything for you!</i> Katie sighed a bit as she saw her dog, and even Lauren look happy. \"Ok Lauren and Jester, I'm gonna clean these and then fill these with water. When I come back, we need to find out why you're a dog!\" Lauren, remembering her predicament, whimpered and laid on her stomach.

She screamed in terror as it slowly lengthened, each little bone growing longer before splitting into two. Before long, she had a foot long naked tail limply hanging between her legs with a curly white ball at its tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret ran out of bed over to the mirror on her dresser and on the way stumbled and fell on all fours. She continued running on all fours until she reached the dresser. Then she held on to it and straightened herself up as far as best she could. Her breath was taken away when she saw her deformed reflection in the mirror. Her body was completely covered by white fur.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fur spread across her shoulders, up her neck and down her arms, Margret felt six needles poke into the front of her torso. She watched as the points of pain became tiny holes which slightly swelled into nipples, turning pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur covered her thighs, butt, back, shoulders and arms. A medium-length tail hung limply between her quivering legs, her ears were higher than they should have been, and she had several pairs of small teats, leaving her human breasts slightly smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret's screams of pain and terror were beginning to crack and fall in pitch until she could only moan, too afraid to let herself bark or howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, she suddenly realizes the most important (or maybe second most important as she's still unaware of the most important) oddity, she was completely naked.

There are four paws on the ground right where her feet should be. The paws are not surprisingly at the ends of four legs, which are covered in shinny black fur. She tries to follow the legs up more, but can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this happens, her mind clicks, it finally hits her. She realizes that she's become a dog!</span></div></div>",

He was a dog, but then she heard it again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren looks like a dog\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Lauren was concerned.  She told Katie she needed to use the restroom.  She ran over there as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked in the mirror, her breath came out in foggy bursts.  She felt an odd chill run through her body, given that it was a mild spring day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as she stood, feeling her cramped muscles popping. She looked herself over, but nothing appeared different. Then, she just hunched over the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lauren noticed that her thighs were feeling warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" she screamed, looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw, however, didn't comfort her. Her leg hair was growing rapidly. Long brown strands of hair pricked up and flowed out of her pores. Lauren quickly took off her shorts to see how far the changes had progressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs stretched out painfully, her toes pointing out at odd angles as she groaned and panted in pain. She watched her toes swell to the point that her toenails fell out. The hair on her thighs was now undeniably fur, and it spread to cover her buttocks and lower back just as her coccyx began to reverse its orientation, pointing outwards and nearly piercing her flesh. She screamed in terror as it slowly lengthened, each little bone growing longer before splitting into two. Before long, she had a foot long naked tail limply hanging between her legs. She had tried to stand up just as the tail had begun to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fur spread across her shoulders, up her neck and down her arms, Lauren felt six needles poke into the front of her torso. She watched as the points of pain became tiny holes which slightly swelled into nipples, turning pink. Lauren noticed variations in the color of her fur as she lifted her hand to feel her ear growing pointed and moving to the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur covered her thighs, butt, back, shoulders and arms. A medium-length tail hung limply between her quivering legs, her ears were higher and more pointed than they should have been, and she had several pairs of small teats, leaving her human breasts slightly smaller.  Lauren heard the restroom door open and quickly ran into a stall so no one would notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she locked the door, her tail grew several more inches after she hunched over, gasping in the cool air. Her feet began to ache from the pressure building in her shoes. She looked down and could see tension marks forming at the tips of her shoes. The front of each shoe cracked open and two clawed dog paws emerged. She clutched her stomach as her teats swelled.  She cried out in pain as her hands balled up into fists, the fingers swelling. Her fur had nearly covered the rest of her body, only a few patches of skin remained on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's fingernails fell off as her fingers continued to swell and shrink. Her thumbs receded into her hands, and she closed her eyes as she screamed. When she had opened them again, her hands were paws. Her ears rang as they stretched and finished moving to the top of her furred head. Her feet continued to lengthen as her calves shrank. She was becoming exhausted, and she fell to the floor, barely able to catch herself with her paws. Her upper arms shrank and her elbows were pulled closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the voices disappeared, Lauren again ventured out to the mirror over the sink.  She panicked and was barely able to stand on two feet. She had to really concentrate until her hips uttered one last loud snap. She slowly fell again, feeling her hips realign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on all fours, Lauren was crying uncontrollably as her human semblance quickly faded. Her eyes lost their human glow, and became much wider. Her teeth became pointed as the bone of her jaw thrust forward. Her facial skin was barely able to keep up with the growth. Her nose flattened out and was replaced by a big, wet dog nose. Her screams of pain and terror were beginning to crack and fall in pitch until she could only moan, too afraid to let herself bark or howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the reflection starting back at Lauren was that of a German Shepard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then she was suddenly angry and thought - when I get a hold of her she is going to regret ever doing this to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the restroom and said \"Come on, Jester, we're going home.\"  Then she saw the German Shepard again and her heart became a little softer.  \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJester barked trying to say \"That's Lauren!  She's our friend!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren barked saying \"It's me Lauren!  I've been cursed!  Let's go to your house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on you two.  We might as well go home.

Julie finally took one hand off the wheel and snaked it down into her skirt and felt around in the area of her discomfort. There was something hairy in there and it had a hard core to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell got into my skirt?\u201d She said aloud as she continued to drive while trying to get it out of her skirt and relieve the discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost lost control of her car when she realized after a hard tug that it was attached to her. Not only that but she could feel her hand on it. Julie screamed and let it go but it was still there poking out above the waistband of her skirt. She continued the rest of the way to the interview, but every time she thought about it the rest of the way she could feel what she now feared was a tail twitch and move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie pulled into the parking lot, she jumped out of her car and ran into some nearby bushes, out of the view of the public.  Julie looked behind her and noticed something was lifting up her skirt. She slowly reached her hand out to reveal what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh my god!\u201d she grasps in shock as she sees what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere for all the world to see was a tail. It was completely black, except for the fur on the end which was white.  As much as her mind wanted to deny the sight before her eyes it couldn\u2019t. She thought about the tail and it started to move from side to side almost as if it was wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at it, Julie suddenly felt shame and embarrassment and she watched as the tail, her tail, stopped wagging and curl down between her legs as she felt the heat of her shame spread across her face. Julie threw her head back and let out a scream that ended in what could almost be called a howl, \u201cNooooooooooooooooo.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Bill opens one of the cages and a pretty collie jumps out of the cage.  Bill puts a collar and leash around the dog and hands it to Julie. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We have an outdoor enclosure so the dogs can run around and get some exercise.  How about you take Sport here outside and play with him for a little bit. I'll check back with you in a little bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" Julie responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill leads Julie to the back door and opens it.  She takes the leash off Sport expecting him to run around, but he starts licking Julie's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sport licked Julie's face, she paused as she felt a sudden hot flush followed by a pulse through her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a throbbing pain began in her hands, Julie looked at them in horror as her carefully manicured fingernails fell out, within an instant they were replaced by black claws which pierced through the end of her fingers. Lauren began to cry out as she watched her fingers bloat and widen while her thumb retreated into her hand and moved around so that it now sat at her wrist. The skin on the palms of her hands began to harden as it to swelled, within moments Julie\u2019s hands had been transformed into paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god, make it stop\u2026please make it stop!\u201d Julie pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie cried out as a burst of pain hit her feet. First she felt a stretching sensation as the arches of her feet began to lengthen until they seemed to be almost twice their normal size. Her toenails fell out as they made way for the black claws that pierced through her skin. Her smallest toe disappeared as the other four became enlarged. The mutation continued until her feet were no longer recognizable as anything other than paws. Julie started to feel a strange feeling at the bottom of her spine and remembered the tail she saw earlier.  She watched horrified as it continued to grow from her body at an alarming speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Julie was forced onto her knees as more pain pulsed through her shrinking hips and calves as they began to change shape and reform them selves. At the same time she felt a tremendous tightening across her chest as her rib cage began to expand. With this expansion, Julie's once plump breasts seemed to flatted out until all that was left were her pert nipples. She felt a strange sensation as several new pairs of nipples pushed through her skin and lined her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tried to raise herself from her crouching position, but the wave of pain from her hips as they begun to shift prevented her from doing so. She tried again, but this time it seemed as if her shoulders were collapsing, changing. Julie felt the vertebrae on her back pop into position, one by one, each one making her new form more and more permanent. Once complete Julie felt her hips make a final adjustment, and heard a loud popping sound, and with that her new body shape was locked into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tried to cry out, but found she could no longer do so, her human cries had been replaced by canine whines and howls. The changes then moved to her head, which until now had remained unchanged. Julie\u2019s human teeth feel out as her new sharp, pointed canine teeth pushed through the gums of her lengthening jaw. Her skull seemed to remold itself into its new shape, her eyes increasing in size and moving further apart. As her human nose disappeared to be replaced by a muzzle and black moist dog nose, she felt her human earlobes sink back into her head as her ear hole was pushed higher and new dog ears formed. Finally she felt her neck stretch and lengthen and as her neck bones reset themselves so that the position of her head changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie felt a strange itching sensation across her hole body as black and white fur began to burst through her skins pores. As the strange sensation continued Julie\u2019s former human hair was forced from her head to make way for her new fur. </span></div></div>",

With that, he walked out to his office to answer the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bill left, Julie entered the play area.  She figured this wouldn't be difficult, she had  been around lots of animals before and never had a problem dealing with them.  But the minute she entered the play area, the cat ran to the opposite corner of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie got down on her hands and knees so she wouldn't appear as intimidating.  She opened her mouth and wanted to say \"Here Kitty\" but she was shocked as all that came out of her mouth was \"Arf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure what was going on, she never acted this way before, but she started to feel very angry with a cat being in the same room as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumble of anger arose from deep in Julie\u2019s throat. It gained in volume and lowered to a base range. Julie barked again but this time she put all of her emotion behind it, \"Rrrrrrroooofff! Rufff! Rrrrrrrrrr, rrrrufff!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie rose up slowly onto her hunches. She moved slowly on her hands and knees toward the cat and she barked again and continued with a deep resounding growl. In the back of her mind she felt a pricking sensation run over her body but dismissed it as goose flesh or pins and needles. They were uncomfortable but only slightly distracting and she pushed it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became single minded as she barked again and again. Her lips twisted and pulled back bearing her blunt human teeth. Julie never noticed the strands of black and white hair that pushed through the skin of her arms and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe posturing as a dog was becoming easier and she shifted from her knees to her feet. It felt more natural to stand on all fours as her shoulder blades and pelvis reformed and she found it easier to move and take a more aggressive stance. She never noticed that the length of her legs had become the same as her arms or that she was standing on the balls of her feet and that her fingers had curled under her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was so concentrated on the cat that she failed to notice as her face pushed out and began to form a muzzle. She didn't know that her nose had darkened to black and the skin of it roughened but she did noticed the scent of the cat as it assailed her more sensitive olfactory nerves and instinct told her it was the enemy. Her lips again twisted and pulled back again but now they revealed four lengthening pointed canine teeth, sharp incisors and foamy saliva that was expelled with every guttural growl she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curled fingers receded into her hands and formed into toe like structures. Her fingernails darkened and curled under from the sides until they were dark curved claws. Her thumb shrank until it became almost nonexistent leaving only a dark curved dewclaw. Her feet and toes were undergoing a similar metamorphosis as her hands and feet formed into four paws making every step and movement easier and easier to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her back arched the end of her spine shifted position, curled upwards, and then extended slowly. The tail that she saw earlier continued to grow.  As it became longer, the black and white hairs that now covered her back, arms and legs moved up the length of her growing tail. At the same time, the other end of her spine also extended giving her a much longer neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears twitched and grew as they pushed through her hair and then flopped to the sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's back arched the stiff black hairs rose along her spine. The muscles in her legs grew taut as she lunged towards the cat. </span></div></div>",

Soon Julie had the very large, brown eyes of a dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie then felt a warmth overcome her face, in a tingling itch. Very long and noticable whiskers, about six on each side of her nose, grew out of her upper lip. They grew thick, and stopped at a very unsightly six inches each. She pulled a hand to her lip, and felt the bristles of a dog's whiskers bend to her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another feeling hit her face. Her jaw began to feel tight against her skin, as her  face jutted out from her skull. Her upper jaw and lower jaw extended out very fast, and it sprouted with black and white fur. Her lips turned black, and pulled up, narrow over her jaws. Exposing her new very large and sharp canine teeth. Her upper lip sprouted black and white fur, and stopped below her nose, which itself quickly sweated a moisture to it, and it too turned black, and the nostrils flared out like a border collie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her face as her head began to narrow, flatten, and pulled back behind her huge snout. Her blond hair was quickly replaced with black fur.  Her itching ears rang as they stretched and finished moving to the top of her furred head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie could only look on in shock as she saw the head of a collie looking back at her in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

It looked pudgier and wider and her thumb seemed to be smaller and further back. And where were her finger nails! She turned over both hands and stared in mute horror as some blackish calluses were all over her palms and it looked like she had daggers of black plastic jutting out of her stumpy fingers. Then she caught her reflection, her ears were longer wider, pointed, her nose seem to be flatter, and blacked at the tip, and it felt cold and wet to the touch. In her mouth she saw elongated canines. She screamed, no she howled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose started merging into her upper lip as her face stretched outward.  Several pains wracked her body and made her feel numb. Her big toe receding back toward the heel even as her feet expanded at the sides. Similarly the dull ach in her back intensified and she was forced to hunch over further her growing muzzle staring into the mirror as her hands, her paws, clutched the sides for dear life. The sharp nails digging into the wooden vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie watched as her breasts shrunk, but what really scared her were the 4 other pairs of nipples below, and as small as they were at only a inch or so high they had the definite shape of developing teats. By now the black and white fur had started to spread over her body. It grew out from the edges of her claws up her arms and legs. It spread out from just under her nose and all around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crouched now on very beastly toes and hands that had no thumb. They were almost indistinguishable from full paws. Her arms must have grown, or her legs shrank as she found she could comfortably stand on her 4 new paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whinnied pitiably as she felt a painful pressure hitting against her bath towel just above the buttocks. The towel soon gave way as her new tail burst out slowly growing to full length. As the last of the changes settled and her rich, thick fur grew in, the pains subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
