As most see them as blood thirsty mosnters of lore they are actualy a peaceful and sometimes Religious race.  Lycan's tend to travle in pack's not staying in one place for and extended piroids of time, though it isn't unusual to find single wolf or large family's living in villages if they are welcomed to them. They are as capible of just about any other races when it comes to skills they can learn. Their instices make them exilent hunters and trackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Race picture: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120704065254/ben10fanfiction/images/4/4b/Werewolf-1-.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a></span></div></div>",

As most see them as blood thirsty mosnters of lore they are actualy a peaceful and sometimes Religious race.  Lycan's tend to travle in pack's not staying in one place for and extended piroids of time, though it isn't unusual to find single wolf or large family's living in villages if they are welcomed to them. They are as capible of just about any other races when it comes to skills they can learn. Their instices make them exilent hunters and trackers.<br>\r\nRace picture: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120704065254/ben10fanfiction/images/4/4b/Werewolf-1-.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120704065254/ben10fanfiction/images/4/4b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy the game ^_^</td>",
