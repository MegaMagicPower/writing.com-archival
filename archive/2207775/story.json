My name is Caleb and you guys get to decide who I am and what I become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment I am a 16 year old, high school sophmore. Don't ask about my grades, that is for you to decide! Each story of my life will venture into different parts of fantasys for abdls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the universal facts that apply everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. My dad is dead, he died when I was 10 from a bad accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I have 3 siblings. Anna is 19, and in college to be a psychologist. Bobby is 9, and still wets the bed. Amber is 5, born 9 months after our father's passing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. My dad had a sizable life insurance policy. Mom only works as a preschool teacher to keep busy. Most of the funds have already been invested, allowing us to live off the returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, let start with the first day of school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you know the most annoying sound to wake up to is? Nyan Cat! My mom gave us all Amazon Echos last Christmas, and has loved finding every annoying song to wake us up. One week its Wannabe, by Spice girls, and then the next its I'm a Barbie Girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh does it get better though! She sits in the kitchen and listens for each child's alarm to go off, and waits for us to turn them off. The first time we have 5 minutes to get up and be in the kitchen for breakfast. If you try to snooze, she will begin her favorite part of the morning. From her app she will blast whatever annoying song she can until she sees us in the kitchen. You can't stop the music or she will just start blasting the same song again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up, tell alexa to stop, and make my way downstairs to the kitchen. Anna is already at the table, drinking some coffee while on her phone. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBobby's alarm was off, and Amber was doing some crazy little kids dance to her barbie song we all hate, but it gets her out of bed. Mom yells up to Bobby's room, \"60 seconds\"<br>\r\nI take my seat next to Anna and grab some pancakes and load them with syrup. Grab my share of sausage links, and just as I am about to take a bite, the the deafening sound of a siren alarm startles us all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby is hard to wake up, he is such a deep sleeper, it must be why he wets the bed so much! We installed a bunch of speakers/bass in his room, it literally startles everybody in the house. If he doesn't wet during the night, and misses his first alarm, he is definitely soaked when the siren goes off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby rushes downstairs, in his tshirt and pee stained youth diaper yelling, \"I'm up now, you can turn it off now!\" Anna yells back, \"Stop being such a baby and go get your diaper changed, mom is waiting in her room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby knew his mom was waiting for him, but knew he wasn't quite done going yet. He could still feel the pee slowly trickling into his diaper, slowly being sucked up by all the sap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb noticed his face on half concentration, and could see the the back if his diaper still turning shades of yellow as bobby walked away to the master bedroom to get changed. He was jealous his brother got to wear diapers, but also glad he wasn't anywhere close to stopping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, I went to mom's room to ask for some more deodorant, but mom wasn't in there, so I decided to go into the bathroom and grab one myself. When I entered the bathroom, I spotted the soaked diaper in the trash. I knew mom could be in there at any moment, but part of me just wanted to feel it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My heart started racing as adrenaline shot through my veins. I quickly shut the door to the bathroom and sat on the toilet next to the trash can. I slowly picked it up, and the smell of urine mixed with lavender baby powder used entered my noustrouls. A smell only a diaper lover would appreciate. It was heavy, but still very, very warm! Part of me was begging to just try it on, but I knew the cleanup would take too long. I then decided to try and hold it in front of me to see what I amy look like in it, I heard somebody enter the bedroom before I could untape the tabs. I quickly disposed of the diaper and flushed the toilet to make it sound like I had just used the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom enters the bathroom as I am washing my hands, startling me as I had been so careless to forget to lock the door. I say \"sorry mom, I was coming in here for some deodorant when I had to use the bathroom all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had noticed Caleb jump and immediately became suspicious, but bought his story and sent him on his way with 2 sets of deodorant \"There, that should last you a while, now go get ready or you'll be late for school! We don't want to start the year with a tardy now.\" \"yes mom.\" I replied, and ran back to my room heart still racing from my close call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went as could be expected, first day of school, a few new kids, mostly the same faces. I mostly kept to myself, as a boy with many secrets would prefer to do. The best part about the first day of school, is handing my mom the stack of papers SHE has to sign for me to return to each teacher. The one day I get to sit with her at the table and help her do HER Homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Bobby and I usually played some Xbox in the living room. He always thought of it as brother bonding time, but really, it was because I knew if we were in there, mom would change him into a diaper right in front of me.she did this so he could get back to the game quickly, and she wouldn't be waiting all night for him to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom entered the room with one of his Starz Diapers with race cars designs. The change was always quick, but I would always steal a glance from the couch, as she would lift his legs and secure his diaper in place. She always wanted to be the one to do it to make sure it was seated properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce mom was finished, she gave us both pecks on the cheeks and told us we had 30 min before bed time, and left to tuck in Amber. Bobby was a very physical person while playing. He would move around with his character, and I would hear the soothing sound of his diaper crinkling. The best part of the night for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mom yelled from upstairs for us to head to our rooms and get some shut eye. Bobby reluctantly, and I followed him watching the diaper expose itself as he ran up the stairs. I went to my room and laid down thinking about what had happened that morning, and started to brainstorm How I would get back into mom's bathroom again tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning I woke up to TNT by ACDC. The first 30 seconds is enough to wake me up. I leave it running as it is a good song to wake me up as I get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get downstairs, and again Anna is on her phone texting at the table, while I see Amber struggling trying to grab a plate of eggs by herself. I rush over, and proceeded to assist, \"here, let me get this for you. We don't want to make a mess here now dow we?\" Amber's face turned to joy as the scrambled egg were scooped onto her plate, I placed the plat on the table and looked at Anna, \"thanks helping Amber, she could dumped all the eggs on the floor if I hadn't come down in time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at me with  with a smirk \"that wouldn't bother me, I already ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well maybe there is more to this world than texting. What if the pan fell and hit her in the head?\" I said hoping to get the last word, Mom entered the the room just in time to hear a pan falling and chipped in, \"and it's a good thing it didn't or somebody would be getting a summer job next year rather than going on a road trip with their friends\" this stopped Anna from making any more comebacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to grab my plate and sit down to enjoy my meal, when once again, we were all startled by Bobby's alarm, proceeded by him running downstairs, peeing what was a solid white diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom rushed him to her room to change him for the day, while Anna and I started cleaning up breakfast, leaving a plate bobby at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby and mom came back, and waited for mom to grab a cup of coffee before I set my plan in motion. \"Hey mom, today is trash day so I'm gonna go around the house and collect all the trash ok?\" Mom looked at me very pleased and nodded in agreement, as a que to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI emptied the full kitchen trash, rebadged the can, and carried it to help dispose of the smaller trash buckets. I started with the master bedroom. I knew mom's coffee would be me some time, so I went straight for the bathroom and locked the door and figured I'd use the same excuse as I did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on the toilet and proceeded to grab the recently used diaper. Just like yesterday, it was warm, and squishy and had its signature lavender urine scent. I untapped it, noticing the size could probably still fit me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from me, I saw in the bathroom closet the stack of diapers that belonged to my brother. I started to hatch a plan in my head. I could probably sneak this used or one of those new diapers upstairs to my room using the trash can to conceal it, and dispose of it next week if I take out the trash again. The adrenaline starts rushing again, as I am about to do the craziest thing on behalf of my urges. </span></div></div>",

I head to my room first and and roll the wet diaper under my bed. I collect my trash and finish the chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I finished disposing the rest of the trash, I ran upstairs, adrenaline still pumping, to check out my treasure. I got down on my stomach and started to fetch the diaper, when suddenly mom walks in behind. \"Boy what are you doing under the bed? You have to leave in 10 min!\" This startled me causing me to hit my head on the bed above. </span></div></div>",
