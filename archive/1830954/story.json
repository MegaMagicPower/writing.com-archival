            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Puck was tired of it, always playing second fiddle to everyone else. Yeah he was a stud with an awesome body and very experienced, but he couldn't seem to get anyone to stay with him. Even the desperate moms who needed a younger touch were shying away from him these days and his power in school has gone from high to none. Santana his once former come to girl was out in the open with her feelings for Brittany (he was glad for her but now he was left high and dry), Rachel was back with Finn who seemed to have a brain transplant and for once seemed to have something of a mind of his own. Finn was still rather stupid but Puck swore Finn was smarter than before. Quinn was insane and there was no way he was going to go near that crazy bitch again. And Shelby...he had genuinely thought he was in love. He had been and it killed him Shelby didn't want him anymore. It wasn't the sex that was the problem, he drove her wild and even she admitted he was the best, but apparently she was feeling guilty or something for 'taking advantage' of him or some such shit because she was lonely and the father of her adopted kid. That was absurd, especially considering he was the father of her kid. He wasn't a kid anymore and he would have made an awesome dad. He had made an awesome dad before Shelby decided to cut him out. They were still settling over the issue although Puck refused to talk to her anymore about anything other than caring for Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get it. What was wrong with him that although he was good for a quickie he was not good enough for an actual commitment? Rachel, Lauren, Shelby, Quinn, Santana, even the randoms wanted nothing to do with him anymore. He had ruined his friendship with Finn back in Sophmore year over the whole Quinn thing and although they were still friends, they weren't as close as they used to be. Rachel used to be his friend until she got all buddy buddy with Kurt and then the whole election thing and going insane trying to get into New York. Perfect Blaine was stealing the spotlight as Finn's second, and they managed to apparently find Sam and bring him back from some stripper club and so even Sam was stealing the spotlight from him because he was one of the most ripped people at McKinnley and Puck pretended not to hear them being compared. Even the Irish kid who Puck could barely understand with that ridiculously thick accent was more popular than him nowadays. How had he come so low? Not Jacob Ben Israel low, but low enough. Possibly worse because it was almost like he was invisible nowadays other than someone scolding him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck admitted it, he was lonely. That's how he ended up in some bar he never been in before after driving around randomly and feeling in the mood for some random pickup. He was just getting a drink when who should come and sit next to him but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karofsky?\" Puck said, shocked. He hadn't seen Dave Karofsky in a while, not since prom. The sad thing was, he was so happy to be noticed for once by someone familiar, even Karofsky, that he wanted to sing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Puck, what you're doing here?\" Dave asked. Puck looked at him and noticed the sweaty football uniform and cleaned up, Karofsky looked pretty chill. He didn't have that scowl he always seemed to have at school. If anything, he seemed...happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it look like? I'm getting a drink,\" Puck said, looking away. <br>\r\n\"I'm just surprised you'd be in a gay bar.\" Karofsky said. Puck looked at him startled.<br>\r\n\"Gay bar? This is a gay bar?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Dave said and Puck looks around closer. Those guys on the dance floor were awfully close and...oh. <br>\r\n\"Well, that's something you don't see everyday, at least I don't,\" Puck said. He drained the last sip of his drink and ordered another one.<br>\r\n\"Let me get that for you,\" Dave says and Puck doesn't argue. If Karofsky wants to give him free drinks, he'll take them. Karofsky owes a lot of drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's on your mind anyways?\" Dave asks and Puck giggles a bit. He and Dave had been making small talk and learning things about each other and by around drink four and five, Puck thought Dave was the best guy in the world. 'He's a better friend than Finn and actually listens to me' Puck thought. The alcohol had done its job loosening his tongue and mind and he found himself spilling everything, how lonely he felt, how no one seemed to notice or care about him anymore, how he had been replaced, and used and thrown out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Shelby...I loved her, you know? And I was a good father, took care of my family but what did it get me? Zilch!\" Puck was angrily berating Shelby and Dave listend to him carry on. After being kicked out of McKinnley and accepting that he was in fact completely gay, Dave became a very good listener. He spent more time on his studies, improved his grades, and actually made friends. He listened as Puck cursed her for a bit longer and then hugged him as Puck burst into tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss them and everyone hates me,\" he said sobbing. \"I'm nothing and nobody and here I am crying in the arms of one of McKinnley's greatest douchebags who threatened Kurt's life\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" Karofsky said. \"I have sorely regretted that most of all. But it'll all be okay, you'll see.\" Puck sobbed more.<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't, but if I can do it, someone who as you pointed out isn't deserving in the slightest, then you will too. You're one of the strongest guys I know. Stronger than Finn Hudson, that ladylips Sam even though he does have a nice ass, and even Kurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Puck got up bobbing his head. <br>\r\n\"I guess, thanks for this. I got to go home now though.\" He walked and stumbled a little and Dave rushed over. <br>\r\n\"Can't let you do that. I'm driving.\" Puck seemed barely conscious as they walked and Dave was worried until he saw it was just normal exhaustion, and who wouldn't be? Helping Puck in, he was glad he didn't let Puck go off alone. He wouldn't have been able to drive in this state. Dave was sitting there for a moment before he realized he didn't know what Puck's address even was. They hadn't been the best of friends in High School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, that's a problem.\" Dave rubbed his head, trying to think. Should he take Puck to his house or to one of the other loser's...er, gleek's houses? Karofsky was fine taking him home to his house but Puck might not be. On the other hand, he couldn't imagine any of the glee kids being thrilled to see him, especially of he brought a passed out Puck to them. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunlight streamed in through a crack in the curtains and landed directly on Puck's eyes, forcing him to sit up.  He was still a tad disorientated and his head was pounding like crazy, \"Uuuuuugh... Why did I drink so much last night?\"  Once Puck had rubbed the sleep from his eyes, he looked around and realized he had no idea where he was.  The living room was large and cozy, with an extremely warm fire burning in the brick fireplace.  The TV was on, with the local Lima news, but Puck didn't care about that - he was being drawn towards the amazing smell coming from the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck entered through the doorway that separated the kitchen from the living room, he let out a loud \"OUF\" as he collided with something solid, but soft.  He felt two big hands grab him from both sides and steady him out, \"Easy there, Puckerman.  You almost knocked me over.\"  Once Puck was steady, he realized the thing he ran into was Karofsky.  He took a step back and rubbed his head, \"Uuugh.. Sorry about that.  So... This is your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smiled, \"Yeah.  I was going to take you home last night, but, I don't know where you live.  I could have dropped you off at Kurt's house, but I'm not exactly on good terms with Hudson.\"  Puck blinked, \"You know where Kurt lives?\"  \"Yeah, we're pretty good friends now.\", Dave said, \"All those incidents from McKinley are behind us now so we hang out every now and then.\"  Puck was about to bring up a question about how Blaine felt about that, but a loud commercial from the TV decided it wanted to make Puck's head throb even more than before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave grabbed the remote and turned the TV off, \"Sorry about that, I like to listen to the TV while I cook.  It keeps me entertained.  Speaking of food, lets eat before it gets cold.\"  Dave headed back into the kitchen and Puck followed, still rubbing the side of his head.  Puck was surprised by how much food Dave had made: there was a massive stack of pancakes in the middle of the table, a big plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, and biscuits, and it all smelled AMAZING.  Puck's stomach growled from the smell of it and Dave chuckled, \"Dig in.  I made enough for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck stared at Dave, \"Enough for two?  There's enough for four people here!\"  Dave laughed as he loaded up his plate with food, \"What can I say?  I'm a big guy with a big appetite.\"  Puck watched Dave piling on food to his plate and he realized something; Dave WAS a big guy.  In fact, he was bigger than he was at McKinley.  Dave stood at at least 6'3 with super wide shoulders, thick muscular arms, and a bigger stomach than he used to have, all of which were tucked away under his winter thermal.  Puck was actually scared to imagine what it would be like to be tackled by Dave in a football game.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, eat up. trust me.  Food like this is one of the best ways to get rid a hangover.\"  Dave said, before shoveling in a huge bite of his pancakes.  Puck sat down and still wanted to ask Dave a few questions, but if eating would get rid of this hangover, than damn it he's eating.  Puck filled his plate with as much food as he thought he could eat (not touching the bacon or sausage because of his religion) and just started chowing down, and it was was so good he couldn't stop.  Puck had never had pancakes as fluffy as these, or such delicious hashbrowns eggs, or biscuits.  After cleaning his plate clean, Puck went back for seconds and inhaled that too, leaving the rest for Dave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was all gone, Puck sat back in his char and grunted loudly, completely stuffed.  He had never eaten that much food before and looked down, amazed to see his stomach was bloated.  Dave leaned back also, patting and rubbing his bigger, solid stomach, \"That was - UUURP- so good.\"  Puck was amazed by Dave's massive figure across from him, and he had to ask, \"So... How did you get so big?\"  Dave smiled and patted his belly, \"Football.  Coach wanted us to beef up this season so I've been lifting and eating non-stop.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about your figure?  Don't you care what girls thi- .. I mean -don't you care what other guys think of you being so big?\"  Dave chuckled, \"Puckerman, I'm a bear cub.  I'm SUPPOSED to be big and burly.\"  \" A what?\", Puck asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bear cub - it's a gay term.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh... then what would you call Kurt and Blaine?\"<br>\r\n\"Kurt is a twink and Anderson is an otter.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not even gonna ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah, I beefed up for football, and to be honest, I really love it.  I feel so big and powerful.\"  Dave said, flexing one of his massive biceps.  Puck was amazed by the sheer size of them, of Dave in general, and then that's when it hit him.  He's been feeling like a outcast for the longest time and what he needed was a friend - someone who was also an outcast.  What he needed was to feel big and powerful, like his old self, like how Dave feels now.  What he needed was a body and a friend like Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Karofsky.  You remember all that stuff I told you yesterday?\"  Dave nodded and Puck continued, \"Well... I think if I started getting bulky like you are, I'd start to feel better about myself.  Y'know, raise my self-esteem and stuff.  Could you help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave decides to..</span></div></div>",

You're kind of an impulsive guy Puckerman and rush into things without thinking things through. If you spend a couple days thinking about it and still want to, I'll be glad to help you. Here, add in my cell which is 303-244-1220. I don't want to accidentally crush your phone.\" After looking at Dave's massive paws again, Puck had to agree and adds it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really changed,\" Puck said, still somewhat astonished by this fact<br>\r\n. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know I had been terrible with your Glee club friends, Kurt in particular. Call it what you well, repression, latent homosexuality crisis, whatever but I had been a ticking time bomb. I guess getting expelled and away from my former friends was one of the best things that could happen to me. If I stayed I would have possibly actually done something which scares me now to think about it. I was really messed up. But after the anti-bullying club and finding new friends and people who accepted me, I don't feel like such a freak all the time and take it out on other people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Puck said not quite sure what to say. \"Kurt forgave you?\" Puck find it hard to belive. If it was him, he would never have forgiven Karofsky. On the other hand, it was Kurt and Dave was a much different person from who he had been. Puck found himself liking the new Dave, not to mention Dave cooked very well. He could still taste breakfast. Rubbing his bloated belly, he burped again manfully which caused Dave to grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Kurt forgave me. By the way, nice one.\" Puck shrugged his shoulders modestly, blushing a little. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for breakfast, it was really good.\" <br>\r\n\"Not a problem. If you ever want more...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you bet I will. But for now, I guess I should leave. Have to go pick up my car where I left it last night.\" Dave drove Puck to the bar. <br>\r\n\"I hope to see you again sometime,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"I never thought I would say this, but me too. You're pretty cool Karofsky.\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Dave. Karofsky makes it sound almost like we're still enemies and I hope we aren't those anymore.\" <br>\r\n\"No, we're not.\" Puck said smiling. <br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. If you're still interested, I would love to help you. You'd look really hot, even more than you do now if you started bulking up. But I want to make sure its what you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll know soon,\" Puck promised and he watched as Dave drove away. A minute or two after Dave left, he shrugged and went to his car, driving home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck did spend time thinking about it, wondering what it would be like. He drew up the pros and cons into a list and he fantasized being beefier, his biceps even bigger and his pecs and legs even more impressive. So strong and powerful, like Dave. Probably not as big because Dave was a wooly mammoth of a dude or as he put it, a bear and that was a pretty apt description, but Puck wouldn't mind it. Unlike most people, abs to him were secondary and although he had them, they weren't as cut as Sam's or Mike's. While he enjoyed having them, his favorites were the guns and chest and Dave had those. A big belly as well and even bigger than before, but it only further made Dave look manly and kick-ass awesome. Dave had always acted confident but now he truly was and grown into himself. Nobody messed with Dave if they were smart and he had calmed down enough to mostly ignore them if they were being stupid. If Puck got bigger, he'd be more respected and people would like him again. He also remembered the sensation of being stuffed and had enjoyed it. He thought about it a lot as well. What it would be like with a big rounded stuffed hard belly. Not soft and weak, but with solid muscle beneath. Puck thought it manly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few days before he was settled for it. After putting up with Shane, Sam, and Finn in football, constantly being picked over in Glee by Blaine, Finn, Sam, even Irish Rory, and be insulted by Santanna, reminded again by Quinn he was just a 'Lima loser' (man, she had been in a bitchy mood), Shelby telling him again it was a mistake and he was just a kid, and being part of the background otherwise, he was more decided than ever to stick out.He liked the self-confidence and power, and he remembered the immense strength of Dave's that put them all to shame. Dave might have even been bigger than Coach Beiste although Puck wasn't sure on that. He wanted that and he was going to do whatever it took to got it. Besides, he wondered what sex would be like as a beefy stud and he was experienced enough to know that it wasn't always appearance but the way you do it (although his appearance was very good looking). He called the number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave,\" Puck said, <br>\r\n\"Hey Puck!\" Dave said excited. <br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about it as you told me to. And I want it. I need the self-confidence and power from being bigger and stronger. I'm falling apart otherwise. So please help?\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll help you.\" <br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could start soon.\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Okay, how bout over dinner. I'm free tonight,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"That will be good thanks. I'm glad I have a friend like you. <br>\r\n\"Glad to be of assistance. I feel the same way. Where do you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can come over now and we'll eat.\"  The two hung up and Puck pushed himself off his bed and threw on his thermal, jacket, and mohawked beanie before jumping into his car and driving over to Dave's house.  Puck had never bothered to learn where Dave had lived before, but he was surprised to know it was only a twenty minute drive from his house.  Puck pulled his truck into Dave's driveway and hurried to the door, shoving his hands in his pockets because of the cold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck knocked and waited a bit before Dave pulled the door open, \"Hey, Puck.  Dude, you look frozen, you better get inside.\"  \"Thanks, man.\" Puck said as he walked past Dave into the amazingly warm house, \"Man, this place is really warm.\"  Dave shut the door and laughed, \"Yeah.  I can't stand the cold so I usually have either the heater or the fireplace working.\"  Puck smirked, \"It's winter, shouldn't you be hibernating?\"  Dave laughed and slapped Puck on the back, almost knocking the poor guy over, \"Good one.  The food is already done so let's eat!!  I'm actually kind of excited to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck followed Dave into the kitchen and took a seat at the table across from where Dave was going to sit.  As they made small talk while Dave loaded up Puck\u2019s plate, Puck caught himself staring at Dave\u2019s insanely wide back.  Puck\u2019s still couldn\u2019t believe that Dave had gotten to be so huge.  His imagination started to wander as he began to think of himself getting as big as Dave soon - a thought that simply made Puck feel incredibly excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Dave set down his plate that made Puck realize he was daydreaming, \u201cOH.  Thanks, Dave.\u201d Puck said before looking down at his plate.  Never in his life had Puck seen a plate so full of mashed potatoes and roast beef that it almost made his stomach want to run away.  He looked up at Dave, who was already digging into his equally massive plate, and sighed; If he was gonna bulk up, he needed to start eating like Dave did.</span></div></div>",

The smell was tantilizingly delicious and if it was going to taste as good as it smelled and was like breakfast, this was going to be awesome. There was no other way to describe it. The amount however was intimidating. Dave seemed comfortable with it and making surprisingly speedy progress, but Dave was a bear and this was a bear sized portion. No wonder Dave had grown so quickly, coupled with working out if he ate like this on a regular basis. Sticking his (rather large, meant for Dave sized fingers) spoon into the mashed potatoes, he scooped it up and took a bite and was both astounded but not astonished by the excellent taste. It was perfectly creamed, not to wet but not unsmashed, with a very good consistent quality throughout and damn him if they weren't the best mashed potatoes he ever tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck man, seriously, where did you learn to cook like this?\" Puck asked between bites of potatoes he was shoveling in, Dave, Puck noticed, was almost halfway done with the first plate already. Holy crap, that was fast. Dave slowed down for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like them?\" He asked and Puck stared at him in shock. <br>\r\n\"Are you f-ing serious? These are the best damn mashed potatoes I have ever had.\" Puck was surprised when Dave blushed a little. <br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, thank you. Glad to know. I learned from my grandmother. She used to be a chef at fine restaurants. Her food is always better but she says I'm not too bad at it.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, that's an understatement. I think you're fantastic.\" Puck said proudly. Dave smiled at the compliment. <br>\r\n\"Thanks Puck, glad you think so. When I was younger, I used to hate people knowing I knew how to cook. I never told anyone. You're the first outside my family to know. My friends...former friends, thought it was gay for a dude to know how to cook. And you know how openly gay people are treated in this town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All too well. But if you think about it, the fact that you know how to cook, although surprising, doesn't mean you'd be gay. Well, you are, but not for knowing how to cook.\" Puck shook his head. \"If people knew what they were missing out on...oh man. And looking at you, no one would accuse you of being different if you wore an apron and started cooking. I always heard it said never trust a skinny cook.\" Dave looked confused at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why's that?\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think it's because anyone who can cook well will also have to enjoy eating to know what good food is. If a cook is skinny, clearly they aren't eating good food and either they must actually suck at it or there is something wrong with them. They might be planning something fishy, stuff like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, makes sense.\" Dave ate the last bits of mashed potatoes and pot roast and eyed Puck's plate. <br>\r\n\"Aren't you hungry?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't eat as fast as you. Most people wouldn't have at this amount. Plus, I've been talking.\" Puck shoveled in some more mashed potatoes and groaned against the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And oh heavens above, these are fucking awesome.\" Dave went and got himself more while Puck was still working through the first plate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPuck realized he had a problem when he finally got through the creamy mountain. It was more filling than he realized at first and he was getting kind of full. He was also completely sober and not drunk enough to push the feeling aside and also feeling kind of sleepy, sitting in a warm cozy room with a blazing fireplace and a full belly. Yawning, Puck shook himself a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <br>\r\n\"Can you help me stay awake? Least until I finish?\" Dave shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Uh...sure. What should I do?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know, talk or something. Rub my stomach, anything you want. Just do something to keep me awake.\" Dave's eyebrows rose and Puck mentally slapped himself. <br>\r\n\"Rub your stomach?\" Dave asked and Puck just shrugged seeing as he couldn't take it back now. <br>\r\n\"Sure, if you want. I wouldn't mind. It would help in digestion and I am feeling kind of full but I'm not done eating yet.\" Dave smiled. <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. I'm glad you like my food.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad to be eating it.\" Puck said and Dave grinned. <br>\r\n\"This is fun. I wish you had been my best friend instead of Azimo and the rest.\" Puck nodded in agreement to that.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now get over here before this turns any more sappy and we turn into a couple of girls.\" Dave grinned. <br>\r\n\"Aye captain.\" Standing up, Dave took his plate to the sink and then moved his seat next to Puck's. Puck took a few more bites while waitng and then to Dave's amazement, removed his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..what are you doing?\" Dave asked shocked. <br>\r\n\"It's getting really warm in here and I'd stay awake easier like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay,\" Dave bit the inside of his mouth. He had taken peeks of Noah changing in the Locker room before (Hey, he couldn't help it if Puck was one of the most gorgeous bodies he had ever seen and it was a guy's locker room so he had an excuse) but never  had Puck done it so flauntingly, or maybe it just felt that way. His stomach was a bit bloated from the mashed potatoes but Dave enjoyed the sight, actually thought it made Puck even more yummy. Laying his thick hands carefully on it, he rubbed softly and Puck moaned. Taken aback, he stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? That felt amazing, don't stop,\" Puck demanded and Dave obliged. Holding his head down low and thanking that Puck couldn't see it, he blushed as he continued rubbing, loving the feeling of rubbing it. Puck continued eating the meat and made occasional comments to Dave or just intermittently moaned when Dave did something particularly good. Soon the plate was empty and Puck belched loudly as he relaxed back against the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuurrrrrppp. Oh man, that was good. I feel stuffed.\" Puck reached down and rubbed his stomach himself. \"Thanks for the meal and helping.\" <br>\r\n\"My pleasure,\" Dave said amicably. Puck burped again. <br>\r\n\"You wouldn't mind if I took a short nap do you? I'm feeling pretty tired.\" Dave backed off. <br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all. Mi casu es su casa. My house is your house.\" Yawning, Puck leaned against the velvet chair. <br>\r\n\"You're a really great friend.\" With that, Puck fell asleep and started snoring lightly. Dave blinked at the suddenness of it. <br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, that was fast.\" </span></div></div>",

It could have been taken as creepy, but Dave couldn't help it, nor did he care.  He could already feel himself falling for Puck, and the fact that Puck wanted to be massive like him just made him fall farther.  Dave put both of his large, thick hands Puck's bloated belly and rubbed softly, watching as a sleepy smile spread across Puck's face.  Dave sighed and pulled back, taking Puck's plate and putting it in the sink with his.  He cleaned up the kitchen and put the leftover pot roast and potatoes in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kitchen clean, Dave crossed his thick arms and thought out loud, \"Puck might not sleep that long and he'll probably be hungry when he wakes up.  I should make him something..\"  Dave started to search through the fridge, mulling over the ingredients he had, \"I don't have enough for a pie.. and a cake would take too long.\"  Dave opened up the freezer and he smiled, \"Bingo!  Sundae it is!!\"  Dave pulled the massive tub of vanilla and hot fudge swirl ice cream out of the freezer and opened it up.  He opened the utensil draw and pulled out a spoon out, scooping out a big bite of the ice cream and eating it happily.  Dave, ever the glutton, couldn't help himself and just dug in, not realizing he was eating a large amount of the ice cream.  By the time Dave was able to stop himself, he had eaten half of the gallon and his own big stomach was rock solid and cold from the ice cream.  Dave chuckled and patted his bear belly, which made a distinct \"thump\" each time.  He had a feeling that Puck wasn't the only one who would be getting bigger during this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith half of the ice cream container empty, Dave decided not to bother with a bowl, and pulled out all of the ingredients out of the fridge for Puck's sundae.  He opened the brand new bottle of whipped cream and covered the entire top of the ice cream in it, squirting a gracious amount into his own mouth before putting it away and grabbing the chocolate syrup.  Dave drenched the sundae is chocolate syrup before pouring some into his mouth, accidentally spilling some on his white shirt.  \"Damn it.\" Dave said, pulling off his shirt and taking it into the garage to get rid of the stain.  He came back, opting to go shirtless, and finished the sundae for Puck by throwing on some caramel sauce as well(and sneaking some for himself of course.  Dave picked up the  half gallon of ice cream sundae and went back to the table where Puck was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Puck was still asleep when Dave got back and he set the sundae down. The sight of Puck sleeping was really adorable since he was all cute and child-like. Dave sat across from him and started rubbing Puck's bloated belly again although it was less bloated than earlier. Puck made a cute moan and snuggled closer against Dave's hand and Dave grinned. Puck was adorable and the furthest thing from bad-ass as he could possibly be at this moment. Puck didn't seem to like it but Dave enjoyed the cute cuddling Puck as much as bad-ass awesome Puck and the other various sides. Dave continued rubbing Puck's belly soothing it and suddenly there was a fluttering as Puck's eyes opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Dave, is that you?<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's me.\" Puck blinked sleepily. <br>\r\n\"I am having the weirdest dream. In my dream I was at your house eating food and then somehow we ended up shirtless and you're rubbing my stomach.\" <br>\r\n\"No, this is real.\" <br>\r\n\"Really? Did we do anything?\" Puck made some gestures that made Dave blush and he shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Ah no, you just fell asleep, rather cutely I might add.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute, Puckasauraus ain't cute, he's bad-ass\" Puck said, which made Dave giggle because it was cute how Puck tries to not be cute but bad-ass, especially since he still had a sleepy expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why are you shirtless anyways? You weren't before.\" Dave notices Puck subtly examining him and he grins as he flexes a bit, his massive biceps bulging. The brief look on Puck's face was priceless, all stunned and very desirous. Puck recovered quickly and made it seem like he hadn't just been totally checking Dave out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice chest hair,\" Puck said, looking at the thicker dark hair on Dave's pecs and continued downwards. \"You are a bear.\" <br>\r\n\"Do you...do you mind?\" Dave asked. He thought it was awesome but not everybody thought so and he wanted to know Puck's thoughts on it. <br>\r\n\"While normally I wouldn't find it attractive, it suits you because you're a bear and you wouldn't be as awesome without it.\" Puck blushed. <br>\r\n\"Oh god, I had a Brittany moment. I mean 'you're a bear and you wouldn't be as awesome without it'? I sound freaking retarded.\" <br>\r\n\"No, it's okay, I like it,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"I am amazed you can't stand the cold. I mean, I think your thick pelt would have kept you warm,\" Puck said, only half-joking. Dave rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Haha, very funny. But I don't know, I am just sensitive to it or something more than most people.\"  <br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Puck said. \"Is it just me or are you bigger or something?\" Dave grinned as he slapped his hard belly making a thick thumping sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you are observant. I had a wee bit of icecream.\" Puck scoffed. <br>\r\n\"A wee bit? I'm fairly sure it was more than a 'wee bit'.\" <br>\r\n\"You're right, just a little more than a wee bit.\" Dave said grinning. Puck scooted closer to Dave and put his hands on Dave's stomach.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Dave asked, shocked and excited. Puck was touching him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reciprocating. You helped me and I'll help you. It wouldn't be very nice to have you do such nice things for me and not pay you back in return.\" Well, Dave was a bit disappointed to hear that but it did make sense. And no way was he turning this down. Puck used both hands on Dave's massive gut as he rubbed it, Dave sighing at the touch. Puckerman was disturbingly good at it and it felt amazing those talented hands. He tried to not think where Puck learned it because he didn't want to throw up but wow, Puck was good. No wonder people loved him, or at least had. Dave relaxed against the couch as Puck continued massaging when a massive rumble built up and exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP.\" Dave's face was bright red when it happened, completely embarassed. Fucking hell he couldn't believe it. Puck just laughed, his mouth cracking into a beautiful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's freaking awesome. You're such a beast,\" Puck said giggling as he resumed rubbing. Dave just blushed harder. After a few more moments, Puck stopped. <br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that?\" he asked pointing at the big bowl of icecream sitting there, having only just noticed it. <br>\r\n\"Uh, I made you a sundae while you were asleep. I couldn't resist having icecream as well but this one is yours.\" Puck looked doubtfully at it.<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can eat all that, especially after that last meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you,\" Dave said. Honestly, he wasn't sure how much he could eat either as he was pretty full himself but if it encouraged Puck, he'll gladly do it. \"And if you get too full, I'll help feed you as well.\" Puck looked at it then at Dave then shrugged. Picking up two spoons he handed one to Dave and kept the other. He looked at it a few more moments before digging in. </span></div></div>",

He finally settled on a pretty funny movie that he enjoyed before digging into the ice cream with his best friend.  Dave ate slowly, because his stomach was already bloated and hard from his ice cream binge before and didn't want to get sick.  However, Puck was going in a completely opposite direction - despite the huge meal he had eaten earlier, Puck was devouring the mountainous sundae in front of him.  Dave watched, amazed at how much Puck was eating.  Dave kept at his slower pace, eating one bite for every three that Puck did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, Puck flopped back against the couch and groaned happily, \"Oh, God....  That was so good.\"  Dave smiled and scooted closer to Puck, the tub of ice cream in one hand and the spoon in the other.  Dave scooped out a big bite and held it up to Puck's mouth, \"Open up.\"  Dave said encouragingly.  Puck, without saying a word, opened wide as Dave slid the spoon into his mouth.  Dave fed Puck bite after bite, Puck hands rubbing his hard, bloated belly the entire time.  Dave scooped out one last bite and Puck ate it happily, though some of it fell onto his chest.  Dave scooped it up with his hand and it licked it off his fingers before giving Puck's stuffed stomach a few hard pats, \"Man, listen to the sound of that stuffed belly.  Now THAT is a manly sound.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck opened his mouth to say something, but words didn't come out.  Instead, a massive burp was what exited his mouth, \"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURPPPPPP...  mmmmmhh..  That felt SO good...\"  Dave laughed at how awesome Puck's belch was before he placed both of his massive hands on Puck's belly, \"Man, Puck, you're really getting into this, aren't you?\"  Dave asked, running his hands in slow circles on Puck's gut.  Puck grinned and put his hands behind his head, \"Sure am!  I haven't felt this relaxed and happy in a LONG time, Dave.  I honestly think this was something that was meant to happen, y'know?  I've always been so worried about my body, but now I realize it's time the Puckasaurus got his feast on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that.\"  Dave said, patting Puck's stuffed belly before he kept rubbing it with one hand, sitting back on the couch and just hanging out and talking with Puck.  Without even realizing it, both of them passed out on the couch, Dave's big bear paw still on Puck growing belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wafting smell of pancakes was what woke Puck up. Mmh pancakes, Dave made delicious pancakes. He was drooling already in anticipation as he walked in and saw Dave turning them over skillfully as they cooked to perfection. He also had eggs and bacon of course already out since he seemed to make pancakes last. Puck whistled letting Dave know he was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Dave,\u201d Puck said smiling. Dave flipped over another pancake and turned around smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Puck.\u201d Dave had a big black tank top on which look stretched on his massive frame and only accentuated it which Puck ogled once again. Damn he was big. Puck was both jealous and in awe of his new friend. Possibly his only with Finn being stupid, Kurt and Rachel being all buddy-buddy and if Kurt hadn\u2019t been 100% gay (and not fond of bisexuals apparently) he would have sworn they were dating, Artie busy, and Sam\u2026well, he had no idea. He wasn\u2019t sure if they were friends or not so he\u2019ll withhold judgment on that one. Perhaps he should see Sam later, introduce him to the new Dave Karofsky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be done in a few minutes,\u201d Dave said and Puck sat down in the seat as he continued cooking. Puck flipped through the channels, knowing Dave liked to eat and watch tv at the same time and he did as well, and settled on a show called \u201cMy Babysitter\u2019s a Vampire.\u201d Childish, maybe, and he\u2019d deny it vehemently to anyone who accuses him of it, but he loved little kid\u2019s shows like that and Wizards of Waverly Place, Ben10, Yugioh (and LittleKuriboh who did the fantastically awesome abridged), and so on. Maybe he didn\u2019t always have time helping around the house and stuff but he loved watching. Only Finn and Dave knew his love of cartoons. Sam probably suspected but Puck hadn\u2019t told him yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck burst out laughing and Dave turned around confused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan and Benny are cross-dressing to join the cheerleading squad to get close to chicks and their friend Rory thinks Benny is hot and keeps flirting with him. Haha, hilarious. Hey, I\u2019m surprised I never thought of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDressing up as a cheerleader to join the cheerios?\u201d Dave asked, amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Puck said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe you were a girl for even a second, your legs are far too hairy in the skirt plus I doubt you could do all the jumps and twists cheerleaders do.\u201d Puck winced at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably true. Plus Santanna and Quin would do bad things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of bad things?\u201d Dave asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea but it\u2019s Santanna and Quin. Whatever it would be it would be sure to make my life a living hell.\u201d Dave shuddered at the thought of Santanna. She may have been tiny compared to him, but she was one of the scariest most demanding people he had ever met in his life and pretending to be her boyfriend only made it even more apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Satan\u2019s scary,\u201d Dave said, shuddering again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys ever dated.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much as dated as friends (of a sort) with benefits who sometimes hooked up.\u201d Dave made a gagging noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw, but what do you mean \u2018of a sort\u2019?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re friends but not really since I don\u2019t know if Santanna can even have friends but\u2026I understand her more than anyone else, even Brittany since whenever Santanna was sad she\u2019d come to me because I was the best and I made her feel better plus she was hot and I could never suffer a girl crying\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo much detail,\u201d Dave griped. \u201cI know you slept with her who knows how much but I don\u2019t need to be reminded of it.\u201d Puck smirked a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Are you jealous?\u201d Dave kept silent but he blushed a little because yes, he strangely was. He turned away from Puck, hiding his face as the last pancake was ready and he removed them all, putting them on a plate and bringing them to the table and turned off the stove. Grabbing a jug of milk from the fridge and some orange juice, he put those out as well. Puck had his eyes narrowed and focused on the food as he waited for Dave to sit down. Chuckling, Dave sat down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave as much as you want,\u201d he said, knowing how much Puck seemed to love his pancakes. His other stuff as well but Puck had a special heart for pancakes. So Dave made a lot of them again, just for him. Puck grabbed a whole bunch and some eggs onto his plate and dug in while Dave did the same, although Dave was distracted by watching Puck. Puck divided his attention between the tv and the pancakes, as he chewed and shoveled them in, making groaning noises of enjoyment every now and then. <br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026mmph\u2026 these really\u2026.mmph\u2026.are the best pancakes,\u201d Puck said in between bitefuls. Dave really liked that but so did his little friend at the sight of his big friend being all cute and adorable as he enjoyed his food. Dave squirmed in his seat. He might like Puck, like him a lot to be honest after only a couple days, but he wasn\u2019t sure yet if Puck wanted him in that way. Yeah, Puck sent him admiring and longing gazes but that didn\u2019t mean Puck liked him in that way. Puck himself said that he wanted to be like him which didn\u2019t necessitate at all liking him. Plus, the dude just got burned by girls but that doesn\u2019t mean he swung for his and Kurt\u2019s team. After all, Puck slept with many, many, females and had relationships with them, even adult women. Dave had never had a relationship with anyone and his few fumbling attempts with Kurt scarred him mentally and drove him away to Dalton. He didn\u2019t know anything. But he did know he wanted his friend, although it was probably too soon to suggest that seeing as they were only newly friends and again, Puck mightn\u2019t be even gay and might freak out and only drive him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away, Dave tried to focus only on his own food as Puck plowed through one huge plate of pancakes and eggs and got another. It was extremely difficult as Puck was extremely vocal in his appreciation that Dave was left wondering if Puck was having breakfast or doing something else because he surely wasn\u2019t that good at cooking. Dave looked up to find out although as far as he could tell, both hands were above the table. He was however distracted by the sight of bloated stomach. Never in a million years would Dave have thought it would happen or that Puck would like it, but he did. Puck was rubbing his solid stomach as he finished the last few crumbs of pancakes, letting out whimpers of enjoyment and burping a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a-uuuuurrpp-good breakfast. Uurrrrpp, you going to-ugh-finish those?\u201d Puck was looking at Dave\u2019s plate which still had a pancake and some eggs left. Dave wasn\u2019t feeling particularly hungry right then from last night and the sight before him was far more entrancing so he shrugged and pushed them over, letting Puck have the rest. Puck finished them before slumping in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuuuuuuuurrrrrppppp, man I love it here. Such good amazing food.\u201d Puck patted his stomach. \u201cIf I continue to eat like this, I\u2019m going to get huge.\u201d The smile on Puck\u2019s face said what he thought of that and Dave was relieved. He\u2019d certainly hope so. Dave came over and Puck looked confused before Dave placed his hands on Puck\u2019s belly and started rubbing. Giving a sigh, Puck leaned back in his seat as Dave did his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuuurrrrppp, so-urrrpp-good.\u201d Puck said between belches, relieved that Dave didn\u2019t mind, even liked them. Shifting a little, he let out a sigh. \u201cYou really are surprisingly good at this as well,\u201d Puck said. Dave shrugged modestly then continued rubbing his big paws on and around Puck\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Around two in the afternoon Dave and Puck were sitting in the living room watching TV, both of their big stomachs extremely swollen from the massive lunch Dave had made for them.  Dave, who was used to such massive meals, felt completely fine with such a full belly and was giving Puck one of his amazing belly rubs.  Puck was completely relaxed by the feeling of Dave's large hands rubbing his belly, but the near-silence between them was broken when the cell phone in Dave's pocket went off.  He pulled it out and held it up to his ear, \"Hello?..  Hey, Dad!  You're coming home?  Yeah, I'll go to the grocery store.. okay, see you soon then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad?\"  Puck asked, sounding a bit disappointed.  <br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry.  You're gonna have to go home tonight...\" <br>\r\nPuck whined a bit and pouted, \"Damn it.  I love hanging out with you.\"<br>\r\nDave smiled, he hadn't heard that in a long time, \"He's only staying until tomorrow.  He just went on a hunting trip with some friends and tomorrow morning he has to go on a business trip for about a week.  You can come over then and I'll make some massive meals for you!\"<br>\r\nPuck's face brightened up instantly, \"Oh, hell yeah!\"  <br>\r\n\"Only on one condition though.  You still need to eat tonight so I'll be sending over some take out.  I expect you to eat ALL of it.\"  Dave said, giving Puck a stern look.  He tried to keep his expression serious, but he ended up cracking a smile before patting Puck on the stomach, \"Make sure you weigh yourself tonight.  After we reach a certain weight we'll start lifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck agreed and and the two best friends said their good-byes before Puck headed home.  His family was out of town so Puck had the house to himself, so he decided to strip down to his boxers and just relax on the couch watching TV.  Puck ended up falling asleep for a few hours but was woken up around eight.  He lifted himself up and threw on his jeans before opening the door, surprised to see a pizza boy standing there with three large pizzas, \"Noah Puckerman?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...?\" <br>\r\n\"Your pizzas were paid for by the man who ordered them for you.  Enjoy!\"  He said as he handed Puck his pizza and left.  Puck shut the door behind him and sat down on the couch, opening the first pizza and instantly began to drool.  It was a PERFECT pizza, just the right amount of meat, cheese, and sauce.  Without hesitating, he grabbed the first bite and started to inhale the food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a perfect pizza. Puck briefly thought about calling Finn over before he realized they weren't close friends anymore. Not to mention he was probably busy with Rachel doing who knew what. Not having sex with her most likely because Finn is Finn and Finn sucked. The old Puck would have been all over her. But now he just felt tired and not himself except when with Dave which was funny. He, Dave, and Finn used to be best friends in Elementary and Middle School. Even the first year of High School they were inseperable. Then Mr. Schue took over Glee club and got Finn to join and Puck joined as well because he wanted to keep his friend safe and also because deep down he was curious. Dave hadn't liked that and tormented the Glee club until he got kicked out which actually had been a good thing as Dave changed for the better, back to the nice friendly Dave he had been in Elementary and Middle School and not the terror he was at McKinnley. And now they were best friends again while Finn and everyone else didn't seem to care about him wrapped up in their own dramas. Well, whatever. Puck didn't feel like being alone right then and he couldn't call Dave or Finn so he called someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck tapped his fingers nervously until he heard them pick up the phone. \"Hey Sam,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Puck?\" asked Sam confused. \"Why are you calling?\" <br>\r\n\"Don't know, I was just curious if you wanted to hang or something, maybe play a videogame or two. I got pizza.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess so. Wanna watch Avatar?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure...I guess we could watch Avatar too,\" Puck said. Sam hooted happily. <br>\r\n\"I'll be right over then! See you soon! Hey, where do you live?\" While Puck told him, he heard the sound of Sam getting something. <br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, okay, thanks. See you soon!\" Sam hung up and Puck put the phone down and settled down to wait. When the doorbell rang, Puck jumped up and ran to get it. <br>\r\n\"Woah there!\" Sam said as Puck yanked it open. \"Wow, you're sure excited to see me.\" Puck shrugged a little. <br>\r\n\"'Little lonely or something, doesn't matter,\" he mumbled, almost too quietly for Sam to hear. \"But now you're here and we can get started. I got pizza and stuff.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Sam said, following in after Puck. \"Can we start with Avatar?\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Sure, why not. It's a good movie.\" He took the disk from Sam and put it in the dvd player. \"Help yourself to as much pizza as you want, I have a ton of it.\" Sam looked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah you do. Why do you have three pizzas?\" He asked curiously. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, they were just delivered as a gift from someone who apparently wants to give me a ton of pizza. I just don't like eating pizza alone.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Sam said. \"You're alone? What about Finn? I thought he used to be your best friend or something.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck said a little bitterly. \"Used to. Not so much anymore. He doesn't like to hang with me anymore, something about stealing all his girlfriends.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, technically you did.\" Sam said pointing it out. <br>\r\n\"No I haven't. I have not once slept with Rachel. Thought about it, yeah, who wouldn't? But we only dated and that was for about a week before she dumped me.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought you dumped her?\" Sam said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just tell everyone that. But since I'm in a talkative mood I'll tell you that I actually liked her and was upset she had dumped me after only a week. I actually hadn't been going to break up with her but then she did and I just got upset and told her I had been about to do the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Sam said, not knowing what to say. Puck remained quiet for a moment before he put a smile on his face. <br>\r\n\"So, want to see that movie?\" Puck took out two of the pizza boxes and put them on the table. Puck jumped on the couch and patted the seat next to him. Sam made his way over and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to drink?\" his host asked and Sam shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Just water is good,\" Sam said and Puck shrugged as well. <br>\r\n\"Cool, suit yourself. I'll get you some. Just help yourself to as much pizza as you want. I'll be back with plates and shit in a minute or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, Puck was back, putting out paper plates for him and Sam as well as plastic cups and a big 2 liter Dr. Pepper. He quickly went to the kitchen and filled one of the cups with water before coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your water, which by the way, really? You sure you don't want anything else?\" He looked at the plate where Sam had only two slices. \"Come on dude, I know you can eat more than that. At least have a few more.\" Sam opened his mouth to say something but before he did, Puck already dropped two more onto his plate and moved his attention away as he dimmed the lights and poured himself his own drink. Sam decided it wasn't worth the argument and just stayed quiet, beginning to bounce in anticipation as Puck turned on the movie. Avatar was such a good movie and Sam had already seen it a bunch of times but he never got tired of seeing it. There was just something awesome about the world of Pandora and the Navi. Sam sometimes wished he was a Navi and had a tail. That would be so cool and he'd be able to communicate with different creatures without needing the ability to talk. He was teaching himself the Navi language right now and he was doing pretty well at it. Sadly, most people did not speak it so it was tricky to know the proper pronounciations of things but if he ever ran into the Navi, he would probably be able to put on a decent conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched the movie in rapture, especially Sam. Puck was pretty interested himself but Sam was really into it. He unconsciously quoted lines as they were said onscreen and didn't take his eyes off the screen for a single moment. He ate his four slices without noticing and even drank Dr. Pepper without looking or noticing when Puck poured it in his glass after the water was gone, curious to see what would happen. Puck lost himself in the movie as well but on a lesser-scale but still pretty interested. It was pretty easy to fall into an almost trance like state as he watched the movie and pretty colors and tasted such delicious pizza alternated with sips of Dr. Pepper. When the movie ended and Sam turned the lights back on excited, they both blinked to see two empty boxes of pizza and almost all the two liters gone. Puck suddenly let out a massive burp and there was silence for a few moments before Sam started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that was so awesome!\" Sam high-fived Puck and Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuurrrrrppp, thanks.\" <br>\r\n\"But I can't believe you ate two boxes of pizza!\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"Actually, 1 and a half, you ate the other half,\" Puck drawled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. Plus you had all that soda. Aren't you worried about the calories? I'm going to have to work out hard to recover from just that half a pizza, let alone 1 and a half. Crap, I just ate half a pizza.\" That caused Puck to start laughing hard while Sam stood there confused. \"What?\" he asked. \"What is it?\" Wiping pretend tears from his eye, Puck managed to settle down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's the thing,\" he said grinning. \"I'm actually doing this deliberately.\" <br>\r\n\"Doing what deliberately?\" <br>\r\n\"Eating and gaining weight of course.\" <br>\r\n\"But...why?\" Sam asked, really confused now. <br>\r\n\"Multiple reasons among which it feels good, am bulking up, is entertaining, not to mention it feels good.\" <br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried though? What about chicks and stuff?\" Sam asked. Puck frowned. <br>\r\n\"I'm done with chicks man. They're all fucking crazy and I'm just done with them. I'm taking a break. Besides, it's not like anyone's interested in me anymore anyhow.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm sure that's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. Quinn's downright crazy, Rachel is an annoying giant loving midget, Santanna's a lesbian which would ordinarily be rather hot but now she wants nothing to do with me, and Shelby is reluctant to let me near Beth anymore. Even my pool cleaning business has been drying up and the milfs don't want me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what about Shelby?\" Puck looked away. <br>\r\n\"None of your business.\" <br>\r\n\"Fine. So you actually like this?\" Sam wasn't being judgmental, he was just honestly puzzled. <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Puck leaned back against the couch stretching his arms up and the shirt riding up exposing his bloated gut. Sam cocked his head nervously as he looked at it and the slight hairy trail across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...Can I touch it?\" Sam asked, his voice cracking as he shut his eyes as he expected Puck to freak and sock him for asking. Instead he heard a chuckle and Sam opened his eyes in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can,\" Puck said easily. Warily, Sam stepped forward a few steps at a time expecting it to either be a prank or a trap to punish him. Puck just sat their watching as Sam carefully made his way forward and hesitantly laid a finger on Puck's stomach. He flinched as he expected a hit but nothing came. Sam moved back a little and hesitantly poked it, which barely jiggled at all from its round fullness. Poking again, Sam marveled at the feeling. It was fun and who knew it could get so full? He laid his hand across and rubbed it. Puck leaned his head back and sighed in pleasure which encouraged Sam to keep going. He continued rubbing as Puck made noises of pleasure and Sam loved it. Switching hands he continued, revulsion totally gone and interest just left. He had no idea what was going on but he liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After such an amazing weekend at Dave's place, Puck was beyond bummed to be back in school for the next five days.  Classes and Glee club came and went(they had begun talking about their setlist for regionals but nothing really stunning came to mind) and as soon as the bell rang dismissing the school, Puck was GONE.  He quickly made it to his truck and hopped in, grunting as he did so.  He looked down, over his growing stomach, and knew exactly what the pain that had been bugging him was.  He put both hands down on the waist of his jeans and unbuttoned them, letting out a loud, happy sigh of relief.  Puck had to deal with the pain of his now-shrinking jeans cutting into his jeans.  He always wore them a little tight but now they were starting to hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small pain was worth it though, and it meant that he was indeed getting bigger.  Puck turned on his truck and pulled out of the parking lot, heading down to Dave's house.  When Puck got there, he hurried to the front door - it was freezing outside and the warm heat from Dave's fireplace is just what he needed.  He knocked a few times and a big grin spread across his face when Dave opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Puck!  Get inside, you look frozen.\"  Dave said, stepping to side while Puck hurried inside.  Puck loved how warm Dave kept his house; it was obvious to him that Dave hated the winter months.  \"So how was school?\"  Dave asked as he walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Boring.\"  Puck said bluntly.  Everything seemed boring to him recently, except for when he's eating or hanging out with Dave.  \"What about you?\"<br>\r\nDave put on his oven mitts and opened the stove, pulling out a huge lasagna, \"School was good!  Classes were boring but I hung with a few of my friends at lunch.  My buddy, Trevor, doesn't want to admit it, but I totally caught him checking out my ass.  I think he's got a thing for thick dudes.\"<br>\r\nPuck bit his lower lip subconsciously, not realizing he was a little jealous.  His green-eyes were soon cast aside when the sound of his growing belly roared in protest of not being pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave grinned and walked over, \"Let's see your progress.\"  he said, pulling Puck's shirt up and revealing his stomach.  Dave smiled and pressed his massive fingers against it, \"You're a natural gainer, Puck!  It's only been a few days and you're already soft and squishy.\"  Dave said, squeezing Puck's doughy stomach.  <br>\r\nPuck felt his cheeks turn red slightly, \"You think so?\"  <br>\r\n\"Definitely!  Turn around.\"  Dave asked.  Puck complied and turned around, \"So far it's all in your stomach and waist, I noticed your unbuttoned jeans, but you've put on a tiny bit of meat back here too.  It looks good!\"  <br>\r\nPuck smiled, not knowing why such a compliment made him happy, but it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was that pizza I sent over?\"  Dave asked, standing up.<br>\r\n\"OH!  It was amazing!!  I didn't eat it all though...\"<br>\r\nDave crossed his arms and stared down at Puck, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"I actually invited a friend over... You know Sam.  I kinda..  well I don't like eating alone so he came over and ended up eating half of it with me...\"<br>\r\nDave gave Puck a look, which made him seem upset, but he smiled, \"That's fine.  I'm just gonna have to feed you twice as much as I planned today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave walked back over to the stove, \"Lasagna's should be cool enough,\" he said, reaching in with a mitted hand a pulling out one large tray after another of garlic bread.  Each tray had two large loaves on each, four in total.  Puck sat down at the table and Dave took his spatula and cut the lasagna in half, putting each half on a plate.  He one loaf of garlic bread on each plate and set them down at their usual spot, \"Eat up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave went to the fridge to get the soda, Puck scratched the back of his neck.  This was a LOT of food, even for his new appetite, but, he knew he needed to make up that 1 and a half pizzas that Sam ate, so Puck picked up his fork and dug in.  As always with Dave's food, Puck was in food HEAVEN when he ate.  The cheese, pasta, meat, and sauce were just AMAZING.  Puck just kept shoveling in lasagna, only stopping to take a huge bight out of his garlic bread, drink soda, or belch.  He didn't even notice when he finished his first loaf of bread and Dave sneaked another one onto his plate, which was gone in no time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After two loafs of garlic bread, a couple of glasses of Dr. Pepper, and god only knew how much lasagna, Puck was completely utterly stuffed. He was probably (no, not probably, he was) more full than he had ever been in his life. The pizza was light compared to this which was scary. Well, not light but lighter. Puck was really glad he'd already unbuttoned his pants before he had gotten there as he did not want to imagine how it would have felt still buckled, or if they even would have remained so. Puck shifted in his chair miserably and Dave paused to help Puck over to the couch which felt more like traveling a thousand leagues. Puck collapsed onto it gratefully before returning his attention to his poor stuffed self and moaning again as he rubbed. He promised to himself never to eat again (until it wore off). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave after making sure Puck was okay and not going to die (although Puck complained he was), dragged a small table over and placed it so he could be within reaching distance of Puck and moved the rest of the somewhat sizeable portion of Lasagna on his plate there along with the drinks. Sitting down, Dave continued to eat with one hand while using his other to help Puck out, feeling along that hard bloated belly and rubbing it. This made Puck feel better and Dave continued to do so as he absent-mindedly shoveled forkful after forkful of lasagna into his mouth until the last bit had gone. He was shocked when he heard his fork scratch against the plate and he came out of his disassociated state to realize that indeed it was all gone, lasagna and bread. Letting out a massive burp and getting a weak chuckle from Puck before dissolving back into moaning, Dave pushed the table aside and ponderously stood up. He was surprised by how heavy(er) than normal he felt. Dave was impressed because eating with Puck was not only pushing Puck's endurance but also his. Dave had always eaten a lot but now with Puck, he passed beyond limits even he thought possible for him. They were both mutually benefacting and cooking for Puck gave Dave the opportunity to cook tons of food not to mention it was nice having someone enjoy it. Patting his substantial belly, Dave trundled over and lifted Puck up a bit who opened an eye-lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" Puck asked indignantly and Dave yawned. <br>\r\n\"Taking the-uuuuurrrrrpp-couch,\" Dave belched as he slid himself under. Puck looked shocked as Dave squeezed himself under him and then put Puck back on top and wrapped his arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Puck started before Dave interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Can't be bothered to move, plus it feels nice.\" Puck after feeling Dave had to agree as he laid on top the big pillow. It was very nice indeed as Karofsky traced patterns over Puck's belly as the sluggish exhaustion finally started kicking in. Yawning, Dave continued to rub Puck until Puck was asleep and without anyone to talk to, Dave quickly fell asleep as well. They laid there together, just sleeping until the sound of a car coming in woke them up. </span></div></div>",

Somebody's here...\"<br>\r\nDave lifted himself up onto his elbows and grunted, \"Uggh...  okay.\"  Puck fell back onto his bigger ass as Dave got up and went to the door, ignoring the fact that he was shirtless, \"Hello?\"  He asked as he opened up but was pretty surprised when he saw who was there, \"Evans?\"<br>\r\nSam stared for a moment, temporarily stunned by the beauty that was Dave's massive body, but shook it off, \"Hey, Karofsky... Uhh... Puck is here right?\"<br>\r\nDave blinked, \"Uhh, yeah...  You wanna come in?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Sam said, sounding a bit excited.  Dave stepped back and Sam came inside, nearly blown away by the sight of Puck's bigger, shirtless body, \"H-Hey, Puck...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sam.  What's up?\"  Puck asked getting up off the couch.  <br>\r\n\"Uhh.. you know, just...\" Sam sighed, \"Okay... I'm gonna be blunt.  I wanna help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?\"  Dave asked, crossing his huge arms over his chest and raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Yeah..  I realized the other day when I was hanging out with Puck that I kinda liked how big he looked.  I wanna help him get bigger.\"  Sam said, blushing a bit.<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"I didn't know you were an encourager?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"  Sam said, scratching the back of his neck, \"So... can I?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Dave?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Why not!  It'll be nice to have an extra set of hands around to help us.\"  Dave gave Sam a pat on the back, which almost knocked Sam over, \"So, what do you want for dinner, Puck?\"<br>\r\nPuck thought about it for a second, \"Hmmmmm...

Sam said he knew a good one so Puck and Dave followed him as Sam drove to the place he knew. Getting out, Sam smiled at them. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, this place is really good and affordable and will be sure to fill your bellies,\u201d he said with a smile quirking his face. He reached out and patted Puck and Dave which was surprising but not altogether disliked. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Sam said in an evil ominous voice before grinning at them again. Both Puck and Dave rolled their eyes and Sam smirked as he led them in. \u201cThree please,\u201d he said to the girl waiting and the cashier lady nodded and smiled at them, her eyes giving a once-over to Puck a bit too long and definitely not just once. Dave felt a powerful rush of emotion run through him that left him almost staggering. Confused, he pushed the possessive feelings aside and pretended that the waitress did not just wink at Puck or that Puck smiled back. Eventually though, she finally did her job and rang them through at a base price of S12.00 a person and lead them to their booth. She gave them cups for their drinks and told them to call if they needed anything and then finally left. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo yeah,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy, just go grab whatever and however much you want and as many times as you want. I hear you guys like to eat so I hope you do. Now, I better go get my food before it gets eaten.\u201d Sam got up and they all split up to different areas of the buffet. Puck was in the mood for hamburgers and fries so he grabbed as much as he could as he filled his huge plate to overflowing. Dave on the other hand went for the mashed potatoes and gravy as well as carved turkey, three-bean salad, bread rolls, and blueberry pie which was similar to what he ate on Thanksgiving. Sam just went and got a few slices of pizza and some spaghetti. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all you\u2019re having?\u201d Puck and Dave asked at the same time when they looked at Sam\u2019s plate which caused them to laugh, look at each other, and laugh again. Sam shrugged unconcerned. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is what I usually eat.\u201d Puck and Dave looked at each other  and communicated silently as Puck tilted his head towards Sam\u2019s plate and Dave nodded. Sam who watched this interaction with interest, was confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked and both Puck and Dave shrugged. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, let\u2019s just eat,\u201d Puck said with a relish and enthusiasm Sam hadn\u2019t heard for a long time. Dave nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah dude, this is awesome. Thanks for bringing us out to this place.\u201d They both started digging into their food and Sam slowly ate his, unable to tear his eyes away from watching them enjoy their food. Their plates, huge to begin with, were close to overflowing and they somehow ate every bite with delight yet still at a far faster pace than Sam could. By the time Sam was half-way through his much less filled plate, Puck had already eaten most of the fries and some of the ginormous stacked burger he did himself and that he couldn\u2019t even get his mouth all the way around when he started; while Dave was already cleared of mashed potatoes, beans, and bread. Sam whistled slowly at the sight. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDudes, that is so awesome,\u201d he said looking at their plates. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re almost done already.\u201d Puck took a long sip from his now traditional cup of Dr. Pepper and burped loudly. Sam looked around startled and Puck laughed. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, it\u2019s just us guys, and no one would care in a place like this. If anything, it would be much appreciated advertisement. No need for embarrassment whatsoever.\u201d Puck burped again and smirked. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s manly. You are a man, right Evans?\u201d Before he even knew it, Sam was boxed in between Puck and Dave. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be so tense,\u201d Puck whispered across Sam\u2019s back. \u201cJust relax and have fun. We\u2019re all buddies, right?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWha-what are you doing?\u201d Sam almost shrieked when he felt Puck\u2019s hands grab onto his shoulder-blades. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHelping you relax, you\u2019re really jumpy,\u201d Puck grumbled as he started moving his thumbs in circular motions. Sam had been about to comment on that statement but instead what came out was a long moan of pleasure as Puck did something. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cReally tense, you need to relax more Sam, you wouldn\u2019t get such knots.\u201d Sam jerked a little as Puck pressed a little harder but relaxed again when the pain went away. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cPuck here is like a gifted masseur or something,\u201d Dave announced. \u201cThe pleasure he can give\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI like to make people feel good,\u201d Puck finished as he continued rubbing. \u201cNow just relax,\u201d Sam surprised but not questioning it, sat there while Puck worked on him. He opened his eyes when he heard a clink in front of him. Dave had come back with another plate of food and placed it in front of Sam. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Sam asked. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThis is making good use of $12.00. I don\u2019t know how you get the energy to play football on your rabbit food diet.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cKurt is the one who eats rabbit food,\u201d Sam said defiantly. There was silence for a moment. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point,\u201d Puck said grinning. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay, but if you\u2019re going to hang with the big boys you\u2019re going to need to eat a little more. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re going to make you eat the same amount we do but it would be awkward if you don\u2019t at least try.\u201d Sam looked at the two of them, Puck looking at him encouragingly with a smile and Dave nodding his head. He wanted to be friends with them, they were really cool and awesome. Plus, they made it seem fun. Sam had no intention of getting as big as them but they were right in a sense and they might probably help him get over his food issues. He had been plateauing for a while in the weight room so it might help. Best of all though, he\u2019d get to see them and he had not forgotten when Puck came over or the sight of his bloated belly. Puck and Dave were not going to continue with him unless he did so he better do it. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I guess I can eat a little more,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWhat about you though?\u201d Puck smirked getting up. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I could use some more myself. What about you Dave?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Dave said lumbering up. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nDon\u2019t start without us!\u201d called Puck and Sam rolled his eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to and to be honest even if he did, they\u2019d probably still finish before him. When they came back with reloaded plates, Sam dug in as fast as he could, ignoring the voice in his head wanting him to stop and wanting to get done before his brain could catch up.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a good ten minutes of being stuffing himself, Sam collapsed in the buffet booth, his hands going straight to his swollen stomach.  \"Oh, God..\" Sam groaned, I've never been so full in my life...\"<br>\r\nDave and Puck both chuckled, each having made a sizable dent in their now second helpings.  Dave finished his last few bites before pushing his plate away and looking at Puck, \"May I?\"  Dave asked, pointing at Sam's bloated stomach.  Puck nodded, his mouth full of his now fourth burger.  Dave cracked his fingers and placed his massive bear paws on Sam's stomach and started rubbing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like magic, Sam went from pain to blissful heaven as Dave rubbed his belly, \"Now listen up, Evans.  I want you to remember that we brought you on as a feeder, not a gainer.  You'll probably get a little beginner belly while you work with us, but your main job is to feed us as much food as possible.  If we get full, you cheer us on and encourage us to eat everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck added, \"and there can never be any leftovers.  If we get full to the point where we can't move then it's your job to feed everything that's left to us.  Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, who was so enjoying his magical belly rub too much to even respond with words, nodded his head at their words, and after a few minutes Dave removed his hands and left the booth to get another plate.  Puck soon followed after.  They returned this time with two plates in each hand: Dave had one plate that was full of nothing but a mountain of mashed potatoes while his other one had ten pieces of fried chicken and huge helpings of mac and cheese.  Puck's first plate had five double cheeseburgers while his other one was stacked with a massive pile of french fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched, amazed, as Puck and Dave spent the next 10 minutes or so inhaling their food.  Sam's eyes would dart from watching them devour their food, down to their bloating stomachs, which he was just dying to touch.  He felt his face flush slightly when he saw them visibly get fuller.  Dave and Puck both seemed to push their plates away at the same time, each stuffed with meat and potatoes of various kinds.  They were about to get up when Sam stopped them, \"You two rest.  You're burning way to many calories by getting up and going to get your food.  I'm your feeder and it's my job to stuff those huge guts of yours.  What do you two want?  More of the same or are you two big bears ready for dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave and Puck looked at each other, and almost simultaneously said, \"Same.\"  Sam walked away to go stack up their fourth helping and Dave put his hand on his stomach, \"Man, this is great.  We need to hit up buffet's more often.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"  Puck said, rubbing his growing belly, \"The food here isn't as good as yours, Dave, but we definitely get more.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, \"I'll have to start making more food at home for these big boys,\" he said, smacking his swollen gut.  It wasn't completely full yet, so when he hit it his stomach made a THUMP sound and it jiggled a little.<br>\r\n\"We haven't weighed ourselves yet, have we?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\nDave shook his head, \"Not yet.  I guess we were having too much fun gaining.  I'll record our weights once we digest all of this and make a chart tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam returned a few minutes later with four giant plates; two in each each hand and two balancing on each arm.  They were all full of the same things Puck and Dave had just eaten.  Sam set the first two down and before he had the chance to put down the other two Puck and Dave were eating.  Sam refilled their drinks and sat back down, watching in awe and Dave and Puck stuffed their growing bellies with food. Once their fourth helping of food was gone, both Puck and Dave leaned back in their booth, rubbing their swollen bellies.<br>\r\nDave burped loudly and groaned, \"Uuuugh...  I haven't felt this full in a long time...\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"  Puck said, burping as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam patted both of their big stomachs, which were both large, round, and hard, \"You two aren't done yet.  You still have dessert to eat.\"  Sam patted both of their bellies as he got up, \"Who wants to go first?\"  <br>\r\nDave and Puck looked at each other, \"I'll go - UUUURP- ... first.\"  Dave said.  He knew Puck was a gifted eater, but he was still training, and Dave had more experience when it came to forcing food into his ever-growing gut when he was as full as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was gone and back in what seemed like no time at all.  He had a huge grin on his face and a gigantic hot fudge sundae in his hands.  He set down the massive sundae, picked up the spoon, and without even having to say anything, began feeding Dave.  Despite how full Dave was, he would never deny the fact that he was, and always would be, a gluttonous bear.  No matter how full he was, unless he was on the verge of throwing up, he would NEVER turn down food presented to him.  Dave eagerly ate spoonful after spoonful of the vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, and whipped cream that Sam fed him, rubbing his now cold, bloated belly the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave opened his mouth again, expecting more food, but when nothing came he looked at Sam, who smiled back, \"That's all.\"  Sam lifted Dave's shirt up, revealing his bloated, hairy gut, and instantly began rubbing.  Feeling his face grow slightly redder with each loud belch Dave made.  Sam loved it when Puck and Dave burped; it meant that he was doing a good job helping them on their quest to get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Dave was finally in a place where his bloated pain turned into bloated bliss, Sam got up and instantly made his way to the dessert table for Puck.  Puck waited eagerly, feeling a little less full than he was earlier and excited to eat after seeing how happy Dave was full of sweets.  Sam came back, the same huge grin he had on before, but instead of a big sundae like Dave had, Sam was armed with a complete chocolate cake.  Before Puck could say anything, Sam had sat back down, cut the cake into 8 slices, and began feeding them to Puck with his hands.  Puck ate happily, enjoying the delicious chocolate he was being fed.  As the final bite of the first slice went down Puck's throat, he felt Sam's fingertips in his mouth.  Without thinking, Puck sucked the chocolate cake off of Sam's fingers, which Sam let him do as he grabbed the next slice with his other hand, switching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck kept eating each and every slice of cake Sam fed him, suck the remains off of Sam's fingers as he waited for the next slice.  When Sam, pulled his fingers away, Puck instantly opened his mouth for the next slice, but there was none.  Sam pulled Puck's shirt up and went straight to work on relaxing his swollen, cake-filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Puck was relaxed, Sam sat back, admiring his work; both Dave and Puck were stuffed with as much food as possible and they looked so happy.  After a few minutes, Sam helped the two massive bears to his car, where the both slept as Sam drove them to Dave's house.  The weekend was starting tomorrow, which meant Sam would get to spend even more time feeding his two gigantic friends and helping them get bigger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to Dave's house, Sam helped Dave inside first, since he had the keys.  Dave made his way into his bedroom and collapsed on the bed, passing out instantly.  Sam admired how big Dave's gut looked while he was lying down, but then went and got Puck.  He got an idea as he helped Puck in and lead him to Dave's bedroom.  He put down on the bed with Dave and made sure house and his car was all locked up.  When he got back into Dave's room, he helped Puck and Dave out of their clothes until they were in their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing really didn't do these two justice: they were amazingly huge.  Arms, thighs, shoulders, chests, bellies, all of it BIG.  Sam stripped down to his boxers and snuggled between their beefy frames, resting his head on Dave's bloated belly and feeling Puck's against his back as he rolled onto his side, drifting to sleep happily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A ferocious noise woke the three of them up. Sam leapt up startled when he realized that he heard Puck laughing. <br>\r\n\"Relax, it's just Dave.\" They both looked over to see Dave blinking tiredly as he yawned loudly again, sounding like thunder. Sam blushed as Dave looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrr...sorry, just really tired,\" he said flopping down again. Puck smiled fondly at Dave and stood up causing Sam an intake of breath. Puck was still in just his (rather small) boxers and Sam was again struck by how beautiful the two were, despite the body contrasts. Puck was more muscularly defined whereas Dave was just massive and more like a bear with fur and everything. Sam was honored and excited his two friends had chosen him for his special task of helping them grow. Well, Puck technically did and Dave went along but Sam and Dave had become friends, especially after the events of the night before. Dave had really changed from the bully he had known back at McKinnley in the short time they had been at the same school. Now however, Dave was an awesome guy and one Sam admired which was good because it would have been bad to be attracted to a horrible person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck was yanking on an old pair of tight jeans of his that quickly became evident he had outgrown. Using words that normally would have made Sam's innocent ears burn if he hadn't been so amused by the scene, Puck hopped up and down, trying to yank up the pants and finding they did not close around his big belly. Giggling, Sam rummaged through Dave's closet for a pair of drawstring sweatpants and laid them out while Puck hopped around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might want to try these. They're Dave's so I'm sure they will fit and that he won't mind you bothering, I don't think\" Sam said, hoping the last part was true. Puck shrugged and took the proffered clothes and put the pants on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Puck said when Dave blinked sleepily and looked at them. \"Pants wouldn't fit so I'm borrowing yours.\" Dave nodded sleepily and closed his eyes again. <br>\r\n\"S'okay.\" <br>\r\n\"What was that about anyways?\" Sam asked confused now that the funny part was over. Why had Puck been upset?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love being big and getting bigger but I didn't expect to grow out of my favorite pants so fast which is both amazing and sad because me and those pants, we had good times. It was going to happen eventually but I thought I would have a little longer before them not fitting you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, if you say so.\" Puck grinned and the scowl on his face disappeared. <br>\r\n\"So Sam, what do you think about breakfast?\" Sam thought for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have breakfast later. First, we want to see where your two big bears progess is and it's best to do that on an empty stomach.\" Puck gave a playful frown before shrugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll need to wait for Dave to wake up. What do you want to do in the meantime?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" Sam said. Puck got a mischievious grin on his face. Laying back down on the bed he leaned on one arm and patted his belly seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here,\" Puck said smoothly and Sam swallowed hard. Puck smiled again. \"It's your job and I know you want to.\" Swallowing again, Sam didn't resist as he sat on the bed and started massaging Puck's belly. Humming with pleasure, Puck leaned back closing his eyes enjoying Sam's touch. It didn't take long for Dave to wake up after that and making his presence known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's my turn.\" With only a small cry of protest at the pleasant feeling being withdrawn, Puck was again smiling as Sam and Puck both massaged Dave. A few minutes later, Sam stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think it's time to measure where you guys are currently to see how much you've grown already and for future comparisons. Puck, you first. Dave, where's your scale?\" Dave pointed the way and Sam retrieved it from the large bathroom so they could all see the numbers. Taking out a journal and a camera, Sam got ready because he was going to be the best feeder partner he could be. After a few more preparations, Sam motioned for Puck to step on the digital scale (which could weigh up to a 1000 pounds). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"215,\" Puck said, both pleased and surprised. \"I was about 185 at the start of the year when we got weighed for football. Most of the weight gained is undoubtedly within the last few weeks.\" Puck got off the scale for Dave to get on which looked really small beneath his feet. Sam marveled at the claim it could even weigh up to a 1000 considering it almost looked like it should have been crushed beneath Dave's massive body. However it withstood fine and the number became clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, 302 lbs!\" Puck was excited. \"That's over 300 pounds!\" Dave raised his eyebrow and Sam wanted to palm himself. That was extremely self-obvious but Puck didn't seem to realize. Before it could get any more awkward, Dave interrutpted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the last time I weighed myself at the beginning of the year, also for football was...281 lbs,\" Dave said, blushing a little. He was really big now. Past the big three-oh and he didn't mean thirty. He could officially count himself as part of the huge club.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome,\" Puck said, heartily slapping congratulations to Dave. Had it been anyone else, the force would have probably clean knocked them over if not out, but Dave withstood it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, thanks..\" Dave said, suddenly shy. Over 300 pounds, that was a lot. He wondered when he had crossed the line from 290s to the 300s. Perhaps it might even have occured last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have a celebratory 300 meal,\" Puck said. \"For Dave clearing that special number.\" Sam nodded in agreement and Dave blushed again as both Sam and Puck put their hands on his massive gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now or later, what do you want special? Sam asked after writing their numbers down. <br>\r\n\"We should see how much you weigh,\" both Puck and Dave said and at their insistence, Sam got on. <br>\r\n\"168, woah, you're light\" Puck said as Dave wrote it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of us can be huge or be gifted.\" Sam didn't mention that was a few poinds heavier than he expected when he last weighed himself. \"But really, back to feeding. Do you feel like breakfast or waiting a bit for an huge brunch? It's your choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If you guys can wait a bit I'd be happy to make a SUPER huge brunch.\"  Sam said, asking his two huge friends.<br>\r\nPuck was about to say yes, but both his and Dave's guts growled loudly at the same time, demanding food.  Puck shrugged, \"Sorry, Sammy.  These guys are calling the shots and they're straving!\"<br>\r\nSam rubbed his chin for a sec, then got an idea, \"Gimme a sec!\"  Sam was gone for a couple of minutes, but came back with his arms full of treats, \"Knowing you guys, you can pack these away and still have room for a huge brunch.  Eat these while I get started!\"  Sam set the large bags of chips, boxes of twinkies and cupcakes, and cold cans of soda on Dave's bed before heading down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave and Puck both looked at each other, shrugged, and laid down on the bed; Puck tore open a bag of chips while Dave ripped open the box of twinkies, stuffing one into his mouth.  Dave turned on the TV, which was airing saturday morning cartoons, and they both watched, stuffing their faces with junk and washing it down with soda.  As they did, Dave's eyes wandered over to Puck's body, looking it over.  Puck was definitely the more muscular of the two; his arms were still very buff and defined, and his pecs were huge(though they had gotten bigger thanks to all his gaining), and his stomach was big and round, but very spherical at the same time.  It was soft and squishy, but not doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dave was done admiring his smaller buddy, his eyes went back to the cartoons on tv as he ate the last twinkie from the box of 24, tossing it aside and opening another box.  As he did, Puck(who had noticed Dave's admiring) did the same as he looked over his big bear of a friend.  While Puck was more muscular, Dave clearly had more body fat and was insanely thick.  His arms were muscular, but not defined, as they were thick and wide with fat.  His chest was like Puck's, huge, only they were much fuller looking from his extra weight.  Dave's belly, which was currently being stuffed with twinkies, was much different from Puck's - it was obviously bigger, but while Puck had more of a ball shape to his, Dave's was very fleshy and doughy, and jiggled with every step Dave would take.  It hung over his waistline a little(a spot that was Dave's favorite to be rubbed), but the rest of Dave's body wasn't as doughy.  He was huge and thick with both muscle and fat - truly a big, powerful bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Puck was done, he also returned to devouring the bag of chips he had and laughing at the cartoon.  Dave and Puck ate slowly for a good hour and a half, wanting their appetizer to last and laughing at the different shows that were on, when Same came in, \"How are my two big guys doing?\"  He said, walking over to the sweatpants and boxer clad men, \"Not too full?\"  <br>\r\nDave lifted his arms off of his belly, \"Feel for yourself?  It's not even hard yet.\"  Sam put his hands on Dave's fleshy, hairy guy, poking and prodding at it, \"You're right, it's still soft.  What about you, Puck?\"  Sam said, laying his body across Dave's soft stomach and checking Puck's for fullness, \"Neither of you are full?  Awesome, because I made a LOT of food.  Let's have brunch in bed.\"  Sam said as he left the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave and Puck sat up, Dave's belly sitting on his lap slightly, and Sam walked in with brunch - a huge tray of home made fried chicken and MASSIVE mixing bowl of mashed potatoes.  He set both on the bed and settled between Dave and Puck's big bodies, \"Eat up!\"  He said, enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

Dave took one and did the same while Sam looked on admiringly. He loved being with Puck and Dave and being able to help them. Puck and Dave seemed to be in a competition eying one another as they ate their chickens and Sam decided to use that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I wonder who could eat more right now? It would be really interesting to find out. What do you think?\" <br>\r\n\"I think,\" Puck said between a mouthful of chicken, \"that that's a pretty good idea. What say you Dave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that'll work. See how much you progressed Puckerman.\" They remained mostly quiet after that as they quickly ate chicken and washing it down with even more soda and occasional manly belches. Sam helped by either getting them more chicken or quick rubs of their big bellies and words of encouragement. Eventually the chicken was gone, the result being mainly equal in number of pieces eaten which was both a a surprise to Dave and Puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've...urrrpp, really improved,\" Dave said in shock. Puck sat their in shock for a moment as well.<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe it.\" Puck patted his rounded gut and let out another belch. \"Uuuuurrrrpp, man that chicken was good. Thanks so much Sam.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, I just like being able to help.\" Sam shrugged and placed his hand on Puck's belly, rubbing it which made Puck sigh in relaxation. Dave shifted.<br>\r\n\"My turn,\" Dave said stiffly and Sam grinned and moved over to him rubbing Dave's belly as well. <br>\r\n\"Who is your favorite anyhow?\" Dave asked and Sam shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I like both you guys but in this case I do think Puck will probably win.\" Dave thought for a moment and then nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. Puck especially loves Mashed Potatoes, way more than me. I won't make it easy for him though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck had already started on the mashed potatoes, making noises and comments of appreciation on their creaminess as he shoveled them down like he had only just started eating and not just filled up on fried chicken. Dave gave a look to Sam and nodded as he got a spoon as well and started eating from the same bowl eating slower as Dave was beginning to finally feel full. He probably shouldn't have started with eating so many of those sweet cream-filled twinkies and soda but Dave did have a bit of a sweet tooth. Not to mention, mashed potatoes ranked on the list of Puck's favorite foods along with pancakes, chocolate, etc. When it came to his favorites, Puck could be really obsessed as he was with those potatoes and twitched everytime Dave dug his spoon in, causing him to eat faster. Eventually the spoons scraped the bottom and Puck started licking the sides to clear up every last spot. Dave sat back and both he and Sam watched Puck clean out the bowl. When the last spot was cleaned, Puck blinked his eyes looking around for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...UUUUUUURRRRRRPPPP...no more?\" Sam leaned over and poked Puck's solidly bloated stomach. <br>\r\n\"Nope. I can't believe you ate all that. You actually beat Dave.\" Puck groaned and burped again, struggling.<br>\r\n\"H-here that? I...ugh-urrrrrpppppp, won.\" Dave was disappointed for a moment before he grinned. <br>\r\n\"That's great Puck, you're the man.\" Puck smiled at that briefly before his face started to change.<br>\r\n\"Sam, better take care of him before he blows chunks on my bed,\" Dave said as he scooched a bit for Sam to have roon. </span></div></div>",

You're much better at belly rubs than I am.\"  Sam said as he got up, taking the dishes with him, and leaving the room.<br>\r\nDave looked over at Puck, \"You heard him, Davey.  Get to it.\"  Puck said, putting his arms behind his head and closing his eyes.  Dave smiled and place his two gigantic bear paws on Puck's stomach, rubbing and soothing it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Puck and Dave sat on the bed in silence as Dave rubbed Puck's growing belly, a smile on their faces, \"This is nice, huh?\" Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  It is.\"  Puck said, scratching his chest.  Almost twenty minutes went by with neither of them saying anything, until Puck broke the silence, \"It's great having Sam here to cook for us, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah!  He does all the cooking and you and can focus just gaining as much muscle and fat as we want!\"  Dave said, a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I mean, his cooking is good, but nowhere as good as yours.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!  You're food is like, orgasmic!  Some of the best I've ever eaten!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks..\"  Dave said, blushing.  He looked down at Puck, his face turning a darker shade of red as he stared at his eyes.<br>\r\nPuck chuckled, \"Why are you so red?\"<br>\r\nDave swallowed, \"Uh...  It's nothing...  Okay, that's a lie.  Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, Puck.  I uh....  I like you.\"<br>\r\n\"I like you too!\"  Puck said, not realizing what Dave meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean..  I think you're really hot...\"  Dave said, avoiding Puck's face.<br>\r\n\"Oh... OH.\"  Dave said, realizing what he meant, \"Well...  I think you're hot too.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I mean, you're the definition of manly!  Huge muscles, a hairy body, that massive gut!\"<br>\r\nDave scratched the back of his thick neck, \"You mean it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Puck said, \"I honestly think I've always been kind of attracted to guys like you.  I just didn't realize it until now....\"<br>\r\nDave smiled, \"So, uh...  do you wanna go out?\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"I'd like that!\"  Puck would have gone in for a kiss, but he was still so stuffed that he simply laid there as Dave rubbed his swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave, who was equally as full, snuggled up next to his new big boyfriend and laid down, falling asleep with him, their huge bellies pressed together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was absence of Dave's thundering snores that woke Puck up. Yawning, he stretched and got out of bed, feeling totally refreshed. Scratching his belly, Puck bent down to put on some tighter jeans and a comfortably snug tanktop that emphasized his big arms, broad chest, and thick belly. He was definitely even more of a manly hot stud and he hadn't been horrible to look at before. Desirable and attractive, the Puckasaurus had regained his swagger and confidence that had been lacking for what seemed like a long time. With pride in his strut, he went to go find his buddies Sam and Dave. It didn't take long to find them as Sam and Dave were playing a game of Poker which Dave clearly wasn't very good at. Puck walked up to the table and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up dudes?\" Sam shrugged as he revealed the next few cards from the stack. <br>\r\n\"Not much, just crushing Dave at Poker while dinner for the three of us is cooking.\" Puck sniffed the air appreciatively. <br>\r\n\"Smells good, what we having?\" Dave groaned again as Sammy unveiled a triplet as well as a pair. <br>\r\n\"Damn it, not again,\" Dave groaned as he handed over the pile of chips. \"You have to be cheating.\" <br>\r\n\"Nope, I just seem to be getting really good hands. Too bad it isn't real money we're playing with right now.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd be raking it in,\" Dave griped. \"Can't freaking believe it, you won every round except for like one.\" <br>\r\n\"Instead I'm making you guys dinner. Almost unfair really.\" Sam turned and eyed Puck's belly and grinned. \"Almost unfair, but not really.\"<br>\r\n\"But what are we having?\" Puck asked again. \"It smells really good.\"<br>\r\n\"Potroast,\" Sam said. \"We're haing potroast. Just going to let it stew for another hour or so before it's ready.\"<br>\r\n\"When did you start making it?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"When you guys were asleep, a couple of hours ago.\"<br>\r\n\"It cooks really slowly.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me 'bout it,\" Sam said. \"Anyways, want to play?\" Puck grinned and nodded as he sat down and Dave leaned back to watch. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I do but trust me, you won't like it.\" They played a few rounds and true to Puck's prediction, Sam's luck flip-flopped and he was losing. <br>\r\n\"Woah, you're really good,\" Sam said after Puck scooped him again. \"How do you keep doing that?\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I've learned how to count cards, comes in handy when playing.\" Sam huffed as he shuffled the cards back in. <br>\r\n\"Cheater, I don't want to play anymore.\" <br>\r\n\"It's not cheating really since it requires a fair bit of concentration and memory.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever, I have to go check on the Pot Roast, it might be ready soon anyways.\" Sam left through the doorway to the kitchen and Puck turned to see Dave smiling at him. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Puck asked confused. <br>\r\n\"You're really something you know that?\" <br>\r\n\"I am going to assume that's a good thing.\" <br>\r\n\"Trust me, it is. You're just incredible.\" The look of admiration in Dave's eyes caused Puck to flush a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thank you. I...oh forget it. We're together or something now so I can do this.\" Grabbing Dave's face, Puck leaned in and kissed him briefly. Dave stood there stunned for a brief moment before wrapping his arms around Puck and pulling him against him as he roughly gnashed teeth on Puck's lip. Sam chose that moment right there to walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys it's time for...woah!\" Sam watched with rapt attention as Puck and Dave continued to kiss roughly. \"Wow, I leave for less than a minute...\" he mumbled under his breath, He continued to stand there waiting while Puck and Dave continued their intense make out session. Finally just as Sam was beginning to wonder if he should leave to give the pair privacy, they slow down and reobserve their surroundings. Dave blushed when he saw Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see-?\" Dave started and Sam nodded. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Right in front of me the whole time.\" Dave turned an even more interesting shade of red while Puck laughed. <br>\r\n\"So what did you think?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Think about what?\" Sam wasn't sure what Puck was referring to.<br>\r\n\"Me and Dave.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay. I can not say it's much of a surprise at this point. So when?\" <br>\r\n\"Just today actually.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool, that's cool,\" Sam said again. \"Don't mind at all. Anyways, I just wanted to tell you dinner is ready.\" <br>\r\n\"Is it? Let's get to it,\" Dave said excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck nodded. \"This baby demands it.\" Puck pats his stomach and Dave laughed when it growled. He was still laughing when his belly growled as well causing Puck to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get started if your stomachs are demanding food,\" Sam said as he led them into the kitchen. </span></div></div>",

Thats gotta be like, like, forever away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave chuckled at his bulky boyfriend, \"It's okay, Puck - er.. baby.  We can wait an hour.\"  Dave scratched at his cheek, it was gonna take a while to get used to this whole relationship thing with Puck.  Dave placed his massive hand on Puck's ever growing belly and rubbed it, \"It's not like waiting an hour will make you lose this sexy thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, \"You two won't have to wait, actually!\"  Sam walked back into the kitchen and returned with two of the biggest cakes Dave and Puck had ever seen in their lives.  Each cake had three layers and they were both at least the size of large pizzas.  Sam set them down next to the constantly-growing couple, \"I went out and bought these while you guys slept.  Double chocolate fudge!  Nobody can resist these bad boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck and Dave's faces lite up at the sight of these two massive cakes.  Without saying a word, Puck and Dave each grabbed the cake in front of them and instantly went to work, devouring the cakes.  Sam was about to go and get forks for them, but he quickly realized that these two were having much more fun using their hands. Dave and Puck groaned happily as they shoveled fistfuls of cake into their mouths, doing their best not to spill any of it.  Thirthy minutes went by and the two were almost half way through the thick, chocolatey cakes.  While showed no signs of slowing, Puck was beginning to slow down, though he pushed on, determined to finish the cake and to keep up with his big bellied-boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

That doesn't mean the Puckster was going to give up of course since he was a bit competitive, and he wanted to prove to Dave and himself that he was a big eater as well, but man was he full. It had been a shock to actually win at lunch earlier but that was different and not going to be applicable here. Dave recovered faster from binges and this was one rich chocolate cake. As his chewing slowed, the thick gooey fudge stuck to the top of his mouth and throat and made the going even slower as his brain was beginning to send the full signal. The taste was still good but he was beginning to feel sick of it to his stomach. Darn, and there was only a little bit left to go too. Sam who was noticing Puck's struggle, came over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" Sam asked and Puck groaned. <br>\r\n\"Cake...so good...but so filling.\" Puck shuddered and burped loudly, trying to keep from throwing up or falling unconscious. Sam quickly rushed into the kitchen and came back with a glass of milk. Supporting the moaning Puck, he helped him drink it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that better?\" Sam asked and Puck made a sound. <br>\r\n\"Ugh, not really but a little now that my throat's clear. I'm so freaking full.\" Sam looked down at Puck's plate. <br>\r\n\"Are you serious? You're so close to finishing, you might as well man.\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"No way, I'm too full,\" he groaned. \"Uuuuuuurrrrrrpppp.\" He moaned as another belch rumbled through. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to help you,\" Sam said. Ignoring the withering death glare Puck sent him, Sam scooped up some cake and brought it near Puck's face. <br>\r\n\"Open up, you're going to finish this cake whether you like it or not.\" <br>\r\n\"Ugh, why?\" Puck moaned as he rubbed at his stomach.<br>\r\n\"That's what you guys brought me on for, to help keep you eating until you no longer could,\" Sam said smirking.<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I've reached that stage already though,\" Puck groaned again. Sam shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Nah, just a barrier. I know you could at least finish this cake before really being done.\" <br>\r\n\"You...fucking...\"Puck started to say before Sam stuffed chocolate in his mouth. Puck was forced to swallow as the stuff was sticky and cloggy in the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" He was interrupted again with more chocolate. It only took a third time to convince him to not bother saying anything but continue to shoot laser death glares from his eyes at Sam although Sam seemed immune. He also whined and tried to not throw up as bit by bit, the remaining cake disappeared. After the last few crumbs were gone, Sam leaned up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. How was that?\" Another massive rumble and Puck gave a record-breaking burp for him. <br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP.....\" It went on for quite a while that even Dave looked over in awe. When it was over Puck started shouting quite a number of curses. Sam just walked over and started massaging Puck's way too over-stuffed and full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrrppp...fuck that's amazing...don't you dare stop or I'll seriously fucking kill you...\" Puck moaned as he added his hands, frantically trying to restore equilibrium. Sam just grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So again, how was it?\" Puck flipped him the bird for a brief moment before returning. Dave who was finishing his cake, came over. <br>\r\n\"Puck baby, you okay?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"Will...will be...eventually. If I don't murder Sam in the meantime.\" Puck complained.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's going to be fine later,\" Sam said way too cheerfully. \"I see you've finished.\"<br>\r\n\"Good stuff,\" Dave said patting his belly.<br>\r\n\"I've still got Pot Roast which should be done about now,\" Sam said. Puck moaned loudly.<br>\r\n\"No, please no!\"<br>\r\n\"Not for you, although it is a bit disappointing since I've spent so long making it, but for Dave, if he's still hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"I could eat some,\" Dave said. \"Still got room in this big old belly of mine.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome, you're going to love it,\" Sam said. \"Puck, I'll be back for you shortly once I take care of Dave.\"</span></div></div>",

I feel like I'm gonna throw up.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, \"Really?  I thought a big, tough guy like you could handle a measly little cake like that.\"<br>\r\nPuck took a deep breath, \"I tried, babe, but I'm not you.  I just don't have the capacity for something that big yet.\"<br>\r\nDave smiled and he leaned down as gave Puck's bloated belly a kiss, \"Just try and relax, okay?  I'll come back to rub your belly once I finish dinner, okay?\"<br>\r\nPuck nodded, \"Uuuugh... Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Sam walked in carrying Dave's plate and Dave let out a low, impressed whistle.  Instead of a regular plate, Sam had brought Dave's mashed potatoes and pot roast in on a giant 27X20 inch steel serving tray, \"Dinner is served.\"<br>\r\nDave rubbed his belly eagerly, \"How much is there?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n\"All of it.\" Sam said.<br>\r\nDave was suprised, \"ALL of it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"  Sam said,  \"Since Puck is too full to eat any of it, and I hate having leftovers, I thought you could just eat it all.  You've got the biggest appetite of any man I've ever met, Dave!\"<br>\r\nDave grinned, \"You're just flattering me.  I'll do my best!\"  Dave sat down at the table, his belly folding over onto his lap.  Sam put the plate in front of him, along with a fork and a two liter of soda, and without a second though, Dave began shoveling food into his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed by and Dave hadn't said a word the entire time; he was to busy gorging.  It shouldn't have been possible for Dave to eat as much as he did, since he had just devoured that entire cake, but he couldn't stop himself from stuffing his face with pot roast and potatoes.  Sam had made enough food for 5 people and Dave had eaten every single bite.  He dropped his fork on the serving tray and groaned, leaning back.  His stomach was just as distended and bloated as Puck's was and the two could barely move.  Sam smiled, proud of his work, and he slowly helped Puck and Dave up one at a time and lead them to the bedroom for the night.  Once both were in bed, he stripped them down to their boxers (he undressed as well) and got between the two bloated bears, alternating between bellies to rub until they both fell asleep.  Sam pulled the covers over all three of them and happily fell asleep between their warm, food filled guts.</span></div></div>",

Dave mumbled a bit and turned before continuing his chainsaw snoring. Sam felt a bit tired having had to listen to the racket and realizing he was in bed with two beautiful and very, very big men kept him awake for a long time. Getting up, Sam sleepily shuffled out of bed and got out clothes for the day. Turning back to look at them, Sam was still somewhat surprised that the bed had managed to hold all three of them considering they took up most of it. It certainly had been a tight squeeze but damn it had been worth it, even if he was so dead tired. Feeling the completely stuffed solid flesh on either side was...well, heaven really. Also, Puck and Dave were really cute all snuggled together and even holding hands while fast asleep. Puck had been holding onto Sam when he woke up as well and that had been a bit of a struggle to get out of at first but he finally made it. Sam headed into the bathroom to wake up and wash the sleep out with a nice hot shower trying to not think of the two in his bed...okay, he better make it cold. Standing there shivering, Sam stumbled out, getting dressed. One of them had to get the day started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepy heads,\" came Sam's voice into Puck's head. \"Or should I say afternoon? You've guys been asleep for a while and I was going to wake you up but honestly I have nothing planned and I doubt you too do and you were pretty tired so I thought it best to let you guys rest for a while.\" Puck grunted as he pulled himself up, his brain still somewhat asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sam...what time is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Noon time and although I don't mind you guys sleeping in my bed, I still think you should get up for some part of it. Dave is still asleep and I can't wake him.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh that...that's easy.\" Puck reached over and felt under Dave's belly. <br>\r\n\"There's a certain spot here that's really ticklish to him for some reason. If all methods of waking him up fail, this one works best.\" Puck started tickling and after a few moments Dave started twitching and then laughing as he came awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, please stop it, I really shouldn't have told you about this should I?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, not really. But it's cool.\" Puck leaned back against the pillow and yawned. \"Man I'm tired.\" Dave chuckled a bit. <br>\r\n\"You're almost lazier than I am now.\" Puck scoffed at that. <br>\r\n\"Please, as if. I'm just taking a break from responsibility for a bit not to mention last night...wow. Just...wow.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping that's a compliment,\" Sam said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not sure whether I should thank you or skin you alive you sadist.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment then.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am so getting you later.\"<br>\r\n\"You won't catch me. You couldn't even catch me when you had a 4% bodyfat or whatever and now you're...a lot higher.\" Sam's eyes traveled down Puck's belly. Puck followed him and grinned as he patted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's pretty sexy and manly. Even my mom is into it, but not in that sense.\" Puck grimaced at the thought. \"But yeah, she's kind of proud, it's almost scary.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? I did not know that,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I'm finally settling down with someone or something, I don't know. Blah blah growing up, responsibility, a bit disappointed that she won't have any Jewish grandchildren but she's happy that I've found someone after Beth when I nearly...anyways yada yada I'm becoming a man since you aren't really a man until you get a few extra pounds and I finally take extra at dinner.\" Puck rubs it thoughtfully. \"Weirdly enough it gets her off my case which is a rather unexpected pro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say. You are a stud,\" Sam said sitting on the bed and crawling over as he ran his hands over it.<br>\r\n\"Don't forget modest,\" Puck said smirking as he flexed his arms and Sam smirked back. <br>\r\n\"Modest too. How could I forget?\" <br>\r\n\"So does your mom know we're dating?\" Dave asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Well since it only became official,\" Puck glanced at Dave, \"I don't believe so but I'm pretty sure she suspects it. Women have a way of knowing.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not to mention you make it really obvious when you're interested in someone,\" Sam said. \"You're not exactly the most subtle, like at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I believe in being straightforward and upfront which is better than all the games and cheating that went and probably still go on.\" Sam decided not to mention that Puck was lying about being honest in everything since he knew a bunch of times when Puck wasn't but Puck was right about not cheating and playing games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're being honest here, how do you feel about threesomes?\" Sam asked casually. Getting directly to the point was the best tact to take with Puck. Puck's smile widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Threesomes, definitely awesome. I have no qualm there. Want some tips?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, probably later. How would you and Dave feel if you expanded your lovenest a bit?\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind, what bout you Dave?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"You, me, Sammy boy having fun times.\" Dave looked blank and only understood it when Puck started miming which caused him to blush.<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...if he wants, I guess. He does have pretty kissable lips and can cook.\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, cooking is important.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you've got no problem.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess we don't.\"<br>\r\n\"Good then.\" </span></div></div>",

Or do we want to try the three of us actually dating?  Like, all three of us our each others boyfriends?\u201d<br>\r\nSam scratched his chin, \u201cHmmm\u2026  I wouldn\u2019t mind having two boyfriends.  What about you, Dave?\u201d<br>\r\nDave blushed and scratched his head, \u201cWell\u2026 Whatever you want, Puck.\u201d He said.  He didn\u2019t really care if Sam was his boyfriend or not, but if Puck wanted this than he\u2019d be happy to call Sam his boyfriend as well.<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \u201cWell, than I guess I\u2019ve got two boyfriends now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, grinning at the fact that he was in two relationships with such big men, eagerly stood up, grabbing Puck\u2019s wrist as he did.  Once they were both on their feet, Sam turned to Dave, \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m so happy about this is that now I don\u2019t have to hold back when I admire you two.\u201d<br>\r\nDave chuckled deeply, \u201cYou were holding back on us?\u201d<br>\r\nSam smirked, \u201cI was, but now I get to really admire you both.\u201d  Sam placed his hands on Puck\u2019s large, firm pecs and squeezed them, making Puck grin, \u201cI really like how, even though you\u2019ve put on so much weight, you\u2019re still as big and muscular as before.\u201d Sam said.<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Puck said, \u201cI\u2019m even more muscular.\u201d  Puck flexed his huge arms and Sam grinned, squeezing them as well.<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are.\u201d  Sam said, his hands trailing back down Puck\u2019s muscular torso before getting to his much bigger belly, \u201cI always thought your abs were sexy, Puck, but this gut you\u2019ve developed is even sexier.\u201d  He said, kissing it before giving it a smack, watching it slightly jiggle.<br>\r\n Puck smirked, \u201cThat\u2019s not the only place my weight has gone to.\u201d  Puck turned around and grabbed the waistband of his boxers, pulling them down over his much larger ass.  It was still strong and muscular, but it was much rounder and plumper than before.  <br>\r\nSam got down on his knees and squeezed it happily, \u201cBig and round all over.  It\u2019s a really sexy look for you, Puck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam was down on his knees, happily admiring and playing with Puck\u2019s fat ass, he felt Dave\u2019s massive body walk up behind him, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d  Dave asked, a little sheepishly.<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026 How could I forget about my new big bear?\u201d  Sam said, standing up and placing his hands on Dave\u2019s pecs, squeezing them, \u201cYou and Puck have such different bodies, Dave.  It\u2019s really sexy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Dave asked, feeling a little bit more at ease with Sam\u2019s groping.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!  Puck\u2019s body almost all muscle with a sexy gut and a fat ass, but you\u2019re a big boy, Davey.  You\u2019re pecs are massive but they\u2019re so much softer and rounder than Puck\u2019s.\u201d  Sam\u2019s hands went to Dave\u2019s gigantic biceps, \u201cSame with your arms.  They\u2019re so round and soft, but so strong with muscle.\u201d <br>\r\nDave grinned; flexing his huge biceps hat bulged with both muscle and fat.  Sam gave them a few loving squeezes before his hands trailed down to Dave\u2019s belly, \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget this little guy.\u201d  He said, playfully.  Sam placed his hand on the bottom of Dave\u2019s belly, where it hung over his waist and boxers, and happily jiggled it, sending a few ripples across Dave\u2019s big, furry belly.  He got on his knees; like he did for Puck, and he gave Dave\u2019s belly a kiss, \u201cMmmmm\u2026 so big and meaty.  I just want to make it bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of bigger,\u201d Puck said, grabbing Dave\u2019s huge shoulders and turning him around, placing Sam right in front of Dave\u2019s massive ass.  Puck didn\u2019t hesitate to pull his boxers down over it, revealing it to Sam, \u201cCheck THIS out.  Is this not the FATTEST ass you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPuck, stop\u2026  You\u2019re making me blush\u2026\u201d  Dave said, his face bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s right.\u201d  Sam said, jiggling both of Dave\u2019s gigantic butt cheeks.  Dave\u2019s butt was twice the size of Puck\u2019s but it wasn\u2019t nearly as muscular.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got such a huge, sexy, gigantic ass, Dave.\u201d  Sam said, giving it one small smack and watching it jiggle before standing up and maneuvering his two boys so both of their bellies were facing him.  He happily rubbed both; \u201cI can\u2019t wait to make you two as muscular and fat as you want.\u201d  All three guys laughed before Sam felt Puck\u2019s hand on his abs, \u201cWhat about you?  Feel like adding a few pounds?  I think you\u2019d look amazingly sexy with a big, fat gut.\u201d  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled, \u201cI bet I would, but I don\u2019t think so.  I like being the \u201cskinny\u201d guy.\u201d  Sam lowered his hands down to both of his boyfriend\u2019s huge asses and squeezed both of them, \u201cSo\u2026 How about we celebrate out new relationships with a little bed time?\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Dave and Puck knew they were about to have an amazing night with their new boyfriend, and all three quickly hurried to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Sam, Puck, and Dave were lying in bed, all three of them sweaty and naked.  Sam eagerly got out of bed and smiled back at them, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go shower again.  Once the two of you are cleaned up and dressed, I\u2019ll make you both the biggest breakfasts you\u2019ve ever.\u201d  Sam grabbed a clean and headed to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck looked at Dave and grinned, \u201cSo\u2026 best sex ever or best sex EVER?\u201d<br>\r\nDave smiled, \u201cDefinitely best sex EVER.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam was making a good country breakfast when the doorbell rang. Wondering who that could be since Puck didn't tell him he was expecting anyone, Sam opened the door and blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi. Can I help you?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Is this the Puckerman place?\" Sam looked at the guy who was a total stranger. <br>\r\n\"Um, do I know you?\" <br>\r\n\"Is this or is this not the Puckerman house?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah it is.\" Sam was startled when the guy pushed him aside and came in sitting down at the table. <br>\r\n\"Smells good. Whatcha making?\" The stranger Sam had never seen before asked.<br>\r\n\"Um breakfast ham and eggs but what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Sitting,\" the guy replied smartly. Sam rubbed his head not wanting to deal with a smartass like this. <br>\r\n\"Yes. But in who's house?\" <br>\r\n\"Apparently mine for the next year or whenever.\" <br>\r\n\"Excuse me? I think you're confused-\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is the right place. I'm going to be living here for the next year or so with my older brother Noah Puckerman.\" <br>\r\n\"Puck has a brother?\" Sam asked confused. \"How come he never said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure if he knows about me, can't say I know much about him other than his name. My mom just decided to drop me off here for a bit while she and my new step-dad or whatever get settled and thought I should get to know my own half-brother. How she came to the conclusion that dropping me off with a total stranger, even if they are related, for so long is a good idea I don't know but supposedly Mrs. Puckerman knows and has agreed to letting me stay at her place.\" Puck came down the stairs in just boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells good Sam.\" Puck said grinning, not noticing the new addition sitting at the table. <br>\r\n\"Thanks. Puck, we've got a visitor.\" Puck blinked and Sam pointed at the table where he was sitting. <br>\r\n\"Oh, hi. Uh...what are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n\"Are you Noah?\" the guy asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, who's asking?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Jake. I'm your brother and I'm going to be living here.\" There was silence for a few moments. Puck stared a few moments blankly before laughing.<br>\r\n\"Hah! You almost had me going there! No really, who are you?\" The guy stared back solemnly.<br>\r\n\"I told you. I'm Jake, your brother, half-brother actually, and am going to be living here for a bit while my mom and new step-dad get things settled and whatever.\" Puck look stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay...its a bit much even if I shouldn't be surprised there are others running around. After all, it's dad we're talking about.\" Both he and Jake made a similar disgusted face and Puck smirked. \"What do you know, you are my brother. Dad sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The suckiest,\" Jake said grinning as he and Puck high-fived. \"I must admit, you're not what I expected.\"<br>\r\n\"What were you expecting?\" Puck asked curiously. Jake thought for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Don't know really, just you know I guess kind of like him banging chicks all the time or whatever.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh I did. Some fun times but I'm done with that shit. Some women, they just mess you up.\" Jake raised his eye curiously.<br>\r\n\"You bat for others now-hope you don't mind me asking but I am curious and won't judge you but-do you?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, got two boyfriends.\" Jake whistled. <br>\r\n\"Kinky. I'm in between at the moment since my last girlfriend broke up with me accusing me of cheating on her with another.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Not intentionally, I didn't really know what I was doing at the time. In fact I thought it was her since they strangely looked sort of similar despite not being related.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow. So she didn't believe you?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope. It probably also didn't help that I was known as a player which I admit I had been.\"<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, one of the few things I did know was your legendary exploits. It made my mom nervous a bit but was eventually convinced that it was safe to come here.\" <br>\r\n\"That must have been weird.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was worried at first but you're pretty alright, nothing at all like dad.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good. I would hate for you to think me anything like that bastard.\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't even know I was coming, why would my opinion have mattered?\"<br>\r\n\"Just cause. Anyhow, want anything to eat? Sam's making breakfast if you haven't had any yet or whatever.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh sure. Smells good and I haven't had anything to eat yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Don'tt worry, that won't be a problem around here,\" Puck said as he chuckled patting his belly. <br>\r\n\"I admit that was one thing that I didn't expect. That you would be, you know, so big.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks. No but really, you're right. I didn't have this then.\"<br>\r\n\"So you deliberately?\" Puck noticed that Jake was sounding both surprised and pleased...<br>\r\n\"It was both for me and as a deterrent for the more shallow girls when I got tired of that. Not to mention, it just feels good.\" <br>\r\n\"That's interesting. So you live with both your boyfriends?\" <br>\r\n\"Not quite but essentially since they could come over whenever since Mom has to work a lot. You'll meet her at some point I think.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she's lovely.\"<br>\r\n\"She is. She's a good mom.\" Puck grinned when a plate filled with ham and eggs was dropped down. \"My friends really do know how to cook. You'll meet Dave later.\"<br>\r\n\"So, you want any?\" Sam asked and Jake shrugged. \"Sure, that would be great.\" Sam grinned as he dropped a huge plate in front of him as well.<br>\r\n\"You're going to fit quite well in soon enough.\"</span></div></div>",

These were the BEST eggs he'd ever eaten!  Instead of talking with Sam and Puck, Jake spent the few minutes stuffing himself with eggs.  Puck chuckled, \"Looks like he's got the famous Puckerman appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the appetite you developed, babe?\"  Same said, smiling as he set a gigantic plate of biscuits and gravy in front of Jake.<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Sure did!\"  Puck leaned back in his seat, his hand behind his head and his other on top of his big stomach, and watched as his baby brother stuffed himself.  As soon as Jake finished the eggs, he grabbed the biscuits and gravy and started stuffing them down as well.  Puck watched, interested by what he saw.  For being related to him, Jake was a lot smaller than he was; he wasn't nearly as muscular and he sure didn't have the extra chunk that was now spread across his entire body.  Puck grinned as he stood up and walked over to Sam, wrapping his arms around his thin boyfriend's waist and leaning into his ear, \"Hey, Sammy?\"<br>\r\nSam's face turned red at the feeling of Puck's strong arms and soft belly against him, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"You love me, right?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.  What is it?\"  Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking.  My baby bro looks a little thin, doesn't he?  I think you and I should help him beef up some.  I know you'd love another man around to watch grow.\"<br>\r\nSam's face turned even redder at the thought of his massive Dave and TWO huge Puckermans, \"I'm in.\"  Sam quickly sprinkled some of the weight gain powder onto the next plate of biscuits and gravy and Puck grinned, taking the plate and giving it to Jake himself.  The second the plate was set down, Jake grabbed it and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Puck spent the next hour or so getting to know Jake, or at least, what they could get out of him when they weren't encouraging him to eat more and more.  They found out he shared a lot of similar interests as them; he loved video games, action movies, basketball, and football.  It took some working over but they were able to find out that Jake also enjoyed singing and performing, and that he even took ballet lessons.<br>\r\n\"Ballet?  Really?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jake replied, \"Ballet is awesome.  I've been taking it for years and I'm really good.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show us some moves?\"  Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...  I would but I think I ate too much.\"  Jake said, rubbing his bloated belly.  Sam and Puck had fed Jake so much weight gain powder that he ended up shoveling down 20 plates of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grinned, \"It's cool, dude.\"  Just them, Puck's belly growled in need of food, \"Oops...  Sorry, Puck.  I fed Jake here everything I made for breakfast.\"<br>\r\nPuck shrugged, \"It's cool.  We can just order a couple dozen pizzas for Dave and I.\"</span></div></div>",

Jake Puckerman meet Dave Karofsky my other boyfriend, Dave, meet my half-brother Jake Puckerman. I just met him today but he is my brother and he is going to be staying with us.\" Jake let out a huge belch then, turning red as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP.\" They all stared for a few seconds before Dave, Sam, and Puck started laughing while Jake sat there confused and still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Dave said glancing over. \"I can see the resemblance now that you mention it.\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Jake said still blushing which made them laugh harder.<br>\r\n\"Oh man I'm sorry but your face right now, it's too much,\" Puck said gasping in between laughs. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well fuck you guys,\" Jake said miffed. Puck stopped laughing. <br>\r\n\"Jake, manners!\" Sam raised his eyebrows behind him.<br>\r\n\"Puck, you're going to chide him on manners? I remember you cussing up a storm just a few days ago in fact using some of the most disturbing connotations I've ever heard.\" Puck rolled his eyes. \"Got to be a role model now, guide my younger brother with my wisdom.\" Jake and Sam both snorted in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Uh I can still hear you and psh you're only older by about two or three years.\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about breakfast...any left?\" Dave asked looking around hopefully. <br>\r\n\"Nope, Jake ate it all.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Two voices exlaimed, both surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam said shrugging. \"Didn't expect another guest coming over this morning.\"<br>\r\n\"But all of it...\" Dave moaned.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll order pizza,\" Sam said going to the phone. \"It's 11 now which is close enough to lunch anyways after your long sleep-in and shower.\" <br>\r\n\"But I heard you were making eggs and stuff....dang it,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation at all, they were delicious,\" Jake offered.<br>\r\n\"I can tell,\" Dave said looking at Jake's bloated stomach. Jake's shirt was pushed up by the straining confines of his packed belly. Jake looked down and shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Man I don't know what came over me,\" he said regretfully. Puck moved to Dave and tapped him. <br>\r\n\"Hey can we talk in private?\" he asked and Dave nodded. Puck looked back at Jake. <br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon, just got to talk to Dave for a few minutes kay?\"<br>\r\n\"Kay,\" Jake said looking around. Puck and Dave moved to the other room. <br>\r\n\"Hey, wanna see my impressions?\" was the last audible thing before Dave and Puck crossed into the living room and shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah,\" Puck said awkwardly. \"Again like I said, Jake is going to be staying with us for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't mind, I was just a little surprised is all,\" Dave said. \"Although how long is that?\"<br>\r\n\"Possibly throught the school year,\" Puck said rubbing his Mohawk.<br>\r\n\"Ah, wow and your mom doesn't mind?\"<br>\r\n\"No, she wants to meet her other sort-of son and stuff, or something. Not quite sure what her reasons are.\"<br>\r\n\"You probably should make sure she isn't going to whack him.\"<br>\r\n\"Dave my mom wouldn't do that.\" Puck said, alarmed.<br>\r\n\"I know but you should make sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Well whatever. I just wanted to apologize about breakfast since me and Sam gave it all to Jake.\" Dave's stomach let out a roar of hunger at the mention of food. Puck smirked and leaned down and kissed it. \"So hot babe,\" then Puck giggled. Dave raised his eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Just thinking back before all this started. Voluntairily being with not just one guy but two. Well not that part but being guys and actually being happy.\"<br>\r\n\"You deserve to be.\" Puck's eyes glistened. <br>\r\n\"That...that is...\" Puck launched himself at Dave taking him down in Dave's surpise as he landed kisses on him. The door opened for a moment and Sam came in seeing. <br>\r\n\"Dang what did I miss?\" he asked in one of his impression's voice. He knelt down next to them. \"Don't mind if I join?\" Puck scooted over a little and gave Sam room to take Dave's other side. Puck returned to massaging Dave's massive pecs, Sam working on the stomach. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys, whatcha doing?\" Jake called and they froze as reality set back in. Dave's stomach gurgled loudly again as did Puck's.<br>\r\n\"Well that's a mood ruiner,\" Puck joked looking disappointed. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dave said possibly even more. <br>\r\n\"Should call for pizza now,\" Sam said getting up.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, check on my baby bro,\" Puck said pushing himself up. <br>\r\n\"You're scarily protective,\" Dave said, struggling a little to right himself. Puck leaned a hand down and pulled him up.<br>\r\n\"I never had a brother before,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Regardless. Though I must ask considering he just ate all of breakfast, is he going to be joining us?\" Dave asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, going to be another addition of our growing family,\" Puck said with a smirk. \"In all senses of the word.\"<br>\r\n\"I bet he has no clue,\" Dave said.<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. But he'll go for it eventually. It'd be too hard to resist.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd bet, with you and Sam encouraging him subtly or directly and all the food we'd eat, it'd be a miracle if he didn't get bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"It's in the genes,\" Puck said proudly. <br>\r\n\"It certainly looks good in your jeans,\" Dave smirked back as he slapped Puck's big belly causing him to laugh. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam had always been obsessive about his body. He had been given a gift of a built body along with decent genetics that made it easier to gain muscle than it otherwise might be. It had been his temple, his pride and joy and it was what made him who he was. If he hadn't been buff, he would never have been popular or even anybody. Other than his physical appearance, he was a comic book nerd and geek. He loved Star Wars and was so obsessed with Avatar he had learned Navi and could quote from exact memory every line and where it was in the movie if anyone would ever ask, which no one did. He loved comic books and sci-fi tv shows and had it been possible for him to read, he knew he would have enjoyed that too. Unfortunately, books, especially with small print, were frustrating and did not help his stupid dyslexic self  being able to read them. They looked like squiggles on a page and blurry and the words were all mixed up. They made his brain hurt and it made him angry. Had it not been for football and sports, his condition would have made it impossible for him to do well in school, and the only reason he was doing well was the fact that teachers were motivated not to fail the best football players and cheerleaders, even if they were dumb as rocks. Honestly, Sam wondered how Britanny ever passed anything, even with grade fixing her grades were so awful. She was a sweet girl and very nice but stupid. He would have been stupid too if he hadn't been gifted at football just like Brittany at snging and dancing except he wouldn't even have gotten a break because he wasn't that stupid. The fact that he was so smart at everything else but reading and math would make them think he was trying to pull a fast one on them or something. So he stuck to what he had best which was his beautiful body. He had the benefit of extremely cut abs (probably the best anywhere except for those 1 in a 100,000 or whatever number people like him) and big biceps which although not as good as Puck's or a few of the other players, were still bigger than Finn's and he was a better quarterback honestly. He was glad he and Finn weren't fighting over it anymore, but he had to have it at the time. Without it, he might not have made the team or been anymore than a geeky blonde guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his dad lost his job and everything went to hell in a handbasket. They were barely making it by and Sam had to get a job to support them, delivering pizzas. They lost their house and all their possessions and had to move into a rundown motel and being popular and reputation no longer mattered. What mattered was supporting his family and that's what he did. He may not have been the smartest or strongest but he supported his family and dated at the same time. Then his dad got a new job and they moved. The job wasn't as lucrative as they thought it would be but it was better than when they were getting nothing so they stayed. Sam tried to find another job in the food industry selling icecream but it sucked. It really really sucked. Horrible boss, horrible pay, bratty customers, no tips, insulted all the time, and he didn't even get to taste the damn icecream. He was going insane trying to find something else when he discovered something that ordinarily he would never have thought but knew he could do. He signed on to be a stripper known as \"White Chocolate\" (he missed Mercedes, his first real girlfriend). Although it was a little bit humiliating, it wasn't as bad as when he was getting mocked at DQ. At least, that's what he told himself. The pay however was infinitely better and he loved the smiles of joy on his parents' faces as he brought the money home. If they knew where he was working, they wouldn't have been as happy but Sam told himself he had too. It was for them that he stripped for strangers and showed off his body. It was his gift, his talent, and if he got paid so much, then why the hell not? It was probably going to be the only thing he'd be able to do after High School anyhow. There was no way to get into college, they simply did not have the money and even if they had, Sam would have failed with his dyslexia. All that reading and math...he couldn't do it. When he was being honest with himself, Sam didn't enjoy the thought of being a stripper and showing off to random strangers who were always grabbing him and making comments as if he was prostituting himself, but it was what needed to be done. Then Rachel and Finn found him and he was humiliated, having to strip for people who actually knew him. He was a prostitute, selling himself for money. Even if he didn't sleep with any of the clients, it still was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey convinced him to go back to school as did his parents. Sam only agreed because he really had missed it and he had made enough working to support his family for the rest of the school year. He gone back and surprisingly Blaine was at McKinnley now. Sam had nothing against Blaine, had liked him, but Blaine's comment about selling himself out...he did not like that. Did not like it one bit. He may have overreacted a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was surfing the web, watching random hilarious youtube videos one day in the library in free period when he came across something weird. He had no idea how he got there but he came across groups of fetish videos. Normally he would have clicked out but as they say, curiousity killed the cat and he had to watch. He watched fat people eating and people giving encouragement for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People actually like this? What the hell is wrong with them?\" Sam had wondered until he read the comments. Not only did they like it but they really liked it. It made Sam hot reading all those comments and then he saw something that surprised him even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually give money for this?\" And some were very generous donors apparently. That set Sam thinking. It may have been similar in appearance to stripping for what people wanted but  it gave distance and they couldn't physically touch them. People were more complimentive and it was oddly less stigmatized as well. Plus it would just be eating. Barely anything else to it as far as he could tell and he would give people material to fantasize to. He closed the site, unsure. He was going to have to think further on this. </span></div></div>",

Rachel's dads were two of the kindest people he'd ever met - not only did they open up their home to him but they also bought him a new laptop so he could do his homework.  Sam had the entire house to himself on Saturday - Rachel was with Finn and her Dads were out of town - so he decided it was a good time to look into those videos and the possibility of getting bigger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that there were so many people who were supportive of these youtube gainers journey to get fat, but being fat isn't what Sam wanted.  If he was going to go through with this, he wanted to keep his muscles and strength, but also lose his abs and get a big belly.  He searched around on the internet for a bit before finding a website for muscular gainers, \"This is exactly what I'm looking for.\"  Sam browsed around the website for a while, reading comments and forum posts, and he realized that this is exactly what he was looking for.  Sam thought long and hard about this, and in the end, he decided he would do it - his family needed the money that he could make from his viewers and he was curious to see what he'd look like as a bigger guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered something else - Shane.  Sam was determined to win Mercedes back from him, and that guy was HUGE.  If Sam could get that big as well, maybe he could get Mercedes back.  It was decided; Sam Evans was about to start gaining.  Sam quickly made an account on the gainer site under the username \"ThickWhite_Cocoa91\", having grown attached to his stripper name, and made a post about how he was interested in getting bigger and asking for tips.  He posted a shirtless picture of himself with his head cropped out and almost instantly Sam got a message from someone named \"HelpinUgrow\", who also lived in Lima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, big guy.  I wanna help you get large and in-charge.  You in?\"  Sam thought for a moment and then started typing, \"Sure, I'd love the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.  You wanna meet me at Breadstix?  I can be there in 30 minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"It'll take me an hour but I can make it.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome.  I'll be at the far corner table on the left in a brown jacket.  See you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't believe he was about to do this, but he got up from his bed, shut his laptop, and got dressed.  After an hour drive from Rachel's house, Sam pulled into an open parking spot at Breadstix and headed inside.  He told the lady at the front that he was meeting someone and headed towards the corner table.  When he got there, Sam was surprised to see that the man sitting at the table was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're HelpinUgrow?\" Puck pointed at the seat in front of him and waved for Sam to sit. He didn't speak until Sam did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. I admit, I was surprised when I saw something from someone in this town of Lima, let alone anyone interested so I had to talk to you. Plus I thought I recognized that ripped body of yours and here you are. I admit, you didn't strike me as a gainer. I'm pleasantly surprised that you are.\" Sam however was still lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an...encourager?\" he said, trying to wrap his mind around it. \"I thought you weren't gay.\" Puck shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never said I was, and I'm not. Call it a little interest of mine nobody knows about, not even Rachel or Finn. I'm only trusting you with it because I know you actually can keep a secret unlike the rest of those blabbermouths. I just happen to find large and in charge people incredibly hot. Why do you think I was all over Lauren? Mmmh, yeah she was fine. Too bad she was such a bitch, I had really liked her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what about you're thing with the 'guns'? You've always been fond of those.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy boy, you've got a lot to learn. There is no incongruency between me wanting one thing for myself and finding something else attractive in another person. Me, I like being buff.I like it a lot. Ironically, gaining anything but muscle would be not fun for me. However, I find larger people and people such as your luscious self getting larger quite desirable and bad-ass to the extreme. \" Puck looked Sam over appreciatively whistling. \"And man am I, er. we are going to have fun with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you weren't gay?\" Sam said. \"I'm not homophobic but this does sound very gay coming from you.\" Puck sighed, shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such simple labels as those, it's lucky you have me to teach you. I told you, I'm not gay, nor am I exclusively straight. People like what they like and that's just that. I prefer girls but I am not closed off to the idea of other males. Real alpha bad-asses, none of those sissy rainbow people. Those people are girly, sometimes even worse, and I don't care about them. Take Kurt, he's cool but so not my type. Too fruity and girly but without the assets of being a girl, more the pity. Anyways, we're off on a tangent here, we're here to help you. Tell me Sammy,why are you gaining? Last I checked, you were obsessed with maintaining your perfect abs.\" Puck put his elbows on the table and leaned forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam cleared his throat. \"Well,\" he started. \"Uh, I discovered this gaining thing quite recently watching videos on youtube. I have no idea how but somehow I come across these fetish videos and watched them and discovered that there are some groups of people who apparently like, as you put it, 'large and in charge' people. Some of them like it so much they even pay.\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Your father still doesn't have a job?\" <br>\r\n\"No, he has one now but we're still trying to level out right now. But any extra income would be welcome and I want to help.\" <br>\r\n\"I heard you were a stripper,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it paid better than anything else.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. You're ripped.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you jealous?\" Sam asked, worried. Puck shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Nah,at first maybe but not anymore. Especially since you're interested in becoming a gainer. What are your other reasons? I assume there must be more since I doubt that short of all the money in the world paid to you right away, gainging wouldn't have been considered ever, especially for messing with your abs.\" Sam blushed a little and lowered his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...I guess I have always been curious to see what it would be like to be a bigger guy and not worry about weight,\" Sam said. Puck grinned at him. <br>\r\n\"Now we're talking. Anything else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a better gig. I could just make videos of my progress and people would throw money at me but this time outside of wishing on the internet, they won't be grabbing my crotch and yanking my underwear down. I won't have to put up with random strangers touching me. Finally, I'm hoping to win back Mercedes.\" Puck raised an eyebrow at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercedes...that's pretty clever actually. Although I can not say for sure absolutely since I only dated her for about a day, I think the diva does prefer boys large and in charge to match her. Other than that one weird time when she had a crush on Kurt, she has always picked large men or been single.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a crush on Kurt?\" Sam asked, confused. Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, freshmen year. She somehow missed the obvious fact that he was gay. Worst gaydar I ever saw. She broke his car windows when she thought he was dating Rachel. But that's in the past. As for your plan, that actually makes sense. You are a bit skinny for her tastes, although then again, she had been interested in Kurt...argh, digressing again. Still, you're in for some tough competition with that Shane dude. But wanna know a little secret? They won't be lasting much longer since he got a full football scholarship. This is your chance to win Mercedes back. If you start bulking up now over the next few weeks, she's as good as yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the tip.\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"So,\" Puck says, his mouth stretching into a playful grin. \"Feeling hungry?\" </span></div></div>",

Now, I have to warn you, this won't be easy.  Hell, it might actually hurt sometimes and you might feel like throwing up, but trust me.  It'll be worth it.\"  Puck grabbed the basket of bread sticks on the table and pushed the entire thing over to Sam, \"Let's start with this.  I wanna see that entire basket gone before our waiter gets here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took a deep breath before grabbing one of the hot bread sticks and holding it to his mouth, \"No going back after this...\"  Sam took one large bite out of the bread stick, ripping off more than half of it and chewing before swallowing and finishing the other half.  Once the bread stick was gone, Sam instantly started going after the rest of the basket.  Puck smirked and sat back in his seat, arms crossed over his large chest as he watched his friend chow down.  Sam finished the last bread stick and pushed the basket back, smiling at Puck, \"So whats - URP - next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck chuckled and adjusted how he was sitting as their waiter came over and asked for their order, \"Yeah, I'll have the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and a coke, and this big guy will have the four meat lasagna with another coke.  Also, could we get more bread sticks?\"  The waiter took their order and walked away for a brief moment, coming back with both of their drinks and another basket of bread.  Puck pushed the second basket over to Sam, \"Eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam wasted no time finishing off this second basket of bread, sitting back and putting his hands on his quickly-filling stomach, \"Are you sure eating this much bread is a good thing?  I'm getting kind of full..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's a good thing,\" Puck said, \"Bread is one of the best things a gainer can eat, it really helps pack'em on.\"  Just then, the waiter returned with their order, and Sam was starting to regret his decision.  The lasagna Puck had ordered for him was HUGE, \"I hope I don't throw up.\"  Sam said nervously before picking up his fork and shoveling in the first massive bite.  It tasted amazing and Sam soon found himself unable to stop.  Puck took a few bites out of his own pasta, but he enjoyed watching the blondie across from him eat even more.  About six minutes passed before Sam finally pushed the plate back, chugged his coke, and then flopped back into his seat, his hands rubbing his hard, bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck reached over and patted Sam's shoulder, \"Excellent work, Sammy!  I didn't think you could eat it all.\"  Sam belched loudly before smiling back at Puck, \"UUUUUUUUUURP...  Hehe, what can I say?  It was good.\"  \"Do you think you can eat more?\"  Puck asked.  Sam rubbed his swollen belly, \"Maybe like... something - UUUURP - .. small.\"  Puck flashed Sam a smile before pushing the rest of his plate over to him, \"Here.  Eat up.\"  Sam looked down at the plate, which was almost full, and the back up at Puck, \"You planned that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck shrugged, \"Maybe.  Now eat.\"  Sam picked up his fork and started eating the chicken and pasta.  If it meant getting bigger, than he could sit through the bloated pains.  Sam got about halfway through the plate before becoming way to full.  \"I can't eat anymore, Puck... It's to much.\"  Puck crossed his arms, \"I thought you wanted to get bigger?\"  \"I do,\" Sam said, \"But I feel like I'm going to burst.\"  Sam let out another burp before...</span></div></div>",

Sam couldn't really see all that well right now but he was sure he would be huge. He felt it, like an ungainly whale. Suddenly, Puck started doing something both unexpected and wonderful. With one hand, he started rubbing Sam's stomach, his rough yet soft fingers tracing sensations across his stomach, and it felt heavenly. He barely felt it when his mouth opened of his own accord and Puck's other hand came around and started giving him the remaining spoonfuls of pasta. He just opened and closed his mouth automatically as Puck fed and rubbed him, totally concentrated on the wonderful sensation of Puck rubbing him. Suddenly, the hands slowed and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, you ate it all,\" Puck said admiring his handiwork. Sam Evans the gorgeous blonde with perfect abs was in front of him, totally stuffed to the brim and physically unable to eat anymore, and his stomach bulging out from underneath his shirt. Sam groaned and made noises of pain and pleasure that left Puck wanting and Puck admired the view. Patting the stomach he poked it a couple of times and grinned as Sam burped with each poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uurrpp, stop that, that hurts...I'm too full.\" Suddenly Sam gave a massive belch. \"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.\" Puck was nearly blown over and was stunned. Sam was stunned as well before Puck started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, nice one. Oh my, that was exhiliarating. You're even more of a man than I thought. I bow to your greatness.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" Sam said groaning. \"Just do that thing with your hands again.\" <br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" Puck said. \"You have no idea how much fun this is.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, you have no idea how much my belly hurts doing this.\" <br>\r\n\"You like it,\" Puck said knowingly. Sam shrugged, knowing it was almost true but right now he hated it. He really really did.<br>\r\n\"I hope we can do it again,\" Puck said. Sam just shushed him and had him continue rubbing. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After getting back to his new home Sam went straight to his bedroom and collapsed on his bed, to full to even bother doing anything but sleep.  The bloated teen was fast asleep, but was woken up by the sound of the doorbell ringing.  Sam sat up and looked at his bedside alarm, surprised to see that he had slept until eight.  He pushed himself out of bed and went to go see who was at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam opened the door, a delivery boy from Breadstix was standing there with a huge take out box, \u201cAre you Sam Evans?\u201d  Sam blinked, \u201cUhh... yeah.\u201d  The delivery boy handed Sam the takeout box, \u201cSomebody already paid for your order.  Enjoy your food!\u201d  The delivery boy headed back to his car, and Sam stood there confused, until he looked down and saw that there was a note reading \u2018Eat up, Big Guy.\u2019  Sam shut the front door and headed into the kitchen.  He set the food down and pulled his phone out - calling Puck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sammy!  What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just got a massive takeout order from Bredstix, that\u2019s what\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sweet, you got my order for you.  I want you to eat as much of that as you can tonight.

I\u2019m still full from lunch...\u201d  Sam looked down at his stomach, which was no longer hard and bloated.  He lifted up his shirt and saw that his abs were did look less defined than they did this morning.<br>\r\n\u201cYou slept for six hours, I\u2019m sure your fine.  Besides, it\u2019s gonna take a lot of work to get rid of those super cut abs of yours.  Just eat what you can and bring the rest to school.  I gotta go, dude.  See you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put his phone on the counter and stared at the take-out box: it was one one of those large, aluminum casserole dishes that Italian food is always delivered in.  One top of it was a big bag of breadsticks.  Sam sighed, \u201cI guess I really don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d  He fished out a fork and opened the container; Puck had ordered him a massive spaghetti and meatball dinner that looked like it could feed a family of four.  Sam took a deep breath and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam paced himself the entire time as he ate, and after two hours, he was somehow able to eat half of the order and all of the breadsticks.  He went to bed at around ten that night, half an hour before Rachel came home, and fell right to sleep with a full, bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school, Sam was at his locker after class putting books away and when Puck came over, \u201cHey, Sammy.  Haven\u2019t see you at all today.\u201d  Puck said, leaning against the lockers.  He reached down and grabbed the bottom of Sam\u2019s shirt, pulling it up to get a look at Sam\u2019s fading abs, \u201cWow, your abs already looking pretty soft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pulled his shirt back down, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d  Puck laughed, \u201cI\u2019m just checking out my handy work.  I was actually pretty bummed out that I wasn\u2019t there to rub your stuffed belly after you ate.  Speaking of, how much did you eat?\u201d  \u201cHalf.\u201d  Sam said, pulling out the other half, which was inside of a Tupperware container.  A big grin spread across Puck\u2019s face, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to watch you eat it.\u201d  He and Puck headed to the big stone steps outside of the school for lunch.</span></div></div>",

I am curious to know.\" <br>\r\n\"Well...it was exhausting,\" Sam said. Puck looked down at the area of Sam's stomach. <br>\r\n\"I bet,\" he said grinning. \"Is it what you wanted?\" <br>\r\n\"It is...tough, but actually, I enjoy it. Even if I wanted to murder you yesterday.\" Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. I see you enjoyed my little gift yesterday. I wish I was there but I had to do a couple of things.\" Puck whistled. <br>\r\n\"By the way, I got nice footage yesterday.\" Sam blinked. <br>\r\n\"You did have a camera?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't want to miss a second and as you told me you wanted to put it online for enthusiasts. I was working on setting the website up and the payment options yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness, I had totally forgotten yesterday.\" Sam breathed a sigh of relief. \"I won't have to do that again.\" Puck raised his eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Yeah you will.\" <br>\r\n\"I meant losing my eating virginity.\" Sam said. Puck burst into laughter. <br>\r\n\"Eating virginity, what the hell? You're crazy Evans. Nobody remains a virgin eater. Everybody eats food.\" <br>\r\n\"I meant as in deliberately stuffing myself.\" <br>\r\n\"If I had to name it, I'd call it feedee virginity but never mind. I want to see.\" Sam brought out the pasta container. Puck whistled appreciatively and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're such a good eater, last year you were so obsessively not that I thought you were anorexic or dangerously obsessed with exercise. But this year...\" Puck grinned, \"this year you're awesome.\" Sam shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" Puck replied and pulled out a small camcorder. \"You ready?\" He asked Sam and Sam nodded. \"Action,\" Puck said and Sam dug into the pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam played it up for the camera (and because it was good pasta, even if it had to be reheated), making noises of appreciation and random bellyrubs and showing off his stomach as his abs bloated out again. When he finished the pasta, Sam let out a loud burp and grinned as he rubbed his bloated stomach. Unfortunately lunch was starting to come to a close and they had to wrap up soon but Puck gave him a big slice of uneaten pizza which he had Sam scaerf down as well. Then the bell rang and they had to get to class. Puck reached down and helped Sam up who stumbled a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go,\" he said and grinned as Sam had to straighten and pull down his shirt which had risen a little when he stood. There was an outline of curvature as his bloated belly pushed against the tight fitting shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking hot,\" Puck said appreciatively as he rubbed it. Sam belched again and waved him off. <br>\r\n\"Urrp, yeah I know. But not right now.\" Puck gave a dramatized sigh.<br>\r\n\"Ah, oh the pity. Later you're going to have to let me rub it again.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever. See you in class.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't forget gym,\" Puck said grinning wickedly. Sam's eyes widened in shock. Crap he had forgotten that. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's weights day. And you're going to have plenty of fuel to burn so I expect you to lift your hardest.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n\"I switched with Finn to be your partner/spotter. I bribed him with a gift idea for Rachel as well as a few other things.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then.\" <br>\r\n\"See you,\" Puck said waving as he headed into the building. Shifting his shirt again (clearly wearing a tight fitter one was not one of his better ideas but he hadn't been thinking when he chose to wear it), he headed into the building towards his next class. </span></div></div>",

His stomach was still bloated from lunch and his shirt was clung to his body really well because of it.  The outline of his bloated stomach was clearly visible, and Sam was about to suck it in to try and hide it, but Puck walked around the corner and smiled, \"Hey there, Sammy.  That shirt's lookin' pretty snug.\"  Puck said as he walked over and patted Sam's tiny belly.  Sam laughed a little, \"Yeah, it is.  I think we're gonna have to bump up the amount I eat if we're gonna get rid of my abs.\"  Sam said, shutting his locker.  Puck smiled, \"True.  We gotta get rid of those abs before your belly can really start coming through, but, we can worry about that after school.  Right now, we're gonna beef up those muscles of yours.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Puck walked into the weight room and they went straight to the bench press to work on Sam's chest and arms.  As Puck loaded up the weights, Sam's eyes moved over to the massive man he was competing against for Mercedes: Shane.  Shane was TRULY a giant; he had massive shoulders, thick arms, and a super-wide back with a huge chest.  His stomach was big and rotund, and it even hung over his waistband slightly.  He had soft love handles and a round, plump butt that lead down to his tree-trunk thighs and giant calves.  Sam felt down right scrawny next just being in the same room as him.  Puck put his hand on Sam's shoulder, \"Don't worry, Buddy.  Soon, you'll be just as big as him.  In fact, no.  We're gonna make you BIGGER than him.\"  A smile spread across Sam's face, \"Awesome.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Puck spent the next hour working on Sam's upper body, and when they were finished, they showered up and got dressed.  Puck stole glances at Sam's body and he approved greatly at his own hard work  After they were dressed, Puck and Sam went to their different classes, and then met up again for Glee club at the end of the day.  While Mr. Schue gave his next lesson to the class, and in between breaks of them practicing a few song ideas, Sam and Puck were whispering to each other about where to go for Sam's dinner.  After debating it, Sam decided he was in the mood for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After going back and forth on it with Puck, Sam decided to give in and have pizza which Puck felt like being insistent on. \"Come on, it'll be good,\" he had said. \"All delicious and dripping with cheese...\" and then delivered the final \"it will certainly help and your fans will love it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have fans already?\" Sam asked and Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, they really dig you. I'm not surprised really, you are phenomenal. Of course there are some mean people who have nothing to do with their lives and be useless trolls insulting you, but they are only a few and are far outnumbered by those who are more positive ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they want me to have pizza?\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Ugh fine,\" Sam said giving in. <br>\r\n\"Why are you so unhappy? I thought you liked pizza?\" Puck asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I like pizza. But I worked for the pizza place we're going to and it sucked. I swore I would never go back to that place again if I could help it.\" <br>\r\n\"It was worse than DQ?\" <br>\r\n\"Much worse. At least I got some free icecream there, not that I wanted it at the time but I had the option. Here you get minumum wage, insulted, and not even a modicum of a bonus which at least the icecream store had. I don't want to give that place business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we'll find another pizza restaurant,\" Puck said. \"It doesn't have to be at that one if you don't want it to be.\" <br>\r\n\"That would be good,\" Sam said agreeing. <br>\r\n\"Well, how about this one?\" Puck asked, stopping the car after driving a bit further. Sam got out and looked. <br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"A pizza place,\" Puck said grinning. <br>\r\n\"O...kay.\" Sam looked in at the dark windows. <br>\r\n\"Are they even open?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck pushed the door open and ushered Sam inside. It didn't seem all that promising with only a few people quietly eating there entirely focused on their own food. Leading Sam to a table he sat him down and got back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your pleasure?\" Puck asked. Sam burst out laughing. <br>\r\n\"That's funny!\" Puck just looked at him until Sam stopped laughing. \"Uh...cheese pizza?\" <br>\r\n\"Would that be it? What about drink?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah just cheese. To drink could I have Dr. Pepper?\" Puck gave a grin then. <br>\r\n\"Cheese pizza and Dr. Pepper coming right up sir.\" <br>\r\n\"What are you having?\" Sam wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same. Don't worry about it.\" Puck went to the front where he gave the person at the register his order, paid, and went and filled two large cups of Dr. Pepper from the soda machine. Bringing them back, he plopped one in front of Sam and kept the other for himself. \"It should be ready in 20 or so minutes,\" Puck informed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Sam said and they sat there before Sam started doing impressions.<br>\r\n\"And I said...'Houston? We've got a problem,'\" Puck was laughing so hard he was nearly spraying his soda everywhere and he waved his hand for Sam to stop. <br>\r\n\"Oh man, that is funny! You're really awesome at those,\" Puck said laughing. Sam smirked back. <br>\r\n\"As they say in show business...that's all folks,\" Sam said in a voice that matched it perfectly. A waitress came up to them then and placed a large pizza down on the serving table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One extra-large cheese pizza with extra cheese and one medium meat lovers, please dig in,\" she intoned in a voice that said how much she didn't care. Puck thanked her anyways and she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why do we have two?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"One's for you of course,\" Puck said nodding his head in the direction of the cheese. \"I got my own as well.\" <br>\r\n\"That's...nice,\" Sam said looking at the pizza.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can eat a lot of it,\" Puck said. \"Perhaps the whole thing, who can say?\" <br>\r\n\"It's a bit much I think?\" <br>\r\n\"Just try it out Sammy, I think if you put your mind to it, you could do much further than you expect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck was right, of course. Once Sam had taken a bite of it and nearly died in heavenly bliss from the best tasting pizza he had ever tasted somehow, it wasn't long before Sam was all over it. Puck ate slower, content to enjoy his pizza and the show, plus it had a bunch of meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you recording this anyways?\" Sam asked between bites of dripping hot delicious melted cheese.<br>\r\n\"Hat cam, plus hand corder,\" Puck said showing. <br>\r\n\"Ah, I wondered what was up with the goofy hat.\" Sam said grinning. <br>\r\n\"You're goofy fish lips,\" Puck said, pouting. He liked his big fur hat, it was awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way through the pizza, Sam started putting on a little show again as he exaggeratedly licked his lips, rubbed his belly, and moaned in appreciation. Actually, those weren't really exaggerated at all but whatever. After about 10 slices, he started slowing down and panted in exhaustion as he scrabbled with his belly and drink. Puck put the cam down still pointed at them as he made his way over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat anymore,\" Sam said with a groan. <br>\r\n\"I can help you with that,\" Puck said all seductively and Sam raised his eyebrows. Puck tilted his head slightly back so Sam could see the camera rolling. <br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...okay.\" Puck laced his fingers a moment before he started rubbing and Sam forgot everything and that they were on camera. <br>\r\n\"Oh that feels so good,\" Sam moaned as he bucked into the touch. \"Yes, harder!\" Puck obliged as he rubbed Sam's stomach and Sam burped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPP, aw man that feels great!\" With Puck rubbing, Sam managed to be convinced to eat another few slices leaving only two before he was done, along with the rest of the soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-uuurrrppp-I'm-uuuuurp-done for real,\" Sam said as he belched uncontrollably. Puck turned the cameras off and continued to rub. <br>\r\n\"You are doing such a good job,\" he murmured and Sam rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Sure doesn't feel like it,\" he muttered before burping again. <br>\r\n\"Well you are,\" Puck said as he continued rubbing. <br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" Sam said and groaned. </span></div></div>",

As he rubbed Sam's stomach, Puck watched the video with a proud smile on his face.  He LOVED that Sam was willing to get huge and that he could be part of this.  Sam was amazed that he had eaten as much as he did, his stomach still completely stuffed with food, but he had to admit to himself that he was amazed by the video.  He finally understood why some people were so turned on by videos like these, it was surprisingly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it ended, Puck shut his laptop and looked at Sam, \"So, what do you think?  Those are the kinds of videos that people pay good money to watch of you.\"  Sam cleared his throat and smiled, \"I'll admit it..  it was actually pretty hot.\"  <br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"You bet it was!\"<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Sam said, \"I think my gaining is going a bit too slowly.  I mean, at the rate we're going, I'll reach Shane's size by the time we graduate.\"<br>\r\nPuck patted Sam's belly, \"I was thinking the same thing.\"  Puck grabbed the bottom of Sam's shirt and pulled it off of him, \"You've put some weight on your stomach, but everything else about you hasn't changed.  You've still got your abs, give or take some definition.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you have any ideas how we can beef me up?\"  Sam asked.<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Give a second, I have just the thing.\"  Puck got up and headed to his bedroom, \"You know, Sammy, I didn't tell you this before, but you aren't the first person I helped turn massive!\"  He yelled from his room.<br>\r\nSam blinked, \"Who was that?\"<br>\r\n\"You remember Dave Karofsky?  Over summer I helped him gain a TON of weight.  You should see him now, he's MASSIVE: big, soft belly with a broad chest, not to mention arms and legs like tree trunks.  He goes to a different school now but he's one of the best football players they have.\"  When Puck came back, he had a huge, white jar in his arms, \"And I used this to help him.\"  He said, setting it down in front of Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam read the label; It was a jar of muscle growth powder called <i>Big and Thick</i>, \"You used this on Karofsky?\"  Sam asked.<br>\r\nDave shook his head, \"Yep!  It took about half of the jar to make him into the big bear he is now, but trust me, it was worth it.\"  Puck carried jar back into the kitchen and grabbed the blender, as well as the tub of chocolate ice cream from the freezer.  Puck emptied the entire tub of ice cream into the blender, along with six huge scoops of the powder, \"This stuff is the best weight gain powder on the market: It lowers your metabolism, increases your appetite, and even triples the calories of whatever you eat.\"  Sam was about to ask about it, but the blender started up and for about a minute straight.  Once it was done, Puck walked into the living room with the glass container from the blender in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can drink that now, Puck...  I'm still full.\" Sam said, his hands on his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Which is EXACTLY why we need to drink.  Trust me, after you drink this for a couple of days, your appetite with be HUGE.\"  Puck said, handing him the milkshake.<br>\r\nSam took a deep breath before putting it to his big lips and drinking it down.  It wasn't easy, and Sam had to stop a couple of times to breath and get his energy back to do this, but after 15 minutes he had the massive shake in his stomach and he was totally bloated.  Puck gave him the best massage of his life, \"Now this stuff works best when you don't move very much, so I want you to head home and go to sleep for the night.  Trust me, when you wake up, those abs will be gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got dressed again and headed home, passing out as soon as he hit his bed.  When Sam woke up the next morning for school, the first thing he did was check in the mirror, surprised by what he saw.  Puck was right, that powder did help him get big faster!  Sam's abs were gone a small, but very noticeable, belly had replaced them.  His body over all had a little bit more thickness to it, especially in his butt, but most of it was in his stomach for now.  Sam grinned, for this first time he was REALLY excited about gaining.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam was amazed that Rachel still did not notice anything. If it didn't relate to music or to Finn, Rachel seemed astoundingly oblivious. She didn't seem to notice anything weird and he was living with her. Though in this case she had an excuse: Finn had apparently asked to marry her and in that situation, one could be forgiven if they were a little out of it. It was such a surprise and unexpected and was really messing with her. You'd think she'd be happy but now that it actually was happening, she was freaking out and wondering what to do and say. And in the midst of all this Will finally proposed to Emma and asked the glee club for opinions on how to best ask her to marry him. It was about time really, it had been obvious to everyone even before he went to McKinley he had liked her. Wrapped up in these marriage flurries, they for once didn't really notice what was going on with him. Best of all, Mercedes and Shane didn't seem to be going to good from when he saw them in school. He seemed to want to constantly walk her EVERYWHERE and Mercedes wasn't the type to like possessive and worse, hovering guys who had to know where she was every minute of every day. It was clear Shane only reluctantly let her talk to her friends in Glee. There also seemed to be an odd decrease in slushie incidents for once and they weren't really sure if it was because people had finally gotten bored of it, matured, or if the hockey and other popular kids were planning something. It was true that the major instigators of the slushie torture were gone or had retired (Puck, Azimio, and Dave Karofsky) but there were a number of hopefuls who still wanted to carry the torch and hadn't given up, especially that one jackass on the hockey time. They were beginning to think the slushy torture was beginning to come to an end for once because despite the occasional isolated slush incidents, it as a whole stopped. The annoying hockey member although quite boisterous and full of bravaado, wow, being around Rachel absorbs vocabulary, he was quite cowardly when alone and apparently only slushied when he had team support. He was no Puck, Dave, Sam, Finn, Azimio, etc. He wasn't all that big of a guy or much of a fighter without his big hockey friends and teaming up on the weaker members of Glee. Other than those rare occurences, it was surprisingly quiet in the making fun of the glee club arena since by now most people were concerned about their future (or their lack of one and the inevitablity they were going to remain in sucktown Ohio forever) and couldn't be bothered most likely. They weren't popular but they weren't targeted for utter destruction except by Sue who still had a beef with Mr. Schue and the club. Though she actually helped with proposing to Emma which was weird and almost freaky. Maybe it's because Sue had ended up marrying herself (erm, weird) that she decided to help Mr. Schue (or Emma) get married. Sam was still terrified of Sue, absolutely positively terrified and would rather face Coach Beiste's punishments than Sue in psycho mood, but there were times, rare enough but they did happen, where Sue almost seemed like she had a heart. Almost. The jury was still out on that though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was pleased though. He never thought he would be or that it would excite him as much as the pride in his well-cut abs or Avatar (okay, maybe not as much as Avatar, pretty much nothing could beat the world of Pandora or the Navi, but it came close) as it came to the feeling of gaining and getting bigger. At the start there were some reservations: getting fat, people laughing at him, being unpopular, being unattractive, eating (well, that one was still difficult at times because Puck was tough), etc. But after finding out how some people actually like and even love it was amazing. He was beginning to understand why since on the receiving end it was all the food he wanted (and more) and it felt...good. There was something about it that just felt amazing, the feeling of a full belly and getting it rubbed. Plus, he was getting bigger. And after watching that footage of himself, Sam could see why others were interested. There was something about it...not to mention, he was getting bigger! In the good sense. A bigger frame and more muscle mass and strength was good. The more the merrier. Going it this way did pack on extra fat but it actually made it even cooler. Extra mass was manly and sexy. The internet and Puck opened his eyes to it and now that it was actually happening, he was happy. He felt better than he ever had before. He didn't realize just how much he was missing when he had kept that rigorous diet and it was a relief not to almost essentially starve himself. While he wouldn't call what he was doing now healthy in most cases, it was more healthy than how he had been before which was downright disturbing. Very disturbing to be precise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being dropped off by a distracted Rachel who talked the whole ride over about Finn and how freaked out she was, Sam smiling walked over to where Puck motioned to him from. Puck was bouncing a little in anticipation which made Sam grin grow wider as Puck tried to see through Sam's bulky jacket that showed nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work? I'm sure it worked, it has worked before but what if it didn't work for you?\" Puck was dying to know and after a few moments of pure anxiety on his part, Sam finally smirked and unzipped his jacket. A smile grew on Puck's face as he looked at Sam's curving shirt because this time it wasn't just a heavy bloat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah it did, what did I tell you? The stuff works wonders doesn't it?\" Puck looked pleased with himself. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does. Where did you get it?\" Sam was curious. He looked it up and it didn't seem like something you could just get in store or over online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a guy. Cleaned his pool and did other favors for him. Some sort of bio-scientist or something who is part of a project developing stuff like this. Gave it to me as a favor and although not officially allowed to do human trials yet, he was curious to see if it works.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't dangerous or something is it?\" Sam asked now worried. Puck shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, after various trials and Karofsky and a few other test subjects not done by me, as far as it looks there isn't anything seriously dangerous with it or any serious side effects. Besides you know, the rapid weight gain. But outside of that and an understandable change in how much you need to eat, it is safe and effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"Positive. Besides those  two things and the muscle promoting components, there are no dangerous sides and is non-addictive, physically. Of course, it is recommended not to use too much or to take with alcohol and to stop after a week at most but otherwise yeah, it's good. I have some more for you here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not? Besides, I got a treat for you.\" Puck took out a box and opened it, the smell of glazed donuts coming out. \"Smells good doesn't it?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah it does,\" Sam said, feeling hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Drink the shake.\" Puck passed it over and Sam took a sip and winced a little. Hmm, no wonder Puck had used so much icecream the day before, it tasted pretty awful by itself. Well, not that bad, but definitely not great. It tasted kind of like other protein powders he had before which was reassuring but there was an odd aftertaste that had been covered up by the icecream before. Sam had to choke down all of it before Puck let him have the box of donuts and he really wanted them by the time he finished the awful shake. Puck chuckled as Sam all but grabbed at the donuts and stuffed as many as he could into his big mouth. Chewing furiously, Sam got glaze all over his cheeks, mouth, lips, and hands. Puck walked over and traced a finger down over Sam's mouth who stopped in shock as Puck licked his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good glaze,\" he said grinning and Sam just stared. Puck nodded towards the donuts and Sam continued to dig into them like he was starving which it felt like he was and it wasn't long before the box was empty. Sam stood there licking his lips and Puck grinned at the sad look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,\" he said. \"I got some more-\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Sam cried in joy. <br>\r\n\"I'll just go get them then. They're chocolate.\" Puck returned with another box and Sam eagerly started on that box as well. </span></div></div>",

He doesn't know why he didn't realize it sooner but this whole gaining thing was an amazing idea.  He felt so relaxed having a belly full of donuts and gainer shake, and Puck's magic hands were just an added bonus.  As his mind drifted, he heard Mercedes and Shane two tables behind him having an argument.  Sam couldn't hear everything, but he could tell that Shane was mad about something and Mercedes couldn't do anything to fix whatever problem there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class ended, Shane left class quickly, which was surprisingly fast for a guy his size, and Sam got up to talk to Mercedes.  He pulled his back pack onto his shoulder, \"Is everything okay, Mercedes?  Shane seemed really upset.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh, no it's fine, Sam.  We had an early date planned for tonight but I had to cancel because of Glee club.\"  Mercedes said, looking upset.<br>\r\n\"Really?  That's a stupid thing to be upset about.\"<br>\r\n\"I know it is, but he can't help it.  He isn't a big fan of me being in Glee because he doesn't think I get the attention I deserve in there.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you've been getting a lot lately, but I think he needs to calm down.  He's being ridiculous.  I know I'd never freak out at you for something small like that.\"<br>\r\nMercedes smiled, \"You're sweet, Sam, but I can see where this is going and it's not gonna happen.\"  Mercedes headed out of the class and Puck came up behind Sam, \"That just strengthened your resolve to get her back, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\"  Sam said, turning around to Puck, \"I'll see you at lunch.  I'm ready to really start eating.\"  As Sam headed out of the class, Puck couldn't anything but grin like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses went by fast and when lunch finally rolled around Sam met up with Puck and followed him out to his car.  McKinley had an off campus lunch-time policy that most students didn't really take advantage of, but Sam was determined to start eating bigger and bigger meals.  Puck drove Sam over to the local McDonald's and the two headed inside.  When they reached the counter, Puck started to order, \"Can I get 2-\"<br>\r\n\"Five.\"  Sam said, interrupting Puck.  <br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Okay, 5 double quarter pounders, 3 large orders of fries, and 3 large milkshakes, one in each flavor., and an order of the 20 piece chicken nuggets.\"  Puck paid the order and their food arrived in no time.  Sam sat down and Puck set the food down in front of him, \"I'll be right back.  I need to go get the powder from the car for these shakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Puck was gone, Sam started to eat ravenously.  His large mouth was made for eating like this, finishing off an entire double quarter pounder in only four bites.  When Puck came back, \"Atta boy!\" he said as he popped the lids off of the shakes and added two large scoops of the powder to them mixing them up before giving them to Sam.  Sam had already eaten the entire 20 piece of chicken nuggets and was downing some fries before he grabbed the vanilla shake and started drinking it down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the vanilla shake was gone, Sam picked up one of the four double cheese burgers left and unwrapped it, taking a large bite out of it and chewing happily.  He swallowed the bite and looked across the table at Puck, \"Hey, can you get me a few apple pies?  Maybe another burger or two?\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned happily, \"That powder sure is amazing, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's AWESOME.  It makes me hungrier every time I drink it and it's helping me gain really quickly!\"  Sam said, taking another large bite out of his burger.<br>\r\nPuck got up and went back to the counter, ordering another 5 cheeseburgers and seven apple pies.  He was absolutely delighted when he saw that Sam had eaten two more burgers and had finished the chocolate powdered shake, \"All yours!\"  He said, setting the tray of burgers down in front of the growing blonde.  Without a second thought Sam picked up the one burger left and dug in, unwrapping one of the newer ones once he was halfway through, drink the strawberry shake in between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam devoured the remaining burgers and all of the apple pies before finally falling back into his seat.  Sam was absolutely bloated and stuffed beyond belief, but he was happy about it because it meant he would get bigger.  His shirt, which was tight on his growing belly to begin with, had ridden up his belly and wouldn't go back down no matter how much he tried - a sight that Puck was in love with.  <br>\r\nThe mohawked teen got up and sat down next his growing friend, \"Easy there, big boy.  You just ate a lot of food and you need the relaxing touch of a belly rub expert.\"  Puck said as he pulled Sam's shirt up, revealing his bloated, solid stomach, and rubbing it with both big hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed happily, leaning his head back as Puck worked his magic on his stuffed belly.  Sam didn't know how Puck did it but belly rubs from him had one of the most amazing feelings Sam's ever felt.  He was a bit shocked when he felt Puck's hands slid down his belly to his jeans, \"What are you...\"  Puck unbuttoned Sam's tight jeans and an amazing feeling of relief overcame Sam's body.  <br>\r\nHe let out a loud, content sigh as Puck's hands went back to his belly, \"You're not the first person I've helped gain weight, and trust me you won't be the last, Sammy.  I can tell from a mile away when someone's jeans are too tight even if they don't realize it.\"<br>\r\nSam simply smiled, \"Thanks, Puck.  So how long am I supposed to be taking these gainer shakes again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for one week, \"Puck said, \"it's for giving you that weight boost you need when you first to packing them on.\"  As Puck rubbed Sam's belly, he continued to talk, \"I'm still going to be feeding you your three big meals of the day, so you'll be getting one gainer shake per meal at the very least, three at the most.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's five more days of days of intense eating like today?\"  Sam asked, an excited tone in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, this was nothing compared to what I'll be stuffing you with.  Plus, \" He said, tapping the camera in his awesome hat, \"Your fans are gonna love it.\"  Once Sam was comfortable enough, he and Puck returned school to finish for the day before going back to Puck's house for a very fattening spaghetti dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the next three days, Mr Schue had the class focus on Michael Jackson songs to possibly use for Regionals, but of course there was plenty of drama to go along with it.  With Blaine stuck at home waiting for his eye surgery, ND was down a member and things were changing for everybody, but Sam didn't really pay to much attention to that.  During those three days, Sam did something really risky when it came to his attempts to win Mercedes back and he was surprised to see it worked in his favor.  He could tell that Mercedes was falling back in love with him - be it his charming personality, her problems happening with Shane, or his growing body - but after their duet of \"Human Nature\" they had kissed for the first time since they broken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam' groaned as he slowly lifted his now heavier body up for his bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes before sitting on the edge and look at his alarm, which read that it was about 9 AM.  Sam stood up and stretched, sighing happily as he heard his back pop a few times, before slowly making his way to the bathroom.  He finished and walked back to his room, more awake now, and stopped to look over himself in his full length mirror.  Sam was amazed at how quickly the gainer powder was effecting his body.  Over the last three days Sam consumed 9 massive meals with about 5 gainer shakes through out each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's weight gain, which had started only in his stomach, was now starting to spread to his entire body: his cheeks were fuller and Sam could see the beginnings of double chin.  His neck was thicker, which lead down to his broadening shoulders and his thick pecs, which were still fairly muscular, but had a layer of fat developing over the.  Sam's middle was where the weight gain had hit the hardest - his belly, when empty, was big, soft, and jiggled when he walked.  He had small love handles that were growing in, which Puck adored and would grab and squeeze when he wasn't doting on Sam's belly.  His backside was no longer toned and had developed a cute, round look to it thanks to the extra weight he'd put on there and his thighs were getting thicker.  Sam patted his bigger belly, which made a thick THUMP sound, and he smiled.  He really was loving being big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door made Sam jump and scrambled to throw clothes on over his skin tight boxers, \"Just a second!\"  Sam said and be bend over to grab his pajama pants off the floor.  The door opened and Puck walked in just as Sam bent over, a sight Puck was VERY happy to see.<br>\r\n\"Morning, Sammy!\"  Puck said, giving Sam a playful slap on his softer ass.<br>\r\nSam straightened out in surprise and turned around, \"HUH?  Oh.. Hey, Puck!  Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n\"Rachel and her Dad's were leaving the house for the day so they let me in.  You hungry, big boy?\"  Puck asked, putting his hands on Sam's growing belly.  He rubbed and played with it, squeezing Sam's belly fat and jiggling it a little.<br>\r\nSam blushed a bit and he didn't really mind it when Puck played with his growing body.  He knew how much Puck loved bigger guys, and he WAS helping him get this big.  It was the least he could do, \"Sure am!\"  he said happily as he slipped into his pajama pants, though remained shirtless.<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Puck said, \"I've got a huge...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I've got a huge pancake breakfast planned for you!\" Puck put his hands into his pockets and felt around. After searching a few moments, he pulled out a wad of cash. \"Before I forget, mail delivery for you. Donations from kind viewers online who enjoy our sweet footage. If you don't mind, I've already taken my cut as well as for other expenses but you still have over $1200 bucks which is just ridiculous. And that was just the first wave. Pretty soon there'll be even more.\" Puck grinned at the look on Sam's face. $1200 bucks? That was insane, and it was more than a month of stripping or over a year of minimun wage (slave labor) pizza delivery. Plus he was getting paid to do something that he decided he would have done anyways! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$1200 bucks?! That's incredible! Thank you so much!\" Sam babbled as he hugged Puck. It was all thanks to him that this was possible to begin with. Puck grinned and hugged back (taking the opportunity to feel Sam's belly because he was never one to pass a chance down) before pushing Sam off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Save it for later. Right now a pancake breakfast awaits you. I made your favorite chocolate chip and we don't want to let it get too cold do we?\" Puck laughed as Sam rushed down the stairs and he followed behind. Sam was really filling out which was thrilling too Puck. Sam looked really good and he was the one to help him get that way which was just freaking awesome. Mercedes better like Sam for all the effort he was putting into this. Sam was head over heels for her and Puck wanted it to work out. He knew all to well the bitterness of loving someone who doesn't love you back. But if it didn't work out, Sam would have many options as there are quite a number of people who enjoy bigger people. Puck grinned. Him for one, he wouldn't mind at all. Puck was all down for doing whatever Sam wanted barring any really kinky shit like being tied. Unless it was Sam being tied, then it would be okay. He shook his head, clearing his thoughts. Okay, random and irrelevant. Sam was waiting for him and he needed to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was waiting for him which Puck appreciated. It was well known Puck absolutely hated missing a single moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you start,\" Puck said. \"You wouldn't mind doing a dedication would you? Someone apparently really wants one and is willing to pay really good money for just a dedication and personal copy. It isn't hard, all you have to say is you thank all the support of your numerous fans, especially so and so, and that if anyone else wants a dedication to send in money like they've already been doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay,\" Sam said. \"Who's it for?\" <br>\r\n\"Don't know, just someone named Porcelain. No real names, its a personal thing.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess. I just want to get started.\" Sam said eagerly. Those were chocolate pancakes just sitting there waiting to be eaten! Puck chuckled at that. <br>\r\n\"Someone's an eager beaver. Kay, camera....on, don't forget to dedicate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi guys.\" Sam said. \"Thank you for the money and being so supportive, it's been a blast and I'm glad you like it. Um, this episode is dedicated to Porcelain and we're starting a new thing to buy your own dedications. If you want to be mentioned just send your money like always to my man Puck who is also director and producer and without whom none of this would be possible. So umm, yeah. To Porcelain, I guess this eatings for you, or something like that.\" Puck nodded and Sam began to eat.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam once again forgot the camera. He moaned into the pancakes. Damn Puck was an amazing cook. How did Puck not get addicted to his own food? It was so freaking delicious. The chocolate just burst in Sam's mouth and the soft fluffiness made him feel happy as it slid down easily. Sam tore through the pancakes like a starving hyena the first eight. At that point he was beginning to feel sated and that he could slow down and enjoy it more. Letting out a burp, Sam continued onto the next stack. This going was a little slower and Puck poured out one of those shakes that was both oddly filling and yet made him ravenously hungry. It still tasted awful alone but being able to wash the taste with orange juice and chocolate made it better and it made him feel good. His belly was beginning to feel tight yet it felt like he could eat more. Amazing how the stuff worked.  Sam was energized to start on the second batch of 8 as Puck shot from different angles showing how full and huge Sam's stomach was. After the second stack, Sam got no rest as Puck immediately thrust yet another shake for Sam to drink who does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP,\" Sam released a massive belch. Puck laughed before getting in front of the second camera as he came on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here that?\" Puck said. \"That's for you Porcelain and all our fans. Your contributions help to keep this young hot stud big and bloated. It would be much more difficult and boring without all you fans. So just keep sending in money and Sammy here will continue to be able to afford getting bigger for you all.\" Puck knelt down and held up another pancake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also wanted me to handfeed him a bit so here it is.\" Sam looked at Puck and Puck grinned pointing to the camera as he fed Sam bite by bite a few more pancakes with one hand while rubbing Sam's stomach with the other. After it was done, Puck got a wicked grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So fucking stuffed aren't you? Say how stuffed you are.\" Sam nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp, yeah, I'm stuffed.\" Puck knuckled his fist against Sam's stomach causing him to moan and release another couple massive belches. He waited and did it again.<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Sammy here is totally stuffed and vulnerable. How cute is he? It's enough to make one want to do things. But for now I'm just going to give him pleasure with another famous belly rub as fans know. If anyone else is thinking about being fed by me as well send your information, a picture, an explanation of goals, your fee, etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck proceeded to do exactly that, doing his magic touch massage thing that made Sam and everyone else shiver in delight. </span></div></div>",

His classes came and went, as did Glee club, but it was the breaking news of Finn and Rachel's sudden engagement that seemed to be the most interesting part of the day.  While the majority of the Glee club was happy for them, Sam honestly couldn't care either way.  He was happy for them but it was their decision and he didn't think it was right to interfere.  After Glee club was over, Sam told Puck they'd meet up later for dinner and he headed home with Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was mostly quiet, that is, until Rachel broke the silence, \"Sam, listen.  I wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n\"I know this whole, Finn-and-I-getting-married-thing is kind of sudden, and this might seem a little sudden too, but, Finn is going to be at my house a LOT more often now and I was wondering if it would be okay if he and I got some space.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.  I'm usually out with Puck or in my room so it's no big deal...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, no.  I mean... it's hard enough with my Dads being there and I was thinking about, maybe, you moving in with someone else?\"<br>\r\nSam stared at Rachel, confused, but sighed, \"Uhh..  Sure.  I can ask a few of our friends about it.\" Her family was nice enough to let him stay as long as they so Sam didn't really mind.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, Sam, it's no trouble.  I talked to Puck about it and he's asking his family about it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was surprised... okay, that's not true.  As soon as she said Puck he knew it was going to happen.  As soon as they pulled into the driveway of Rachel's house Sam's cellphone went off.  The caller ID said it was Puck and he picked up, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"GOOD NEWS.  My folks said you can move in!  I assume Rachel told you?\"<br>\r\n\"She did...\"  Sam said<br>\r\n\"Sweet!  I'll be over in a bit and we can get started.  You'll be staying in the guest room next to mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was spent packing Sam's stuff up and loading it into Puck's truck for the move.  Sam didn't really mind moving; he'd get to hang out with Puck more and the money Puck would save on gas would go into feeding him.  When they got to Puck's house Sam saw that Puck's sister and Mom were out, so the two had the house to themselves.  They spent two hours unpacking Sam's belongings into the guest room, and as Sam was putting his jeans on the top shelf of his closet, Puck grinned as he slid his hand to the underside of Sam's exposed belly, \"Somebody sure looks hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso immediately Sam's belly made a loud, rumble and Puck grinned, \"So what'll it be, Sammy?  I'm gonna make sure to get you super stuffed tonight to celebrate your new living conditions.\" <br>\r\nSam chuckled and put his hand on his chin, thinking.  He finally decided on...</span></div></div>",

I'm hungry now.\" Puck grinned as Sam's stomach made another rumble, asking for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I wouldn't have let you come over without anything to eat would I? I got some snacks and I also made a special surprise dessert.\" Puck left and came back llugging a big bag. \"My sister was curious to know what I was doing with so much food but I told her it was for a party and for friends.\" He grinned. \"She can't wait to meet you..\" Sam shifted nervously. He hadn't thought of Puck's sister's reaction. What if she didn't like him? Puck read the worry in Sam's face and figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, she'll like you. Anyone I like who keeps me from doing something stupid is someone she likes. She especially likes you already since I sing your praises all the time. Literally, I have written and peformed songs about you and what we do that she heard when I thought she wasn't around.\" Sam raised his eyebrows an Puck blushed. \"Er, never mind that. Um...moving on, I got snacks!\" The opening of the bag distracted Sam from that rather amusing revelation as he caught sight of goodies, chips, candy, etc. Sam drooled and Puck smirked. \"I'm going to order the pizza and then pump some iron. You just sit and enjoy as much as you want, watch tv, play a video game, workout with me, you're my guest and part of the family now so feel free to do whatever.\" Puck left the room to call the pizza delivery number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam went through the contents of the bag. Chips, Chocolate, Skittles, Starbursts, M&amp;Ms, Beef jerky (beef jerky? Must be for Puck), Nerds, Smarties, Gummybears, Ho-hos, Dingdongs, brownies..yum, lots of good things. All in large sizes. Sam almost would have wondered how Puck afforded to even spend the money for these things before he realized that in bulk it is cheaper and remembering that their videos make a surprising amount of money. Well, Puck and his family deserved it. He was the one staying with them and Puck was the one who was helping him and even earned the money in the first place. Without him, Sam would have no idea, and Puck was surprisingly adept with technology which one would have guessed looking at him. The hat camera was one invention, Sam always got a kick out of the hat since Puck looked so silly in it, and other cameras, and other pieces Sam had no idea how they worked behind the scenes. Puck was definitely a lot smarter than anyone, or Puck himself, gave credit for. It probably didn't help that Puck liked to act the big intimidating (and now singing) jock because he actually was really nice. Well, to people he liked. On the other hand, Puck could be downright vicious when pissed off or if he didn't like you. This year he toned it down but Sam still remembered last year when Puck terrorized some hockey players. They brought it upon themselves but getting swirlied and super-wedgied was painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a faint clanging noise and Sam wandered down, munching on a bag of chips he opened. Opening the door, Sam walked into the basement where Puck was pounding out reps on the bench. He was amazed at how much Puck could do, especially when he upped it past 300. This gave him some difficulty but not enough to require a spotter yet. Breathing heavily, Puck put the weights on the rack and sat up taking a break as he reached out for a water bottle next to him. After gulping water down, he smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see Sammy?\" Sam was startled and Puck laughed. \"I know you're here, I could feel you watching. Come here and sit.\" Patting the space next to him, Puck waited as Sam came and sat down next to him. \"Good boy. The pizza will be here in about...30 or 35 minutes, something like that.\" Puck got up and gently took the bag of chips from Sam's hands. \"Lay down, it's your turn. Wanna keep your strength up and your muscles big in addition to your totally sweet gut.\" Sam blushed as Puck patted it grinning. Laying down, the shirt rode up even more exposing his belly for all, or in this case just Puck, to see. That shirt had fit just a few short weeks ago before he started working with Puck. Which actually was pretty cool but it made finding and dressing in clothes irritating when they get grown out of. Puck's smile widened as Sam snorted, sat up with a bit of difficulty, and tugged it off. His eyes traveled down Sam's body. \"Very hot, show that baby off,\" he murmured and laughed as Sam flipped him off. Suddenly he was gone and back with his silly hat cam and recording devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sam asked and Puck nodded, eyes glowing. <br>\r\n\"I know people will enjoy this. The perfect combination of power and comfortable living taking its toll on your waistline.\" Puck went over and squeezed it. \"Also would be fun to compare before and after eating all the delicious pizza that will be here before you know it. Just pretend I'm not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hard. Your hat is distracting.\" Puck rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"After lying down. Now get ready. It's been a while and I know you haven't topped 300 even when you were less...big so I'll lighten it for you. How about 220?\" Sam shook his head. Puck thought for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess 200?\" Sam nodded and Puck removed the weight and moved back. He focused the camera on Sam as the big muscle-gut stud worked his bench, incline, curls, etc. This was going to be some sweet footage. Then, Puck heard the sound of a doorbell and he had Sam pause. \"I think pizza's here. Let me go get it.\" Sam nodded wearily. Puck rushed up the stairs, coming down with numerous pizza boxes stacked in his arms that you couldn't see his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to be filled up Sam? You're going to get massive my friend.\" Puck smirked. \"It's going to be freaking awesome. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Puck set the pizza down and went upstairs to get the soda, Sam got to get a good look in the basement/workout room.  Puck's basement was set up so that it was the ultimate man-cave: A huge flat-screen tv with a big comfy couch, a huge personal fridge, a water cooler filled with soda right next to the couch, a wii,PS3, and Xbox 360 with a large amount of games, several different pieces of work out equipment, and a rather large box labeled 'Gain Equip\".  Sam knelt down and was about to open it when Puck put his hand on his shoulder, \"Whatcha lookin' at, Sammy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Sam said, surprised, \"I was just wondering what was in this.\"<br>\r\n\"It's my gainer equipment!  I bought all this stuff when I first started helping guys get massive.  I haven't had a chance to use any of them on you yet since all of our feedings have been at Rachel's house, a restaurant, or at school.\"  Puck opened the box and Sam took a look.  Inside, Sam saw several large containers of protein powder and gaining supplements, one of which he recognized as the one Puck forced down his throat for a week, as well as measuring tape, a funnel and tube, and a pair of handcuffs for what Sam assumed were for his more perverted clients.<br>\r\nPuck grinned as Sam stood up, \"Maybe in a few days we can start using these on you.  It'd be a lot of fun!  But for now, lets get these pizzas into that growing gut of yours.\"  Puck said, smacking Sam's big, fleshy stomach.  A bigger smile spread across Puck's face as he watched Sam's empty belly jiggle.  As much as he loved watching Sam's muscles get bigger as well, his favorite part was clearly Sam's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck sat Sam's large body down on the couch and set the first pizza box on Sam's lap, \"Eat up!  You've got about eight of these to shovel down.\"  Sam picked up the first slice of pizza and began eating quickly, finishing the first slice in seconds and moving on to the next.  As Sam ate his first pizza, Puck turned on a movie for the two of them to watch, and while Sam was enjoying the movie as he gorged, Puck didn't even bother watching.  He'd seen it a thousand times but this is what he'd rather be watching.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sammy, I'll be right back, you just keep giving that big belly of yours the attention it needs.\"  Puck said as he reached over and grabbed a container from the 'Gain Equip' box.  Sam mumbled an \"Okay\" through his full mouth as he tossed the first box of pizza to the side and reached over, grabbing the next and shoveling food in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck reached his kitchen upstairs and pulled a full container of vanilla ice cream from the freezer, as well as some milk from the fridge.  He scooped half of it into his large blender and poured the milk in before looking over the container he brought from the basement: It was the same one he had been using on Sam, <i>Big and Thick</i>.  Even though the label said to only use for one week, Dave used this stuff for three weeks straight and there were no side effects except for getting HUGE.  Puck threw five huge spoonfuls into the blender and turned it on and off, throwing in more ice cream and even hot fudge as he worked.  When he was done, Puck went back down stairs with the shake, happy to see Sam had finished four of the eight pizza's while he was gone, \"Good job, Sammy!  Here, wash that pizza down with this.\"  Puck said as he handed Sam the gigantic blending cup full of gainer shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put the shake to his big lips and started drinking.  He recognized the taste of the <i>Big and Thick</i> powder and it's effects went straight to work.  Sam started chugging down the shake like it was air.  Once he finished, he let out a big belch, \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPP~\" and sighed happily.  Puck took the blending cup and set it aside, \"You spilled some.\"  Puck said, scooping off his shirt and holding it up to Sam's mouth, who happily sucked if off.  Puck pulled Sam's shirt off, since it was now dirty, and set the fifth box of pizza in Sam's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam could feel himself getting fuller as he ate, but the gainer shake was making him just as hungry, so he had no problem scarfing down the next 4 pizzas over the following thirty minutes.  groaned as he rubbed his huge, swollen, pizza filled stomach, letting out loud, short burps as he did so.  Puck grinned as he placed both hands on Sam's huge belly, \"There, there, Sammy.  Let me take care of that.\"  He said as he rubbed, a big smile on his face as he did.  Puck knew helping Sam gain would be fun, but he never knew it would be this amazing and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of silence(the explosions from the movie withstanding) Sam looked up over his bloated belly, \"Hey, Puck?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"  Puck asked, kneading his hands into Sam's gut.<br>\r\n\"I think we should really use that <i>Big and Thick</i> stuff more often.  I'm nowhere near as big as Shane yet and I need to pick up the weight.\"<br>\r\nPuck nodded, \"Gotcha!  We'll go back to what we were doing before: three huge glasses of <i>Big and Thick</i> shake with every meal.\"<br>\r\nSam smiled, excited to get bigger, and ended up falling asleep to the feeling of Puck's hands massaging his belly.<br>\r\nPuck went upstairs, made sure everything was turned off, and came back into the basement.  He locked the door and pulled his shirt off, resting his head on Sam's big belly and falling asleep with his gainer buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam opens his eyes later on and yawns, feeling the weight of Puck on his softer, less swollen belly, and...</span></div></div>",

Such a nice big soft pillow to lay on.\" Puck lifted his head a little and jiggled the greatly softened belly. \"It's amazing to think you once had a flat six-pack stomach,\" Puck shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I admit I feel so much better now.\" <br>\r\n\"You don't have the stress of that anymore and you can eat.\" Puck played with Sam's belly more. \"Its looks good on you.\" <br>\r\n\"Really? I would NEVER have believed that, I thought you would be totally disgusted,\" Sam said sarcastically but in a nice tone. Puck smiled again.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Sammy's got bite. Well I do think its great.\" Puck continued rubbing in circles. \"So nice...\" Suddenly a growl went through the room and Puck smirked. <br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone's hungry. Well, I'll go make us some food.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool. I'll be lifting weights. After all, I'm going to need to be able to carry this,\" Sam said, smacking his belly getting Puck's full attention. <br>\r\n\"Good, very good. See you soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck went up the stairs, turning around and winking as he gave a thumbs up which Sam saw in the reflected mirror that was in the back. It was a floor to ceiling type mirror but only covered a small section. Walking up to it, Sam looked at himself. He was very different from when he started the year. Then he had been both buff and massively ripped and now he was even bigger but definitely not ripped.He hadn't checked himself out recently except for those videos, so he was a bit surprised at just how big around his stomach was or how his pecs, though large, were the barest edge of sagging a little. He was going to hace to work on that because while he wanted to be big, he didn't want to be a blob. Jiggling his belly he watched the slight bounce and he had to say whatever he felt about his upper chest, he thought the bouncing was pretty cool and that he could stick his fingers in. Turning around, he craned his head, looking at his butt which was definitely bigger and strangely better. Shrugging, Sam grinned at his reflection with satisfaction. He looked pretty good allround and he really was enjoying this now. Other than running, this wasn't going to make all that big of a difference and maybe he could change position, now that he was joining the ranks of bigger people which was weird considering he had never once been once been quite that. Big-mouthed perhaps because of his lips, but not quite big. Bending over, his stomach flopped over the waistline and his back really stood out. Straightening back up with a grunt, Sam patted himself, liking the vibrations in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to the weights, Sam walked over to the squat rack. He couldn't afford to let his arms, chest, or legs go weak and watching Puck the night before had been inspiring. He was really strong and Sam wanted to be like that or stronger but as big as possible. Putting the belt on, Sam loaded the weights on and got underneath as he lifted the bar. It took a couple of tries to maintain a center of balance since it had been a while since he squatted, even before meeting with Puck, and he staggered a bit. Once he did though, he found it was fairly easy and that the larger frame made it much easier to spread the weight around than he had ever remembered it being. Getting a rhythm going, Sam started squatting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck was upstairs humming to himself as he flipped pancakes. He had gotten out his 'kiss the cook' apron which normally would he would have not worn but he felt comfortable wearing it for Sam. After all, Sam was going to be part of the family. Puck forgot what day his sister was coming back from music camp but he hoped soon because he was missing the little twerp and he wanted to introduce his feedee Sam. She knew all about some of his private kinks. Although it was a little disturbing how much she knew. Still, he knew she would like Sam a lot and vice-versa. This was going to take a while and so Sam was going to be hungry once all the food was done, which was a good thing. Once the pancakes were done, Puck started on cooking the packages of bacon, enjoying the crackling and crisp smell as it cooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sam finished the first few sets of Squats, Sam was tired but felt pumped. Flexing his arms and chest, he was impressed with how solildly his muscles bulged. Wiping the sweat from his face, Sam racked the weights back up and went over to the dumbbells. Picking two up, he alternated, watching and admiring in the mirror how his arms moved next to the bulging gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast?\" Sam heard Puck call out sometime later after Sam went through a routine of squats, dumbbells, and dealifts. Sam made a muffled noise and Puck came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a sec to catch my breath,\" Sam said breathing hard. Puck went over to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of water which Sam grabbed and drank down. After a few more breaths, Sam was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was some workout. Even if I was out of practice I beat my old records. Hey, does your apron say 'kiss the cook' or is that just me?\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"You bet it does.\" Reaching out a hand, he wrapped it around Sam's arm. \"Impressive pump. Me likey. But are you going to be able to eat?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see won't we? Come on, I made you a nice huge breakfast.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sam said laughing at Puck's eagerness. \"I'm coming, I'm coming.\" Sam felt himself be dragged behind Puck up the stairs in Puck's eagerness at getting Sam to eat. That was an intense workout and made him very hungry but damn if it didn't make it hard to motivate himself to lift his arms. </span></div></div>",

As Sam was loading up his first plate, the doorbell rang, \"I'll be right back, Sammy.\"  Puck said, rubbing Sam's gut, \"Start filling up!\"  Puck got up and walked to the front door, opening it and surprised by who he saw.<br>\r\n\"Finn?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Puck!\"  Finn said, the same goofy smile on his face he always has, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" Puck said, \"Sam and I are eating breakfast.  You wanna come in?\"<br>\r\nFinn shrugged, \"Sure!  I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by.\"  Finn followed Puck back into the kitchen and approving smirk spread across his face when he saw Sam, who was eating as if he'd never eaten in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sam!  You're lookin' large!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  Sam mumbled through his pancakes as he kept eating.  Finn sat down next to him and lifted up his shirt, \"Damn, Puck, you're really working hard on Sam, aren't ya?  He's already gotten this big?\"<br>\r\nPuck eyed Finn cautiously, \"Yeah..  Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\nFinn gave Sam's growing belly a few pats as he slid over a couple of muffins to Sam, who picked on up and started eating, \"What?  A fellow admirer can't appreciate good work when he sees it?\"<br>\r\nSam swallowed the chunk of muffin he had, \"You're a feeder too?\"<br>\r\nFinn chuckled, \"Used to be.  I've been so busy with Rachel lately that I haven't had the time to enjoy helping guys gain like Puck does.  Last time I did it was when Puck and I helped Dave Karofsky become the massive bear he is today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, impressed and surprised, goes back to eating when Puck chimes in, \"Well, we've got a lot to do today.  Sam needs to finish breakfast and then I need to start on his lunch.  We'll see you at school, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!  Good luck, Sammy.  You're gonna get huge!\"  Finn said, heading out of the room.  Puck followed and opened the door, letting Finn out.  <br>\r\nHe stepped outside and closed the door behind him, \"What was that?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"What was what?\"  Finn replied.<br>\r\n\"THAT.  I've been trying to get you back into the feeding gig for months now and all of the sudden you have an interest in Sam's weight.  What gives?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess it can't hurt to be honest.\"  Finn said, \"I got a feeding job.\"<br>\r\n\"You did?  With who?\"<br>\r\nFinn smiled, \"Shane Tinsley.\"<br>\r\nPuck's eyes grew wide, \"SHANE?  Dude, he's already HUGE.  Why did he hire you to help him gain weight?\"<br>\r\n\"He knows about what you and Sam are doing.  How you're fattening Sam up so he can Mercedes back.  He's not going down without a fight, and he said he'll get as big as he needs to.  Good luck with Sam!  He'll need it.\"  Finn said, getting in his car and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck rubbed his forehead, thinking about what to tell Sam.

He and Finn must have been talking for longer than he thought or the shock of Finn doing such a bad friend thing really threw him off his game. Of all people, Finn was going to help Sam's rival Shane? It's not even like Shane needed it. The guy was ginormous as it was. Actually, he couldn't see what Finn was going to be able to do to help Shane much anyways so this wasn't the end of the world. Shane was going to need someone a lot smarter and more effective than Finn to make much of a difference considering he already was a giant and clearly did not need much help in the gaining weight arena. Puck was more pissed off at the fact that Finn knew and chose to be hired by Shane anyways, after all that jazz about being too busy with Rachel and Glee to do their fun thing. What a douche thing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sammy, good job,\" Puck said smiling as he rapped the table. \"I can't believe you ate everything already. That was quite fast. You must have been very hungry.\" Sam let out a belch as he rubbed his gut that was poking out of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrrppp, yeah, but not so much anymore.\" <br>\r\n\"Think you could still eat anymore?\" Puck asked. Sam shook his head.<br>\r\n\"N-uurrp-not really. I'm full.\" Puck rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Sam, you know I don't believe in that word when it comes to my clients. The whole point is to break the barrier and I know you've done it a whole bunch of times.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean stuffed so full of delicious food and soda I couldn't eat another bite,\" Sam said, laying on the flattery. <br>\r\n\"Mmh, much better. But I still need to check.\" Puck moved over and placed his hands on Sam's stomach, reveling in its full and solid packed nature. <br>\r\n\"I guess you are and that I can give you a break. I'm not in the right frame of mind anyhow because of Finn.\" <br>\r\n\"Finn? What did he do?\" <br>\r\n\"He's helping Shane,\" Puck blurted out before he realized it might be better not to tell.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sam asks shocked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because Shane knows why you're getting big and he plans to counter-act.\" Sam continued to sit their stunned. <br>\r\n\"But I don't get it, he's already a big dude, why does he need to get even bigger?\" <br>\r\n\"Don't know. Just to prevent you from impressing Mercedes or something I guess. I can't really imagine. Besides, we don't need to worry to much.\"<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Sam asked panicked. <br>\r\n\"Because Shane is even less of a threat with Finn helping him than he would be alone. Finn's heart isn't in the right place for it, he's out of practice, has other commitments with Rachel, and well...he's Finn and not the smartest tool in the toolbox. If anything without help, he'd probably screw Shane up which would only be for your benefit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Sam said. Puck laughed. <br>\r\n\"No need to worry. I'm sure Mercedes will be impressed with your progress because I sure am. I'm just mad that Finn would rather help Shane out than you, especially since we're all friends and in glee club together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, if you say so...\" Sam said. \"I could use a bit of help here,\" Sam said patting his exposed stomach invitingly. Puck's eyes gleamed brightly. <br>\r\n\"Oh you do, and I know just how,\" Puck said grinning as Sam ginned back. Grabbing Sam's arm, he yanked Sam to his feet and lead him over to the couch. Pulling at the hem of the shirt, Puck yanked it off, a smile crossing his face seeing Sam's big bare body, muscular and big with a bulging gut. Cracking his knuckles, Puck got to work massaging and rubbing Sam's belly, accompanined by the glorious soundtrack of each groan, moan, and belch of appreciation. Man it was good to be him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The week came and went extremely quickly for Sam and Puck and before they knew it they were back at school.  The two were in math class, but sadly their teacher had the seating chart arranged so that Sam and Puck weren't next to each other.  After hearing the news of Finn helping Shane Puck decided it was best to double the amount of gaining shake Sam would ingest with each meal. As class dragged on Sam was trying his best to get comfortable in his seat but no matter what he did it wasn't working.  Puck watched from the other side of the room, upset that he couldn't see Sam's thick, muscular, and chunky body as he maneuvered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Stupid pants...  you fit last week...</i>, he thought as he tried to pull his pants to a comfortable spot.  Sam let out a slight gasp, followed by a sigh of relief, as the button on his pants popped off and flew across the room, hitting the wall.  Sam's massive belly sagged out and relaxed.  Sam put his hand on it, happy to finally be comfortable in class.  A few minutes later and the bell rung, and before Sam could even get up Puck was standing next to him, \"Whoa, there, big guy.  Lemme help you up.\"  Puck wrapped his hand around Sam's gigantic bicep and hoisted his heavier friend up, giving Sam's enormous belly a few pats before jiggling it, \"We hit a MAJOR mile stone this weekend, Sammy.  I can't believe you're up by 80 pounds since last week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck took a step back and admired the much bigger Sam: His neck and traps were much bigger, and his double chin becoming even more prominent.  Sam's extra-large t-shirt looked painted onto his thick body.  His gigantic pecs strained the fabric across his chest, his biceps were so large that his sleeves looked like they would rip, and his belly was so big that he couldn't cover it all the way.  Sam's belly had begun to hang over his waistline, but only by a little, though it was still enough that his belly peeked out from under his skin-tight shirt.  Sam's waist had increased to a size 40 pants, but even those were becoming too small for the growing teen.  His thighs were extremely thick and muscular, as were his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had become so massive that if he were to stand in front of Puck, the mohawked teen wouldn't be visible.  \"You've really reached the point of musclechub, Sammy!  You're almost as big as Dave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rubbed his hand on the back of his massive neck, \"You keep comparing me to Dave but I haven't seen him since you put his through my 'workout.'  I really wanna compare sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck's face lit up at the thought, \"He can come over tonight!  I'll make a MASSIVE meal for my two special bears.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you think I weight?\"  Sam asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck scratched his chin, \"I'm pretty good at guessing weights...  I'd say you're about 310!\"  Sam wasn't sure he'd broken the 300's yet, but they'd find out at home.As the two left class, Puck walking behind Sam so he could stare at Sam's huge ass, the two ran into somebody unexpected. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hadn't seen Puck or Sam since he went to Puck's house that day a week or so back and Sam had grown by leaps and bounds. He wondered what on earth Puck had fed the big guy because there was no way it was possible for someone to grow that fast in only a week. Sam was absolutely huge and really close to Shane's size already. It was like a miracle, but not a good one for him. Shane was going to be displeased. Now he wasn't going to get paid and be able to afford everything for his and Rachel's wedding. Finn had to know though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck...how...how did you get Sam so big?\" Finn stammered, still shocked. Puck smirked at him and grinned as he waved his hand. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, that's a business secret, you understand. Just between me and my clients.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah c'mon please dude, that's like impossible!\"<br>\r\n\"Impossible, nothing is impossible. Isn't that like what we sing all the time about in Glee or something, following your dreams and making them come true?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but...dude, there's no way that can naturally happen. What is your secret. Steroids or something?\" Puck scoffed. <br>\r\n\"I don't deal in that and besides, although there is a possible similar side effect of steroids with the muscle-belly and all, it's not the same. As you pointed out, its not nomral stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, I knew it!\" Finn said triumphantly. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, but it isn't steroids, at least not the kind you're thinking of. Just give it up already and go back to Rachel.\" Finn nodded and turned. <br>\r\n\"Fine, I will for now. But I will figure out how you've done it.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever, knock yourself out trying,\" Puck said rolling his eyes. \"Me and Sam are going to be going out now for an earler dinner.\"<br>\r\n\"We are?\" Sam asked excitedly. He was beginning to really enjoy eating food and looking forward to Puck's sessions as Puck filled him up. Puck grinned and patted Sam's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are. Why not? Unless you're totally stuffed, you're hungry all the time now. It makes for quite a good show watching such a massive man-beast as yourself dig in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blushed a bit at that. \"It's still so weird to be called that,\" Sam said. Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Hey, you know me. I call it as I see it. And you're quite massive. Not as much as Dave, really big.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the mysterious Dave Karoffsky, when am I going to meet the new and improved him?\" Puck shrugged, \"<br>\r\nDon't know, sometime. For now let's just go, don't want to be late.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck walked the massive Sam down the hall behind him. Every eye seemed like it was watching them, or rather Sam in awe and surprise. Sam shifted uncomfortably a bit since he knew he was missing a button on his jeans and his gut was pushing out but Puck was enjoying it. Finally, the bell for the end of the day rang and people were heading out, eager to get away from the school, Puck and Sam included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need some new pants,\" Sam said as he looked down. Puck followed Sam's eye and grinned. <br>\r\n\"Of course, but for now, I think those will do just fine. We're going to the early bird dinner special. We're going to be spending plenty of time there so no need for changing just yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Sam said rubbing his hands together. 'Buffet right?\"<br>\r\n\"All-you-can-eat,\" Puck said grinning as he rubbed Sam's belly. <br>\r\n\"Good.\" Sam said relaxing. When they got to the buffet, they were quickly seated and Puck got up. <br>\r\n\"I'll be bringing some food for us. What you want?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam gave his gigantic belly a few rubs, thinking about what would taste best, \"You know what,\" Sam said, \"I don't care.  Bring me whatever you think will fatten me up the most!\"  A massive grin spread across Puck's face at those words.  One of his favorite things in the world was that moment when his client stops gaining for their original reason and started gaining because they wanted to experience the thrill of getting fatter.  Puck reached down and gave Sam's huge belly a nice, loving jiggle, \"Anything for you, Sammy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck made his way down the row of seats and was surprised by how empty the buffet was, there was only one other couple here and they were on the other side of the restaurant.  Today must just be an off day because normally this place is packed.  As Puck rounded the corner that lead from the tables to the food, he collided with something thick and hard, but at the same time extremely soft and squishy.  He fell back onto his ass, and was about to tell of whoever he ran into, but when he opened his eyes with greeted a familiar sight - the extremely large and furry belly of one Dave Karofsky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, sorry about that.  I wasn't watching where I wa- Puck?  Is that you?\"  Dave asked, a huge grin on his round face.  Before Puck could answer, Dave's gigantic bear paw-sized hand reached down and lifted Puck up from the ground like he weighed nothing.  \"Dave, dude, look at you!  You're fucking gigantic!\"  Gigantic doesn't even begin to describe the new Dave.  Puck hadn't seen Dave in almost a month, and at that time, Dave was around the same size Sam is now and he weighed 310 pounds, again, around the size Sam currently is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in that one month time frame Dave had really beefed up: his cheeks were adorably round and plump and he had a very large double chin that Dave's incredibly thick neck hid behind.  His traps were gigantic and helped to hide his massive neck and his very broad shoulders led down to the bigger pair of pecs Puck had ever seen in his life.  They were so massive and beefy that they strained the fabric of Dave's skin tight triple-extra-large polo to the point that it looked like it was about to rip.  Dave's enormous biceps were each the size of one of Sam's incredibly thick thighs, but, the biggest part of Dave's body was his gargantuan gut.  Dave's gut stuck out almost four feet in front of him and hung down over waistline, covering half of his crotch.  Dave's skin tight polo could barely contain the monstrous belly that Dave had - the shirt only reached down to his deep belly button.  Beneath that were Dave's massive thighs, which were each the size of Puck's torso and, just like his shirt, his shorts appeared to be painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave's round face blushed and he rubbed his humongous belly, \"Sure am!  What, do you honestly think I would quiet gaining and lifting after you stopped coaching me\"<br>\r\nPuck shook his head, \"No way, man, but GOD.  I never thought you'd get THIS big.  Turn around, let me see you from behind.\"  Dave's massive body turned around until his back was facing Puck, who's face lite up like a kid on christmas.  Dave's back was incredible wide, MUCH wider than Sam's, and Dave had the bigger, roundest bubblebutt that Puck had ever seen on a guy, \"Do you mind?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\nDave smiled, \"You never asked before when you were coaching me so why start now?\"<br>\r\nPuck reached out and gave huge ass one hard squeeze, \"Dude, they're so round and soft, but REALLY firm at same time.  You must be doing some crazy squats.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure have!\"  Dave said before turning around, Puck's face staring happily at Dave's huge belly.  Without asking, Puck's hands reached out and grabbed Dave's overhang, squeezing it before his hands slid up to the sides of Dave's gut, rubbing it and giving it a few playful jiggles, \"Who would have guessed that my little bear cub would grow up to be such a big, strong, sexy bear.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, \"You're the one who coached me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how much do you weight now?  Last time I saw you you were 310 pounds.  You're CLEARY not in the 300's anymore.\"  Puck asked, still rubbing Dave's furry belly.<br>\r\nDave patted his huge belly, \"Weighed myself this morning and the scale read 485!\"<br>\r\nPuck couldn't believe what he just heard, \"485!!  Dude, you gained 175 pounds in a MONTH?!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure have!  That 175 is about 40% muscle and 60% fat!\"  Dave said, flexing his monster arms.  \"So,\" he said, \"Who are you fattening up now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck crossed his buff arms, \"How do you know I have a client?\"<br>\r\nDave smirked, \"Because, this is your favorite place to stuff anybody who breaks 300.  I should know, you shoveled more chocolate down into my gut than I can count here.\"<br>\r\n\"True.  It's Sam Evans.\" Puck said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Trouty mouth Evans?  I can see why you'd fatten him up - those plump lips must look amazing when they're eating.\"<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.  Do you wanna eat with us?\"  Puck asked, hoping he'd say yes.<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Lemme go load up my plate and I'll meet you there.\"  Dave said, waddling towards the roast beef and mashed potatoes.<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"  Puck said, heading towards the pizza, \"OH, Dave, what course are you on?\"<br>\r\nDave smiled, \"5th!\"<br>\r\n\"Nice!\"</span></div></div>",

Sam raised an eyebrow at that. <br>\r\n\"Uh what?\"<br>\r\n\"Dave motherfing Karofsky! You would not believe it.\" At first Sam had no idea what Puck was talking about before he saw the shape making its way over.<br>\r\n\"Holy mother of Jesus and shizznuts,\" Sam said his mouth dropping open. The thing behind Puck was just massive, the biggest person Sam had ever seen and he wondered how someone who reached that size was even mobile. Sam was pretty big himself now but he felt tiny compared to that monsterous size. The thing nodded in greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave? Dave Karofsky?\" Sam said his mouth unable to keep from dropping. <br>\r\n\"Sup trouty mouth. I see my boy Puck's been taking care of you.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Sam replied. <br>\r\n\"He's good at what he does, very good. You sleeping with him?\" Sam's eyebrows rose shocked. <br>\r\n\"Huh? No!\" Dave shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Oh, too bad. You're been missing out and totally should. Puck digs the big as you know and is very talented and you've always had those big kissable lips.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh, thanks?\" Sam said not quite sure what to say to that. Dave got into the booth with his absolutely ladened tray, pressing against the back as his stomach brushed the table and filled up the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are getting smaller,\" he rumbled shaking his head. Puck smirked as he got in besides Sam pulling along two pizza boxes. <br>\r\n\"Nah, they're quite roomy for table booths but you're exceptional. What have you been up to lately Dave?\"<br>\r\n\"Eating, eating, football, eating, weights, eating, uh...eating, school, interning with my dad at the office...\"<br>\r\n\"You're going to be a lawyer? I didn't know you were interested.\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't either at first but he made me come in one day and I discovered I really liked it and was good at it. I also think the other people are scared of me there.\"<br>\r\n\"Of you? I wonder why?\" Puck said sounding so sincere for a moment that Sam and Dave almost believed him and gave simultaneous wtf looks at him before he started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah just kidding. Yeah, you'd be good at that. Heck, you wouldn't even need to say a word, the opposing side would give up with just a look at you and your client's case would be secured.\" Dave laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish but it certainly does help. How did you convince Sam to get big?\"<br>\r\n\"He came to me and still is hoping to impress Mercedes, defeat Shane, and also because he decided he enjoyed it, right Sammy?\" Sam blushed a bit.<br>\r\n\"I guess so, everything tastes so good now and being full and I admit Puck's massages makes it feel...well, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I know.\"<br>\r\n\"I hear Finn and Rachel are getting married,\" Dave said. Sam looked surprised. <br>\r\n\"How do you know? You don't go to our school anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Word gets around, and its not like its surprising. The hobbit's affection for frankie and vice-versa is so obvious it burns.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah,\" Sam said. \"I had been living at her house but it got so love-filled over there that it was almost a relief to be kicked out.\"<br>\r\n\"You've been living at Rachel's? Why'd they kick you out?\" Dave asked sounding surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't actually kick me out but it was pretty much 'you wouldn't mind leaving?' and I was 'no, not really, you and Finn need your private time to do...things' and well I was good getting out of there. Besides, I'm living with Puck now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Yeah. I can only guess he used that shake stuff with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, its obviously effective but I suspect it does have a permanent effect on the body afterwards, not that I particularly mind but you know. I just hope it will slow down eventually. I gained 175 lbs a month off that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month?! 175 lbs?!\" Sam was shocked for a moment before he blinked. \"Well, dang, Puck you sure there are no permanent side-effects?\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard there wasn't and supposedly should be safe outside of extreme growth apparently. I'll talk to the guy later to see if there is any change on that but apparently it should be without the normal health risks for a bit longer anyways. Here, have some pizza.\" Puck slid the slices over and Sam found himself drooling a bit. He looked over at Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you eating?\" he asked looking at Dave's full plate. Dave looked down. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, haha, can't believe I forgot,\" Dave and Sam both dug in and Puck leaned back, eagerly looking back and forth as the two dug into their food. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Puck watched, he quickly realized just how much Dave's appetite has grown.  The massive man had already finished his gigantic plate of meat and potatoes before Sam was even done with his second slice of pizza.  Dave started to get up, but Puck stopped him, \"No, no.  You sit back and relax.  I'll handle the refills for both of you.\"  Puck said, happily patting Dave's gigantic stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck walked off to refill Dave's plate, Dave placed both hands on the top of his massive belly, \"So, Evans.  How's football going?\"<br>\r\nSam blinked, swallowing down the last bite of his fourth slice, \"Oh, I'm not on the team this year.  When I moved back I tried to get Coach Beiste to let me back on, but she had already filled the whole team.  I considered joining synchronized swimming, which was the only team that had an opening, but I declined.\"<br>\r\nAn image of Sam's new body, all beefy and thick with muscles and fat, squeezed into a skin tight speedo appeared in Dave's mind for a bit, but he quickly pushed it out when he realized he was getting a little too excited in his pants, \"Oh, well that sucks.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam said, \"But, on the bright side, all this added bulk I'm putting on will be great for the football team next year!\"  Sam took another huge bite of his next slice.<br>\r\nDave grinned, \"Oh, totally!  I'm a tank on the field, not gonna lie.\"<br>\r\nSam laughed as he swallowed down the slice and went for the next, \"I believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Puck came back pushing a cart that had eight massive plates of the exact same potatoes and pot roast Dave had been eating, \"I thought it would be easier to bring you a whole bunch at once than to have to go back after every plate.\"<br>\r\nDave grinned, \"Good thinking!  Come to Papa!\"  He said, reaching both of his massive bear paws out.  Puck placed all eight plates in front of Dave and he quickly dug in.  <br>\r\nBy the time Sam had finally finished both pizzas, Dave had devoured all 8 plates and Puck was off to get more for both of them.<br>\r\n\"How many more can you eat?\"  Sam asked, wondering just how much Dave could fit into the massive gut of him.<br>\r\nDave happily patted said massive gut, \"Oh, trust me, I can still eat a LOT.  What about you?\"<br>\r\nSam rubbed his own belly, \"If Puck keeps bringing me those same pizzas, I'd say maybe three or four more?\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, \"I remember when I could only eat five or six pizzas.  I sure was a light weight.\"  Dave noticed how Sam's t-shirt was so tight it looked painted on, and how his belly poked out at the bottom, \"Starting to outgrow your clothes too, huh?\"<br>\r\nSam blushed a bit, \"Yeah.  My pants button popped in class today because of my belly.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, which was very deep and hearty, \"To be honest, I love the feeling of my buttons popping.  It reminds me that I'm bigger than I used to be.\"  He said, tugging at his polo, which refused to cover his belly button and furry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck returned with the 16 plates for Dave and, as Sam suspected, four pizzas.  He and Dave quickly started eating, and once Sam started on his last pizza, Dave had just finished his last plate.  Puck got up again to go get more, and Dave burped before saying, \"Puck, wait.\"<br>\r\nPuck turned back around, \"What, you can't be full already?  Not a big, strong bear like you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Dave said, \"but I want desert.  You know what I like?\"<br>\r\nPuck's face lit up and he hurried off to go grab as much cheesecake as possible.  Once he was gone, Dave turned to Sam, \"So, Sammy boy!  How much do you weight?\"<br>\r\nSam swallowed the last bite of pizza before starting on another, \"I weighed in at 310 this morning.  You?\"<br>\r\n\"485!\"  Dave said, proud of his weight.<br>\r\n\"485!!  You're almost 500 pounds!\"  Sam said, amazed.  Though, he knew he shouldn't be.  Dave was the biggest man he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n\"Yep!  That's why weight lifting is so crucial in out gaining lives.  How else will I stay mobile if my muscles can't handle it?\"  Dave said, flexing the biggest arm Sam had ever seen in his life.<br>\r\n\"So, do you plan on gaining past 500?\"  Sam asked, curiously.  He wondered what life would be like at Dave's size and was even considering gaining up to that.<br>\r\n\"Sure do!  As much as I can!\"  Dave said, rubbing his bloated belly, which was now pressing against the table due to the 25 plates of buffet sized meat and potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Puck emerged from out of nowhere with the cart he'd been using, which had 15 cheesecakes on it, \"10 for Dave and 5 for Sam!\"  He said, eager to push Sam past his limit, hoping that Dave's massive size made Sam considering a gigantic gain.</span></div></div>",

He also was a big bear too.\"<br>\r\n\"Stop speaking nonsense Sammy, spit it out already,\" Puck said not in the mood for dribble when he could be watching bears eat.<br>\r\n\"You'll get even more stuck then you already probably are and we should probably get out of the booth before Dave gets wedged real tight in there that it would be impossible.\" Puck and Dave looked down then at Dave's belly pushed up pretty hard against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a point there,\" Puck said and sighed as he put the cheesecake back. \"Hang on we're going to get you out. Come on Sam.\" Sam tried to stand up but barely got up before he fell back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in a bit,\" Sam said. \"I'll just roll out of here, literally.\" Puck smirked at that before turning his mind to solve the problem of Dave. <br>\r\n\"Well hang on, I'll be back in a jiffy with the help here. They're used to situations where this happens.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sam asked surprised. <br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not one as big as Dave now probably but he was a regular so they'll be ready to help one of their favorite or hated patrons.\"<br>\r\n\"I feel so loved,\" Dave said sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"Heh, you eat them dry and arouse strong feelings of passion,\" Puck said winking as he left. They waited there for a few moments while Puck was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awkward,\" Dave said shifting a bit. \"Only downside is not getting out of booths and stuff. Its a good thing a drive a big vehicle as that's the only thing that's going to take me anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, true enough,\" Sam said. \"It's pretty weird but I love it, the feeling of being bigger. Well, when not in the stages of wanting to either severely hurt Puck or die in intestinal agony after one of his stuffings.\" Dave smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does love those. Puck especially loves the big feeders he works on. Puck takes feederism into an art.\"<br>\r\n\"He certainly is obessive.\"<br>\r\n\"And very well endowed.\" At Sam's raised eyebrows Dave shrugged, \"I meant at his feeding gift but trust me he also is the other way as well. That is also s gift.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Sam said and Dave smirked. <br>\r\n\"Couldn't resist taking a look either? It's gorgeous yes?\"<br>\r\n\"...Yes, yes it is,\" Sam muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" asked Puck as he came back with a couple of guys from the kitchen. <br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Sam said at the same time as Dave said \"your schlong\" Puck laughed at that.<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" he asked mischeviously. <br>\r\n\"Only where to put it,\" Dave said grinning as Sam turned red. <br>\r\n\"Can we please stop this kind of talk please? It's embarassing. Let's just focus on Dave shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a rough going. Dave was wedged in pretty tight and no amount of tugging or pulling was able to get him out. Finally someone had the brilliant idea to use slippery stuff to slide him on out. Using soap, grease, mayonaise, ranch dressing (Sam suspected that the kitchen staff was taking a little too much fun out of this) they greased Dave up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels really weird and slimy,\" he said as they finished. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll be out of there in no-time!\" Puck said enthusiastically as he wiped his hands on his pants. With the help of some of the kitchen staff and a bit of pushing, pulling, and grunting, they finally pulled Dave out of the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Next time, don't use a table booth,\" muttered one of the kitchen staff helpers. \"Freaking pig.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard that!\" Puck yelled. <br>\r\n\"You were meant to dope!\" Yelled the guy back. \"Always coming in here with one of your prize fattened hogs eating everything, its sick and-\" the rest was cut off with a visit from one of Puck's fists which sent the guy sprawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else?\" he asked casusally as he inspected his fingernails for invisible dirt.<br>\r\n\"No, we're all good,\" the other staff member said. \"Danny just forgot his manners today.\" <br>\r\n\"Good,\"Puck said as he strode over to the cart. \"Mind if I take some home?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the other waiter said bowing. \"Need any help to your vehicle?\" Puck thought for a bit before shrugging. <br>\r\n\"Sure why not.\" With the help of some of the staff who wasn't Danny, they made it to the vehicle and all packed up. <br>\r\n\"Where too?\" he asked and Dave shrugged. <br>\r\n\"My house is good and has more space than either of yours.\" <br>\r\n\"Yours it is then. That was fun wasn't it?\" <br>\r\n\"Depends on your definition of fun,\" Sam countered. <br>\r\n\"Touche. And it's only going to continue soon. After all, I've got cheesecakes!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh!  One sec, guys, I just got an idea!\"  Puck said before hopping out of the driver seat of Dave's monster-sized truck.  Sam was sitting in the back seat, rubbing his bulging belly, \"Uggh..  I think I'm way to full to eat these cheesecakes.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled as he wiped his belly off with paper towels he kept in the car, doing his best to get the mess off of him, \"More for me, then.  I'm still starving.\"<br>\r\nSam couldn't believe what he just heard, \"What?  You ate three times as much as I did!\"<br>\r\nDave tossed the messy paper towels out the window, \"Those rude employee's can clean that up.  Huh?  Oh, yeah, what I ate in there was nothing compared to what I can actually eat.  Like I said, if you can't eat those cheesecakes I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the back door opened and Puck set down 15 more full cheesecakes, \"I figured since they're terrified of me I could just grab a few more!\"  He got back into the front seat and looked at his two humongous bears, \"What were you two talking about?\"<br>\r\nSam was about to tell Puck he doesn't think he could eat 10 cheesecakes by himself, but Dave jumped in, \"We were talking about how huge your cock is and how tight and buff your ass is.\"<br>\r\nSam's face turned bright red and he blurted out, \"Dave!\"  Dave's chubby face grinned back at Sam before Puck turned around, \"Really now?  And here I thought you only had it out for the ladies.\"<br>\r\nSam looked out the window, his face still bright red, \"I.. I don't know...\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Well, big guy, no need to worry.  There ain't no weight limit on the Puckasaurus Express.  You ever wanna fool around just say the word.\"  Puck pointed his thumb at Dave, \"This guy knows.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do.\"  Dave said, grinning, \"Now, lets head home.  I wanna shower before we stuff those cheesecakes down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck drove, Sam stared out the window and relaxed, rubbing his belly which bounced and jiggled as the car drove.  His mind was drifting to thoughts he had never really thought about before.  Could he be attracted to men?  He'd gone his entire life only attracted to woman, but maybe things were changing for him.  Puck was definitely attractive and Sam knew just how much Puck lusted for his bigger body, and Dave was an entirely different kind of sexy.  He was HUGE, powerful, commanding.  Sam scratched the back of his head, thinking.  Maybe he was that one thing.  What was it called?  Bisexual, that's it.  Maybe he was bisexual.  Sam didn't have a chance to think more about it because they had reached Dave's house.  All three of them loaded out of the car, and despite the massive meal still digesting in his even more massive gut, Dave was the first person out of the car and at the front door, unlocking it before heading inside to shower.  As Puck unloaded the car, Sam turned to him, \"Did you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Dave?\"  Puck asked, carrying 15 cheesecakes in his arms, \"He might weight almost 500 pounds, Sammy, but those thighs of his are powerful and he has to be fast on the football field.\"<br>\r\nSam had completely forgotten about Dave's football skills, which clearly have gotten better since he's put on almost 300 pounds.  Sam made his way inside and was surprised by the sheer size of Dave's house.  To compensate for the ever growing teenage bear, everything in Dave's house was gigantic.  The sofa made Sam's now very large and round ass look tiny, compared to how he took up half of the one at Puck's house.  The TV was gigantic, as was the table, fridge, everything!  The entire house was one big bear cave where everything was the perfect size for Dave's gargantuan body.  The fireplace had a warm blaze crackling inside of it, and Sam sat down on the couch, his large backside barely covering one cushion, felt the warmth of the house take over and he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half passed by before Sam was woken up by a large hand shaking his shoulder.  Sam opened his sleepy eyes to see Puck, sitting next to him and smiling, \"Morning, sunshine.\"<br>\r\nSam yawned, \"Sorry about that...  I fell asleep.\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Hey, it's all good.  Sleep does a fat belly wonders.\"  He said, reaching down and squeezing Sam's jiggly belly, \"You're metabolism is really picking up, Sammy.  You've almost finished digesting that huge meal from the buffet.\"<br>\r\nSam chuckled, \"Huh...  Guess so.\"  Sam sat back and smiled as Puck gleefully rubbed, jiggled, and played with Sam's belly fat.<br>\r\nJust then, Dave walked out of the hall wearing only a pair of his boxers that were so tight on his enourmas waistline, titanic thighs, and gargantuan ass that they looked more like a pair of briefs that boxers.  \"Hey!\"  He said in a loud, dominating voice, \"I can forgive Sam because he's never been here before, but you know the rules, Puck.  Underwear only in the Bear Cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smacked his forehead, \"Sorry, Dave!  You better undress too, Puck, or else Dave'll sit on you.  Actually...  that sounds kinda hot.\"  Puck stood up despite and peeled off his clothing, revealing his cut, muscular body.  Sam did the same, until he was down to just his skin tight Spider-Man undies.  Dave licked his lips at the sight of Sam's meaty ass packed tightly into his briefs, \"I could just stare at that for days!\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously.\"  Puck said, giving his ass a squeeze and making Sam's face turn an even brighter shade of red.<br>\r\n\"Can we just eat now?\"  Sam asked, and he and Dave sat down.  Dave's body was so big that it took up one and a half couch cushions, when Sam could barely fill one.  It took two trips, but Puck returned with all 30 cheesecakes he had gotten from the buffet.  It a couple of tries, but Puck figured out a routine that would work best for his two bears; he would simply feed both of them a slice at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 4 of Sam's 10 cheesecakes, Sam had to call it quits.  His stomach wasn't as big as Dave's and he was still full from the buffet.  He expected Puck to protest and start force-feeding him, but instead, Puck took the remaining 6 cheesecakes he didn't eat and started to feed them to Dave instead.  After a couple of minutes of bloated bliss, Sam fell asleep on his side of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Sam woke up to find a blanket on him and a pillow under his head.  He was about to call out either Dave or Puck's names, but Puck came around the corner, \"Oh, sweet, you're up!  I'll go tell Dave and we can do a weigh in!  Meet us in the bathroom.\"  Sam gets up and groggily makes his way into the enourmas bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Taking out Dave's scale, Puck set it down and pointed at Sam. \"Okay, you first Sammy boy. \" Sam look sceptically at the device. <br>\r\n\"You sure that could stand my weight without me crushing it, let alone Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck said. \"It surprisingly takes more than it looks.\" Sam got on and tried to lean down but couldn't see over his belly the numbers. <br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" Puck looked down. <br>\r\n\"Woo, 320 awesome.\" Puck rubbed Sam's belly fondly. Puck then motioned over to Dave. \"Your turn.\" Dave managed to somehow balance his feet on the scale. Puck looked down and his eyes widened. \"Holy mother of...no f-ing way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Dave asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"It says 520.\" Puck looked over. \"Wow, that was sure a big jump! I've come to a realization. I can no longer be your feeder...\" Puck said. Dave and Sam both jumped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But you...?\" Dave started before Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"Relax. I can't be both your guys feeder without help. The thought of sharing you with someone else is a bit repugnant I admit but it is hard even for me to feed both of you effectively without a bit of help as I saw last night. So I'm going to bring someone in to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Who?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"You don't know him yet. I only recently discovered his existence myself so maybe I'm just hoping too much but I'm thinking of my brother Jake. Actually, half-brother but he might as well be my brother. Just have to see if he's interested but if he's anything like me he probably will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Sam said. Puck pulled out his phone and a crumpled piece of paper. <br>\r\n\"Now let's see...okay, here it is. Jake's number. Google is an amazing source.\"<br>\r\n\"As well as scary,\" Dave said under his breath and Sam nodded. Puck dialed and after a few moments he started talking.<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this Jake? This is your brother Puck...\" There was silence for a moment and then loud noises coming through the phone. Puck looked at them and then left the room to continue his call privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Dave trailed.<br>\r\n\"Smash Brothers?\" Dave asked. <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sam grinned and they went to go play Smash Brothers with Dave being Bowser and Sam Falco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of rounds, Puck came in and grinned. \"There, that's settled.\"<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Sam asked pausing to Dave's frustration right before Bowser was going to smash Falco again. <br>\r\n\"Well, Jake was as surprised to find out he had a brother as I was and he's going to come over to meet us in a bit.\"<br>\r\n\"So, I guess he's going to help or something?\" Dave rumbled. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guessed right that Puckerman's love feeding since I do, my sister does, he does, my mom does, my aunts and grandparents do...\" <br>\r\n\"Not your dad...?\" Sam trailed off nervously and Puck's eye twitched and his smile curdled. <br>\r\n\"No, he's not a Puckerman, he married into the family name. Don't bring him up please.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Sam said and Puck grinned again.<br>\r\n\"I forgive you so keep doing what your doing while I meet my brother for the first time. I hope he likes me,\" Puck said beginning to worry, Dave laughed.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're awesome. He's going to love you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, yeah, he will.\" Puck said pumping himself up. \"He will like me, he will like me, he will like me...\" He left the room still talking to himself. <br>\r\n\"Should we help him?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Nah, he'll be fine. Besides, I need to get back to kicking your ass at Brawl,\" Dave said grinning.<br>\r\n\"It's not over till it's over,\" Sam muttered as he unpaused.<br>\r\n\"Just keep telling yourself that trouty mouth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the doorbell rang and Puck rushed to it. <br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he said, being cool despite the fact that he was all dancing and giddy inside.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the guy outside said offering out his hand. \"I guess you must be Noah? I'm Jake.\"<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Puck,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Okay Puck,\" Jake said grinning as Puck shook his hand. \"It's good to finally meet you.\"<br>\r\n\"Likewise. Come on it,\" Puck said as he lead Jake into the house. <br>\r\n\"Wow, this is where you live?\" Jake said astonished and wide-eyed.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh no, this is Dave's house.\" Jake looked at Puck.<br>\r\n\"There a reason you're only in underwear?\"<br>\r\n\"Bachelor house rule?\" Puck said and Jake shrugged accepting it.<br>\r\n\"So you needed my help with something?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, call it a little bonding experience as well.\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't as muscular as his older half-brother, but he was getting there.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  See, heres the thing.  You're a Puckerman, and we Puckerman come from a long line of people who enjoys helping other people get bigger.\"  Puck said, trying to ease Jake into the idea, the way he was.<br>\r\n\"Bigger?  Like, a professional workout coach?\"  Jake asked, an idea he could get behind.<br>\r\n\"Exactly!  Only not just with muscle.\"  Puck said, \"There are some people who want to get bigger in other ways too, and its a Puckerman's job to be able to understand how to help anybody get bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Other ways?  Like, weight gaining?\"  Jake asked, starting to realize what he was saying.<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Exactly!  I have two friends who are gainers, they're both gaining muscle AND fat, but both are doing it in two different ways.  I can't handle it on my own, and I need your help.\"<br>\r\nJake scratched the back of his neck, \"I don't know, dude.  This is kind of weird...\"<br>\r\n\"I felt the same way,\" Puck said, \"But once you start, you realize its what you've always been meant to do.  It's in your DNA.\"<br>\r\nJake signed, as he pulled off his shorts, standing there in his boxers, \"Okay, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck lead Jake into the other room, and Jake responded the exact same way most people do at the sight of Dave and Sam's size.  He was SHOCKED that people could even get that big!  As he stared, slack jawed, Puck chuckled, \"Jake, these are my two best friends; Sam and Dave.  Dave is the bigger one.\"<br>\r\n\"Sup!\"  Dave said, grinning at the sight of another very attractive Puckerman boy.  Sam leaned forward, so Jake could see him over Dave's massive body, and waved at him.<br>\r\n\"You...  You guys are HUGE!\"  Jake said, still stunned.<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\"  Dave said, rubbing his belly with one hand and flexing the biggest bicep Jake had ever seen.  His eyes flickered to Sam, who was also flexing his huge arms.<br>\r\nJake was stunned by the sizes of these and Puck finally stepped in, \"See, Jake!  These guys are MASSIVE and I can't do all this work by myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, these two are STILL gaining?!\"  Jake asked, shocked again.<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"  Puck said, leading Jake in more.  Jake was standing next to Dave and watched as Puck squeezed himself between them, his body happily trapped between their strong muscles and soft, blubbery bodies, and the size of these two made Puck look tiny.  Puck put his hand on Dave's stomach, \"Davey, here, was a 200 pound little nothing trying to bulk up for the football team.  Now he's a 530 pound beast that the other players are terrified of.  And Sam,\"  he put his other hand on Sam's stomach, \"Sammy has already hit the big 320 and is doing his best to win back an ex.\"<br>\r\nSam's eyebrows knitted in concentration, \"She broke up with her boyfriend but is mulling things over still.  He's also trying to win her back.\"<br>\r\nPuck rubbed his shoulder, \"You'll get there, buddy.  Anyway, with these two I can't cook, feed, massage, AND work them out evenly.  Will you help me Jake?  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed, \"I guess... if it IS the Puckerman way.\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"GREAT!  Since this is your first time as a feeder/coach, I think you should take Dave; just feed him as much as he wants so you can get the hang of it.  Just remember to give his body all of the attention it deserves!\"</span></div></div>",

After Dave let go he introduced himself again to Sam. \"So yeah I'm Jake, Puck's half-brother. It's sure...something to meet you guys. You guys are huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your brother takes good care,\" Dave said grinning. \"You're sure to do the same.\"<br>\r\n\"I can only hope to do so,\" Jake said. \"But uh..what do you guys eat?\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty much anything and everything,\" Puck said grinning. \"Though of course some foods are preferred over others. You can cook right?\"<br>\r\n\"A bit...\" Jake said. \"Not much but I'm pretty good at what I do know.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool, you'll be able to help me and even learn new recipes as well. Anyhow, we should get started since cooking will take a while. Sam and Dave will have snacks in the meantime which should last them for a little bit while we work.\" Puck reached into a bag and placed two massive bowls of chips out along with a couple two liter bottles of soda and leftover cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on earth did you find cheesecake?\" Dave asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just discovered we had some left somehow so yeah here's the rest.\" Puck turned to look at Jake. \"Dave is a cheesecake fanatic, along with everything else, but especially cheesecake. Let's just say you do not want to get between him and a cheesecake.\" Puck lead Jake to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get them so big?\" Jake asked when they were inside. <br>\r\n\"Food, food, lots of food, and a bit of handy-dandy weight gain powders, proteins, mixes, and experimental compounds.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. They are fine right?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would shock you but yes, they are extraordinarily healthy for the weight range. Other than being extremely big the doctors when we went for a checkup couldn't find anything wrong. It freaked them immensely which was fun but after all the tests were done it turned out they were more healthy than most people are at far lower weights and while they'd never be able to run a marathon, they're able to be do most physical stuff without being afraid of keeling over and having a heart attack. Health is of the utmost importance when gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, although I'm having trouble imagining those two running,\" Jake said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Only when they're not full. Then they'd be going nowhere,\" Puck added. \"So you know how to make lasagna?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then it's time for your first cooking lesson. It's rather simple and cost-effective which is useful when dealing with one's gaining clients...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Dave amused themselves by turning the wii back on and playing brawl again while they snacked on the bags of chips. <br>\r\n\"This is the life, eh Sammy?\" Dave said, rubbing his stomach for a moment. \"Just hanging out and playing stress-free. Well, other than the stress caused by going to kick your butt at this game but you know, not the bad stress of people judging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam grunted when Dave's Bowser slammed Falco off-stage. \"Dang you're good at Bowser.\"<br>\r\n\"Favorite character plus he reminds me of me.\"<br>\r\n\"I totally see that,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"So Jake seems nice.\" Dave said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does.\" The conversation stopped for a while as they played a couple more rounds and filling up their chip bowls when they ran out. They lost track of time in the game before a coughing sound came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Hey, so who is ready for dinner?\" Puck asked. Sam and Dave turned around eagerly. <br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Multi-layer lasagna and chocolate fudge cake.\" Puck put the plates down. <br>\r\n\"Sounds awesome,\" Sam said licking his lips. Dave nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"So remember,\" Puck said turning to Jake. \"Feed them slowly or at whatever pace they're going at. Be gentle, encouraging, seduce them into taking that next bite.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, got it,\" Jake said. Puck grinned and cut the first section of lasanga out and put it on a plate and then fed bits and pieces to Sam who eagerly had his mouth open and ready. After watching Puck a few more times, Jake followed his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't bite,\" Dave rumbled seeing Jake's hesitation. \"Intentionally. Unless you want me to of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good.\" Jake said and brought the first piece up to Dave's mouth. \"So uh hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Dave said and when the first mouthful went in Dave grinned. \"That's pretty good.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh uh thanks. Yeah, me and Puck worked on it for a while, so weird by the way saying that since you know it's our last name and we're related...\" Jake rambled for a bit as he tried to keep from spilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cute,\" Dave said in between bites. \"When you ramble.\" Jake just looked up and blushed. Wondering what's going on Puck looked over. <br>\r\n\"Hey, no flirting with my brother Dave!\" Puck said and he and Dave laughed when Jake obviously blushed looking down. It wasn't very physically visible considering Jake's darker complexion but he couldn't hide the other part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shut up,\" Jake muttered as he continued to spoonfeed pieces of food towards Dave. Puck turned back and continued working on Sam. </span></div></div>",

Puck made sure that Sam was so busy eating he never got to say a word; presenting him with massive bite after massive bite of the huge lasagna he and Jake had made every chance he got.  Sam had one arm on the couch's large armrest, the other relaxing against the back of the couch, and he moaned happily as Puck continued to stuff his belly.  Once the last bite of Sam's lasagna passed his big lips, he opened his mouth for more, and when there wasn't any Sam let out a little whine, \"That's it?  I want more...\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Those are my three favorite words to hear.\"  Puck set the plate down and placed both hands on Sam's belly, running his hands over it and smiling, \"Of course you can have more, Sammy.  Just relax for a bit while I admire my work.\"  Puck smiled as his hands glided over Sam's belly, which was still very soft and squishy with very little give to it.  Sam's belly still had plenty of room for food and Puck planned on feeding him until his belly was at full capacity.  Puck reached out and grabbed a 3-liter of grape soda, his free hand patting and jiggling Sam's belly as he did so.  Puck relaxed against the small bit of space on the couch between him and his brother and unscrewed the full bottle; holding it up to Sam's lips, \"Drink up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took the bottle in both of his large hands and placed it to his lips, gulping down huge swallows of the sugary, bubble-y, purple drink.  As Sam gorged himself on soda, Puck rubbed his belly, which he could feel tighten a little bit as it becomes filled with 3 liters of soda.  Sam took one break as he downed the drink, stoping halfway to get some air into his lungs, before going back to swallowing down the soda.  The bottle made a crinkling noise as Sam sucked out the air inside of it before pulling it back and letting out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men in the room laughed, but they all quickly went back into their own little worlds, the feeders focusing on their bears.  Puck rubbed Sam's belly, feeling it for pressure, \"You're still so hungry, Sammy.  Ready for dessert?\"  Sam nodded and Puck instantly began stuffing Sam with his chocolate cake, watching lustfully as Sam scarfed down the cake, Puck's free hand reaching up and squeezing Sam's massive pecs and his nipples, something that no longer bothered Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the couch, Jake\u2019s muscular body (though not as muscular as Puck\u2019s) was pressed up against the solid yet squishy torso of Dave.  One hand was resting on Dave\u2019s gigantic belly while his other carefully fed the massive bear lasagna.  As soon as Dave took a bite, Jake would lower his fork to the plate sitting on top of Dave\u2019s massive belly and get other.  Unlike Sam, who had one lasagna, Puck and Jake made sure to cook four for Dave, their very own ever-growing black hole.  It was challenging at first for Jake, who could barely keep up with Dave\u2019s demands to be fed, but after the second lasagna, Jake got the hang of it and was feeding Dave at a pace Dave agreed with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the final bite of lasagna was gone, Jake gave Dave his very own 3-liter of soda, which Dave instantly began drinking, as Jake started to prepare dessert.  </span></div></div>",

Puck chuckled as he rubbed Sam's stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally full huh...you're getting more and more impressive as time goes on,\" Puck chuckled. \"So big and beefy and content, it makes my feeder heart proud.\" Sam let out another huge belch when Puck squeezed down and whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know not do do that,\" Sam hissed at the pressure. \"I'm fucking about to explode here!\" Puck just smiled.<br>\r\n\"Just teasing man, feeling how nice and big this thing is. I don't want you to pop.\" Puck turned to Jake who was bringing in the dessert. <br>\r\n\"So how does it feel bro? Feeding two big studs here?\" Jake lookd back at Puck.<br>\r\n\"It's really something. Feeding someone and watching them enjoy your food is...wow.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is. Sam here is finished so we just need to finish good old Dave here up.\" <br>\r\n\"Dave is freaking Goliath,\" Jake said brining up the first piece of cheesecake to Dave's mouth. \"How much does it take to fill you?\"<br>\r\n\"A lot,\" Dave answered. \"And I'm never filled without Puck around.\"<br>\r\n\"It must be helluv expensive to feed you,\" Jake said bringing up another piece. Puck moved beside him and picked up a piece as well.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it kind of is I admit but it's still a lot more affordable than being at the hospital for long and well, my dad loves me.\" Dave finished Jake's piece and Puck took the next turn with his piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're lucky you have an awesome dad. My-our dad\" Puck said looking at Jake, \"abandoned us and is a womanizing cheating asshole who only comes over for money.\" <br>\r\n\"Puck just shut up and feed me the damn cheesecake already,\" Dave mocked growled but it had a hint of serious tone to it as well. Puck just smirked. <br>\r\n\"My pleasure,\" he said as he brought it up and let Dave lap from his fingertips. \"Mmmh it must be good,\" he teased shifting his hand a little. He stepped back and let Jake offer his piece when Dave finished. Eventually all the pieces of cheesecake were gone and Dave leaned back with a groan of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh so good, I am really glad your my feeder again, just isn't the same without you.\" Dave let out a tremendous belch and patted his wide stomach. \"I really missed your treatments as well. You have some frigging amazing finger talent.\" Puck grinned as he moved over and rubbed Dave's stomach. \"Glad to be of service. It makes me happy your happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull,\" Dave said. \"You like to see people stuffed to the gills barely able to move after a delightfully big meal and rub their beautiful stomachs which you've said a bunch of times.\" Puck grinned as he kneaded Dave's full stomach bringing out a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too I admit. Jake, take care of Sam for a moment. I'll switch places with you in a few moments.\" Jake grinned as he moved over to Sam and lightly placed his fingers on the globular stomach. Sam eyed him as Jake looked over at Puck and copied his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this right?\" Jake asked as he copied what Puck was doing. Puck looked over briefly and nodded and returned back to Dave. Jake smiled as he slowly but then with more confidence repeated what his brother was doing which caught a gasp from Sam as the pleasure set in. Not quite as skilled as Puck but Jake was pretty decent and Sam moaned in relief and enjoyment as Jake's fingers caressed and massaged his full stomach. Jake was smiling as he glanced back over at Puck who grinned and nodded back as they massaged their bears. Eventually Puck got up and tapped Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch time. Me with Sam, you with Dave.\" Jake grinned and confidently nodded as he moved to Dave and they repeated the same massage. After a while and another switch or two, Sam and Dave were lulled asleep finally having been too full earlier. Puck and Jake moved to the kitchen and cleaned up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Puck asked at Jake smiling. <br>\r\n\"It's...awesome!\" Jake cried grinning. \"I had no idead it was so much fun.\"<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Puck said grinning as well. \"Did I or did I not tell you?\"<br>\r\n\"You sure told me,\" Jake said grinning. \"But man its exhausting work. No wonder you were desperate for me to come in.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just Sam is one thing, but Sam and Dave together is something not even a master feeder like myself could do on my own. But I only trust other Puckermans.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you trust me,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"I'm glad to and that we're going to be spending a lot more time together.\"<br>\r\n\"Amen to that brother,\" Jake said. Puck grinned and said that as well. Puck got up, enjoying the admiring glances of his younger half-brother who was looking up to him. <br>\r\n\"Pretty sweet huh?\" I'm going down to work out for a bit, wanna join with?\"<br>\r\n\"How do you even have any energy left?\" Jake wondered in amazement. <br>\r\n\"Not much but enough to get a good enough workout in, pump the guns and all. Tis the best time to do so.\" Jake sighed as he went to the couch. <br>\r\n\"Maybe later, I need a nap and am downright exhausted.\"<br>\r\n\"Kay, see you later,\" Puck said wandering down. Jake went onto a couch and sunk into its fluffiness and let out a sigh of contentment as he fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an hour of napping Jake yawned and buried his face into the amazingly soft pillow he was sleeping on.  Somebody must have put one under his head while he was out and he nuzzled his face into it, trying to fall back to sleep.  Jake had never slept on a pillow this comfy before in his life!  It was soft and squishy as well as being SUPER warm and big.  It wasn't until the pillow made an audible growl that Jake realized he was sleeping on top of Dave's stomach. He looked up and saw Dave, who was smiling down at Jake over his huge pecs, \"Morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  Jake said, a little flustered, \"S-sorry.  I don't know how I got on your stomach...\"<br>\r\n\"You fell asleep there.\"  Dave said, \"When you sat down on the couch and fell asleep you kind of fell over and landed on my belly.  I didn't mind though.\"  Dave put his huge bear paws under his belly and happily gave the massive gut a few shakes, making it bounce and jiggle, \"I focus more on eating and gaining fat rather than muscle, so having people sleep on my big pillowy belly makes me happy.\"  <br>\r\nJake stared, amazed at how big and jiggly Dave's gut was, \"Yeah...  It really was soft and squishy.\"<br>\r\nDave smiled, \"Well, if you ever want to use me as a mattress or pillow, be my guest!\"<br>\r\n\"Can... can I now?\"  Jake asked, embarrassed.\"<br>\r\nDave adjusted how he was position on the couch, so that instead of sitting up, he was laying down.  He patted his belly a few times, \"All yours.\"<br>\r\nJake crawled across the couch and buried his face into Dave's fat, enormous, squishy belly, happily falling right back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the basement, Sam's belly had finally adjusted to the amount of food Puck had stuffed him with, and the two were working out.  Sam was working on bulking his legs and his already gigantic butt, while Puck was working on his arms, as always.  The two were happily listening to the music on Puck's itunes, which was coming from the speakers on his laptop.  Puck heard his cell phone ringing and he put his weights down and paused the music.  He picked up his phone and answered saw the caller ID was from Finn, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Puckerman?  This is Shane.\"  The deep voice from the other end said, \"I know Evans is with you.  Put him on.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...  Sure.  Yo, Sammy, it's for you.\"  Puck said, a little confused.  <br>\r\nSam got up from the machine and walked over, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Evans?  This is Shane.\"  Shane said from the other end.<br>\r\n\"Shane?  What do YOU want?\"  Sam said, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n\"You KNOW what I want.  I want you to back off of Mercedes.  She's dating me.\"  Shane said, though Sam had a hard time understanding what he said.  It sounded like Shane was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not backing off, okay!  I'm doing all of this to impress her so she'll date me again!  Plus, you two aren't even dating anymore.  You broke up, remember?\"  Sam said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I'm TRYING to get back together with her.  Listen, Evans, I challenge you to a series of contests.\"  Shane said.<br>\r\n\"Contests?\"  Sam asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  You and I will compete to see who deserves Mercedes more.  School is closed tomorrow but the locker room is still open.  Meet me there at noon and we'll settle this once and for all.  If you don't show up you forfeit.\"  Before Sam could say anything the call was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam explained what happened to Puck, who looked worried about it, but they both went on with their workouts.  That night Jake and Puck stuffed Sam and Dave once again until the two were full to the point where they felt like they were going to explode.  Everybody went to bed after that, Puck snuggled up against Sam's belly, hugging it protectively, and Jake asleep on his new favorite pillow, Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Sam was waiting in the locker room with Puck for Shane and Finn to show up.  Dave and Jake had decided to stay at home so Jake could practice stuffing Dave's belly and so he could take more naps on it.  Sam was about to call Finn's cell phone when the tall teenager walked in, \"Sorry we're late!\"<br>\r\nRight behind Finn was Shane, or at least, the massive mound of muscle and fat Shane had become.  If Sam had to guess he'd say Shane weighed...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't his usual cheerful self, but he put on a happy face for Rachel and the Glee club.  One day, he was at home when his cellphone went off.  \"Hello?\"  Finn asked, not recognizing the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this Finn Hudson from McKinley?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Who is this?\"<br>\r\n\"Finn, this is Cooter Menkins, the football recruiter from Ohio State.  We've decided that do want you here to play football with us.\"<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, REALLY?\"  <br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir.  But, there's a catch.  The Ohio State Buckeyes are MASSIVE guys, which is why we went for Shane first.  If you can bulk to about Shane's size, then we'd be honored to have you on our team.\"<br>\r\n\"Shane's size... I'll do it!  You won't regret this, Mr. Menkins.\"  Finn hung up the phone and was happy that he shot out from his bed and started jumping around.  He stopped and went into his bathroom and pulled his shirt off, looking over his body.  He wasn't the most muscular guy in school, but he was fit.  It didn't matter.  Finn was going to bulk up no matter what, but he knew he was going to need help.  Finn went down stairs and opened the fridge, happy to see that the leftover pizza from dinner hadn't been eaten yet.  He heated up the leftover eight slices and took them up to his room.  As he ate, he thought about what it would be like to be so big.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to buy a bunch of new clothes, and Rachel would probably have a few things to say about it, but that didn't matter.  This was what he really wanted.  Finn finished off his first slice and grabbed his phone, calling</span></div></div>",

I think they're still choosing Shane but they're willing to take me as well!\" <br>\r\n\"Really? That's sweet! I'm so glad for you man!\" <br>\r\n\"There's just a small catch.\" Puck stopped cheering. <br>\r\n\"Uh-oh, what is it?\" <br>\r\n\"I have to become as big as Shane.\" There was silence on Puck's end of the phone. <br>\r\n\"Did you hear me?\" Finn asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard you.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, what are you thinking?\" <br>\r\n\"Do you really want to know?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I really want to know!\" Finn shouted back.<br>\r\n\"You are so fucked. To be as big as Shane...yeah, that will be problematic.\" <br>\r\n\"No it won't! I can do it!\" <br>\r\n\"Your enthusiam is admirable but the execution is much in doubt.\" <br>\r\n\"You've been talking to Rachel again haven't you?\" <br>\r\n\"No, she's been talking to me. Your girlfriend is awesome and all but she never shuts her mouth. How do you put up with it?\" <br>\r\n\"Easy, I listen to half the things she says and tune the rest out by thinking of other things.\" Puck chuckled on the other end.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, you're smarter than I give credit for.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey thanks...wait a minute...\" Puck burst into laughter. <br>\r\n\"Don't hurt yourself by overthinking. Your brain might explode.\" <br>\r\n\"Is that possible?\" Finn asked suddenly worried. <br>\r\n\"From overthinking? No. Although there could always be a first time. But back to the main point. You say you have to become as big as Shane to join the team?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" There was silence for a few moments. <br>\r\n\"I'll be glad to help,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Finn asked. <br>\r\n\"It's obvious why you called so the answer is yes, I will help you.\" <br>\r\n\"But what happened to their being no chance?\" <br>\r\n\"You'd have no chance of succeeding on your own I mean.\" <br>\r\n\"Geez, some friend you are.\" Finn whined, insulted. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but you know exactly what I mean.\" <br>\r\n\"That's...probably true.\" <br>\r\n\"So I'll help you.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, thank you!\" <br>\r\n\"I'll be over soon.\" The phone went off with a click. Finn ate a few slices of pizza waiting and was off like a rocket when the doorbell rang. When Finn opened it, Puck came walking in, a couple of fast food bags in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Finn asked.<br>\r\n\"Some food I picked on the way up. Where's Hummel?\" <br>\r\n\"Kurt, Burt, and Mom are out for the day.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool. You hungry Finn?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, not really since I've just eaten a few pizza slices...\" Puck slapped him across the face. <br>\r\n\"Oww, why'd you hit me?\" Finn asked. <br>\r\n\"Wrong answer. You're supposed to say yes doofus.\" <br>\r\n\"Um, sorry?\" <br>\r\n\"If you hope to bulk up to Shane's size, you're going to need more than a few measly slices of pizza. If that makes you full, you're never going to make it.\"<br>\r\n\"But I am.\" Puck rubbed his forehead. <br>\r\n\"Aye-yah, it's a good thing you called me. Finn, sit down.\" Finn sat and Puck started pacing. <br>\r\n\"You want to join the team really bad?\" Finn nodded vigorously. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know that!\" <br>\r\n\"I will help you, but only if you do everything I say.\" Finn cocked his head. <br>\r\n\"This isn't some trick is it?\" Puck stopped and stared. <br>\r\n\"Dude, what the hell? Are you trying to piss me off? No this isn't a trick!\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm sorry.\" Puck rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"I forgive you. Now as I was saying, you're going to do everything I say without question. Think of me as your Coach Beiste or Sue Sylvester.\" <br>\r\n\"We already have those people.\" Finn pointed out. Puck wanted to bang his head against a wall. <br>\r\n\"I...know...that...\" he said clenching his teeth. \"Now shut up, let me finish, and stop asking stupid questions.\" Finn mimed throwing away a key after locking his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you are going to have to get pretty big. What just happened here is a good example of why without help, you are going to fail miserably at this. Now, when I walked in the door I asked are you hungry. Your answer is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes?\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Good boy. You at least started with a pizza which is good but you're going to have to eat much more than that. We're going to reach limits that even you didn't know you have and break them. Now how hungry are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much...sir,\" Finn said. Puck smiled. <br>\r\n\"You're learning fast. By the way, nice touch with the sir. I might just have to keep making you do that. Anyways, did you finish the pizza yet?\" <br>\r\n\"Not yet, I still have a few more slices.\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Good. Let's prepare and eat the rest, then we can get started on what I brought. </span></div></div>",

Right, sorry, Sir.\"  Finn said, stuffing a slice of pizza into his mouth.  <br>\r\nPuck watched as he ate and he sighed, \"Finn, oh my god, you are eating WAY to slowly.  You need to pick up the pace.\"  Hearing this, Finn finished the rest of the slice and went on to eating the next, finishing it quickly.  Puck nodded, \"Better. Finish those last three slices and then we can move onto the burgers.\"  Finn ate the pizza as quickly as he could, and once the final bite was gone, Puck handed him three double cheeseburgers, \"Keep going, Hudson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I get a break, Pu- I mean.. Sir?\"  Finn asked, a little winded.  Puck sighed, \"There are six more burgers in this bag.  You eat all of these and I'll give you a break to digest.  Deal?\"<br>\r\nFinn nodded and shoved one of the burgers into his mouth, trying to eat it as quickly as possible.  As soon as one burger was gone, Puck replaced it with another.  The two sat down on the bed and Finn ate, but after 5 burgers he had enough and had to stop.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Finn.

I am just going to give you your gift now.\" Puck laced his hands together and folded them, cracking his knuckles. \"Please hold still.\"<br>\r\n\"Puck what are you...oh!\" Finn said as Puck started massaging Finn's bloated stomach. \"That feels so good,\" Finn murmured as Puck massaged and kneeded his stomach,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I give excellent massages. Now no talking except moans of appreciation.\" Finn struggled to keep his mouth shut but it felt so wonderful he couldn't help but release a moan every now and then as Puck did his magic. It also relaxed his stomach to let loose a few more burps and belches which Puck gave a chuckle at every time it happened and mutter something about it being manly, but Finn was fascinated by the sensation and watching Puck's hands kneed and rub his expanded belly. Reaching out, Finn gave a jiggle of his belly as well. Normally watching his fat (he had no illusions of it being anything else although his mother said chubby) shake was demoralizing, especially in comparison to ripped bodies like Sam or Puck but for once it made him feel happy. After all, he had to start growing to Shane's size and Shane was massive. Finn yawned sleepily. Puck stopped a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tired?\" he asked and Finn nodded. Puck left and got the other bags. \"I'm storing these for later,\" he said as he left the room with them, coming back a few minutes later. Giving one last rub and belly jiggle, Puck grinned down at Finn. \"Good night bro,\" Puck said as he hopped onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Puck\" Finn said as he fell asleep. Puck watched his friend sleep for a moment before he grinned and laid his head back and closed his eyes. </span></div></div>",

He was shocked at first when he noticed that he was only wearing his underwear, but then he remembered that Puck had undressed him after he'd stuffed himself with food.  Finn looked down at his best friend, who was passed out on the bed, and smiled.  Despite what a badass Puck was, Finn was entertained by how child-like he looked sleeping.  Without waking him up, Finn grabbed one of the three remaining bags of burgers left and opened them: There were at least 9 double cheese burgers in there.  He opened up the other three bags and wasn't surprised to see that they all had the same amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn added it up in his head, messing up a couple of times, and finally figured out that Puck had bought thirty-six double cheese burgers for him.  He'd already eaten 9 of them from the first bag, which means he had 27 left to finish off.  Finn looked down at his once bloated stomach, which had finished digesting all of the food he'd eaten before his nap.  His chubby stomach, while no longer bloated, looked like it had grown a tiny bit bigger.  Finn put both hands on it and gave his small belly a shake, which made it jiggle, <i>'I gotta get this thing bigger and quick...'</i>.  Not wanting to waste the food his friend bought, Finn pulled two burgers out and started eating, taking a huge bite out of one before switching to the next, until both were gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn spent the next hour or so scarfing down as many cheese burgers as he could while he watched TV, ignoring the bloated feeling he was starting to get.  He pushed through the feeling and was able to eat an entire bag and a half, but stopped and leaned back against the wall behind his bed.  Finn put both hands on his insanely bloated stomach and groaned, happy that he was able to eat that much.  He closed his eyes and started to rub his belly when he felt Puck's hands push his off and start rubbing, \"You're REALLY fuckin eager, aren't you?\"  Puck said, doing his best to ease Finn's swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn groaned, \"Yeah... I a- UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPP.... am.\"  Puck laughed and patted the side of Finn's swollen belly, which made a low thump-sound.  Puck rubbed Finn's stomach for about half an hour, watching TV with Finn, who was burping non-stop, when he decided</span></div></div>",

Finn groaned, thinking that maybe 13 or 14 double cheeseburgers was not such a good idea so quickly. Puck nodded in commiseration as he continued rubbing. \"I know, I know it's difficult, but you are doing such a good job. You didn't even have to have me tell you to do it, you just went on your own. Although you could have at least woken me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just too excited. Although maybe not-uuurrrrrppp-so much anymore.\" Finn groan changed into a moan when Puck's fingers did something. <br>\r\n\"But ohhh that doesn feel nice.\" Puck grinned at Finn's goofy grin. <br>\r\n\"Glad I could help my boy out. Although Santanna is going to destroy you tomorrow, just warning you.\"<br>\r\n\"Santanna's just jealous of my awesome body,\" Finn said, slapping his belly a little and Puck laughed.<br>\r\n\"Heh, and here I thought you were going to be all insecure over it like you usually are. Especially if Santanna threatens to barbecue you again.\" <br>\r\n\"Satan's all talk. Besides if she does get a big pointy stick, I'm using you for interference.\" <br>\r\n\"Cold, just cold. Leaving your friend behind.\"<br>\r\n\"You'd do the same to me in a heartbeat if a bear ever came after us.\" <br>\r\n\"Other than that bears don't really eat human flesh, you're probably right.You don't have to run faster, you just have to run faster than the slowest which is you.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's why.\" <br>\r\n\"But in all seriousness,\" Puck said. \"Usually you're pretty insecure over things like this which is why you're both impressing and creeping me out with this kind of attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I guess...I guess I realized I was never going to ever have a body type like yours or Sam's or Mike's and well, I'm not that much good at running and like cake and sweets and stuff too much and then there was the directive by the recruiter and thinking about it it sounds awesome and I've kind of always secretly thought about it and stuff. I guess I was always meant to have a body like this,\" pats his gut, \"and so why the hell not I've been thinking. I can do whatever I want and it's not like I'm going to turn into a total slob right? I mean, I do plan to stay healthy and stuff, it's just extra padding for football.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Puck said. He squinted curiously. \"You still like chocolate cake the most right?\" Finn nodded confused. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I love chocolate.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay. Still...finish this burger.\" <br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n\"You left half a burger here. That's just wrong leaving half an uneaten burger.\" <br>\r\n\"Puck....\" Finn whined. <br>\r\n\"Eat it,\" Puck growled warningly. <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\" Finn said grudgingly. \"No need for growling.\" <br>\r\n\"I'll stop growling when you eat it.\" <br>\r\n\"You're weird.\" Finn said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Are you going to or not?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'm not feeling so well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud you big baby fine, I'll do it.\" Finn made to protest but Puck already yanked his mouth open again and stuffed it in and closed it moving Finn's jaw. Finn swallowed and Puck nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't so hard,\" he said and Finn just glared. \"You're done for the night. By the way, what do you want for breakfast tomorrow?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Finn slept he had an amazing dream: he dreamed of what his life would be like a massive football player.  He had broad shoulders, big, muscular arms, a wide chest, a massive stomach, wide bubble butt, gigantic thighs and powerful calves.  He was a star on the field that nobody could beat and he had even been drafted to the NFL.  He lived in a big house with Rachel, who was a Broadway star, and Puck, who had become his personal chef/trainer/gaining encourager.  It was the perfect life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Finn woke up, he was actually rather upset.  It would be awhile before he got to that point and he needed to start beefing up faster.  Pulling himself from his bed, he realized that he was still in his - slightly smaller - briefs.  He quickly threw on a pair of his pajama pants and an old t-shirt before heading down stairs, realizing he smelled pancakes and bacon.  When Finn reached the kitchen, he saw Puck at the stove making a massive breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' big guy!\" Puck said, flipping another pancake before adding it to the pile.  <br>\r\n\"Morning yourself.  Where is everybody?\"<br>\r\n\"Kurt went over to Blaine's this morning and your parents are out for the day.  I've got a BIG day of non-stop eating planned for you!!\"  Puck said, adding another pancake to the ever growing pile.  When Finn sat down, Puck put the tall stack of pancakes down in front of Finn, who was actually excited to be eating this much.  The stack had to have at least eight butter covered, syrup drenched pancakes on it.  Puck slid over a huge plate of bacon and smiled, \"Eat up!\"  Finn grinned and he dug his fork and knife in and started eating.  \"Dude, we need to run to the store and get you more food for today's plans.  It took me forever to find anything I could make for you.\"<br>\r\nFinn laughed between bites, \"Yeah, Kurt and Mom kinda run the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n\"I can tell.  Finish that up cause I've got more coming.\"  Puck said as he went back to the stove, making more pancakes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Puck made really good pancakes. Finn was very excited to be able to let loose and eat like this and not get a health lecture from Kurt who had turned mom. Mom used to cook hearty stuff like this (albeit even then not to the same quantity as Puck now) but then Mrs. Hudson married Burt. Finn loved Burt and Kurt. However due to Burt's heart condition, they could not really eat stuff like this and all the good stuff had to be thrown out. Finn wasn't resentful, he just wasn't thrilled to eat such 'healthy' food, Kurt's words, not his, all the time. But what was wrong with once in a while? Thank god for Puck and football, he had almost forgotten what the taste of real food was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck sat across from him, eating his own smaller stack of pancakes, occasionally glancing up with a smile of smug satisfaction as he watched Finn dig into his food. It was nice to be appreciated and the rift that had temporarily wrecked their friendship was already diminishing. Puck had missed his first best friend and was glad to do anything that could help him. Besides, Finn was going to go pro, eventually. Puck liked football and the occasional playing but certainly did not want a career in it. He had his heart set out on music and as a side, a chef. That last one was a bit of a secret because he was bad-ass and no one would take him seriously at their school if he admitted to wanting to cook. First singing, then cooking? He'd lose credibility with anyone. However, he had to learn to cook to take care of the family after his dad abandoned them and his mom became too busy working at the hospital and always came home at odd hours. Out of necessity, and genuine interest after a while, he became quite good at it and was always pleased when a concotion he created was successfully received like the donation of his \"grandmother's recipe\" cupcakes. He was surprised that people actually believed that his mom actually cooked but that only showed most people weren't actually interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to get his secret out, if to one person. Especially to his best friend, who he had missed during their fighting stage. Even better that his friend needed him. Finn was slowing down on the pancakes, a more labored pace as signals began to reach his brain that he was full. Puck's pancakes were super-filling with their super fluffiness and drenching in sweet syrup and butter. Honestly, Puck was amazed that Finn could eat so many already. 6 and 1/2 pancakes, especially his, was no small feat and Puck was done after only three. Really done. It was rare for Puck to indulge so much in his own work but hanging with Finn did make him a bit hungry. Still, this is about Finn, not him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning softly as he got up, Puck moved to where Finn was. \"How's it going?\" he asked. Finn blinked slowly. <br>\r\n\"It's...urrrppp....good, just a little-urrpp-break,\" he got out. Puck smirked at him. <br>\r\n\"I can help with that,\" Puck said, grinning a little. He scooted a little closer and placed his hands on Finn's bloated stomach. \"Ready?\" he asked and before Finn barely had time to nod, he started rubbing. Finn shifted into it, moaning appreciatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Puck, how do you do it?\" Finn asked in between moans of pleasure. Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Just a gift, now relax.\" As Finn slumped happily in his chair, Puck took as brief intervals of time as possible as he cut the remaining pancakes before returning back to helping his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide,\" Puck said and Finn did so automatically at first so when Puck with surprising speed put a forkful of pancake into his mouth, Finn was surprised. <br>\r\n\"Mmf, hey, what-?\" Puck lovingly shoved in another forkful onehanded, the other hand still rubbing soothing circles on Finn's full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking, just eating,\" Puck ordered and Finn instinctively listened and didn't complain as Puck slowly fed him forkful after forkful of pancake, leaving time in between to settle and get ready.after the first few. When Finn opened his mouth for his next bite (his body already subconsciously figuring out Puck's timing), he was surprised when there was nothing. Blinking wearily, Finn opened his eyes fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" he asked confused. Puck smirked triumphant. <br>\r\n\"You're finished. You ate every last bit. How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Exhausting,\" Finn said. \"And so full that if I eat anymore I might just explode.\" Puck grinned.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good enough for now. If you keep this up, I have no doubt they'll beg to have you. You are one serious eating machine.\" <br>\r\n\"It's all because of you,\" Finn said and it might have been his imagination but Puck turned a little pink at the unexpected compliment. <br>\r\n\"T-thank you now, let's get you up.\" Between the two of them, they managed to heft Finn up and waddle over to the couch. Turning the tv on, Puck turned to Finn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything in particular you want?\" <br>\r\n\"Nah bro, anything's good.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" and Puck turned the channel to a showing of a football game that got most of Finn's attention. Puck was less interested in the game although he did watch some, as much as he was into rubbing his friend's stuffed belly.</span></div></div>",

In a couple of days Finn would be eating three times that amount of food before he got full.  Normally, Puck kept the gaining help to simply himself and the gainer, as he did with Dave Karofsky, but he wanted to see what it would be like to make this into a group effort.  Plus, he wanted to see if he could slip some extra pounds onto his friends as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a calling both Sam and Mike and explaining Finn's need to be as big as Shane, they both headed over with food.  After about two hours the doorbell rang, which woke Finn up, and Puck answered, \"Sammy, Mike!  Come on on, bros!\"<br>\r\n\"What's goin' on, Puck?\"  Finn asked, rubbing his eye sleepily.<br>\r\n\"We're here to hang out and help you get huge, dude!\"  Sam said, excited!  He and Mike came inside with a couple of pizzas, buffalo wings, ice cream, soda, chips, and Mike's famous homemade extreme mozzarella sticks.<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\"  Finn said, \"Is this all for me?\"<br>\r\n\"About 75% of it is!\" Mike said, \"We're turning your journey of getting muscular and fat into a party!  We'll be sure not to make a mess too, Finn, we know how much your folks freak over that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam and Puck unloaded the food into the kitchen, Mike walked over with the plate of his mozzarella sticks and sat down next to Finn, \"We need to get you up to Shane's size and fast, dude!  We've only got until the end of the year.\"  Finn opened his mouth to say something but Mike shoved a mozzarella stick into his mouth, \"Sam, Puck and I already have a plan ready.  Unless you're working out or at glee or football, you aren't allowed to do ANY activities that might make you burn each and every precious calorie.\"<br>\r\nSam chimed in as Mike shoves another huge stick of fried cheese in Finn's mouth, \"Yeah!  I'll be your workout trainer while Puck and Mike will be your chefs and feeders.  Well keep track of your weight the entire time!  Plus, you have two classes with each of us through out the day, so we'll all make sure that we keep you well feed, even in class.\"<br>\r\nPuck walked over and patted Finn's small, but growing, stomach, \"With our help this baby will be massive and you'll be a gigantic college football player in no time!  Now, let's get this party started!\"</span></div></div>",

Sam and Mike's enthusiasm for this surprised him and he wondered if they were secret feeders at heart as well.When he had called them, he thought they would have put up a bit more resistance or at least a 'what the hell?' when he explained his idea but they were actually quite into it, even before he got to the part about Finn's chance at football. Although he greatly enjoyed his alone time sessions with Finn and he was probably going to have to reserve them now, it was really awesome being with their friends. Besides, maybe they could be convinced or at least not notice if a few pounds were to fall on them which would be pretty awesome as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck went to the kitched to get plates for the rest of the food while Sam was taking a turn in feeding Finn who loved all the attention as his mouth opened happily. Getting a stack of paper plates, and cups, Puck came back in and laid them out, laying out the food within easy reach and stepping back into the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your shirt,\" Puck said all of a sudden and they all looked surprised. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Finn asked. Puck shrugged, a quick smirk crossing his face. <br>\r\n\"Don't want to get stains on that nice shirt, at least more that what is already there. Besides, then we could visually see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck stripped off his tanktop and so did Sam and Mike who weren't quite sure but followed Puck's lead. Finn, blusihng, did so as well a bit uncomfortable. He changed all the time with them in gym but he still sometimes felt uncomfortable if he felt everyone's attention on him as they were now. He especially felt it now with air touching his bare skin. Puck smiled as he walked over and caressed Finn's belly as Sam and Mike watched on, keeping careful note of their reactions. Sam and Mike were both wide-eyed to varying degrees upon the sight of Finn's exposed body although Sam definitely recovered composure faster. Yeah, they were so into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice belly,\" Puck said squeezing it, having fun. \"But of course you need to be even bigger to play in the pros. What do you think Mike? Sam?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Mike said.<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Sam said smiling. \"Although I have to say you're bigger than I thought already. What've you been eating?\"<br>\r\n\"Puck's pancakes, hamburgers, pizza, just stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll need to fill you up with more stuff if you want to be like Shane!\" Mike said, recovering. <br>\r\n\"Exactly what I was thinking,\" Puck said. \"Come on, we need to help get you big.\"<br>\r\nPuck settled back as he watched Mike and Sam try to decide what to feed Finn next.<br>\r\n\"Do both and alternate,\" Puck called out as he took a swig of Dr. Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" they both said and Puck rolled his eyes. Sam took the first go, settling on bringing a buffalo wing to Finn's mouth which Finn munched on happily. Mike went next with even more of those delicious cheesesticks. Puck made a mental note to find out the recipe because they were really great as he ate one as well. After a bit of time as the food disappeared between the four of them but especially Finn, Finn leaned back with a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, that's enough. I can't eat anymore.\" Patting his stomach, he let out a massive belch as he tried to shift to a comfortable spot. Puck crawled over to where Finn was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done already? But you haven't even had dessert yet,\" Puck said. Finn put his hands on his stomach.<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mood for dessert Puck, I don't know if I can even fit it in or eat again, I'm so full.\" Puck put his hands on Finn's belly and was impressed by how solid and hefty it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you did eat a lot,\" Puck said both amused and maybe a bit concerned. Finn burped again as he felt Puck's fingers dig in to his sensitive skin. <br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuurrrrrrpppp, ugh, yeah. Between you, Mike, and Sam I ate...I don't know, a lot.\" Finn moaned in relief as he felt Puck's fingers touch an area releasing the pressure that was inside of him with yet another burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuurrrppp, sorry guys, excuse me.\" <br>\r\n\"Is he okay?\" Sam and Mike asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we should probably give him a bit of rest,\" Puck said as he stood up. Sam and Mike did as well, looking down at Finn who had his eyes closed and seemed completely out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he's huge,\" Sam said as he absent-mindedly nibbled on one of the few remaining mozzarella sticks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Mike said. <br>\r\n\"Hey, does anybody else want food? It'd be wrong to let this go to waste and I don't think Finn will be waking up anytime soon.\" Sam and Mike shrugged and Puck grinned as they ate. </span></div></div>",

As Sam and Mike relaxed after their binge, Puck wrapped up all of the food and put it in the fridge to feed Finn later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam and Mike slept off their first food binge Puck sat down next to Finn, absentmindedly rubbing his belly as he watches tv.  A few hours went by and Finn groaned as his eyes opened up. <br>\r\n\"Morning, sleeping beauty.\"  Puck said, smirking at Finn.<br>\r\n\"Hey...\"  The bigger teen said, half asleep.  He looked down at his bigger belly, which Puck was still rubbing, and blinked, \"... Did my gut get bigger?\"<br>\r\nPuck laughed, \"If it didn't I wouldn't be doing my job, would I?\"  Puck patted Finn's bigger stomach before slipping his hands underneath it and jiggling it, which made Finn smile.  Puck stood up and walked over to the fridge, \"Let's get this big belly of yours even bigger.  We've still got a lot of food left.\"  Puck pulled the two pizzas out of the fridge, \"You want me to heat these up?\"  <br>\r\nFinn shook his head, \"Nah, man.  I like cold pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned and walked over, sitting down next to Finn and opening the first box.  Before Finn knew it, he was being hand-fed massive slices of pizza.  As he ate, Finn focused on the TV, letting Puck and his mouth do the work for him.  Finn opened his mouth, waiting for more pizza, but it never came, \"Whats the big deal?\"  Finn said, upset.<br>\r\n\"The big deal is that you ate both boxes of pizza.  How ya' feelin'?\"<br>\r\n\"Hungry..\"  Finn said, putting his hands on his stomach, which was a little solid but still felt soft and empty.<br>\r\nPuck got up and went to the fridge, pulling out a massive tub of chocolate ice cream and a can of whipped cream, \"Well, I can take care of that.\"  Puck sat back down and popped open the top of the tub.  He quickly began shoveling in massive spoonfuls of of ice cream into Finn's mouth, which he devoured happily.  After swallowing a couple of huge spoonfuls, Puck filled Finn's mouth with so much whipped cream that his cheek puffed out.  As soon as he ate that, Puck went right back to feeding Finn ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for ten minutes before both the can and the tub were empty.  Finn leaned his head back and moaned happily, loving the feeling of having his stomach full of so much food.<br>\r\nPuck patted Finn's belly, \"Impressive.  Earlier you were stuffed to the point of throwing up.  You just ate more than that you still feel empty.\"<br>\r\nFinn chuckled, \"I guess it just took a little bit to get use t- UUUUUUUUUUURP- .. to it.\"  The burp that Finn had made was so loud that it woke up the sleeping Sam and Mike, who were equally as impressed with Finn's stuffed gut.  They sat down around Finn and began hand feeding him from the big bags of chips they had brought until Finn was back to his 'to-bloated-to-move' state.  Puck massaged Finn's bloated belly and eventually led Finn up to his room and into bed, where he quickly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finn was excited that his friends were more than happy to bring him stuff throughout the day. Even before it had been hard to make it to lunchtime without eating something and now that he was going to be eating so much more, he could not imagine what it would be like to have to wait till lunchtime to eat anything. He rubbed his belly thoughtfully, enjoying the already added thickness. Finn had always felt kind of awkward since he always had been a big guy and one of the tallest people at school. He was glad for Glee and Football which had been where he met all his friends, people who were just as awkward if not more so than him. Even when popular he still got called things like Frankenteen which actually hurt. It was cause of his mismatched body and while he wasn't as obsessed with being thin or having perfect abs since even he knew such things would never happen, he wouldn't mind being stronger and more substantial. It felt good and Puck and his friends were quite encouraging and helpful. Making his way to his locker he saw Rachel for him who was eager as ever to talk about their next glee assignment. Not letting her say a word, Finn pulled her against him and surprised her with a kiss feeling great and leaving her stunned and speechless for a few seconds before her brain rebooted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she breathed. \"Not that I don't appreciate it but was there a particular reason for that?\" Finn shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Nah, feeling good and wanted to give you a little something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, thank you. So for Glee...\" Finn quietly tuned out, letting her ramble but enjoying the sound of her voice if not paying attention to the words. Even when she was rambling her voice sounded like singing and Rachel had a very beautiful singing voice. Even if she talked so fast it has hard to follow or if she used big words many of which he had no idea what they meant and made him feel like a big dummy. He did have to say though that after hanging out with Rachel, he knew more words than before after looking them up in the dictionary when she used them. Giving a few nods and vague comments, Finn and Rachel walked to Finn's first class before Rachel finished talking and giving him a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later,\" she said. \"Do good.\" Finn shrugged because this was remedial Geometry and well, it was Geometry with shapes and figures and numbers. Worse, it was with probably the most boring teacher in their entire school Mr. Leonard. He had the type of voice that the minute he opened his mouth to say anything people were already bored, asleep, and or distracted. Sam who was also in this class since in addition to reading, he had some trouble with shapes, was the only good thing as was Puck although he rarely showed up and often ditched. Finn couldn't blame him. There were many times when he wished he could as well but he didn't want to worry or disappoint his mom not showing up in class. Though Finn had to wonder why this class was neccessary or if they could have found someone, anyone, else to teach it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once Puck was actually in class and Finn was surprised. <br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Puck, you're not ditching or hanging in the Nurse's office again?\" Finn asked. It was no secret that the Nurse had a crush on Puck, which was kind of creepy since she was who knew how old, but it certainly was convenient. Puck grinned and winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I am, I just stopped in to give you a little snack to help you get through the day, especially this guy's lectures. It's too bad you would never consider ditching and leaving this loser, I can think of a lot more valuable and fun things to do with my time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why, but thank you Puck.\" Puck grinned as he reached out and patted Finn's belly. <br>\r\n\"Your welcome. If you ever do leave I'd be more than happy to have an extra opportunity to help get this bigger though.\" Puck reached into his backpack and pulled out a few boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I brought you some poptarts which I know you like. Well, I know you like and would pretty much eat anything barring a couple certain fruits and vegetables, but poptarts are the first thing I thought of to help keep you occupied.\" Puck looked out and saw Mr. Leonard coming and grimaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got to go now since I don't want to get stuck in here for a whole hour listening to Leonard so see you later next class. Also these are for Sam when he gets in. I know he'll probably need them especially.\" Reaching into his backpack again he brought out more various flavored poptart boxes. Checking around, Puck snuck out the back door just as Mr. Leonard got in the room. Sam showed up 10 minutes later having overslept but Mr. Leonard didn't even seem to notice as he kept going on about whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam,\" Finn whispered to Sam who was sitting next to him. \"Why are you so late?\" <br>\r\n\"Slept in, had to miss breakfast,\" Sam grimaced. \"Ugh, I hate this class. Why is Mr. Leonard so boring and clueless?\" <br>\r\n\"A mystery never solved. Puck was here and left you and I poptarts. I guess he figured you'd have missed breakfast.\" Finn pointed to the boxes of poptarts. Sam examined them and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, tell Puck he's a lifesaver. Mmm poptarts, I don't care if they're cold.\" Sam eagerly opened a box of fudge poptarts and started eating the first one. Finn did so as well, loving the taste and really glad to have something. </span></div></div>",

Along with the poptarts Puck had given him, Sam had brought Finn a couple of cheesecake slices to eat in class.  He finished both and went to his next class; history with Mike.  Puck showed up again, with more of the same poptarts, and Finn happily ate those along with the cold (Finn prefers them cold) chicken strips Mike brought.  After that was science with Puck, who fed Finn two more boxes of poptarts before running out to get Finn lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was spent with all four of them and they cheered Finn on as he stuffed down three whole pizzas before heading to Spanish class with Mike.  Finn was able to eat an entire box of donuts without Mr. Shue catching him, along with another box of poptarts Puck had given him.  The next class was gym, and Finn finally had a chance to work on his muscles for football with the guys.  After class, they all hit the showers and Puck could tell that Finn was filling out all over.  His stomach was perfectly round and bloated from all the food he had stuffed down, but his legs and butt had clearly thickened.  After the shower, all four went to English, which was the only class they had together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass dragged on, but luckily they were watching a movie today, which gave Finn the perfect cover for eating in class.  Mike and brought more of his famous cheese sticks, Sam bought a box of cookies, and Puck gave Finn his last box of poptarts, one of Finn's new favorite foods.  The entire class was spent with Finn gorging on his snacks while Sam, Puck, and Mike alternated between rubbing his growing, large belly.  Puck leaned in and whispered into Finn's ear, \"I hope you aren't too full.  We're going to Mike's place tonight to give you another huge stuffing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn grinned, \"I'm always up for more.  You guys throw whatever you can at this.\"  He said, smacking his belly and making it jiggle.</span></div></div>",

Guys, the party can finally start!\" Puck called and Mike and Sam came out of the kitchen grinning as well.<br>\r\n\"Woah, you guys are already here?\" Finn asked surprised. Usually Puck and Sam were the last to arrive at get togethers, especially since Sam lived further out of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, rode with Puck. Anyhow, you ready?\" Sam asked and Puck smirked to himself. He was going to ask the same but Sam beat him too it. It was a good thing he wasn't a jealous person sharing Flynn around like this. Of course, in addition to being fun in a group, he now got more to play with who alone would have been tricky but together were easy pickings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving,\" Finn said rubbing his stomach causing Puck to grin mischeviously. Giving a soft punch to the gut, he playfully headlocked Finn. \"Of course you are buddy. Let's get this baby of yours filled with something and then take you back so I can kick all you guys's butts at Mario Kart.\" Sam and Mike exchanged looks confused for a moment before Puck tilted his head at the kitchen. Following him they stood there for a moment, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario Kart? Thought it was just a feeding party?\" Sam asked confused. \"Not that I have a problem but...again huh?\" <br>\r\n\"It's quite simple really. Finn gets bored easy and he is kind of bad at Mario Kart. He has far more fun watching anyways and will absentmindedly eat his plate of food and with his new appetite, he won't stop for a while. And then ask for dinner afterwards since it was just a 'snack.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, makes sense,\" Mike said.<br>\r\n\"Besides, I want a challenge, you guys will give me a far better one than Finn at it.\" Puck took the large chip bags out and opened them while Sam took out the dip and wings and Mike the Cheesesticks. When they got out, Finn took a look at the spread and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, I'll sit out the first few rounds,\" Finn said and Puck shrugged as he set the system up. \"Suit yourself,\" he said winking over at Mike and Sam. <br>\r\nFinn winced at Puck\u2019s incoherent shrieks of rage when Mike\u2019s blue koopa shell hit him only a few seconds away from the finish line and Sam and Mike who had been tailing closely for the last few laps surged ahead. Puck was uber competitive when it came to games and it really did suck to be smashed by a flying shell so close to the victory line. Reaching into the bowl again, Finn felt that it was empty and when he looked around, all the others were as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, guys?\u201d He asked and they all looked over from where Puck was trying to beat Mike over the head with the steering wheel and Sam was blocking. \u201cWe\u2019re out of food.\u201d Breathing hard, Puck composed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s take a break anyhow. I\u2019ve prepared a little something for all of us. Wasn\u2019t sure what to make short notice before thinking \u2018why not pasta?\u2019 Easy, fast, good in HUGE quantities, delicious, yeah its good. Plus there\u2019s also cheese-sticks, poptarts, surprisingly still a few chicken wings, and other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get all those poptarts anyhow?\u201d Sam had wondered that all day since he saw Puck pull out numerous boxes. <br>\r\n\u201cFrom a contest that I don\u2019t remember entering but apparently did for a free year\u2019s supply of poptarts. They were delivered on our driveway and we had to move all the boxes to the garage and the shed and wherever we could store them.\u201d Puck grimaced. \u201cIt took days to move all those and we only just finished.\u201d Ushering them into the dining room to sit down, Puck returned back to the kitchen for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady!\u201d He called. \u201cOne at a time but Finn first!\u201d Single file, they went to the kitchen where Puck was waiting with probably the biggest pot of pasta they had ever seen.<br>\r\n\u201cWoah that\u2019s big, is that a cauldron?\u201d Mike asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNice apron,\u201d Sam grinned at Puck\u2019s attire. The apron was pink, frilly, and spelled out \u2018I love you\u2019 on the front. Puck gave a groan.<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, only one I could find. I\u2019m going to give it to Kurt later or burning it. You guys better come over here and take your food before I go psycho and murder all you fools.\u201d Ladling out the pasta he filled all their plates to overflowing. \u201cThis is a good start. I\u2019ll bring out the other stuff later.\u201d Heading back to the table, they sat a moment while Sam said a prayer and they all dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no denying it; Puck was an AMAZING cook.  The next couple of minutes were spent in silence, except for the sounds of four growing teens devouring huge plates of pasta or tearing into bread.  Finally, there was a loud grunt of exhausting and the other three boys looked at Mike, who was pushing his empty plate away, \"I can't eat anymore...\"<br>\r\nPuck laughed and picked up the plate, heading back into the kitchen to fill it up again, \"Sure you can, buddy!\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mike said, \"I can't.  If I eat anymore I might be sick.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats just the wall talking.\"  Puck said, loading the plate with huge spoonfuls of pasta.<br>\r\n\"Wall?\"  Sam and Finn both asked at the same time, their mouths full of food.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  In the gainer/feeder community the wall is a term for that full feeling.  If you wanna get bigger, you have push past the wall and keep eating.\"  Puck said, setting the plate down in front of Mike just in time for him Finn and Sam to pass him their plates as well.<br>\r\nMike stared at the plate, \"But...  I don't want to gain weight.  I want to help Finn gain weight.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Puck said, loading Sam's plate up, \"But you're not done eating until you get past that wall.\"<br>\r\nMike sighed and sat up, lifting the fork to his mouth and eating as he was told.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smirked, happy to see his plan was working.  Sure, he wanted to make Finn as gigantic and enourmas as possible, but that doesn't mean he couldn't do the same for Sam and Mike.  They'd both be smaller than Finn, but they'll both have huge muscles and guts before they knew it.  Puck doubled the amount of pasta on Finn's plate, after all this was HIS gaining party, and set both plates down in front of them.  Sam and Finn dug back in eagerly and smirked as he sipped his soda.  Soon he'd surrounded by his favorite 5 b's: big, beefy, bloated, best bros.  What more could a man ask for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck finished his first plate, he saw Mike push his plate away, which was half-full, \"I can't, dude.\"  He says, rubbing his bloated stomach.<br>\r\nPuck gave it a few good pats, \"Yeah, if you eat anymore, you'll make yourself sick.  Go rest up, I'll give you a nice tummy rub in a bit.\"  Mike got up and walked over to the couch, where he sat down and did his best to relax.  Puck looked up at Finn, \"You want his left overs, Fi-\"  Puck stopped at the sight of Finn stuffing his face with Mike's plate, his own empty in front of him.  Puck grinned, looking at Sam, \"You hungry still?\"<br>\r\nSam handed him his plate, \"Yep!\"<br>\r\nPuck watched happily as Sam and Finn kept eating, devouring the massive pot of pasta.  Sam ate three more plates, bring his total to 5, and Finn ate 10 plates, bring it up to 12.5 plates of pasta, before the pot was empty.  Both boys sat down on the couch, their bellies huge and bloated with pasta, and Puck got down on his, happily rubbing and relaxing Finn's belly, \"There you go, big guy.  I'll get to you two once I take care of our growing quarterback.\"  He said, happily.<br>\r\nSoon, all three boys passed out from having such amazing belly rubs and Puck happily sat back on the reclining chair, turning on the TV and waiting for them to wake up so they can get to dessert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours passed before Puck heard Finn wake up, \"Hey...\"  He said, sleepily.<br>\r\n\"Hey, big guy.  You want some dessert?\"  Puck asked.  <br>\r\nFinn rubbed his belly, \"Yeah, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Perfect!\"  He got up and went to the kitchen.  While they slept, Puck made sure to add tons of his favorite gainer powder to Finn's dessert, eager to watch his best buddy get huge and fast.  He came back with...</span></div></div>",

Puck shifted awkwardly not wanting to say how much that had meant because it did, it meant a bloody lot and he'd start getting all emotional and shit like a girl if they continued talking about it and he wasn't planning on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I am and everybody here knows it. It's a statement of fact.\" Puck placed it down in front of Finn. \"Hang on, got to cut it.\" He hurried to the kitchen and brought out a carving knife with which he deftly cut the cake into large slices before putting it back. Finn waited obediently for Puck to get back, but couldn't wait to get a taste of that delicious chocolatey chocolate cake with its delicious chocolate fudge frosting and sprinkles and he couldn't wait to eat it but he knew Puck enjoyed watching and if Puck wanted to watch well then Puck was going to bloody watch no matter how tempting it was to dig in right away. Puck came back and grinned, seeing that Finn waited for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro for waiting. I know how tempting it must be to wait with that looking at you. I'm rather tempted to eat it myself actually but that's what you're here for.\" Puck grinned as he patted Finn. \"Shirts off, chocolate stains are irritating to remove,\" Puck said removing his shirt as Finn did the same. Puck leaned over and grinned as he rubbed his hands over Finn's enlarged stomach. \"Amazing, you're becoming a real stud with a gut Finn, it's gotten so big already. They're going to have to take you later for football you'll be ginormous then at the rate you've grown.\" Finn blushed not sure whether that was a comment or an insult but considering this was Puck who was helping him, a very high compliment. It wasn't easy to get Puck's overt praise so this was awesome. Previously he would have been offended by such a statement or even the thought of getting so big but with Puck and everyone's encouragement, it wasn't so bad and he got to eat tons of delicious food. Puck, Sam, and Mike were awesome in helping and to make sure that there wasn't a single moment for long that Finn hadn't eaten or in the process of eating something and to keep his belly full. Sure there were a few downsides but when everyone, especially Puck, was rubbing and helping him it felt like heaven and he just felt like a stud like Puck instead of awkward in everything but football and glee. Even Rachel was encouraging because although she had been concerned at first, after he explained what he was doing, she was totally understanding and even told him to keep on doing it and following his dreams. Heck, she even ordered him saying she would be sorely disappointed if he quit struggling to obtain his goal. She was amazing and so was that delicious looking cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to feed me coach?\" Finn said grinning as he knew how much Puck enjoyed that. Puck grinned wide and smirked as he looked at Finn.<br>\r\n\"Of course, and you're going to eat every last bite,\" Puck said sternly.<br>\r\n\"I'll certainly try,\" Finn said, biting his lip to keep from laughing. It was so silly but he knew Puck took the game seriously. <br>\r\n\"Try? You'll do better than try. You'll succeed,\" Puck barked as he lifted up a piece and brought it over to Finn, offering it. Finn took a bite before his eyes opened in wonder.<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh this is so good! It's like the best cake ever!\" Puck laughed easy at that.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You certainly say that about all my food. Heck, you even said that about the poptarts.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, poptarts are good,\" Finn said stubbornly. \"Joining the list of favorites but seriously, your cake is amazing. You should make one for Sam and Mike. They have to taste how awesome it is.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I will later. But right now its just you and me Finney,\" Puck said smiling. <br>\r\n\"They're still asleep right?\" Finn asked.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think so. Evans ate a lot himself and Mike I don't know.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, they really should try this out,\" Finn insisted and Puck grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'll make more later. Now shut your mouth unless its to enjoy the delicious chocolatey goodness of this cake.\" Finn did so as he took another bite and moaned at how good it was which certainly made Puck pleased. After Finn finished all the bites of the slice Puck had, he licked Puck's fingers clean because there was still delicious chocolate and Puck loved that which was obvious from the happy smile he had as he watched Finn lick his fingers. Finn didn't quite get it but as long as Puck was happy, he was happy and he had no problem cleaning off his friend's fingers of delicious choclatey gooey remnants. Puck grinned as he brought up a second huge slice and Finn excitedly waited as Puck brought bite by bite up to him the cake tasting so good and helping him in their goal. </span></div></div>",

Puck had surprised Finn with a second cake after he had finished the first one and Finn had eaten both.  Puck grinned as he rubbed Finn's bloated belly, \"You okay, buddy?\"<br>\r\n\"Finn belched, \"Ugh...  Yeah, I just need to rest.\"  Finn leaned his head back and in seconds he was out like a light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck stood up and examined three men on the couch; Finn had definitely grown in size.  His belly and muscles was huge, but no nowhere near the size required for the football team.  Sam had beefed up a little bit, but most of his gain fat, not muscle.  Mike has tiny beginner belly, but he hadn't developed any more mass in the muscle department.  Puck knew Finn would grow fast, but he had no idea Mike and Sam would get bigger as well, and intended to keep it that way.  As the three of them slept Puck grabbed his car keeps and hurried to his truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck had always been interested in the gainer community, and had even used Dave Karofsky as a guinea pig when he first started out.  When Puck and Dave decided to stop Puck had helped Dave gain a solid 200 pounds, bring him up from 230 to 430, and now he's one of the best linemen at his new school.  Puck knew of a special little place that focused only on the gainer community.  After a 30 minute drive, Puck pulled up to a small shop called \"Growing Pains\" that was fairly close to the Lima Bean.  Puck parked and headed inside, a smile instantly spreading onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store smelled of warm cinnamon buns and the walls were lined with many different types of weight gain powers, muscle mass powders, and machines to help with the process.  Puck saw a large bear of a man standing behind the counter watching a wrestling match and walked over.  Bruce was a massive dude, probably around 350 pounds, with gigantic arms and huge stomach that flowed over his belt, \"'Sup, Bruce!\"<br>\r\nThe man looked over and grinned, \"Well, if isn't Puck!  How are ya' buddy!  I didn't recognize you without that big bear of your following.\"<br>\r\nPuck laughed, \"Yeah, Dave and I ended our agreement a few weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n\"How big was he?\" Bruce asked.<br>\r\n\"430 pounds!  A nice, clean, 200 pound gain.\"  Puck replied.<br>\r\n\"Dude must be huge!  What was the muscle to fat percentage?\"  Bruce asked.<br>\r\n\"Turned out Dave prefered eating over lifting, so instead of the established 50/50 muscle to fat, it ended up being 75% fat, 15% muscle\"  Puck said, still happy with the results.<br>\r\nBruce put his hands out in front of him, miming a large (er than what he had) stomach, \"Huge belly?\"<br>\r\nPuck nodded, \"Bigger than yours.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice!  So, whats up?  Got a new client?\"  Bruce asked, leaning on the counter.<br>\r\n\"Yep!  Well, three, to be honest.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three at once?  Thats a lot of man meat.  What are your plans for them?\"  Bruce asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, two of them don't know about it, but they will soon.  I'm helping a buddy get onto a college football team.  He wants quarterback but he'll be a linemen when I'm done with him.  I'm thinking 60% fat, 40% muscle for Finn, thats his name, and then 75% fat, 25% muscle for Sam, and 30% fat, 70% muscle for Mike.  He's a dancer so I want him to be able to still move like before, but with a bit more jiggle.\"  Puck said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"I like those numbers.  So, what are you here for?  A refill on your usual powder?\"  Bruce asked, turning around to get a new jug.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm also interested in a machine for these three.  Any you would recommend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce scratched his chin for bit, \"Hmmm... for three men, and with those kinds of numbers, I'd have to suggest this.\"  Bruce walked over to a large machine that had a long hose, a pumping system, and a huge steel vat, all on wheels, \"The Pump-o-matic 8000.  It's the newest machine on the market and the gainers love it!\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"How much?\"<br>\r\nBruce chuckled, \"More than you can afford, but, I feel nice.  You buy 100 bucks worth of supplies and I'll give it to you free.  Plus, I'll throw in some different sized vats.  This one would be perfect for the football player you mentioned, but I have a smaller one for the dancer and the bigger one for the third guy.\"<br>\r\nPuck loaded up on several different types of powders for the purchase; weight gain powders, muscle gain powders, and several powders that focused on specific body parts.  It rung up to 110 dollars and Puck eagerly loaded everything up and headed back to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Puck pulled his truck back into the spot it had previously occupied in Mike's driveway.  He unloaded the machine from the bed of his truck and pushed it inside, setting it up behind the couch.  Puck noticed that Sam was no longer on the couch snuggled between Finn and Mike's bloated, unconscious bodies and he raised his eyebrow, \"Wonder where he went...\"  Puck pushed the idea out of his head and began setting up the machine.  He locked the wheels in place so it wouldn't roll away and began looking over the product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interface for the machine was fairly straight forward:  You poured the bulking supplements and liquid into the vat and then stir it all together.  The control panel for the machine had a knob that you turned to change the speed of the pump's flow and there was a big red start/stop button.  Puck also noticed that the machine had a timer on it, so you could set it and just let it the machine do all the work.  With still no sign of Sam anywhere, Puck went back to his truck and grabbed the three containers he was given: a small one for Mike, a medium sized one for Finn, and a large one for Sam, as well as grabbing a can of black spray paint.  He took them into the backyard and sprayed each of their names onto the containers, and once they finished drying, brought them back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished setting up Sam's container, the blonde teen with full lips entered the room in only a towel, using a second one to dry his hair.  Puck looked over and grinned, happy to see that Sam was already developing a rather round belly, his abs no longer visible.  His face looked a little rounder as well, but other than those changes, he was still just as buff as before, \"OH, Sam!  I'm happy I found you, I was about to wake up Mike to test this out but since you're here I'll just use you.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Sam asked, lowering the towel from his face.  He saw the machine and raises both eyebrows quizzically, \"What IS that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little something that I got to help Finn here get as big as he possibly can!  I want to make sure it works so I need your help.\"  He said, walking over to Sam.<br>\r\n\"What, Dude.  I'm in a towel.  At least let me change before you start this.\"  Sam said, breaking free from Puck and walking back to the bathroom,putting on his boxers, and coming back in.  Sam sat back down on the couch as Puck walked behind it to the machine.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Puck, what do I have to d-\" before Sam could finish his sentence Puck jammed the tube into his mouth.  Sam looked back over the couch and watched as Puck filled the large container labeled \"SAM\" with several massive scoops of weight gain powder.  Sam sighed in his head and leaned back, waiting for Puck to start the machine up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck mixed the weight gain powder in with a gallon of milk from the fridge and stirred it in until all the power has mixed into the milk, turning it a light blue color.  He set the speed to slow, to see how quickly Sam could drink it, and hit the button.  The machine started up and began pumping it into Sam's belly.  It took Sam a moment to get a good rhythm, but once he did, he found that he actually really enjoyed it.  The powder made the milk taste a lot like chocolate milk and he couldn't stop himself from drinking it down as it continued to pump the stuff into his belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck watched with an extremely satisfied look on his face; getting this machine was an excellent choice.  Sam barely noticed how round and swollen his belly was getting as the milk/powder mixture continued to flow into him.  Puck, without asking Sam, turned the speed notch up a little bit, causing the speed of the liquid to flow faster into him.   After ten minutes the machine's liquid ran dry and Puck turned it off, pulling the tube from Sam's full lips, \"So, Sammy, how was it?\"<br>\r\nSam burped loudly and groaned, rubbing his full belly that stretched out far in front of him, \"It was amazing... but I think I drank too much...\"<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\"  Puck said, walking in front of him, \"You drank the entire vat!  That was way more than I thought you would be able to handle!\"  Puck rubbed Sam's belly, to ease the pressure, and grinned.  This new machine would cut the time it took too stuff these three guy in half, meaning they would gain a lot faster!  Puck was very excited, getting Finn attached to the machine would be a problem at all but he had to be careful about how he got Mike and Sam to use it.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finn's eyes slowly opened, finally waking up from his long nap.  The pasta and cake that Puck had stuffed him with had finished digesting and what was left behind was a much softer stomach that rested on Finn's lap.  He sat there for a moment, enjoying the feeling of his softer stomach, when the whirring sound fo a machine caught his attention.  Finn looked to his left and saw Sam passed out next to him, his stomach swollen to a size Finn didn't even think was possible, and Mike, who's stomach was also swelling to an amazing size.  Finn noticed that Mike's swollen gut was smaller than Sam's, but it looked like it was still growing.  The half awake Finn saw a tube in Mike's mouth and his sleepy eyes followed it to a large machine that was pumping his dancer best friend full of some kind of liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn watched, barely aware of what was happening to Mike.  His eyes shifted back and forth between the machine and Mike's swelling stomach.  Eventually, the machine stopped and Puck pulled the tube from Mike's mouth, \"Good work, Mike!  You drank the whole vat!  How was it?\"<br>\r\nMike belched and rubbed his stomach, \"Really fun but REALLY... difficult.\"  <br>\r\nPuck patted his belly, \"You'll grow into it, buddy.  Speaking of growing it looks like Finn is up.  How ya doin' big guy?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\nFinn blinked, confused and still sleepy, \"Uhhh... good?\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome.  Ya'hungry?\"  Puck asked, walking over to the pre-made vat labled \"FINN\" and replacing it with Mike's empty one.<br>\r\nFinn nodded and watched, still not understanding what Puck was doing.  This made Puck grin because a sleepy Finn is an easy to stuff-to-the-point-of-bursting Finn.  Puck walked over with the tube, \"Open wide, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn obeyed and opened his mouth wide, letting Puck insert the tube.  He leaned his head back and closed his eyes as Puck hit the start button, sending the chocolate milk weight gain formula into Finn's mouth, down his throat, and into his stomach.  It didn't hit Finn until 15 minutes of being stuffed with the formula had passed that he was being forcefed a weigh gain serum.  He clutched his belly and groaned as it swelled outward more and more, but no matter how badly he wanted to, he couldn't pull away from the tube.  Another 15 minutes passed and Finn groaned as Puck pulled the empty tube from his mouth, \"I'd say this experiment was a success.  Just look as how MASSIVE the three of you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Finn groaned as Sam continued to sleep, all three of their bellies swollen with the weight gain formula.  Sam's was the largest, followed by Finn's, and then Mike's.  The two were so stuffed that they passed out next to Sam and Puck just grinned to himself, excited to see how much weight they'll have gained by morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and by the time Sam, Mike, and Finn had woken up Puck had just finished a massive breakfast for all three of them, \"Morning, you three!  About time you woke up.\"<br>\r\n\"That smells amazing.\"  Sam said, pushing up from the couch.  Mike and Finn followed suit but all three quickly realized they had all gained weight over the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn, who was already fattening up and was bigger than the other two, had a much bigger, squishier stomach, and a softer, puffier chest.  His love handels has developed more and Puck licked his lips at the sight of them, wanting to squeeze them.  Finn's thighs has puffed out some, rubbing together, and though Puck couldn't see it from the kitchen, his ass had gotten much chunkier and fatter.  Finn's double chin was also becoming more prominent than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with Finn, Sam had also fattened up quite a lot.  Finn was already more muscular than Sam, and with the added weight looked bigger, but Sam had definitely put on the most fat over night.  Sam's stomach stuck out far in front of him under his puffy, soft pecs and he was even developing an adorable little paunch, but what surprised Puck was the drastic turn his weight had taken.  Puck has expected Sam to develop a more fatty upper half but it turned out Sam's body was more interested in being pear-shaped.  Sam's thighs and hips were twice as wide as they were before and strained the elastic of his boxers.  Puck could only assume that Sam was developing a bubble butt even bigger than Finn's and thought Sam's rounder face, combined with his full, sexy lips, was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had the least amount of weight on him but the growth was obvious.  Mike's once rock hard abs were gone and were replaced with a prominent ball belly underneath his strong pecs.  Most of Mike's weight went to his belly, but Puck could see a little softness on his chest and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck walked to his best friends and grinned, \"Well, well, well.  Looks like out little test run of the machine I bought was a success!\"<br>\r\n\"Mike and I didn't want to gain weight, Puck.  We just wanted to help Finn.\"  Sam said, obviously somewhat bothered by it.<br>\r\n\"Hey, these things happen.  It's like a contact high.  Contact weight gain.  How about you three hop on a scale and show me how much you've out on, huh?\"  <br>\r\nDespite not being happy about it Sam was curious.  All three of them went to the bathroom and weighed themselves.</span></div></div>",

Mike had just finished studying for an upcoming test and he was channel surfing, hoping he'd find something good on.  Mike stumbled across a re-run marathon of the 5th seasons of <i>America's Best Dance Crew</i>, a show he really loved.  As he watched, he found himself really being drawn towards the dance crew Heavy Impact, a group of 5 big men who were amazing dancers.  He could tell that all of these guys were strong men with muscle, but he was really amazed at how fast and talented they were despite their sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dance crew was eliminated from the show, Mike turned the TV off, not caring about who won at that point.  The dance moves of Heavy Impact really inspired him a way he hadn't thought of before.  Mike got up from his bed and walked over to his bedroom mirror, pulling his shirt off and looking himself over.  One of his greatest features had always been his toned body, but after seeing those dancers from ABDC, he could definitely see himself as a bigger guy.  The Mike thought about it, the more he would love to see himself with big arms, a wide back, and bigger, soft stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike put his hands on his abs, which he had put so much hard work into, \"Hmmm.  Maybe I should get a second opinion...\"  Mike pulled out his cell phone and called one of his friends from Glee club.  The phone rang for a few moments before...</span></div></div>",

It's some of the coolest dancing I have ever seen and you're a really good dancer.\" Sam said with certainty. <br>\r\n\"Well...what do you think of my abs?\" Mike asked and there was a pause. <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand the question. What do I think of your abs?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Do you think they're necessary to dance?\" <br>\r\n\"Um...I am not really qualified to answer that.\" Sam said haltingly. <br>\r\n\"Sure you are. You can dance and have are ripped just like me. Tell me, would it be weird to not have abs?\" <br>\r\n\"Er, I guess so. Why, are you getting fat?\" Sam laughed at his joke. Mike said nothing and Sam stopped laughing when he realized Mike didn't join in.\"<br>\r\n\"Woah, you're getting fat?!\" Sam asked, completely shocked. <br>\r\n\"Not exactly, at least not yet.\" Mike said. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" <br>\r\n\"I was watching America's Best Dance Crew and I saw something.\" Mike explained. <br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" <br>\r\n\"A dance group called Heavy Impact.\" <br>\r\n\"Who?\" <br>\r\n\"A group of extremely talented dancers who are not what you expect. They are all...big. I mean, really,\" <br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" <br>\r\n\"So I was thinking...they were all talented dancers.\"<br>\r\n\"They must be if you're impressed. You're going to have to show me some videos later.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah I will. But the point is, they were big and still danced like people less than half their size, and even better. They even do backflips and splits.\"<br>\r\n\"Impressive. I can't do a split, it hurts. And these are fat people?\" <br>\r\n\"Not fat, but definitely big. Let's just say you would never expect them to move like they do.\" <br>\r\n\"I believe you. Still, what does this have to do with why you called?\" <br>\r\n\"I was inspired by them.\" Mike said plainly and Sam felt the world come to a stop. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n\"I want to be like that. All big and stuff.\" Sam felt as if he had fallen into an alternate universe. <br>\r\n\"But...why? You have some of the most ripped abs I have ever seen and a very fine body. You're already a good dancer. Why would you want to change that?\" <br>\r\n\"Because I want to be known for more than my abs.\" <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n\"What's the first thing everybody thinks when my name is said.\"<br>\r\n\"Dancing,\" Sam said right away. <br>\r\n\"What's the second?\" Mike asked again.<br>\r\n\"Abs,\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"That's exactly the problem. I don't want to be known for that.\" <br>\r\n\"Why?\" Sam was curious to know. <br>\r\n\"I...it's hard to explain. I'm not quite sure if I even know myself. It's just that when people think about me, they don't think about me but what I look like. I mean, they don't really like me for me, if you're getting this. I am a dancer so that is fine. But I am also known for my flat stomach which I am not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get you. So you don't feel people like you for you but for your body and that doesn't seem right does it?\" <br>\r\n\"No. Besides, all Tina ever wants to do is play and lick at my abs. I can't help but wonder if she likes me or if she just likes me for my abs.\" <br>\r\n\"I think she likes you,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"I hope so, but every now and then I just wonder...if it would be the same if I wasn't.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. I see what you mean. I sometimes wondered things like that myself when I was with Quinn and and then Mercedes. If I didn't have the perfect body, would they still like me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it takes a lot of work to maintain. Possibly too much work. I mean dance helps keep trimness but not that much. It is actually a lot harder than you expect. And at first I thought it was necessary for good dancing. Then Heavy Impact comes and dances to the same skill, and oftentimes better, than people who were thin. So I can't help but wonder why I even need my sixpack? If people truly care, they would be fine with whether I have a sixpack or not. And if it's not necessary for people to care or for dancing, I don't really need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point.\" Sam said. \"If they do, they wouldn't care either way.\" <br>\r\n\"So I plan on bulking up because in certain cases, bigger is better.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n\"Want to help?\" <br>\r\n\"This is really weird but sure.\" Sam said shrugging. <br>\r\n\"Good, let's do it.\" <br>\r\n\"If it's what you want...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll help you. See you in a few minutes.\" Sam hung up the phone and Mike was excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where are your folks?\"  Sam asked, walking inside with an extra large pepperoni pizza in his hand.  \"They're out of town for the week visiting family.  You don't expect me to eat all of that, do you?\"  Sam set the pizza on the coffee table, \"Sure do.  You wanna get big, right?  That means you gotta eat a LOT of food, even if it means stuffing yourself with a massive pizza like this.\" Sam was right, the pizza he had brought over was massive, but it would help  Mike walked over and sat down on the couch, \"All right, lets do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second though, Mike opened the pizza box and took the biggest slice he could find and started eating.  He and Sam spent the next thirty minutes just talking and hanging out while Mike ate.  Mike even pulled up the Heavy Impact performances and Sam was amazed at how good these guys were, \"Damn, Mike.  You weren't lying when you said they were talented.\"  The two watched a couple of TV shows while Mike slowly chipped away the pizza, getting incredibly full as he did.  Eventually, Mike finally stopped and fell back on the couch, his rock hard abs bloated from eating so much pizza.  He let out a large burp before putting both hands on his stomach, \"UUUUUUUURP... Oh god, I have never had that much food before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam picked up one of the three slices left and held it up to Mike, \"Come on, Mike, you gotta finish.  You asked for my help and that's what I'm here to do.\"  Mike grumbled, thinking it over, before deciding that Sam was right.  He needed to eat if he wanted to gain any weight.  Mike sat back into the couch as Sam feed him the last three slices of pizza, making him so full that he could barely move, \"Oh god... I think that was too much..\"  Sam chuckled and lifted Mike's shirt up, revealing the dancer's bloated belly, \"Here, let me help you.\"  Sam put both of his big hands on Mike's stomach and began to rub in slow circles, which made Mike moan happily.  Sam was amazing at this and there was no way he'd let him stop.  Mike just sat back and enjoyed the belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hour passed of Mike and Sam just talking and watched TV, Sam's hands never leaving Mike's bloated belly.  Eventually, Sam pulled his hands back and got up, \"Hey, where are you going?\"  Mike asked.  Sam pulled his jacket back on and smiled, \"I'm heading...\"</span></div></div>",

But I'll see you tomorrow if you're available. No school tomorrow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. See you tomorrow,\" Mike burped one last time causing Sam to chuckle as he gave a few last belly rubs. \"Or you can stay,\" Mike said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, but I'll be over tomorrow, promise.\" With that, Sam walked out the door waving goodbye and Mike got up with a struggle. Man he was full, even now. He made it a few steps to the couch which he promptly dropped down upon. Yawning he laid down. He was glad his parents were out of town for the week which was rare enough. He loved them but he needed a break sometimes from their very gungho drivenness. He was more than happy to kick back and relax for once. Feeling his stuffed belly he rubbed it, amazed at the feeling. It felt so good, like when he mastered a dance successfully. He couldn't believe he hadn't done this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the doorbell woke him from his sleep. Feeling refreshed, Mike went to the door and opened it as Sam came back in with a couple boxes. <br>\r\n\"Hey Mike, I'm here like I said and I brought you breakfast,\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"I see that. What did you bring?\" <br>\r\n\"Donuts, lots of them.\" <br>\r\n\"Glazed and the ones with cream in them?\" Mike asked curiously. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, got both kinds. I remembered those were your favorite.\" <br>\r\n\"You bet they are.\" Sam opened the first box and grinned as Mike drooled. <br>\r\n\"I haven't had donuts in forever,\" he said. \"This is wonderful.\" <br>\r\n\"Glad you like it.\" Sam put the box down and moved back, sitting on the couch as he watched Mike pull out the donut and bite into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhh oh my god, these are so good,\" Mike said as he took another big hunk and licked his lips, after some sugar settled there. Pretty quickly the first donut was gone and he pulled out another one, this one with cream. Taking a bite out of it he moaned again as this delicious cream filled his mouth. \"I can't thank you enough, really,\" Mike said as he swallowed. \"These are so good.\" Sam shifted embarassed and flattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, I'm glad you like them. I wasn't sure what to get you at first until I passed a Donut shop and it came to me you might like those. Clearly you do.\" <br>\r\n\"You bet I do! These donuts are awesome!\" Sam smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" he said as he watched Mike bite into a third donut, chewing happily. Sam carefully pulled out a glazed donut in the other box and bit into it, suddenly in the mood for donuts himself. He stopped shocked for a moment. Damn, those were good donuts! He chewed faster reveling in the taste as he watched Mike take out another cream and accidentally squirting it on himself when he bit it and started licking it off. </span></div></div>",

Sam knew not to eat too many, these were for Mike and he had to watch his figure, so he only ate three of them, leaving the other twenty-one donuts for Mike.  As Sam took the last bite of his donut, Mike reached in and grabbed his fifth one, finishing it in a few bites and grabbing another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mike, you're really powering through those!\"  Sam said, impressed.  Mike, almost in a trance, just kept eating and eating.  Sam got up and went to the fridge, pulling out the new carton of milk and sitting back down next to Mike, handing him the carton, \"Here, drink this.  It'll help clear your throat.\"  Mike swallowed his tenth donut and took the jug, chugging down a large portion of it before pulling it away and letting out a massive belch.<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPP..... WOO!!  This is AMAZING.\"  He said, putting down the jug and grabbing a donut in each hand, alternating between bites of each.  <br>\r\nSam put his hand on Mike's shoulder, \"You should really slow down, Mike.  You're gonna get sick if you keep eating this fast.  You need to slow down in the early stages.\"<br>\r\nMike finished the two donuts in his hands and burped again, \"UUUURPPP....  Yeah, you're right... They're just SO GOOD.\"  Mike picked up another donut and kept going, eating a bit slower this time but determined to finish the box.  Half and hour, two boxes of donuts, and a jug of milk later, Mike was laying on the couch with a bloated stomach, smiling through the pain because he was actually able to eat all of that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cracking his fingers, Sam got to work. Placing his hands on Mike's swollen belly, he gently rubbed, listening to the moan of pain turn to one of appreciation (mixed with pain). Sam again marveled at how big Mike got after eating and how stuffed that belly felt, the bulging protrusion very different than Mike's normal flat abs. It hadn't been very long since they had started but already Mike seemed more open and relaxed, much less stressed. He was happier and if Mike was happy with a belly, there was no way Sam was going to stop him, unless it got too extreme even for him. Sam had always wondered what Mike would look like with a belly hypothetically, but now he got an unexpected opportunity to test his hypothesis in real life. As long as Mike was okay with it, Sam was going to help him achieve it, and if he also had a personal interest and curiousity in helping people grow, that was his business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrpppppppppp,\" Mike belched loudly and Sam smirked at the relief and self-satisfied expression that crossed Mike's face, <br>\r\n\"Impressive dude, you're more of a man than ever before.\" Sam continued his pleasurable rubbing. Mike nodded and placed a hand on his stomach as well, having Sam pause. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I finally feel like one.\" Sam raised his eyebrows in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean you never felt like one before?\" Mike shrugged his shoulders awkwardly. <br>\r\n\"No, that didn't come out right. It's kind of hard to explain. Yes I was a guy but never felt like one because of my dancing and extreme body proportion? And so much pressure and effort, I don't know. It just feels good to kick back and relax.\" He let out another long belch and sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuurrrrrrrpppp, oh man that hit the spot. I finally get why its so much fun to eat when you don't have to worry about impressing anyone. After the pain, it is like the best feeling ever. No wonder people do it.\" Sam smiled at Mike's enthusiasm and resumed rubbing, eliciting even more moans of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially after a....uuuuuurrrrrpppp...big meal and someone....urrrrrrrrrrrppppp does that,\" Mike groaned in pleasure at the touch of Sam's hands which felt heavenly rubbing his full stomach. He could really get used to this, the whole eating thing. Not just as an experiment but as something to legitimately work on. His fantasy of becoming of bigger dancer might not just be a fantasy but an actual reality. Sure his parents might be freaked out at first but they would hopefully accept it. If not, oh well. And it would honestly be a relief to get rid of his abs. Other people might have admired them from afar but they were hard to keep and maintain, especially ones as defined as his. He secretly had wondered what it would be like to have a gut, one that was both round and hard. However, he had done nothing about it and pushed those thoughts aside until now. Now that he knew it was possible, he wanted to try to do something he always dreamed (after dancing). With his friend Sam's help, he could do this. The only thing that bothered him was what Tina would think. Would Tina be okay with him losing his abs and being more of his full self? Or would she want him to stop? Mike wasn't sure if he wanted to stop. but Tina's opinion did matter to him and he couldn't in conscious continue until he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, would you mind if Tina came over?\" <br>\r\n\"Not at all, but are you sure?\" Sam asked, figuring out what Mike was thinking.<br>\r\n\"Not at all but I do hope she would be okay with me getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"And if not?\" Sam asked concerned. <br>\r\n\"I...well, I don't know. I love her but I want to go through with this. We'll just see when she gets here.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, if you're sure.\" Sam said, taking one hand off to get his cellphone. The Glee Kids all had each other's phones under contacts so Sam pushed Tina. <br>\r\n\"Hi Tina, it's me Sam and I'm hanging out with Mike. He wants you to come over and give your opinion on something that he has thought about for a while. What? Oh, see you soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Mike asked. <br>\r\n\"She's on her way over now,\" Sam said, a little bit of disappointment in his face because his time might be cut short if Tina doens't like it and Mike gives up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything went the opposite of how Mike had hoped it would: Tina wasn't happy with his new decision to gain weight, and after almost 20 minutes of trying to get through to her, Tina left angry.  Mike slumped into the couch and put his head in his hands - upset.  Sam sat down next to him and rubbed his shoulder, \"Hey, it's okay, dude.  It's not like she broke up with you or anything.  Tina just needs time to think this over.  She's just concerned that this will effect your dancing and health.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's right...\"  Mike said sadly.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hey!  That's quitter talk, Mike.  I will NOT let you give up on this dream of getting big, got it?\"<br>\r\nMike smiled at Sam, \"Thanks, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled back and got up, \"How you feelin?\"<br>\r\n\"Hungry.\"  Mike said, rubbing his stomach.  His bloated belly had shrunken down back to his flat, muscular stomach, though Mike didn't realize that his abs were slightly softer now.<br>\r\n\"Perfect!  I've got just the thing.\"  Sam said, \"I'll be right back.\"  Sam walked outside and came back in after only a minute, tossing a bag of chips to Mike, \"Here, munch on those while I go grab something.\"<br>\r\nMike opened the large bag of chips and started eating happily while Sam was gone.  After about 15 minutes, Sam came back in just as Mike was pouring the last crumbs of the chips into his mouth, \"Perfect timing!\"  Sam said, congratulating himself.  Mike watches as Sam set down a massive chocolate cake on the coffee table, cutting a gigantic slice and putting it on a paper plate, \"Eat up!\"  Sam said, handing it to Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, eager to become the gigantic dancer he's always wanted to be, dug in, eating as quickly as he possibly could so he could get more.  After he finished the first huge slice, Sam plopped another down on his plate, refusing to let Mike go without.</span></div></div>",

I do believe you could eat at least a little more. We'll just go more slowly to allow it to settle and so you don't throw up.<br>\r\n\"But I don't really-\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were such a quitter Mike,\" Sam interrupted. \"How can you hope to be a dancer if you quit when it gets a little tough? You'd never make it.\"<br>\r\n\"But that's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not different from this. This is about never giving up and if you think this is hard, you would never make it as you would be giving up on yourself. Now you're going to eat until you really can't eat anymore and you're going to enjoy every last bite of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...\"Mike started and Sam smirked. <br>\r\n\"Why, I feed you of course until I decide you've had enough.\" Before Mike could start to say anymore protestations, Sam shoved the first part of cake into Mike's mouth, forcing him to chew and swallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel that? It's good,\" Sam said as he started tracing patterns on Mike's stomach. Mike panted a little. <br>\r\n\"I-urp-guess,\" Mike muttered, still with a slightly sick face. Sam nodded satisfied. <br>\r\n\"Good. You're a big boy, and big boys need to eat.\" Mike raised his eyebrows at the tone in Sam's voice. <br>\r\n\"Okay dude, don't start talking like that, its kind of creepy.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry. Got a little carried away,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a surprisingly good eater, I still have a bit of trouble believing it,\" Sam said as Mike reluctantly chewed the remaining part of the third slice of cake. <br>\r\n\"I guess because I've spent repressing hunger for so long...but this is a bit overkill. I feel like a stuffed pumpkin.\" Sam laughed, amused at Mike's comparison.<br>\r\n\"Getting round like one too, and it will one day be permanent although with a lot less pain than there is now. I'm really sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n\"It's...okay. You're absolutely right about not giving up, yet anyways. Though I would say this is a lot harder than dancing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancing comes more natural to you and is your talent. But I say you're pretty good at this as well. I mean, I don't know many people who would be able to eat all you did and still have determination to eat more.\" Mike groaned as his belly churned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well my body disagrees.\" Sam leapt into action taking out pepto-bismol from his pocket and poured some for Mike who drank it.<br>\r\n\"You keep medicine in your pocket?\" Mike had been surprised when Sam so readily had it on hand.<br>\r\n\"I like to be prepared. Now for part 2.\" Cracking his knuckles, Sam put both hands on Mike's distended stomach and started massaging. Mike groaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you are-uuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrpppp-really good at this,\" Mike got out before descending into another series of impressively long burps, Sam kept on a straight face as he rubbed Mike's bloated belly. When Mike finally started settling down, Sam got out cake number four. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more and then you can rest,\" Sam said. Mike was kind of out of it and his head felt heavy.<br>\r\n\"O...okay.\" With gentle care, Sam started feeding pieces of cake to Mike not wanting to push to much. However, the reluctance was knocked out of Mike and he slowly but surely ate each and every small piece, obediently opening his mouth when Sam waved something in front of it. When Mike, who's eyes were half-closed opened his mouth and nothing came in, he forced his heavy eyes open to look at Sam's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Mike asked disoriented. <br>\r\n\"You ate every piece and are at full capacity,\" Sam said, his fingers lightly brushing over Mike's rounded and over-stuffed gut. <br>\r\nYay...\" Mike muttered sarcastically as he let out another quick burp. \"Now can I sleep?\" <br>\r\n\"Of course you can, you earned a rest. I must say I am quite impressed.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, tell me that when I can care,\" Mike groaned out. Suddenly like a flash he was asleep. Sam sat there for a few moments. <br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\" Getting up, Sam took the rest of the cake back to the fridge for later. Going back to the living room, he looked at the couch and at the passed out Mike on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he muttered, then got onto the couch and pulled up a blanket. Putting his head on the pillow, Sam closed his eyes and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He was in the kitchen making a massive stack of pancakes with huge piles of bacon and hashbrowns when there was a knock at the door.  Sam opened the door, confused, and to his surprise he saw Puck standing there with a bag full of chips and snack cakes, as well as his copy of Halo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy?  What are you doin' here?\"  Puck asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you the same thing.\"  Sam said, moving aside to let Puck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck walked inside and set down the bag and game on the couch, \"Mike invited me over a few days ago.  I was busy and couldn't make it until today.\" Puck looked down at Mike and raised an eyebrow, \"Whats with Mike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rubbed the back of his neck, thinking of a way to explain it, \"Well... I'll just be blunt.  I'm helping Mike gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... GAIN weight.  As in, Mike wants to be <i>fat</i>?\"  Puck said, a look of both confusion and excitement on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded, \"Not just fat, muscular too.  He saw a dance crew on a TV show comprised of big guys and he wants to be like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck put his hand on Sam's shoulder, \"Sam, why didn't you tell me!  Look, I don't go around telling a lot of people this, but you're one of my best friends and I think you have a right to know.  I'm an encourager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An encourager.\"  Puck repeated, \"I like to help and watch guys get bigger.  You haven't seen Dave Karofsky since he switched schools, but dude, I made him HUGE.  Massive muscles, a gigantic belly, thick legs, the works.  He's the star football player at his school now!\"  Puck made sure to leave out the part where he got turned on by it, as well as the many times he and the MUCH larger Dave fooled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..  well that's pretty good new then!\"  Sam said, heading back into the kitchen.  As he started cooking again, Mike groaned a little as he awoke, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, \"Oh... Hey, Puck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there big guy!\"  Puck said, kneeling down and patting Mike's tiny belly, \"Sam filled me in on what you're doing and I'm gonna help!  I've got a bit of experience in this department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike, still half asleep, simply nodded before getting up, \"Whats that smell?\"  Mike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\"  Sam called, \"It'll be a bit before it's done though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck, hearing this, set Sam down on the couch and opened up a box of twinkies, \"I'll take care of Mike, Sam.  You just keep cooking!\"   Puck grabbed a twinkie and held it up to Mike's mouth, \"Open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sleepily opened wide and Puck shoved the twinkie in, excited to see his friend get huge.</span></div></div>",

Odd that it was Puck feeding him though, he would have thought it would be Tina or Sam. There was no reason though that Noah Puckerman would be at his house so early in the morning feeding him. Especially with the excitement Puck had on his face as he fed Mike. The real Puck would probably hit him for even imagining such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually there was a disappointed huff. Mike watched as Puck rooted through the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, no more. I would open another box but I think Sam is finishing breakfast soon and I don't want to ruin your appetite after all.\" Puck grinned and licked his lips and Mike cocked his head in confusion. This dream was turning even weirder as Puck laid a hand on Mike's belly and rubbed, patting it as he went to the kitchen to join Sam. How very weird. He must be really out of it if he dreamed of Puck touching him, especially since Puck was one of the straightest people Mike knew. He wondered when he was going to wake up and this weirdness would be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the smell of cooking bacon and pancakes slowly pulled Mike from his dream state. Breathing in deeply, Mike walked into the kitchen smiling as he said \"Good morning Sam-\" when he stopped and stared. There sitting at the table eating a bagel was none other than Noah Puckerman. Still staring, Mike sat down in wonder. \"What? That wasn't a dream?\" Puck raised his eyebrows at that and smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm a dream but what made you think you think that was what you were doing? Now come on, start eating this delicious looking breakfast Sam made and we can possibly all play some Halo or something afterwards. </span></div></div>",

Helping you with your goal to get big like a good supportive friend and also because its freaking awesome you've decided too.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay but why...\" Mike started before Puck sighed.<br>\r\n\"Enough questions already, just go with it capiche? Just be content that Sam and I will be helping you in your rather surprisingly unexpected goal. I'd have pregged almost anyone else before you as more likely to be a gainer but here you are rather than someone like say Mr. Schue. Hey, do you think Mr. Schue would ever consider...?\" Sam nudged Puck again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus and eyes on the prize,\" Sam said. That was something they all heard often from Coach Beiste in pre-game pep talks and in practice. Puck straightened up. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course. Enough talking, you ready Mikey?<br>\r\n\"Of-of course,\" Mike stammered. Puck gave a grin of reassurance. <br>\r\n\"Relax Mike, we're not here to hurt you, only to help. You came to us first and here we are.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? No one ever said anything about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore the big bonehead. He doesn't know what he's saying,\" Sam said glaring over. Puck smiled and grinned, waving mockingly and fingered Sam when he his back was turned, winking at Mike as he did so. It was finally beginning to settle in that this was reality and not just some very vivid hallucination and Mike was finally feeling more comfortable as his friends joked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really hurts right here,\" Puck said dramatically, pointing at his heart. \"Right in here.\"<br>\r\n\"So, pancakes?\" Sam asked, ignoring Puck's antics for the moment. Puck sobered up and settled down in a more serious mood.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Mike asked, wondering if that was a question or a statement.<br>\r\n\"How many?\"<br>\r\n\"How about-\" Mike started before Puck cut in. <br>\r\n\"He'll have four,\" he said and Mike glanced over. That had not been what he was going to say at all.<br>\r\n\"I was going to say more like two-\"<br>\r\n\"Four it is,\" Sam said with a smirk and left before Mike could protest again to get the batch. Mike glared at Puck who whistled innocently.<br>\r\n\"You're ganging up on me aren't you,\" he asked and Puck smiled ambiguously.<br>\r\n\"Only if you believe that,\" he smirked tauntingly and Mike wished he could knock that irritating knowing smile off his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon heavily laden plates of pancakes smothered in what was certainly unhealthy but amazing tasting syrup and loads of butter was placed in front of everyone as well as additional plates of bacon (Puck the exception, he got toast instead) and scrambled eggs. Sam said a quick prayer thanking God before lifting his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can now eat.\" Puck had been examing the food on the table and Sam the entire time while he prayed and he had his eyebrows raised as he puzzled something out. It was pretty obvious what it was since Mike had to wonder as well how Sam could whip up a breakfast like that and not be...well, giant. Sam seemed unaware as he cut into his pancakes eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't just sit there, eat up! I can assure you its not poisoned or whatever.\" That was the furthest thing from anyone's mind but Puck shrugged as he started eating as did Mike. Sam smiled behind a glass of milk as he watched, thoughts of his own forming in mind as Puck and Mike first slowly and then with greater speed and enjoyment started to eat. </span></div></div>",

While Puck was stuffing Mike with twinkies, Sam had snuck in a couple of spoonfuls of weight gain powder that Puck had recommended to him before.  For a while Sam had been wanting to get into the feeder/gainer business and he knew Puck was pretty well known in town for doing so.  Sam had snuck the bottle of gainer shake into the house while Mike slept and it was designed to make the devourer both incredibly full and starving at the same time, while making it easier to put on weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had made two seperate batches of pancake batter; one for Mike which was laced with the powder, and one for him and Puck.  The pancake on the top of Sam's plate was regular one, while the other three were the ones laced with the powder.  Sam at the top one, and then pushed the plate back, wiping his mouth, \"I'm done.  You can have the rest, Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam got up and went to the kitchen, Mike didn't even notice.  When Sam pushed the plate towards him, he had already finished his plate and quickly started devouring the next.  He had no idea what had gotten over him but the only thing he was compelled to do was to just eat, eat, eat.  Puck, on the other hand, was definitely hungrier than normal, but he wasn't inhaling food like Mike was.  Sam had given him one pancake with the powder, which was enough to make Puck hungrier but not a black hole like Mike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast went on for two hours due to Mike's constant need for food.  Sam continued to make the gainer powder laced pancakes, but after the ninth plate, he just went to making normal ones for Mike.  By the end of the feast, Mike had eaten 12 plates, a total 48 pancakes total.  Puck had only eaten three plates.  Mike leaned back in his chair, his stomach bloated outward with the fluffy, delicious food he had just devoured.  Without a word, Sam walked over and smiled warmly at Mike, his hands rubbing his bloated belly, \"There, there, big guy.  You ate a lot today!  I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck, who was relaxing on the couch watching TV, \"What about my tummy?\"  He sad, a goofy pout on his face.<br>\r\n\"You'll get your turn.\"  Sam said, focusing on the growing dancer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dave Karofsky had always been a talented athlete. He had been especially blessed with his size which was bigger and thicker than most people his age and while it had been a little awkward growing up, it helped a lot in sports. Unfortunately growing up, it also got him teased a lot because he had been a bigger and kind of chubby kid before it distributed more evenly. Course, he was still thickset and there was a soft pudginess to his stomach that wouldn't go away no matter what he did. And he had tried, going on diets, running laps, swimming, he done it all. It stubbornly remained and it just left him hungry and out of breath. Outside some of his friends on the football team, he was quite possibly the largest guy in McKinnley, and that wasn't always meant as a compliment. He knew that when some of the guys thought he couldn't hear, they mocked his pudginess and likened him to a pig. A pig, and he lead their team to victory on the ice in hockey and field in Lacrosse. He was not all that fat, he didn't think, and he had plenty of muscle in addition, especially in the arms, legs, chest, and back. Even so, he sometimes couldn't help but wish to be smaller. The only good thing was that most did not know he was into guys. If that was ever released, it wouldn't matter how many times he had been useful or that he could easily kick their asses, they'd destroy him without mercy. He admitted that he had been none to pleasant himself when it came to punishing the gay but he had too to fit in lest he be grouped with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen shit hit the fan, he attacked lady lips Hummel and in the heat of the moment kissed and then threatened to kill him. He did not mean to do that and he actually did not like Kurt in that way but he had to know what it would be like to kiss a guy, especially one that was overtly and obviously gay. And the death threat...well, he regretted that. He regretted going that far, scaring the life out of the twink. It was just that Kurt was a notorious gossip and who knew who he would tell? It didn't matter though, he got suspended and his dad had a conniption and Kurt moved. He was relieved when Kurt came back because the guilt had been killing him inside. He and the gleek squad came to a bit of a truce where he preserved his reputation dating Santana (who was Lesbian herself and ironically interested in a certain women while he was interested in men) and they even had an anti-bullying club which gained a lot of legitimacy when Dave stopped following the wants of his team mates and did what he thought was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was a new year and a new school. He wasn't allowed at McKinnley anymore even with the anti-bullying thing because of various past mistakes (and what happened at prom but he had nothing to do with that). His dad instead sent him to another private school (not the one Kurt went to, Balton or whatever the hell it was, a different one) and it was the weirdest change in his life. There he was one of the most popular and well liked people which was disconcerting, being both popular and well liked. Most people can't be both and some are even either. But there they loved him, the exact opposite of McKinnley. Course, it'd be a different story if he acted like how he had when he had been at McKinnley. Still, woah. They all admired his size and strength and the coaches praised him openly wanting other people to be just like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the scene at the gaybar where none of his old friends would ever be caught dead (literally) he was friendly with everyone and they always seemed to be calling him a bear for some reason. Then one day he got the news. Although Dave was extraordinary among people his age, he barely stood a chance against the older footballers who were just as if not more talented and bigger. He was requested to bulk up a bit, get even stronger and wider if he wanted to continue playing and Dave promised to. He was thinking on just how to do that when the answer came to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an ordinary night at the bar with Dave calmly sitting there drinking his drink when one of the most least likely people he'd ever thought to see came in the door. Well, second most, the least likely would probably be his former friend Azimio, but that was beside the point. The point was that it was someone he recognized. He watched startled as Puck calm as day sauntered up and ordered a Jack Daniels and sat a few seats down from him. Dave stood up and walked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck? What are you doing here?\" The mohawked man turned and grinned, surprising Dave even more. <br>\r\n\"Hi Dave.\" Puck said Dave. Not Karofsky but he said Dave. Dave couldn't believe it. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Puck? You do know where you are right?\" Puck shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite aware. I think the dudes in drag over there would have been enough of a giveaway.\" Puck said pointing to a couple across the room. \"I'm just here watching over Kurt and making sure he doesn't get into trouble. Burt and Finn don't want him home drunk again and he is a lightweight.\" He took another sip of his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're fine with you getting drunk?\" Dave asked confused. He couldn't see how Puck drinking prevented a drunk Kurt. Puck just laughed and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, but a man's got to have his pleasures and I figure why not, I'm in a bar all the same. Besides, I'm not intending to get drunk, just a little buzzed. I have to be sober enough to drive Kurt home if need be.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he know you're here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not but he must spot me at some time unless he's totally focused on Blaine. Which is probably the case. Right over there, example A.\" Puck pointed to where Kurt and Blaine were dancing. \"I sound like a total girl for saying this but they're cute together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Dave said. Puck looked askance at him for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Are you still crushing on him?\" Puck asked, his voice with a tinge of threat. Dave shook his head rapidly not wanting to piss him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I'm way over that. I just don't know Blaine all that well and he seems kind of...boring. Plus, that is an awful bow-tie. I can not believe Kurt is actually allowing him to wear something like that. Even I know that's horrendous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never heard him sing or saw him perform. He's fantastic. Although when he isn't, I do have to admit he kind of is boring. And the fact that Kurt hasn't collected all of Blaine's bow-ties and shorts and burned them yet really must mean he's in love because normally Kurt would probably die inside. Then again, he's hanging with Berry now, new bffl's.\" Dave raised his eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bffl's?\" He had no idea what that meant. <br>\r\n\"Best friends for life, it's a girl thing I think.\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Dave had no idea what to say to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's life treating you Karofsky,\" Puck said after about half the bottle was gone. Licking his lips, he scanned the room and tapped his long fingers nervously. How long was this going to take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could still call me Dave,\" Dave said sardonically rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Sorry Kar-I mean Dave. So weird seeing you outside school and your 'friends'.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, they weren't my true friends. I'm actually relieved to be rid of them.\" <br>\r\n\"That's awesome.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm actually pretty popular there. And they're very accepting of gays unlike McKinnley.\" Puck raised his eyebrows. <br>\r\n\"No way, I don't believe you.\" <br>\r\n\"No 'tis true,\" Dave said grinning. <br>\r\n\"That's awesome man,\" Puck said, as he started on another bottle. <br>\r\n\"You should probably slow down,\" Dave said concerned and Puck laughed. <br>\r\n\"No worries, it takes a lot for me to get drunk.\" <br>\r\n\"That's...a bit concerning,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, so anyways, tell me more.\" <br>\r\n\"I've been chosen for a football scholarship, full ride,\" Dave said proudly and Puck smiled. <br>\r\n\"Congratulations man,\" he said putting his hand out for a fistbump like they used to back in elementary and middle school. Dave does so eagerly. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's not so much guaranteed yet, but rather provisional,\" Dave admitted and Puck looked at him confused. <br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought you got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, but not yet. There is a bit of a stipulation for me to receive it.\" Puck was still confused as he tried to think if he knew the word stipulation. Dave grinned and rolled his eyes. \"An extra requirement. I have to get bigger to compete in the big leagues.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are pretty big already,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the recruiter thinks it's possible to be even more ready. Plus this is the big leagues.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dave says. <br>\r\n\"I could help,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" </span></div></div>",

I can't make any fancy shit but I've got a cook book at home with tons of great recipes that'll put some more meat on your bones.\"  Puck said with an oddly excited grin.<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure!  This is gonna help a lot!  Thanks, Puck.\"  Dave said cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"No prob, Dave!!  We'll start tomorrow.  I'll meet you at your place after I get out of school.\"  Puck said before patting Dave's wide back and walking over to check on Kurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was sitting in his history class wiggling his pencil between his thick fingers the next day.  Ever since last night he couldn't get the idea of Puck cooking for him and helping him grow out of his head.  He was excited and couldn't wait to start.  Dave sat back a little and looked down at his already big belly which, along with his muscles and tall stature, had helped him in many football games.  He noticed that his new school's maroon uniform jacket clung tightly to his stomach - he had put some weight on since he bought it at the beginning of the year and it was starting to show.  He patted it softly, not wanting anyway on to see, and jumped a little when the dismissal bell rang.  Dave packed up his things and hurried to his car, his thick arms wrapped around his torso to keep warm.  Dave DESPISED the winter seasons because of how cold it always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Dave got into his car he cranked the heater up and drove home, which was about a half hour drive.  He pulled into his driveway and sent Puck a text saying he was home before hurrying inside.  The first thing Dave did was start a fire in the fireplace, which always made the house extremely warm and comfy.  A few minutes later and there was a knock at the door.  Dave opened the door and Puck smiled up at, \"Hey, big guy!!  Let's get started!\"  Puck made his way inside with two grocery bags in hand and a big book under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"This is that cook book I told you about!!  This thing is full of amazingly fattening recipes that'll turn you into a mountain of a man in no time!\"  Puck set the bags on the counter and searched Dave's kitchen until found the largest frying pan.  Without waiting, he turned the stove top on and dropped two large burger patties on the pan, \"So, Dave.  How much do you weight right now?\"<br>\r\n\"I weighed myself yesterday...\"  Dave said, \"I weigh 235.\"<br>\r\n\"235!!  Dude, you're HUGE.\"  Puck said turning around.  His eyes instantly zoomed into Dave's belly, \"And your uniform seems to agree with me.  The buttons on that blazer look like they're about to burst.\"  Puck smacked both hands onto the sides of Dave's stomach, grinning at the loud THUMP sound it made, \"I'm gonna make you so big these buttons are gonna pop off!\"<br>\r\nDave wasn't sure why, but that made him blush.  Puck patted Dave's belly and walked back over to the first of several burgers he was making for Dave.  Puck's first meal for Dave is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Puck and Dave small-chatted while Puck flipped the bugers, making sure they were evenly cooked but not overdone. When they were done, Puck turned the stove off. The fries he had done earlier and Puck rubbed his hands together as he stood back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Now for the icecream. Do you want Chocolate, Cookies&amp;cream, Oreo, Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough...\" Dave blinked. <br>\r\n\"Woah, how much icecream did you buy? The entire stock of flavors?\" he asked stunned. Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Nah, not that much. I just wasn't sure which you preferred. So, what do you feel like?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Cookie Dough I guess,\" Dave said unsure although Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Okay, let me just go get it.\" Puck left through the door and came back a few minutes later with a tub of Cookie Dough,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get the rest from the trunk later,\" Puck said as he came in. \"I'm not entirely sure if I even needed the cooling, it's fucking cold outside. No wonder you like the heat.\" Puck put the icecream down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where can I get a scoop?\" he asked and Dave almost in a daze points to where it was kept. Puck grabs it and the blender on the counter and started scooping out giant chunks of icecream. Grabbing milk from the fridge, he also pours it in and pushes blend. There is no talking over the sound of blender, not that it was possible, and when he judged it thoroughly mixed, Puck turned it off and poured the thick mix into glasses for him and Dave. Finally, Puck backed up, putting the burgers onto the buns and bringing out the fries. Then he stood there awkwardly for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, bon-appetite, or something like that, I'm not entirely sure.\" Sitting on a kitchen table stool, he settled in to watch. Dave lifted the first burger and took a bite. He chewed first slowly, then with increasing speed as he tasted one of the best burgers he had ever tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Dave puffed between bites, \"these hamburgers are amazing!\" Puck nodded pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, I do make good burgers don't I?\" His mouth full of meat, all Dave could do was nod. When he finished the first big burger, Dave took pause to grab handfuls of fries and stuffed them into his mouth. One handful after another, his stomach calling out for more as it always did. Taking another burger, he bit into it eagerly, savoring the tender juicy meat Puck had cooked to perfection. What was startling was how good a cook Puck was, especially at burgers although that was all Dave knew Puck could do. He had no idea of Puck's other skills at cooking yet. Thirsty, Dave turned to the milkshake. It was a rich and surprisingly thick mixture that made the going tough but tasted wonderful at the same time. Despite beginning to feel full as the mixture already drunk settled inside with those juicy burgers and fries, Dave kept going. Picking up the third and final burger, Dave laboriously took another bite. It still tasted amazing and was pretty much the only thing that kept him going on. Puck eagerly watched as Dave forced bite after bite down, offering encouragement and cheering all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Karofsky, I know you can eat more than that. You're the man.\" \"Think of how big and powerful it makes you feel. \"Keep going almost there.\" Puck cheered as the last bit of meat fell in Karofsky's lips and down his gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it man! I knew you could.\" Dave groaned and leaned back on his stool, releasing a massive belch. <br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPP, yeah, whatevs,\" Dave said, his hands fumbling. Puck immediately stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get that for you,\" Puck said moving over, his hands pushing away Dave's fumbling ones as he undid the buttons for him. The straining uniform jacket broke apart in a flash although it still somehow held both together. His hands resting on Dave's stomach, Puck's face took on a look of admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" he asked vaguely and Dave nodded. Puck grew even more excited as he started rubbing soothing circles on Dave's big and bloated belly. \"How does that feel?\" he asked. Dave opened his mouth to reply but another even more massive belch erupted. Chuckling, Puck continued rubbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said,\" Puck said grinning. \"I'm going to make you huge, you can count on it.\" Dave just sat there barely understanding in a food coma as Puck continued rubbing those wonderful motions that soothed his stuffed belly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several hours had passed since Dave had finished his huge meal and he was happily passed out on the couch, his shirt pulled up and exposing his fuzzy, soft belly.  Puck sighed as he sat down on the open cushion on the couch, watching Dave's belly rise and fall and he breathed.  It took every fiber of Puck's being to keep himself from burying his face into the soft, squishy object of his affection.  As Puck watches Dave's belly, Dave groaned a little before sitting up, rubbing his eye, \"Hey, there sleepy bear.\"  Puck said, a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey.\"  Dave mumbled, letting out a loud yawn before scratching his belly, \"Is there anything to eat?\"  He asked, his stomach grumbling softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THAT'S what I like to hear.  While you were asleep, \" Puck said as he made his way to the kitchen, \"I made you THIS.\"  Puck turned around and showed Dave the massive chocolate cake he had made, \"Chocolate chip chocolate cake with fudge icing and peanut butter filling!  It's a specialty of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave's eyes widened right away, licking his lips excitedly as Puck sat down next to him, cutting a gigantic slice from the cake, \"I think you forgot the plate...\"  Dave said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck laughed, \"I didn't get one.  You're a big bear, Dave, and you deserve to be fed like one.\"  Puck pushed Dave against the couch's back before pulling off his shirt, revealing Dave's strong chest, arms, and soft belly, \"So just sit back, relax, and let the Puckasaurus take care of everything.\"  Puck brought the huge slice of cake up to Dave's mouth and Dave happily took a bear-sized bite of it.  The amazing taste of multiple chocolates, fudge, and peanut was too much for Dave, who let out a groan of happiness before finishing the bite and moving on to the rest, devouring the cake in Puck's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck made sure Dave didn't miss a bite constantly picking crumbs off his body and feeding them to him.  Dave finished the first slice and Puck went back for seconds, which Dave happily devoured as well.  As Dave ate, and whenever he wasn't picking up crumbs or globs of chocolate, Puck was rubbing Dave's belly happily.</span></div></div>",

I must admit though, the thought of helping you get big is a major turn-on.\" <br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Dave was distracted by another piece of cake that Puck shoved into his mouth. \"Mmm, this really is gooff cake.\" Puck cocked his head confused. <br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n\"I said, 'this is really good cake.'\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" He continued to rub Dave's big belly with one hand as he readied the next thick messy slice. This was going to require a lot of handwashing and he was going to have to get a new shirt since the old one was covered in stains but he had been planning to get new clothes soon anyhow. Getting to feed Dave like this was worth the mess, especially when he got to rub and feed that nice gut and have his fingers licked clean. He could even feel it get bigger and more solid with each big slice of cake thrown Dave's way. Suddenly Dave stopped eating with a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't take anymore, it's too good. That peanut butter is really sticking to my mouth and that fudge and chocolate is so very very good but ugh....\" Puck stopped rubbing for a second thinking on how to solve this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back in a flash,\" he said as he exited to the kitchen. Dave only sat there for a few moments before Puck came back with that Puck grin on his face, carrying a bottle<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Dave asked curious and rubbing frantically at his distraught tummy now that Puck had left it alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk of course, what else does a growing bear need? Well besides fish which does give me an idea...but anyways, it is the best remover of stuck peanut butter and clearing out your dry throat from all that moist chocolatey fudgy peanut-buttery goodness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're making up words,\" Dave said and Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Words, shcmords, this is beside the point and you're distracting me. The faster you drink, the sooner I can return to rubbing your tum.\" <br>\r\n\"You'd like that wouldn't you?\" <br>\r\n\"Did you miss the part where I said I enjoy it? I'm not afraid to admit it. You enjoy it as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" <br>\r\n\"Oi, just stop talking, we can do that afterwards,\" Puck said as he opened the bottle and grabbed Dave's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up,\" and started pouring it down Dave's throat. Dave sputtered a little but soon got the rhythm down, enjoying the feel of the cold refreshing milk slide down and also getting rid of lingering peanut butter, fudge, and chocolate. He even felt better as the milk filled him and Puck started to rub one-handed again, the other keeping the milk stable. Soon the milk flow slowed and then stopped and Dave opened his eyes to see Puck peering in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more, milk's all gone. Think you could fit any more cake in that belly of yours Davie? There's just a few slices left.\" Dave rubbed his belly thoughtfully. He felt solid and full, probably more full than he's ever been before but the pain was gone at the moment and it would be a shame to waste that good cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess I could fit in a few more slices,\" Dave said uncertainly but Puck just smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on, let's go for it.\" Puck gently and almost what seemed lovingly if Dave thought that he wasn't slightly imagining things since Puck didn't really ever do things like that, held the slices out and let Dave take nibbles out of them and lick the chocolate off his fingers and hands. Dave did like the feel of Puck's strong manly hands and fine fingers when licking them, not like his thick clumsy paws. It was kind of too bad Puck probably wasn't gay but merely had a size and belly fetish because he was so nice and awesome and Dave wouldn't mind dating that attractive man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile licking fingers clean, Dave embarassingly whined a little when they pulled away and the magic hand on his belly disappeared as well. Opening his eyes he looked up at Puck who was still grinning that Dave was beginning to be a little freaked out since he couldn't ever remember Puck looking so happy, like a kid at christmas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked and Puck's mouth lifted up even more. <br>\r\n\"You finished it all,\" he said in wonder. <br>\r\n\"All of what?\" Dave asked confused. <br>\r\n\"The cake,\" Puck said. Dave was about to respond when a massive rumble went through him and he gave a massive burp. And then another and a few more. Puck just broke down in hysterics laughing. </span></div></div>",

Dave who had been taking a nap after that massive meal woke up wearily. <br>\r\n\"Huh? What'd you say?\" Dave asked, not quite sure if he had understood the question correctly.<br>\r\n\"Did I do good?\" Puck repeated concerned. Dave had understood but he was confused as to what Puck was referencing. <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Puck?\"<br>\r\n\"The meal. You enjoyed it...right? Wasn't too rough or cross a line?\"<br>\r\n\"Puckerman, I'm not sure what you're going on about but I most certainly did enjoy your food and if you don't believe that I will have to kick your ass. I LOVED it,\" Dave emphasized, grinning at the memory. \"Probably the best food I've ever eaten.\" Puck looked relieved at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good...sorry about that. I don't know what came over me. Just some self-doubt worried you might have hated it and only pretended to enjoy it or something, I don't even know. It's just...I've never told anyone I could cook before,\" Puck finished lamely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're missing out, you're phenomenal,\" Dave said and Puck smiled brightly again like he had earlier. Reaching out, Puck jiggled Dave's belly, fascinated.Dave stood there awkwardly. It was both flattering and a bit disturbing Puck's like of his big belly. Puck was the first one after Dave who not only merely tolerated his gut but actually thought it was pretty cool. Manly, sexy, substantial, not words people generally thought of when it came to fat. But those were secret desires of Dave that nobody and oftentimes not even himself was consciously aware of and Puck was the one who brought them into the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do now?\" Puck asked and Dave shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know really. Whatever is good with me.\" Puck glanced at Dave and Dave realized he was still shirtless when he caught Puck's grin and Dave made a move to cover himself. Puck reached out a hand to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. I got a certain idea in mind but it could be a bit messy so leave your shirt off. In fact...\" Puck took off his own shirt and Dave flushed catching the sight of Puck's perfect body. Although he learned to like himself more and actually was beginning to be okay with his size for the most part, Dave still couldn't help but being overawed, jealous, and desirous of such smooth, tanned, flat skin that he wanted...Puck gave a wink at him and Dave flushed again, hoping Puck didn't know what it was he was thinking. No wonder everyone wanted Puck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this idea of yours?\" Dave asked curiously. Puck grinned as seemingly out of nowhere a deck of cards appeared in his hands and he was shuffling through it really fast. Dave looked around startled, wondering where on earth those cards had come from while Puck just kept grinning as he shuffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" Dave started before deciding he didn't want to know.<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you thinking?\" <br>\r\n\"A game I made up just now,\" Puck said, still smiling as he shuffled. \"Just a couple normal rounds of poker of course but the difference is in what the prize is. Instead of for money, the stakes are going to be cheesecake slices.\" Dave raised his eyebrows and Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a bit bored. Anyhow, the winner of each round feeds the loser a slice until the whole cheesecake is gone. Get it?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, makes sense although I do think you're at a slight disadvantage,\" Dave said. Puck shrugged. \"A bit but we shall see. Ready?\"<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" Dave said as he and Puck both sat down at the table and Puck started dealing the first hand. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Dave picked up his cards, his mouth began to water at the thought of Puck feeding him cheesecake.  Dave has an insanely huge love for cheesecake that he doesn't even bother trying to hide.  As a chubby little kid, Dave would go down to one of the local bakeries and he would spend his allowance on an entire cheesecake, which he would sneak into his bedroom and eat while watching cartoons or power ranger re-runs.  You could literally ask Dave to do ANYTHING for a cheesecake (he's even considered having sex with someone if it meant getting the delicious cake) and here Puck was, ready to shovel it into his throat.  All Dave had to do was make sure that he lost as many rounds as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next three hours Dave tried his best to lose every round of poker they played, but on some rounds Puck just didn't have good hands.  The two of them played a total of 30 rounds: one round for each slice of cheesecake that was in Dave's fridge.  In the end, Puck won 25 and Dave had won the other 5.  A big grin spread across Puck's face, \"Look like you're eating 25 slices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\"  Dave said, trying his best to sound upset, \"I was hoping to win.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad, big guy.  Think of it this way; all of those delicious slices of cake are gonna help make you big and fat!\" Puck said, excited.  He got up and went to the fridge, pulling out the first cheesecake.  He sat it down in front of Dave and sat next to him, picking up the first slice and holding it up to Dave's mouth, \"Ope-\"  Before Puck could even finish, Dave had devoured half of the slice of cake, chewing happily.  Seeing how excited Dave was to be eating this cheesecake, Puck quickly started stuffing each and every slice into Dave's mouth.  Puck got up briefly to go get the other two cakes from the fridge, sitting back down and resuming watching Dave nearly inhale the cake he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually all 25 slices of cake were happily sitting in Dave's big, solid belly, which was being rubbed by Puck's large hand, \"Excellent work, dude!  I never knew you were such a beast for cheesecake.\"<br>\r\nDave burped loudly before grinning, \"Yeah... it's my favorite thing in the world to eat.  You could literally get me to anything for it.\"<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"  Dave said, patting the side of his big belly.<br>\r\n\"Okay...  I know that I'm supposed to eat these, but... if I give you the last five slices of cheesecake, can I sleep with you?\"<br>\r\n\"wh-WHAT?\"  Dave asked, his face turning bright red at the thought.<br>\r\n\"Not like that, you big goof ball.  I mean sleep in the same bed as you.  Tomorrow is Saturday, so I figured I could spend the night snuggled up against this big, sexy belly of yours.\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled nervously, \"Uhh..  yeah.  If it means I can eat those last sli-.\" Dave was caught off guard when Puck shoved a slice of cheesecake into his mouth, and in under a minute, the last five slices joined the rest in Dave's big, fuzzy belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Puck was done, Dave let out a massive yawn. \"Oof, man I'm tired. Those long games of poker and eating cheesecake wore me out.\" Struggling to get up, Dave felt Puck help him, one hand on his back and one under his belly as he pulled and Dave pushed up. Dave swayed on his feet a moment, his absolutely stuffed belly groaning in protest and sticking out farther than anything even he was used to. At the moment, he was so stuffed the sight of his gut was blocking the sight of his feet and his pants were strained on his massive thighs. All in all, if not for Puck, he couldn't have made it off the couch or walk to the bedroom where he sagged down onto the bed. Puck had a self-satisfied smirk on his face for some reason as he watched him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feeling Dave?\" Puck asked, the snarky grin stretching.<br>\r\n\"Stuffed. Absolutely mercilessly stuffed.\" Dave was too tired for anything but the truth. \"Can you help me with my pants? They're beginning to hurt and I can't reach the clasp.\" Puck really smiled at that as he trailed his fingers down Dave's stomach, poking and prodding a bit as he searched causing Dave to hiss. Eventually Puck found it, managed to undue it and with a bit of struggle on both their ends managed to get the jeans off leaving Dave in just his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that wasn't so hard,\" Puck said breathing heavily. \"Just a little stuck.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Dave mumbled. \"Least we didn't have to cut it off like you suggested.\" He remembered the hungry look in Puck's eyes when Puck suggested it and wondered. <br>\r\n\"Least it's off now,\" Puck said staring. Dave leaned back his stomach arching and patted the space beside him. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you could sleep here...\" Dave said and trailed off because the moment he said that Puck jumped in right beside him. \"Wow, that was fast.\" <br>\r\n\"Lay down,\" Puck demand-requested as he moved his fingers over Dave's stomach again. Now that he was no longer hindered by his pants, it felt so much better. Yawning again he closed his eyes and relaxed to the feeling of Puck's calloused but gentle hands rubbed at his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck was enjoying himself as he rubbed Dave who had fallen asleep quickly. After the stuffings Dave had underwent it was no surprise at all that Dave was conked out. Dave had really eaten a lot. Puck suspected Dave threw some, if not all the games but he let it slide since he was more than happy to let Dave eat the cheesecake. Dave really was a beast and that excited Puck. He had always had inklings and desires to see people get bigger (among other things) but it took a while to realize what it was that he  anticipated. Although dating Lauren Zizes was a mistake (who knew a girl that big would be such a bitch on almost the level of Quinn? At least he knew to expect Quinn to be one) he did learn a few valuable things. One was that although he did like girls he preferred the size and solidity of men who also made more sense and no wonder he liked Zizes since she was more man than anyone else even if she didn't have the equipment. At least, he hoped not though he wouldn't have been surprised if she did. The second was...he liked big people. No wonder he always fantasized and wondered about what if Finn put on a few extra pounds or Sam. Even Mike on occasion though that didn't fit as well into his image as Finn or Sam. Trouty mouth would look good stuffing those full lips full of food and he'd seen Finn eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dave...Dave was phenomenal. He'd have felt guilty if Dave had still been tormenting Kurt but since he wasn't and Dave was great, Puck really really was enjoying this. Dave played along so well and even encouraged it. He'd already been heavy but after the stuffings Puck put Dave through, Dave's belly was already straining. Getting off those pants had been a chore but admirable and a testament to what Dave had consumed. Puck seriously couldn't wait for the next day and what he could get Dave to eat then. Squeezing and rubbing his fingers, Puck felt Dave's massive stomach and smiled. It was solid and round, perfectly stuffed. Dave sure was one sexy furry bear. Suddenly, Puck yawned. He was pretty tired himself after those hours long poker matches, cooking and feeding, and then getting those blasted pants off Dave, he felt like he could sleep in for a real long while. Putting his head down on Dave's stomach, he sighed at the feeling. It was so big and comfy like a pillow. Closing his eyes, Puck planned what he was going to do for the next day's breakfast, drifting off into a restful sleep as he did so. </span></div></div>",

Kurt's eyes were darker than before, \"I have to go\" he said hurriedly as he brushed past Blaine, and walked down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine didn't see Kurt for the rest of the day and as he was walking out of the school he was grabbed from behind and pulled into a janitors closet. Before he could get out his protest, a pair of lips were on his, heatedly kissing him, Blaine realized from the smell of Lavender that it was Kurt, he quickly responded and wrapped his arms around him. Kurt did not keep his hands to himself though. He ran them all up and down Blaines body and under his cardigan feeling his newly acquired flesh and grabbed his wider ass and thighs.

He crossed his legs and watched as disturbing words were thrown back and forth. Suddenly, Blaine felt a familiar buzz in his left back pocket. He rushed to grab his phone, fiddling around in his seat. For the past two weeks, Blaine had gained some pounds. After the incident with Kurt in the janitor's closet, Blaine started an interesting new diet. He could finally just relax and gorge in food. Sometimes he would have a massive eating frenzy. Blaine would watch his favorite TV shows and eat almost everything in his cabinets! All this new weight was hard for Blaine to get used to though. He was always in need of new clothes because his old ones just seemed to get too tight. There was a definite struggle when attempting to get his phone out. His pants felt a lot tighter that day, but he just didn't have the time to get new ones. Eventually, with a mighty tug, Blaine was able to get his phone out of his pocket. Of course, with all the force when pulling, the phone went flying. Blaine stood quickly and ran to his phone. He bent down as the room fell silent. Blaine could feel pressure on his knees as he squatted down for his phone. Without much thinking, he realized it was his stomach. When Blaine stood up and turned around to the crowd of his classmates, he saw they were all staring dead at his stomach. He felt so embarrassed! Blaine avoided making eye contact with anyone when taking his long journey back up to his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow Mr. Pretty Boy, what sort of show was that? \" Santana crossed her arms and smirked as she looked Blaine up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine struggled to find his words and stared at the back end of the chair in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel glared at Santana's rude comment. \" Gosh Santana! Why do you have to be so mean to him?! We've all thrown our phones once or twice! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantana laughed, \" Oh shut it, Hobbit. We all know that's not what he was trying to perform for us. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Schue did his best to calm the two sassy ladies down. \" Girls! Girls! Forget what just happened. We need a song to perform! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't even try to shush me Mr. Schue! \" Santana pulled her middle finger out and continued to argue with Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine looked around the room. Luckily everyone's focus was back on the song choice for this week. Blaine opened his phone and saw the culprit of all the buzzing. He had a text message from Kurt and a few missed calls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blaine ;) So.. I was thinking... Maybe we could spend lunch together? I can't wait to see you after not being at school...Anyways! Got any good ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine smiled and began texting right away, \"Well...u haven't missed much today :( just arguing. Can't remember the name but there's this great brger place somewhere near the school. if u know what im tlking bout thenn... see u there cutie! ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge smile appeared on Blaine's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a hot date or something?\" Tina giggled and elbowed Blaine in the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Blaine smirked and they continued to watch the argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bell rang. Blaine shook his head, a bit shocked by the noise. He grabbed his things and got up. Of course, waiting at the door was Santana, the devil herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want Santana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantana gave an evil smirk. \"W-W-Well.\" She began mocking Blaine, \"I think everyone saw your little performance. So what's with you? Are you like depressed or something? I mean come on Blaine, everyone knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine wasn't used to people asking about his weight, \"I-I-I don't know what you're talking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shush it walrus, you're telling me tomorrow if you like it or not.\" She rolled her eyes and stomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine sighed and walked out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaine was walking in the parking lot, he attempted to cover his stomach with his bag. Paranoid, he would look around, making sure no one was looking at him. He saw Kurt in the distant and smiled with glee. He ran to the best of his abilities. (A recent struggle Blaine had discovered.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there bubble butt.\" Kurt blushed and began driving to the restaurant. <br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the restaurant, Kurt locked the doors. He stared at Blaine and had a serious look on his face. \" Blaine. Honey, I want you to be okay with this. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine turned and made an awkward amount of eye contact with Kurt. \" I love you so much, and I'd hate for you to be uncomfortable with yourself. I'd just kill myself if you started to dislike your own body! Oh god... I haven't even asked if you're com- \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine cut Kurt off, \"Kurt. I'm fine.\" He smiled, \"I love you just as much and if you really want this, I'd love to do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt pecked Blaine's cheek and unlocked the door. They walked inside, holding hands of course, and grabbed a table in the corner.<br>\r\nBoth just ordering water, they knew they had to choose an interesting meal. \"Cheeseburger?\" Blaine looked up at Kurt after a hard stare at his menu, <br>\r\n\"We can do better than that!\" Kurt responded and began to hunt for a larger meal. \"Ah Ha!\" Kurt threw down the menu and pointed at an item. \"Triple Trouble. Basically a cheeseburger but, basically better.\" Kurt sat confidently knowing he found something that would grab Blaine's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL TAKE IT!\" Blaine shouted in between giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress walked up to the table. \"What would you boys like to eat today..\" She said with a dead look in her eyes. \"We have a new item on our list,\" Her monotone voice was hard to understand, \"It's called the Triple Trouble, and it's like really big.\" The waitress continued to talk about it. \"It's like really really big. Oh my god, I can't even imagine how many calories it has.\" Blaine fiddled with his fingers. He was just too embarrassed to order, especially after her explanation of his order. Blaine looked up at Kurt. Blaine begged with his eyes, \" oh please order for me \" he mouthed to Kurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaine was starting to get a weird vibe around Kurt. Recently it felt like there relationship was going a little...he didn't know, stiff or something. Kurt was his first boyfriend and he didn't have anything to compare too but he was beginning to get the impression that he and Kurt were drifting into that dreaded area known as the 'friend's zone' and he had no idea why. He was spending a lot of time with Rachel and had it not been for Kurt's rant about bisexuals and how it was just an excuse to get sex with everyone or something, he would have thought that Kurt was cheating on him with Rachel. Then again, Kurt might be, just not in the boyfriend way. They no longer had as much time together and when they did, Kurt seemed convinced that Blaine should always compliment him on everything, and complained when he didn't. He also complained when he did and Blaine was having trouble thinking of stuff to talk about that didn't have anything to do with show choir. So Blaine decided to ask the one person who knew more about relationships than anyone he knew. He went to Puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Puck,\" Blaine said and Puck looked up startled. <br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Blaine, what do you, um want?\" Puck looked confused and Blaine didn't blame him. Outside of Glee club, Blaine didn't really associate with him. Actually, most people didn't which now that it was in his mind, was actually kind of sad. Blaine resolved to spend more time with the other members of Glee and not just Kurt but for now he had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a question and I was curious, but...is Kurt still into me?\" Puck looked a bit confused. <br>\r\n\"Kurt? Are you guys having issues or something? As far as I can tell, he is still into you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, because it might just be me but Kurt and I don't talk as much as we used to and he's always spending his time with Rachel and other people now. I just thought he might be losing interest or something.\" Puck looked Blaine over with a critical eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be right about that. Has anyone told you you are a bit...bland?\" Blaine was confused. <br>\r\n\"Bland? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Kurt is a girl-guy and therefore deep down has secret sexual fantasies with tall buff muscle dudes with or without long flowing hair. I'm sure you've had them.\" Blaine blinked. <br>\r\n\"Um, no, not really. But that never really was my type.\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Your type is the young slender effeminate type, ie. Kurt. That's cool. But if you're right about Kurt becoming distant, he's probably finding himself no longer into you because you aren't a big macho male.\" <br>\r\n\"But why would Kurt want that? He hates that,\" Blaine said really confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the mysteries of the feminine mind is that they usually mean the opposite of what they say. When they say they're fine, it's usually that they're extremely pissed and will lash out the moment you do anything they view wrong. And Kurt is a female with a dick which is twice the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what exactly are you saying?\" <br>\r\n\"Dude, you're puny and Kurt either subcomsciously or consciously realizes he needs a real man for complete satisfaction.\" <br>\r\n\"You don't exactly hold back when dissing on someone do you?\" Blaine muttered. <br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" <br>\r\n\"So um...what do I need to do?\" Puck shrugged.<br>\r\n\"You've got the personality, but you need the body to go along with it to win Kurt.\"<br>\r\n\"So...I need to get buff?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. Kurt seems to like guys with a bit of a gut as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"He used to have a crush on Finn.\" Blaine thought about it.<br>\r\n\"That's weird, they're step-brothers.\" Puck shrugged.<br>\r\n\"It was freshman year and it was before Burt married Carole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, so you're saying I need to get buff...and a gut? Are you sure?\" Puck shrugged. \"He didn't want a ride on the Puckerone and a little twink like him surely should have at least some sexual interest and he was interested in Finn. Ergo, Kurt is kinky and secretly digs big manly men with a belly like Dave Karofsky. The pieces all fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally crude and unnecessary with detail but you actually make sense and it would explain why Kurt is starting to no longer be attracted to me. Thanks for the advice,\"<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" Puck said. Puck got up and started to leave before Blaine thought of something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, this is awkward but uh, perhaps you can help me? Become a man and all I mean.\" </span></div></div>",

Meet me at my place after school and we'll get started!\"  Puck announced as he headed down the hall to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine put his hand on his flat stomach, trying to imagine himself with a bigger body.  It was hard to think of but if he wanted Kurt interested in him again he needed to get big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine, not being able to drive, took the bus to Puck's house after school.  The bus dropped him off a block from Puck's home, so Blaine had to walk the rest of the way.  When he arrived at Puck's, he knocked on the door but there was no answer.  Blaine tried a few more times before he heard the sound of a truck roll into the driveway.  Blaine turned around and saw Puck getting out, two large grocery bags in hand, \"Oh, there you are!  I was wondering where you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Blaine.  I had to make a food run so we could stuff that soon-to-be-gut of yours.\"  Puck shoved a bag into Blaine's hands as he fished his keys from his pocket, \"That bag is full of snacks for you so start eating while I cook!\"  Puck said as he hurried inside to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine closed the door behind him and looked inside of the bag, seeing it was filled with cupcakes and cookies.  Blaine, who did his best to hide his sweet tooth, didn't think twice as tore open the box of frosted cakes and started chowing down as Puck began dinner.</span></div></div>",

By the way dinner is ready.\" Puck nodded towards a chair. \"You're going to really like this, I promise,\" Puck said as he sat down at the head of a table. Blaine took one look at the dish laid out and raised his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not to be rude or anything but...what exactly are those?\" Blaine asked, pointing at the plates where strange objects lay. <br>\r\n\"Spaghetti tacos, really good stuff,\" Puck said proudly. Blaine shook his head confused. <br>\r\n\"But what exactly is a spaghetti taco?\" Puck sighed.<br>\r\n\"Exactly what it sounds like, spaghetti in taco shells, me, Finn, and Dave love them. I have no doubt you will as well.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, why would you put spaghetti in a taco? That doesn't make sense.\" <br>\r\n\"Does it matter? Trust me, it will be fine, and I almost guarantee you love it so just put aside the skepticism for a little bit okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, if you say so,\" Blaine murmured and Puck nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now please...\" He gestured to the messy looking creation. Blaine picked it up carefully, only dropping a few noodles as he took a bite out of it. It tasted like spaghetti, clam sauce, meatsauce, salsa, and other things Blaine wasn't sure. Surprisingly it really was quite good although Blaine still did not understand the point of putting it in a taco shell since it was quite messy and spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good,\" Blaine said as he took another bite. Puck smirked as he took a bite of his own taco. <br>\r\n\"What did I tell you. Besides you don't have to eat it so slow, its spaghetti, really. Just finish off whatever falls afterwards with a fork, or your hands, whichever you prefer.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not a total animal thank you, I'll use the fork.\" Puck made a shrugging gesture, spilling some as he was taking a huge bite out of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate in silence a little longer as Puck doled out more tacos as they finished the ones they were eating. Blaine was amused that Puck had eaten two more tacos than he had already 4 to 2 but Puck was really into them. It was a good thing he switched to a shirt he didn't care about getting dirty because it was getting messy from sauce and noodle drippings. Blaine on the other hand ate slowly trying to spill as little as possible. He was going to do this but he didn't plan to become a slob along the way since one of the things Kurt hated most (after bullies and bad fashion) was careless and sloppy behavior. Not to mention, he was getting full. Puck who was beginning to slow down himself on his 5th taco looked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anderson, why did you stop already? You only had two tacos, don't you like them?\"<br>\r\n\"I do, but I'm kind of full and I had all those twinkies sweets before.\" Taking the last few bites, Puck finished his taco and with a bit of struggle got up. Blaine was a bit surprised to see the extent to which Puck's belly was distented out, especially since it was normally flat. Giving his belly a thwack, Puck let out a very long belch before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-UUUUUUUUUURRRRPPP, that is good if I do say so.\" Moving over and reaching out to touch Blaine's belly before he even knew what was happening, Blaine just sat there as Puck rubbed it examingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're not that full yet, you definitely can have at least one more.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't think I can.\" Blaine said. Puck rolled his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you can. I'll even help you.\" Blaine made noises of protest which Puck ignored as he quickly shoved falling spaghetti taco into his mouth forcing Blaine to bite down. When Blaine's mouth was free and he opened his mouth to complain, Puck did it again. After a few cycles of this, Blaine tried to keep his mouth shut but Puck pinched his nose until he was forced to open his mouth, keeping him trapped beneath his other heavy arm. Resigned, Blaine no longer shut his mouth and opened obediently as Puck fed him bite by bite. After what felt like forever, Blaine was surprised to find no more taco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it,\" Puck said grinning. Blaine was by this point exhausted and he weakly growled before giving out a pretty big burp of his own.<br>\r\n\"*uck you\" Blaine muttered and Puck shrugged as he reached out. <br>\r\n\"I'll help with that.\"</span></div></div>",

However, something abnormal was happening to Blaine today; he was being stared at.  Not the normal stares he gets from the very dapper way he dresses, but for what was beginning to show underneath his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last month Blaine had been purposefully getting fatter in order to impress Kurt, who he was certain was bored of him, and Puck has been helping him.  As Blaine walked down the hall, he could feels eyes zeroing in on his bigger body beneath his super tight clothing: He had yet to start putting weight on in his face, but Blaine had begun developing small moobs and a very round, obvious belly that made his button up shirt look tight.  He had small love handles and his thighs had thickened out, but it was his butt where his gain was the most obvious.  His jeans were skin tight and his butt had a little jiggle in it when he walked.  He finally reached his locker and was getting books out when he felt a hard smack on his much larger ass, \"AAH!\"  Blaine turned around and saw Puck, who has a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Noah.  Could you not do that?\"  Blaine asked.<br>\r\nPuck shrugged, \"You know the rules, Anderson.  If you want me to help get you get big and fat, I get to play and grope whatever I want.  You agreed to it.\"<br>\r\nBlaine groaned, \"Yeah, fat and <i>muscular.</i>  All you've done is had me put weight on.  When am I gonna start hitting the gym?\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Soon, buddy.  No worries.  In the mean time, here.\"  Puck handed Blaine a box of cupcakes from a local bakery, \"I brought you lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine sighed, \"Thanks.\"  He grabbed the last book he needed, took the cupcakes, and followed Puck to the cafeteria for lunch.</span></div></div>",

As the entered the kitchen Blaine and puck headed over to the freezer where they kept the deserts. Inside was what Blaine could only describe as heaven tones of cookies, cakes, oreo's, and ice cream!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blaine heard a growling as he woke up that morning, as he looked down at his belly which was blocking the view of his feet he realized that last week since his cafeteria gorge with Puck his belly and its seemingly never ending hunger is what woke him up in the morning. He slowly rose from bed, he'd been practically eating non stop the past week and it was beginning to become obvious. His belly was now gigantic! It was a perfectly fat ball gut that his moobs rested on, and his love handles flowed from. He now only slept in shorts that belonged to his older brother and even they were having trouble containing his monster belly. He patted it and watched it jiggle lightly with each pat then angrily give another grown demanding to be filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Blaine chuckled \"Lets eat! But first lets weigh in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine slowly carried his fat ball belly to his bathroom watching as it jiggled and wobbled with every step he took, he heard his scale creak as he stepped on it and leaning forward slightly to look over his fat gut watched as the dial clicked up fast before stopping right before 200. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"197!\" Blaine exclaimed \"That's another 20 pounds!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine grabbed his love handles and shook his gargantua gut and let it shake and wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're pushing 200!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Blaine looked at the clock, it was noon! he slept in and Kurt would be here soon! He ran back into his bedroom to get dressed his gut growling as it realized it would not be fed now. Blaine had become really fat, however he'd yet to buy new clothes. So as he grabbed a pair of skinny jeans and a button up shirt he realized how much he needed to go shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just get this over with\" He mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the jeans over his ankles and they stopped instantly at his butt. He laid down on his pulled and pulled with all his might as his belly resisted and jiggled as he stuffed his now huge 197 pound body into his 145 pound clothes. He could barley breath once he got them up. They were no where near ready to button, that was later. Then he slipped on his shirt and was ready for the real task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtoning his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine down and looked as his belly pooched out his jean button was four inches away from the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets do this.\" He said with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine took one might breath and sucked in every part of his body with all his might. After a bit of struggling he managed  to button all of his buttons. They looked like they were ready to burst and he knew the moment he let his breath out he was toast. Then a thought occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe that's just the way I'll introduce my new girth to Kurt.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doorbell rang. Blaine mad his way slowly to the door, right before he opened it he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing....hope Kurt likes the new me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door, and Kurt turned around and his face was unreadable at the sight of his new immense boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blaine let it all go. He breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly and ass filled every space available in his tight clothing at once, and it couldn't hold the strain. Kurt looked on as the seam on the side of Blaine's shirt ripped. He looked on as Blaine's jean and shirt buttons exploded off of him bouncing off the walls. He looked on as Blaine's fat gut spilled out pf his shirt and bounce and jiggled around happy to be free. He looked at Blaine's plump love handles hung off his sides and as his fat belly round and full of stretch marks with a deep belly button slowly came to a rest hanging deep over his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Blaine's belly let out an immense growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine looked on scared what Kurt would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurt reached forward and smiled and started to rub Blaine's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're hungry\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine smiled and said \"Yea I am!\"</span></div></div>",

Kurt loved the feeling of them and couldn't believe how much weight Blaine managed to put on in such a short time. After guiding him to a chair Kurt sat Blaine down watching as his belly bounced and wobbled before resting in his lap. In his lap it looked so much bigger, spread out and heavy. Kurt just couldn't wait to make it even fatter and heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blaine's belly gave out another huge rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you really are hungry!\" Kurt said as he patted Blaine's belly watching it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I am! Its use to being fed big these days!\" giving it a few pats himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets not let it wait any longer!\" Kurt smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt walked to the fridge and dug through for a while before emerging with a tub of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! You start on this while I cook up some breakfast!\" Kurt said, \"A tub for my big tubby guy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine started to dig into the ice cream as he watched Kurt begin to make breakfast, with a smile on his face, he was so happy that Kurt was happy. He looked down at his giant belly thinking of the time when he barley had one. He was so thankful to Puck that he was able to help him make turn himself into a big fat flabby guy that Kurt loved. Blaine leaned back in his chair and realized that when he did that he couldn't even see his feet! His rounded soft belly with its deep belly button blocked it from view. Pushing 200 Blaine was proud of his gut which had managed to pulverize and outfit, so he couldn't wait to fell up on breakfast so Kurt could do some exploring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blaine knew it, Kurt was down and he had out done himself. Stacks of pancakes and waffles, accompanied eggs of every style and a giant plate of sausage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up!\" Kurt said as he gave Blaine's belly a smack and watched it jiggle. \"After breakfast I want us to go show the world my new plump boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine picked up his fork as his belly gave another roar, one that seemed to shake the windows, and said..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'll be my pleasure!\"</span></div></div>",

He had broken up a would-be fight between Jake Puckerman, who was sitting in the choir room, and a member of the WWHS football team after school.  Will was standing at the white board, his arms crossed and a scowl on his face, \"Jake, you NEED to learn some restraint!\"<br>\r\nJake rolled his eyes, \"Are you kidding me?  That guy was totally asking for it!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\"  Will said, \"Violence is NEVER the answer!\"<br>\r\n\"And what are you gonna do, keep me here until Puck gets here so we can have another pep-talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to.\"  A voice said from the door.  Both Will and Jake looked to see Noah Puckerman standing there, his arms crossed over his chest, but something was different about him.  He seemed bigger.  Jake noticed that Puck's neck looked thicker, his shoulders bigger and broader, and his biceps were straining the sleeves of his t-shirt.  But what really surprised Jake was the small belly that Puck had developed.  It curved out nicely from under Puck's much bigger pecs and his shirt clung tightly to it.<br>\r\n\"Puck, is that you?  What happened?  You're huge!\"<br>\r\nPuck smirked as he walked in, \"Yeah, I know.\"<br>\r\nWill chimed in, \"I called Puck yesterday after I saw you almost punch the guy you actually DID punch today.\"<br>\r\n\"And?\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"And, I'm here to help you get control of your anger.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"And how are you planning on doing that?\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy.\"  Puck said, reaching down and pulling of his t-shirt, revealing his muscular body and round, tight belly.  He gave his belly a few hard pats, \"With this!\"<br>\r\n\"... What?\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"I hired Puck to help you get over your anger issues and he said the best way to do it was to fatten you up.\"  Will said.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"  Jake yelled, confused.<br>\r\n\"Dude, relax!  It won't be ALL fat.  You'll get huge muscles too, like your big bro!\"  Puck flexed one huge arm.<br>\r\n\"No!  I am NOT getting fat!\"  Jake said, angry.<br>\r\n\"Jake,\"  Will said, \"Either you go with your older brother and fatten up or you're out of the Glee club.\"  Will said, a serious look in his eyes.<br>\r\nJake glared at his teacher for a minute, sighed, and looked down, \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Awesome!\"<br>\r\nWill smiled, \"Good.  Now.  I already talked to your mom about it.  You'll be moving in with Puck and his boyfriend until you learn to control your anger.  She moved all your things in today during school and I'll be paying for all of your expenses.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll channel all of your anger into eating and lifting!  As long as you do that, you won't get angry.  Let's get going, little bro!\"  Puck said.<br>\r\nJake grabbed his bag and followed Puck to his truck, heading off to his older brother's house.</span></div></div>",

Puck sat in the front seat and lifted the mirror to look back. <br>\r\n\"No doubt probably. What'd he do?\" <br>\r\n\"Insulted the glee club...and my mom.\" Puck winced as Jake shifted, looking away.<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you bro. I would have hit someone as well if they go that far.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what's this about fixing my attitude?\" Jake yellled.<br>\r\n\"Because you're angry and unstable and lash out uncontrollably with a bad attitude and you're dying inside...\" Puck murmured. \"I know what's it's like to drown on the indside. But people helped me and I'm going to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still sounds like a bizarre method of doing so,\" Jake said. \"And I don't need any help, I'm just fine.\"<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why you do need help Jake. It's not fine and I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did. Also, I was lucky. It could have been a lot worse had it not been for the help of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to give a sermon about the power of friendship. Please don't.\"<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Puck said laughing. \"I wasn't going too. Even though everything that could be said for friendship is true, that would not particularly help you since you'd ignore and really, I'd ingore it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you see that. You haven't become a total pansy.\"<br>\r\n\"True, although I'm not the one who is a pansy,\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"Why you-!\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not insulting you.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure sounds like it,\" Jake said pissed.<br>\r\n\"No, it's just a personal growth thing and I'm going to help you with that.\" Puck said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's weird. I'm a bit confused on what you were selling to Mr. Schuester.\"<br>\r\n\"That training your mind and body can help you focus and relax and maintain control so you don't lash out inappropiately.\"<br>\r\n\"I do not lash out inappropiately.\"<br>\r\n\"Short fuse, although in your favor you're already starting off better than me,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Really?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, at least you generally have reason enough to hit people who marginally deserve it. Freshmen year...I admit it, I was a bully and went after some for no other reason that it sickened me to look at them, that they thought they were so superior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did deserve it then,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"No, I thought they thought they were superior. And they did, but they had issues of their own besides me and taught me stuff I did not know about myself. I hated who I was and was trying to erase it by becoming somebody different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really admired you growing up, but then you went to juvie, especially over something that stupid. How could you do that?\" Jake asked because he always had wondered. <br>\r\n\"I was drunk, high, sick of life, desperate, trying to buy my baby girl back...honestly, I don't even know. I can hardly remember myself now. Because really, it was just stupid. <br>\r\n\"How does this at all relate to what we're doing now?\" Jake asked now really confused.<br>\r\n\"It's a technique I found afterwards to be successful since you channel all the negative energy and sorrows into something else. And I know you and I love being big guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've gotten...big,\" Jake said sarcastically although Puck smirked when he sensed the slightest bit of admiration. <br>\r\n\"It's awesome. At first it was unintentional but then I found I liked it and I know you will too.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, because I want to be a fat bastard.\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it really does help. Changing the topic quickly, we've almost arrived at my boyfriend's house who we're going to meet.\"<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend? Since when did you have a boyfriend or play for that team?\"<br>\r\n\"Since the end of senior year and I've always been interested in both. Puckasaurus believes in equal opportunities. It's just that you know in this town it's not exactly encouraged and makes it hard to find anybody who would be brave enough to admit to it. I've taken a break from girls since they're all crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Beth?\" Jake asked and winced as a look of extreme pain crossed Puck's face. \"Beth...Shelby took her away for a bit and she hasn't let me see her. Dave, working out, and feeding are the only things that have been keeping me sane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeding?\" Jake asked confused.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Puck snapped out of it. <br>\r\n\"You said feeding.\" Jake said pushing.<br>\r\n\"Oh...its a....thing...where you know...you feed people...and stuff.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Jake said even more confused.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you will,\" Puck muttered. \"Well, here we are.\" <br>\r\n\"By the way, who is Dave again?\" Jake said, looking around, astonished by the size of the house they were out front of. <br>\r\n\"My non-literal bro, boyfriend, huggle bear, puppy...\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you just said huggle bear.\" Jake made a gagging motion.<br>\r\n\"Well, he is,\" Puck said laughing.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, fucking rich should be added,\" Jake muttered looking at the house. \"This place is huge.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dave's dad is a very successful lawyer.\"<br>\r\n\"Must be, I know lawyers and most of them aren't nearly so well-off.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"How would you know,\" Puck asked threateningly.<br>\r\n\"Just a bit of vandalism and mischief. I got off easy though.\"<br>\r\n\"Feel like sharing?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Nah, not really,\" Jake replied. \"So are we going in or what?\" Puck started to go up to push the doorbell when the door slammed open and a big blur moved out tackling Puck to the ground. Jake watched in horror as some big guy ravaged his brother with kisses and just when he was about to open his mouth and scream for help, Puck pushed the guy off and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave, I missed you too. I brought someone here with me though.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh hi,\" Dave said standing up. \"I'm Dave, Dave Karofsky. And you are...\" he said trailing off. Jake's mouth had opened wide and all thought had fled his mind as he stood there staring. Puck had to snap his fingers in front of Jake's face a few times before Jake's attention was brought back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jake asked confused.<br>\r\n\"You were spacing out.\" Puck said. Jake looked again at the big guy in front of him. If he thought Puck was big, this guy dwarfed him. He was absolutely massive, the shirt stretched tightly across a wide expanse of stomach but very powerfully built with huge arms and chest that made it clear this wasn't a lazy slug by any means. He almost got caught getting lost again before there was a coughing noise and a grin came across the guy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Puck's brother Jake? Welcome! So rude of me, why don't you two come in?\" Puck steered Jake behind Dave into a massive living room. \"I was making some lunch and if you guys hadn't already eaten maybe you'd like some?\" Puck licked his lips and grined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that would be delightful. </span></div></div>",

I could eat your pie forever.\" Jake hoped that the oochie-coochie stuff would stop before he began barfing. What the hell happened to his brother, half-brother...whatever. The point was what the heck? Puck and Dave headed to the kitchen and Puck sat down as Dave brought over a big pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and sit down Jake, the more the merrier!\" Dave chortled. Jake almost took off there but before he could move his brother stopped him with a harsh look and made to get up.

Jake made a face back which caused Puck to burst out laughing and Dave joined in not wanting to be left out. When they stopped laughing he stopped and looked around at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was so funny?\" he asked. Jake and Puck looked at each other before bursting out into laughter again.

If you want to see real activity wait till me and Dave do...\"<br>\r\n\"Lalalalalala not listening!\" Jake shouted putting his fingers in his ears. Dave snorted. <br>\r\n\"Puck really? This is your brother? Then again it makes sense.\"<br>\r\n\"F-you Dave,\" Puck said angrily.<br>\r\n\"I'd love to later. But for now let's try to not traumatize our new guest,\" Dave said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh yeah. I said that first.\" Puck said looking justified which Dave rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, let's just get Jake back. Yo, Jake!\" Dave pulled Jake's arms out and Jake looked around.<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it never even started.\" Dave said thumping Jake on the back.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you freaked out like that,\" Puck said smirking. \"Have you ever even slept with a girl or guy?\" Jake's face burned.<br>\r\n\"Uh...er...that's not fair, you know the answer.\" Puck settled back looking smug. <br>\r\n\"That's why you got me to help you.\"<br>\r\n\"No it isn't.\"<br>\r\n\"Added benefit helping my baby brother.\"<br>\r\n\"You suck.\"<br>\r\n\"Ignoring you,\" Puck said cheekily. <br>\r\n\"I regret every fantasy I ever have of two Puck's, one is more than enough,\" Dave muttered and both Jake and Puck hit him on the shoulder and stomach. \"I rest my case,\" Dave wheezed a moment before getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lunch,\" Puck said as he sat back down. \"I'm starved.\" <br>\r\n\"You're worse than me,\" Dave said. Puck opened his mouth to argue before shutting it and shrugging.<br>\r\n\"That's true because you cook way better and can make stuff whenever you want it unlike me. I simply love your cooking,\" Puck said reaching out for Dave's hand. Dave let him grab it for a moment before pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty words. Anyways, what about our guest?\" Dave said looking at Jake. <br>\r\n\"What about him? He's eating the same thing we are.\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"He eats first.\" Dave said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Oh alright fair enough.\" Puck picked up a plate and filled it up with pasta. \"It's a good thing we he have extra.\"<br>\r\n\"You sound so thrilled,\" Jake said wryly. Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I'm hungry right now, otherwise I would enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n\"He'll get happy soon enough,\" Dave sad. \"He always does feeding.\"<br>\r\n\"Shush you,\" Puck said jokingly as he did begin to smile as he ladled up a spoonful and brought it up to Jake's mouth.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Jake asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Feeding you of course. It is so much easier when your mouth is open.\" <br>\r\n\"Man you're weird,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Open up!\" Puck yelled and Jake the slightest bit intimidated did so.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the first plate was gone, Jake watched happily as Dave filled it up again and Puck went right back to work feeding him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for about an hour, and after four more plates, Jake couldn't eat another bite, \"Ugh... no more...

Puck or Dave must have carried him in here and let him sleep on the couch.  Jake stood up and walked into the kitchen where he smelled someone cooking an amazing country dinner.  His stomach, despite how full it was, growled at the idea of such tasty food, \"Smells good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Dave said, smiling back at Jake as he walked in, \"How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n\"Amazing.  Where's Puck at?\"<br>\r\n\"He's down stairs in the basement, working out.  You should join him, lifting is part of this whole thing after all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After getting directions from Dave where to go, Jake went to the basement door down the hall and opened it. He followed the steps down to where some loud pumping music was playing and he immediately started humming along before he realized what was playing which was that gagnam style song which caused him to grin even wider as he wasn't aware that Puck even liked this song. Then again, it was about a certain kind of woman so it really wasn't. Entering the basement complex, Jake whistled. Like the rest of the house it was enormous and he wondered again just how much money Dave and/or his father had because this was...wow. Turning to the right where the sound was strongest, he saw a complete home workout gym with benches, bars, weights, and everything. Puck was working at the benchpress for the moment, caught in the moment as he listened to the music as he did reps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake watched as Puck did flawless rep after flawless rep, his massive chest flexing tightening and releasing as he moved the weighted bar up and down. After quick calculation, Jake was stunned to realize that Puck was doing 300 lbs as easy as a warm up set. He wondered what Puck's max was then as his was pushing about 200 max, 205 his best on a real good day and his brother was doing 300 about as easy as breathing. The sound of metal clanking back on the rack was heard and Puck opened his eyes and saw Jake standing there. Grinning, he got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little bro, I thought someone was watching but it could have been Dave which happens now and again. Did you like what you see?\" Jake nodded speechless for a moment and seeing that, Puck smirked then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool,\" Puck ran a towel down the bench. \"All yours or if you want to do another one, that's good too.\" He briefly reached into his pocket for a remote clicking a few times as the volume of the hidden speakers dropped. \"If that was bothering you, I like listening to music but if you don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its fine,\" Jake said, scanning the room again.<br>\r\n\"So where do you want to start?\" Puck asked. Jake thought a moment before shrugging. He wasn't in the mood for bench right now nor was he going to tell that he got slightly intimidated following Puck on it since he couldn't do nearly as much. Puck would eventually see sometime he hoped he would have improved a bit before then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe bicep curls,\" Jake said heading to the free weights, Puck behind him.<br>\r\n\"Hmm good choice, I'll be doing squats.\" He pulled out the remote and clicked the volume back up, bobbing his head in time as he strapped on the belt stabilizer and in the protective box as he stood under a really loaded bar that he took against his shoulders and began his workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing free weights, 20 lb dumbells that Jake was sure Puck and Dave lifted like nothing, he counted out reps mentally listening to the pounding drum music as he watched his brother Puck do such weight that he thought impossible except for world champion type people (and people with superstrength), not people like his brother. That wasn't a knock-off but yeah, his old old brother would never have been able to lift such a heavy bar. But now...now he did and Jake watched in amazement and admiration as his brother squatted up and down with over 500 lbs of heavy weight. The wider added booty of Puck's added more weight distribution as he went down so that the bar didn't push to the side and try to crush him as he went down and the massive back provided a nice resting spot. Jake felt kind of gay examining his brother so closely but it wasn't that so much as a kind of pride and admiration. His big brother was so strong and massive! He always wanted a brother, being a single kid got kind of lonely so he was glad when he discovered Puck a year and a half back. Puck was big then and continued growing and right now was this massive stud before him still striving to get bigger as he lifted such heavy weights. The amazing thing was he didn't feel angry or jealous about it (well, a little jealous to be sure but not overwhelmingly so). Puck was right that the rythm of music and movement of muscles created a relaxed atmosphere and he wished he had that all the time at school as well. If he got big like Puck, even just a fraction, the school's douchebags wouldn't touch him either, something else to look forward to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued working out until heavy footsteps announced the arrival of Dave who waited a moment for Puck to finish his deadlifts which he had moved to before coming over and kissing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my muscleman doing?\" Dave asked and Puck grinned as he flexed as Dave felt. Jake raised his eyebrows from over at the leg machines as he watched. He was going to really have to get used to the displays of affection because while he didn't mind, it was unnerving to see his brother act almost like a giggly girl with a crush but it was better than some of the others. Maybe he should find someone so he didn't have to keep from yakking when he saw Puck and Dave get friendly since Dave was patting Puck down in places...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hi!\" Jake said. \"What are you doing here Dave?\" Puck shot Jake a quick glare as he moved back and Dave blushed.<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's time for dinner so if you guys want anything...\" Puck was racing up the stairs the moment dinner was said.<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, let's eat!\" Dave shrugged and looked at Jake. <br>\r\n\"You coming?\" Dave asked looking at Jake. Jake's gut agreed because at that moment it rumbled, causing him to blush.<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, kind of hungry after exercise.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you are, now come.\" Dave said as he followed up the stairs. Jake followed behind them and when he got to the table groaned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake had thought that his lunch was big but CLEARLY he had never seen a full dinner cooked by Dave Karofsky.  The dinner table was covered in so much food that it looked like it was close to over flowing.  Two of the biggest fully cooked turkies, one of which Dave had deep friend, that Jake had ever seen were in the center of the table.  Surrounding the two massive birds were gigantic tubs of mashed potatoes and gravy, corn bread, several piles of chicken friend chicken, and candied yams covered in marshmellows.  Dave had somehow cooked an entire country thanksgiving meal in the time it took Dave and Jake to workout.  \"How did you...\"  Jake started, but decided to just not bother asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake noticed that there wasn't a single vegetable on the table with the exception of the yams, but those were covered in sugar, cinnamon, and marshmellows.  He was going to have to get used to this lifestyle.  Puck patted his baby bro's back, \"Don't look so scared, Jakey.  Here's the plan.  All three of us will sit down for a lovely meal and we'll eat.  You'll eat until you're full and then I'll come sit next to you and shovel more food into this growing baby gut you have.\"  Puck said, poking his little brother's already growing stomach, \"Then, once you've on the verge of exploding, you'll go to sleep for the night in your new bedroom and Davey here,\" Puck said, lifting his boyfriend's shirt and revealing his enourmas, doughy belly, \"Will eat whatever is left on the table.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just stood there, staring at the size and softness of Dave's belly, and how it hung over his waistband, and admittedly loved how it looked compared to the rock solid shape of his brother's belly.  He wanted to reach out and touch it, to feel his hands sink into the fleshy belly of Dave's 325 pound frame, and Puck noticed this and grinned, \"Maybe one day you'll have a belly as glorious and big as this, Jakey?  But for now, lets just try and get you huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them sat down and Dave made the first place for Jake.  He loaded it with heaping amounts of everything on the table and Jake watched in disbelief as the massive, overflowing plate was placed in front of him.  There was enough food on this plate for at LEAST 4 people.  Jake took a deep breath before sinking his teeth into a large chunk of friend turkey and the flavor exploded in his mouth,  Never in his life had Jake eaten turkey this good!  Before he knew it he was scarfing down massive forkfuls of the food, only ever stopping to chug the soda placed in front of him.  Puck and Dave didn't even bother keeping an eye on Jake, after all, Dave's cooking was so addicting that nobody could not eat it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, nobody talked.  The only thing any of them focused on was food, food, and more food.  Every now and then Puck would look up at his baby brother and see him stuffing his face, and when he did, Puck felt a wonderful sense of pride.  Another hour passed by and Jake finally pushed his plate away, dropped his knife, and leaned back in his chair.  Jake was beyond stuffed at this point and could barely move.  His light brown stomach stuck out in front of him and was packed so tightly with food that it was almost a perfect circle sticking out from his torso.  Over the course of two hours Jake had eaten a total of 18 plates of food, each just as massive as the last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck walked over to his little brother and patted his belly softly, \"Wow, you ARE a Puckerman!  I don't even have to feed you more now, you took care of the job for me!\" Jake was so full and tired he couldn't even respond.  The only thing he could do was belch loudly, which helped with the pressure in his belly a bit.  Puck looked at the table and was surprised at how little they had eaten; 75% of the food Dave had cooked was still there.  Puck looked at his massive boyfriend, \"You were holding back so he could stuff himself, huh?\"<br>\r\nDave chuckled, \"So were you.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was,\"  Puck confirmed, \"I'll be right back.\"  Puck helped Jake up and lead him upstairs to the spare bedroom that Jake's mom had moved all of his things into earlier that day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck helped his brother out of his clothes, until he was just in his boxers, and helped him into bed.  Puck rubbed Jake's swollen belly through the sheets until Jake passed out.  Puck smiled and set Jake's alarm for school the next day before heading downstairs to finish the massive meal Dave had made.  Puck ate a quarter of what was left of the food, leaving the last half of the table to go into his boyfriend's massive belly.  Puck lifted his heavy body up from the table and started preparing the breakfast shakes for Jake tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed and Jake slowly opened his eyes.  He couldn't see, because all the light were off, but he could feel that his stomach was emptier than before.  He reached under the sheets and felt his belly, which had decreased greatly in size but was still fairly hard and full.  He rolled onto his side and was about to go back to sleep when his stomach let out a large growl, which surprised Jake.  He had enough food to feed a small family in his belly but he was still hungry?  He planned on ignoring it but then he smelled somebody baking apple pies down in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it...\"  he muttered to himself and got up, found the door, and headed downstairs, his still stuffed belly sticking out in front of him.  Jake followed the sound of a deep voice singing until he got to the kitchen.  He turned the corner and saw Dave, standing in only his boxers, baking several apple pies in the over.  He was at counter, cutting up more apples for the pie, and didn't even notice Jake.  Jake's eyes were instantly drawn to Dave's belly, which was at least three times bigger than it was when Jake went to bed and looked just as full and hard as his own was.</span></div></div>",

I'm baking pies for you, me, and Puck. I probably should have asked earlier if you like apple.\"<br>\r\n\"No apple's good but what I meant is why are you baking at...what time is it?\" Jake looked around.<br>\r\n\"5:30,\" Dave supplied. Jake squinted. <br>\r\n\"Thanks. Why are you baking at 5:30?\"<br>\r\n\"I bake when I can't or am not allowed to sleep and well baking is a full time job around here anyhow where we have to get up earlier to make food for mealtimes.\" <br>\r\n\"Well that makes a lot of sense,\" Jake said thinking about his two meals there. They would have to start real early to get anywhere near that amount of food ready.<br>\r\n\"Me and Puck take turns at it and this morning it's my turn while he sleeps.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you always eat like that?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n\"Yep, pretty much. After a while it gets easier but its still takes a lot of preparation before.\" Jake rubbed his bloated gut and reflected.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get big aren't I?\"<br>\r\n\"That should go without saying but yes, one can only hope you will. How do you think Puck got so big?\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty much that but how is he not...you know, like you.\" Jake gestured to Dave's billowing stomach. <br>\r\n\"Lots of exercise of course, far too much in my opinion,\" Dave said. \"Puck has always liked beef.\" Jake stared blankly for a moment before Dave realized.<br>\r\n\"Man beef I mean. Loves being the big bull and powerlifting. He's great at it, but it's far more dedication to maintain the body in a huge but controlled fashion than I really care for. I leave him to it and it works for him.\" Dave licked his mouth. \"Puck is amazing and before you ask, yes he tops.\" Jake shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I wasn't going to ask that and that was more info than I needed. Doesn't surprise me though.\"<br>\r\n\"You hungry?\" Dave asked all of a sudden. \"I've got a pie or two I can spare and I don't feel like eating right now.\"<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" Jake said before his stomach growled again. \"On second thought maybe just a little.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Dave said as he put the entire pie in front of Jake on the table and sliced huge slices, getting Jake a plate. \"Of course a little.\" The wink Dave sent Jake pretty much said he didn't believe him and honestly, Jake was beginning to agree. The pie smelled wonderful and if it was going to have the same perfection as the earlier meals, he wouldn't be able to stop at just one slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your belly all big and bloated out like that. Look's like a real man's belly,\" Dave said as he pulled out a chair for Jake. Jake took the invite to sit down as well then he realized what Dave had said and blushed which made Dave grin even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaining just suits you.\" Dave reached out and poked Jake's gut. \"It's going to be amazing to watch and see the changes,\" Jake flushed.<br>\r\n\"I'm only doing this because I have to.\" Dave snorted.<br>\r\n\"Pretty much everyone says that but ends up enjoying it anyway. I certainly do as does Puck and trust me you both are pretty similar in this regard. At least were.\" He gripped a hold of Jake's gut again and rubbed his large fingers over it. \"Tell me you don't like how good it feels to eat and be stuffed and your belly full and being rubbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never really have been able to have done this, my mom didn't make a lot of money...\"<br>\r\n \"Different issue. I asked if you enjoy it and I think you do.\" Dave dug harder in a moment before returning to soothing rubs that as much as Jake wanted to deny, felt immensely pleasureable on his full stomach like when Puck did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...perhaps a little,\" Jake granted. Dave smirked and moved back. <br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" A loud yawn echoed into the room.<br>\r\n\"Aahhhhh oh hey guys.\" Puck walked into the room rubbing sleep from his eyes. \"Didn't expect you to be up yet Jake, were you comfortable?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah it was good, just woke up a bit hungry, smelled some pie, and came down for a snack and found Dave.\" Puck smiled at that.<br>\r\n\"Sweet, told ya Dave he'd fit in.\" Dave looked up and nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah you did. I tested to make sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait so this was all a test?\" Jake shouted surprised.<br>\r\n\"Kind of. Either way you passed,\" Dave said grinning. \"Welcome to the family.\" Puck came over and pulled Jake against him in a big hug which felt both wonderful and worried that he'd be crushed. Puck eventually let up smiling fondly at his little brother. Jake stared at Puck's belly a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I...?\" Jake gestured and Puck smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, I don't mind. See how big your brother is.\" Jake chose not to comment on how creepy that had just sounded and took the invite since Puck really was touchy-feely and he never got a good chance to explore for a few moments before and getting crushed to death by hugs didn't count. Taking a deep breath, Jake put his fingers on the massive ball and rubbed it. It was rock-hard and if not for the shape and dimension, Jake would have been convinced it was the solidness of very lean-cut abs. How did it manage to stick out and his brother walk with amazing balance, it must have been like lifting a boulder as there was very little give to it. Jake was tempted to punch to see if anything would happen but at the same time he was fairly certain that that would be as great as punching a brick wall except this one could move. Puck's arms were massive pythons that he couldn't even get his entire hand around halfway, and that thick built chest....it was beautiful but at the same time unnerving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that is impressive,\" Jake said which it was. \"How do you get it so hard?\" Puck quirked a smile and Jake rolled his eyes. \"Oh come on grow up I thought I was the little brother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dunno really, I suspect it's natural genetics but also doing power exercises and strict control maintenance.\"<br>\r\n\"It's almost as bad as with someone obsessively working to get thin,\" Dave said.<br>\r\n\"I'm not that bad,\" Puck protested and Dave moved over to him and grinned.<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not, but you are pretty bad and I like the result at least,\" Dave said running his hands down Puck's chest. Jake looked away but turned back and peeked, licking his lips as he felt a desire for someone to touch him that way as well. </span></div></div>",

He lifted himself into a sitting position and grunted as he placed his hand on his still spherical belly.  When he was awake earlier with Dave and Puck they all ended up eating the pies Dave and cooked and hanging out.  It wasn't until Jake had eaten two entire apple pies and a whole container of vanilla ice cream by himself that he realized how much he had eaten.  Now it was two hours later and he was still absolutely stuffed.  Jake sniffed the air and groaned, \"Ugh...  They're making breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going downstairs Jake decided to shower and get ready for the day.  Once he was all clean he threw on a pair of boxers, dark gray jeans, and his leather boots.  He grabbed a green shirt from his new closet and pulled it over his torso, but much to his dismay, couldn't get it over his stomach.  Jake pulled and pulled at the normall tight shirt but no matter what he did the fabric wouldn't completely cover his swollen belly.  Jake looked at himself in his bedroom mirror and saw that half of his stomach was showing and his belly button was poking out.  He sighed, grabbed one of his pull over hoodies, and threw it over.  His stomach was much less visible this way.  He grabbed his backpack and headed down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning!\"  Jake said as he entered the kitchen.  The first thing he saw was the massive breakfast laid out on the table; several huge trays of pancakes, waffles, and french toast, along with a huge tray of eggs and a mountain of bacon, ham, and sausage links.  There was also two huge plates of hashbrowns and a few bottles of milk and soda.  <br>\r\nPuck and Dave were both stuffing their faces at the table and Puck's face light up at the sight of his little brother, \"Morning, Jake!  Hungry?\" he said, walking to the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\"  Jake admitted, reaching for some hashbrowns before Puck stopped him, \"Uh-uh.  Not for you.\"<br>\r\n\"What?  Why?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Because, we need to build your weight up before we start building your muscles up.\"  Puck sat Jake down and went to the fridge, grabbing two large blender glasses full of what looked like chocolate milk.<br>\r\n\"What are those?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Gainer shakes.  Dave and I use them all the time and they pack on the pounds like crazy.  Until you break your freshman 50-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean 15?\"  Jake interrupts.<br>\r\n\"No, 50.  Once you break your freshman 50 THEN you can eat the big boy breakfast.  Until then it's two shakes a day.\"  Puck said, folding his huge arms.<br>\r\nJake sighed and grabbed the first container, putting it to his lips, and started drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jake almost 10 minutes but he finally finished drinking the two massive shakes, his stomach huge and swollen once again.  He looked up at Puck, who happily put another one in front of Jake's face.  Jake groaned, \"No more, Bro.  I feel like I'm gonna pop.\"<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to drink it!  It'll push you past that wall you have.\"  Puck said, putting the shake in Jake's hand.  Jake sighed again and quickly went to work.  Another 10 minutes passed and Jake set it down, \"Ugh....  done.  Can I go to school now?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\"  Puck said, looking back at Dave, \"Babe, I'm driving Jake to school.  You can have everything on the table while I'm out.  I'll grab something at a drive-thru.\"<br>\r\nDave gave Puck a thumbs up as he ate and Puck helped Jake up and out of the house.</span></div></div>",

You're just stuffed.\" Puck looked over at Jake's jacket. \"Nice wardrobe. Let's see what you have accomplished shall we?\" <br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" Jake mumbled. Puck frowned at that.<br>\r\n\"Of course you do, it's just me so I want to see.\" He looked sternly over at Jake who sighed and reluctantly unzipped his jacket. Puck whistled in appreciation.<br>\r\n\"You're doing great,\" Puck said reaching out and squeezing Jake's belly and jiggling it. \"Really good progress already at the start.\" <br>\r\n\"My shirt's shrunk,\" Jake said trying to pull his again rolling up shirt. \"It won't fit.\" Puck grinned at the sight.<br>\r\n\"I say. It's a very good sign indeed. Even I did not expect you to do so well so quickly.\" <br>\r\n\"Gee thanks,\" Jake said. \"That just makes me feel better.\" Puck continued driving. <br>\r\n\"Want to stop for some food?\" he asked teasingly, as he patted Jake's stomach again when he least expected it. Jake jumped a little in hs seat.<br>\r\n\"Wha-NO! No I do not want anything. I couldn't possibly eat anything else!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, just relax. I'm just getting something for me before school starts.\" Puck stopped at the grocery and was gone for 15 minutes before coming back with a number of loaded bags. They still had time but not much to get to school, having left early. <br>\r\n\"Finally, let's just go.\" Puck just grinned. <br>\r\n\"Someone's an eager beaver to get back to school,\" Puck said. \"Got to show his newfound progress...\"<br>\r\n\"No one is going to see,\" Jake muttered.<br>\r\n\"Oh they will eventually. Own your body Jake, own it,\" Puck said seriously.<br>\r\n\"Is that some weird older brother guru advice?\" <br>\r\n\"Nope, but I'm freaking awesome. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" Puck pulled up to the school. <br>\r\n\"Now remember, don't do anything I wouldn't do!\" Puck called as Jake got out. <br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever that means seeing as you do a lot of things,\" Jake muttered. He went in to continue the existence of a high school student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was...school. He didn't see any of the hockey team or rascist douchebags so there were no insults throwed. On the other hand, he wasn't sure if he would have done anything if they had. Puck's logic was kind of screwy and seeing as they just started it made no sense but physically speaking, he would have gotten his butt kicked fast if he did try as he felt already felt slower and bigger although those were just the shakes from breakfast. And that pie, icecream, pasta, turkey, mashed potatoes...okay, it was going to take a little longer than he was used to to get back to normal. Or at least equilibrium. Jake already had a sinking suspicion that he wasn't going to be allowed to go back to normal. He felt under his jacket at the swelled stuffed stomach, far different from its normal flatness of...two days ago. It did have an appeal of its own though but he certainly could have done without the physically ill feeling that at any moment he was going to either explode or throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst class was boring...like Puck, he really couldn't care about Geometry but he was actually pretty decent at it and actually attended though there were many times that he really really wished he didn't. It was harder sleeping there than in the Nurse's office and he'd gotten in trouble for falling asleep before. Mainly to do with the teacher, Jake couldn't imagine how it would be possible to find anyone more boring. It was even harder to stay awake listening to the drone so he had to entertain himself by playing with his belly and rubbing it to move digestion along. He was almost beginning to see why Puck and Dave enjoyed it so much when Mr. Leonard stopped by his desk and asked him a question. Jake was startled and looking at the board, quickly solved it. When he gave the right answer, Mr. Leonard scowled and moved off to torture some other poor soul. Geez, you'd think he'd like a guy who was actually good at Geometry and could answer one of his questions but no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boring hell known as Geometry with Mr. Leonard (the really important part) was over, Jake was excited to get out and then skidded to a stop as he realized something. After this he had P.E. and...crap crap crap how did he forget?! He should have begged Puck to not make him go today and waited until he figured something out but no, he totally forgot in a stuffed belly and Mr. Leonard haze and he couldn't not go because Coach Beiste certainly did not tolerate skipouts. With a sense of finality and impending doom, Jake headed to the P.E. room thinking he was going to die, either of embarassment or suicide sprints which in the state he was really would be suicide. He could only hope to burst into flames before that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed to the locker room and waited as the guys around him changed, hanging back. As soon as everyone was gone he sighed as he started to undress. \"Maybe it won't fit to bad,\" he thought. He wouldn't be allowed to cover up but perhaps it wouldn't look bad? Jake didn't know there was still someone in there with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder headed out into the bathroom when he saw Jake was still there when everyone else was already outside waiting. Ryder squinted. Something seemed a little off...Ryder almost worried his dyslexia transferred into his sight (was that possible? He didn't know, it certainly caused weirdly bizzare letters) and blinked again. Nope, he was seeing right. Jake's belly...well, there was a roundness and it was sticking out in that Jake actually had the beginnings of a gut. It certainly was not flat like normal. Ryder watched in amazement as Jake unbuttoned his pants and sighed in relief as it pushed forward a bit where it had been being held in check as he bent over and removed them, putting on the shorts. Ryder licked his lips at the sight, feeling slightly turned on which surprised him. Though the way Jake was being sneaky with his weight as he looked around and put his shirt on certainly was hot. It didn't even look out of place beneath the loose shirt (lucky for Jake he found a more loose shirt stuffed in his locker from a previous time he had forgotten about than the one he normally wore). It didn't look out of the ordinary at all. Jake left the room and smiling a little, Ryder followed closely behind, keeping from being seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake was waiting with the rest of his PE class for Coach Beiste to come out and begin today's activities.  Jake was doing his best to keep his bloated stomach hidden, and his shirt did help with that, but Ryder could tell it was swollen and stuffed.  He was about to confront Jake about it when Coach Beiste walked out and called Jake over.  Jake, confused, walked over to her, \"Yeah, Coach?<br>\r\n\"You got switched into another class.  Head into the weights room.\"  Beiste said before having her class start off with laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't question this, though he was very happy he didn't have to run, what with his full stomach and all, and walked into the weight room.  The room was empty, not a single other student around, and Jake was about to leave and ask Beiste why it was so empty, when his new teacher walked in.  Jake turned around and was shocked to see his older brother standing there dressed like a PE teacher: a skin tight white t-shirt with the school's PE logo clung to Puck's massive arms, wide torso, huge pecs, and a giant ball belly.  He gym shorts ended half way up his thighs and stuck to them just as tightly, hugging his huge ass as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck?  What are you doing here?\"  Jake asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"Hey!  At school you are to address me as Coach Puckerman, little guy.\"  Puck said jokingly, \"Mr. Schue got me hired as YOUR personal PE coach.  The principal was a little on edge about it but when I said I'd do it for free he agreed.\"  Puck pointed to the weight bench next to him, \"Now get that skinny ass of yours on this bench and give me 50.\"<br>\r\nJake sighed, knowing he really didn't have a choice, and did as his big bro told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class lasted one hour Puck had Jake alternating between doing weighted squats and bench presses.  By the time they were finished Jake's arms and legs were killing him, but in a good way.  He loved the feeling of finishing a huge workout.  Puck patted his little brother's back, \"Good job, bro!  You did better than I expected.  Wait right here.\"  Puck said, leaving the room for a second.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Jake said, flexing his arm.  When Puck returned he was carrying a huge ice chest and Jake started, confused his older brother.<br>\r\nPuck set it down and pulled it open, \"Before you leave you still have one more assignment to do.\"  Puck pulled out a massive two gallon container that was filled with the same weight gain shake Jake had been forced to drink for breakfast.<br>\r\n\"Again?\"  Jake said, groaning.<br>\r\n\"Yes, again.  And if you don't drink it you get an F for the day.\"  Puck said, handing it to Jake.  Jake groaned, unscrewed the top, and started drinking.  He chugged it as quickly as he could, just to get it over with, but as soon as he put that bottle down Puck shoved another into his mouth, \"1 down, 1 to go.\"  Puck said as Jake took the bottle and continued drinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes went by and Jake had finally finished drinking down both of the bottles that Puck had given him.  He groaned loudly and clutched his belly, which currently conatined 4 gallons of of his big brother's weight gain shakes, \"How are these supposed to work, anyway?  I've been stuffing myself wit them since yesterday and nothing has happened.\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Thats because we've been feeding you non-stop.  We'll go easy on you tonight with dinner and by tomorrow morning those abs of your will be a thing of the past.  Now go get dressed and head to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake did his best to change back into his clothes, but his stomach was so tightly back and swollen that he couldn't button his jeans or get his shirt to cover his belly all.  Thank god his sweatshirt still covered it.  The rest of the day went on normally, and Jake was able to successfully skip lunch (he hoped Puck wouldn't notice) and by the time Glee club was over he had successfully spent the day digesting the massive meal that never seemed to end for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake got into the passenger side seat of Puck's car and his big bro grinned, reaching over and patting Jake's still stuffed, but clearly smaller, belly, \"And how was my growing little bro's day at school?\"<br>\r\n\"It was okay, I guess.\"  Jake said, rubbing his swollen belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, thats good, because today is friday, which means you have a BIG weekend ahead of you.\"  Puck said and they headed off for home.<br>\r\n\"So...\"  Jake started, amazed by what he was about to ask, \"Whats for dinner?\"<br>\r\n\"It's my night to cook, Jakey, and I'm making a MASSIVE fried chicken dinner.  Of course, thats not all we're having.  Dave spent all day cooking up 6 mind-blowingly huge chocolate cakes!\"<br>\r\nJake would be lying if he said that didn't sound absolutely amazing, and his stomach even let out a little growl.  Puck smirked, happy to see his little brother excited about stuffing his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home...</span></div></div>",

I'm about done with the chocolate cakes so they'll be ready for eating.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Puck said. \"I'll continue the chicken and you and Jake here can nibble on cakes as long as you leave me some.\" Dave continued grinning as he pulled Jake from the kitchen to the living room table where he had them displayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty neat huh?\" Dave asked and Jake agreed, stunned by the sight of such decadently good looking cake as you would find done by professionals. Jake was even drooling by this point, unable to resist the sight and smell of such sweet things. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could have some right?\" Jake asks. <br>\r\n\"Of course, have as much as you want,\" Dave said. \"There sure is plenty for now.\" He brought out plates and utensils as he carefully cut the cakes into big huge slices for the two of them. Jake felt a stab of guilt and shame for a moment, old training died hard, for even the thought of dessert before dinner but he reasoned with himself that Dave and Puck were the one's pushing it so it was okay and he eagerly took the first piece and dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake groaned at the taste. \"Oh my god this is so good I mean seriously. This is like amazing.\" <br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Puck called from the kitchen. \"It's hard to not come over and have some right now.\" <br>\r\n\"You still can,\" Dave called. <br>\r\n\"Nah, not until the chicken's ready. I'll be there in a bit.\" Puck continued working on the chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was plowing through the first cake, surprised by how hungry he was feeling at the moment, especially since he'd been stuffed all day. Though he supposed the workout helped and skipping lunch and that the chocolate cake was just that good and the  taste just melted in his mouth, sending out pleasure signals all throughout his body. <br>\r\nSlowing down a moment, Jake licked his lips feeling thirsty. \"Hey got anything to drink?\" he asked and nearly ducked as Puck tossed a big 2 liter of Dr. Pepper over his back without looking one-handed. \"Hey watch it!\" Jake said a bit pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, force of habit. You did catch it though.\"<br>\r\n\"You could have hit me,\" Jake muttered before Dave sat down beside him. <br>\r\n\"No he wouldn't have unless you moved too much. Puck has scary good aim.\" Dave removed his shirt, exposing his hairy chest and heavy belly and then his pants. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n\"Getting ready. Don't want my good clothes getting dirty. I'd say you do the same although it is a bit too late already.\" Jake looked down and noticed the chocolate stains of his straining shirt that he had started the day with. With a grunt of disgust, he removed, balled, and threw it away. <br>\r\n\"It was getting small anyhow.\" Jake did the same to the pants which he grudgingly admitted were squeezing a little. Dave smiled as he sighed. <br>\r\n\"Better?\" Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"Much,\" Jake said as he took a large gulp of Dr. Pepper and belched. <br>\r\n\"Spoken like a true Puckerman,\" Dave said grinning. Puck suddenly joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up babe and little bro? Dinner is ready.\" He looked at the two of them and waggled his eyebrows. \"So it's a strip dinner? I always do enjoy those.\" Puck proceeded to remove his shirt and pants as well, leaving them all sitting there in their boxers. Jake almost shook his head before deciding not to bother as his brother already had them off before he could say a word. Looking between Dave and Puck, Jake mentally compared them. He had thought Dave bigger when he first saw him but after earlier and comparing them side by side, Puck was overall more massive because although Dave was a bit wider, his stomach looked soft and furry and kind of paunchy while Puck's was and looked (and felt as he had felt) as solid as a rock with bulging muscles and beefy slab pectorals while Dave's admittedly were somewhat puffy. It was an interesting contrast that really struck Jake. Puck winked at Jake as he cut a slice of cake as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cake before dinner, not particularly smart, especially if its Dave's,\" Puck said as he took a bite. \"So f-ing good,\" he swallowed and grinned as he licked his lips. Dave leaned over and kissed him causing Puck to make a sound that has Jake blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, don't need to see or hear that,\" Jake said wincing. Puck smirked at his younger brother. <br>\r\n\"You'll see eventually. Anyhow, help yourself to some chicken. By the way, you made excellent progress today.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks?\" Jake said and Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"</span></div></div>",

Puck and Dave finished the massive slices on their plates and sat back, rubbing their stomachs happily and watched Jake eat.  As Jake gorged himself on the addicting chocolate fudge cake Puck got an idea.  He leaned into Dave and whispered into his ear.  Dave nodded and Puck got up, heading into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jake?\"  Dave asked.  Jake gave a food muffled 'yeah?' but kept gorging himself.  \"Puck and I decided that we don't really want chocolate cake for dessert.  Puck wants me to make some lemon cream pies instead so all of these are yours.\"  Dave said before standing up and waddling to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake swallowed the last bite and looked up, \"Mine?\"  He asked before looking at the cakes in front of him.  There were 6 massive chocolate cakes, each big enough to feed at least 10 people.  Jake was about to decline but something strange happened.  His stomach, despite how stuffed it was from the last two days of non-stop feeding, grumbled loudly for food.  Puck and Dave grinned and Jake couldn't help himself.  He eagerly picked up his fork and dug into the cakes.<br>\r\nDave joined Puck in the kitchen, \"Are you as excited as I am?\"  he asked and Puck grinned.<br>\r\n\"Of COURSE I am.  When Jake wakes up tomorrow all of the food and weight gain shakes we stuffed him with over the last two days will be broken down and he'll officially start his gaining.  We just need to make sure he takes this.\"  Puck said, holding up a small blue and yellow pill.  Puck and Dave went to work, devouring the massive fried chicken dinner meal Puck had made, while Puck also blended together Jake's batch of weight gain shakes for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed and Dave and Puck were sitting back in their chairs at the kitchen table, rubbing their massively swollen guts which were now happily fille with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and candied yams.  The two of them combined had eaten enough food to feed a party of 50 people.  Puck burped loudly before smiling at his gigantic boyfriend, \"You full?\"  he asked, rubbing his spherical gut.<br>\r\n\"I could still eat but for now I'm content.\"  Dave said, patting his gigantic belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I better check on Jakey.\"  Puck said, lifting himself and walking, slowly, to the kitchen counter.  He grabbed the tray with 6 shakes from the counter, dropping the pill into one of them, and walked in, a grin spreading across his face at the sight before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was sitting back on the couch with a glazed look on his face.  He had chocolate smeared all over his mouth, hands, chest, and stomach.  Jake's chocolate covered hands rested on his MASSIVELY swollen stomach, which was so tightly packed and full of not only the remainds of the last two days worth of food but 6 gigantic chocolate cakes.  Puck never thought he'd see the day when somebody would stuff themselves so much that their stomach would resemble Dave's.  He walked over and patted his baby bro's massive belly, \"Hey, little guy.  How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuugh.... so full...\"  Jake said.<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Well, you only have a little but more to eat, okay Jake?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\"  Jake said, barely understanding what Puck was saying.  Puck picked up the first shake, which had the pill in it, and held it up to Jake's lips.  Jake drank it down, barely resisting, and Puck continued, feeding him one more.  If he fed Jake the other four he feared his bro might explode.  Puck walked back to the kitchen, got a wet paper towel,and sat down next to Jake, cleaning the cake off of his body.  Once Jake was clean Puck helped him up and took him into his room (and thank god Puck was 350 pounds of strong man beef because Jake's room was on the second floor).  Puck tucked Jake into bed and patted his belly, \"When you wake up tomorrow, baby bro, you'll be massive.\"  Puck went down stairs and shared the remaining 4 gainer shakes with Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake groaned as he opened his eyes, yawning and rubbing the sleep from them before looking at the clock on his bedside table.  It was 11 in the morning and Jake sighed, happy to know Puck gave him Saturday morning off from eating.  Jake sat up in bed and thats when he noticed how massive his stomach was, and he didn't mean how bloated it was.  Jake ran his hands along his newly formed gut and was amazed by how soft it was.  Jake quickly stood up, walked to the full length mirror in his room, and for the first time noticed his overnight weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just one night Jake had put on what he could only assume was at least 100 pounds.  He looked at his face which was now much rounder than before.  His cheeks had rounded out a little and he was developing a double chin.  His neck was much thicker and his even his traps were bigger, almost more muscular.  His arms looked thicker as well, and pecs were rounder and slightly soft looking and below them was his massive belly.  Jake's belly looked like a baby version of Puck's and Dave's: perfectly spherical and bulged outward like Puck's but soft and squishy like Dave's.  Jake's thighs were thicker and his ass was twice as wide and formed two perfect spheres, giving him a large bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake flexed his big arms and looked himself over: he should hate the way he looked but he didn't.  In fact, he LOVED it.  He looked strong and powerful.  He had NO idea why he felt so weird about gaining before!  Jake hurried out of his room and was on his way downstairs to show Puck and Dave his new body when he ran into Puck, almost falling on his now fatter ass.<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, little guy!\"  Puck said, catching his brother, \"Well, LOOK at you!  I guess that pill really worked!\"<br>\r\n\"What pill?\"  Jake asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"It's one of the gainer tricks I use to help Me, Dave, and my clients bulk up faster.  We binge eat for days and days and NEVER let ourselves be hungry or have empty stomachs.  Then we take that pill and when we wake up the next morning BAM, a massive gain!\"  Puck said, a grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"WHOA!  That's awesome!!\"  Jake said, looking down at his new bulk.<br>\r\n\"It sure is!  It only works one a month though.  You body adjusts to it and you have to wait before you can use it again.\" Puck said, patting Jake on the shoulder.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Jake asked, looking visibly upset.  He REALLY loved the results.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry bud.  Anyway, I just finished up my meeting with two clients of mine so the WHOLE day is devoted to your gaining!\"  Puck said, walking towards the front room.<br>\r\n\"Clients?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I do this for a living, baby bro.\"  Puck said happily.<br>\r\n\"Who were they?  Anybody I know?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Sam Evans and Blaine Anderson.  I've been working on Sam since last year but I've only been helping Blaine since summer.  Sam weighs around 440 pounds but Blaine is only around 310.\"  Puck said, \"So, hope your ready for your first day as a big guy because we're pulling out ALL the stops!\"  Puck lead Jake into the kitchen where Dave had prepared a massive...</span></div></div>",

I myself haven't eaten yet since I've been taking care of Sam and Blaine earlier and I'm feeling like breakfast so Dave made us all breakfast for lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"So brunch?\" Jake asked amused. Puck scratched his mohawk.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's it. I've been trying to remember what breakfast for lunch was called. Anyhow, how are you feeling Jake? After last night I mean.\"<br>\r\n\"Surprisingly...I feel great. Well maybe not so much last night and it is kind of a blur after the first cake or two but right now, I'm feeling awesome.\"<br>\r\n\"That's good, and how do you feel about this?\" Puck asked jiggling Jake's new gut. \"It's a pretty big jump from what you're used to.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is...I thought I'd hate it but actually I love it.\" Puck stopped for a moment and looked at Jake. <br>\r\n\"Really now?\" He smirked. \"I did tell you you would like it.\"<br>\r\n\"I must admit you were right about that,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm right about everything,\" Puck again smirked as he squeezed Jake's softened belly. Jake twitched a bit as a sigh escaped. <br>\r\n\"No you're not and uh that feels good.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm right when it comes to these matters anyhow am I not? And yes, yes it is. Do you miss your abs?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes and no,\" Jake admitted. \"Actually, mainly no because it feels good like this. Though my clothes don't fit.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not, that's to be expected after such a gain as yours. It will never really be as fast or as much again, particularly fast, but you definitely have growing potential.\"<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" Jake said excited.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Puck patted his head. \"Hey Dave, come and see our 'little' Jake-y here would ya?\" Puck winked at Jake as Dave came out wearing an apron. <br>\r\n\"Good morning-oh!\" Dave looked at Jake in surprise a moment before looking at Puck. <br>\r\n\"What do you know, it did work.\" He looked back at Jake before grinning. \"You're filling out nicely,\" Dave nodded at Jake who was just in his underwear. Jake flushed a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had nothing else that fit me,\" he said in response to the look that Dave gave him. \"Except the underwear, my pants are too tight and my shirts sure as heck don't cover this,\" Jake laughed as he patted his belly. \"I don't even know why that's funny but it just is right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you wear some of Puck's clothes?\" he asked. Jake blinked a moment before looking at Puck. <br>\r\n\"Hey, that's right your stuff would fit me.\"<br>\r\n\"It'd be even loose on you,\" Puck grinned.<br>\r\n\"So why didn't you offer me any?\" Jake demanded.<br>\r\n\"Cause the sight of you parading your beefy body happily and proudly fills my heart with joy. Besides, I wanted Dave to see and it's not like there's anyone but us here and you're still the smallest.\"<br>\r\n\"Well can I get dressed now?\" Jake asked. Puck tapped his fingers against his chin a moment as he thought. <br>\r\n\"Hmm...after breakfast, I mean brunch.\" <br>\r\n\"Well alright I guess,\" Jake sat down in a chair that was already pulled out. He took a whiff of appreciation and grinned. <br>\r\n\"Am I going to be allowed to have bre-brunch today?\" Jake asked in reference to the first time when Puck stopped him from having breakfast before. <br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Puck smiled. \"As long as you leggo my eggo.\" Dave rolled his eyes and Jake stared as Puck burst out laughing. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry, couldn't help myself.\" Puck said smiling.<br>\r\n\"Dude, that joke is getting old,\" Dave muttered. Puck got up and hugged him. <br>\r\n\"Aw come on you know you like it,\" Puck said and then whispered something in his ear that Dave blush and smile and Jake decided it was better not to ask.<br>\r\n\"Is this food going to eat itself or what?\" Jake asked interrupting them. Puck smirked at the enthusiasm. <br>\r\n\"I'm so proud, er I mean hell yeah let's eat.\" Puck, Dave, and Jake began to load their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive stacks of pancakes, eggs, and gritz were passed around, topped off with bacon. Although Puck and Jake were relatively faithful Jews (and Puck more so than Jake by far), they had for the most part given up on the whole non-pig product rule as bacon and ham were too good not to have now and again. Also, Jake had never really been introduced to that rule in the first place. In any case, the food was ready and delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he took a bite. \"You always do it far better than me,\" he said appreciatively to Dave. \"I thought I was good but you always do over the top.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I love your cooking as well,\" Dave said. <br>\r\n\"I for one agree,\" Jake said interrupting not wanting to be left out after taking a bite. \"Seriously this stuff is amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it guys, you're making me blush like a girl,\" Dave flushed.<br>\r\n\"A very big sexy one, who is all man,\" Puck said his hand rubbing Dave's belly.Jake felt weird but also felt a spark of interest for some reason. Probably just the sight of Puck playing with Dave's stomach which Jake copied on himself and knew was fun. Puck looked over and smirked his eyes glancing over at Jake's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help?\" Puck asked as he scooted closer and moved one hand over Jake's. \"Allow me,\" Puck said as he rubbed one-handed while taking forkfuls of pancake and eggs.Jake twitched again as Dave looked at Puck then at Jake then at Puck again before smirking and rubbing his big hand along Jake's gut as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that's so much more substantial than before,\" Dave said grinning. Jake was squirming under the attenton. Puck leaned closer and whispered in his ear. <br>\r\n\"Relax and let us take care of you. Just close your eyes and open your mouth when you feel something there.\" Jake did as he was told and Puck and Dave grinned at each other as they took turns alternatively feeding him as they fed themselves on delicious brunch. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After fifteen minutes of Jake trying to feed himself, while also being fed by Dave and Puck. He quickly realized this wasn\u2019t working and sat back in his chair, letting the two massive men on either side of him shovel gigantic forkfuls of food into his mouth.  As Jake swallowed down the massive amounts of food being stuffed into his fatter stomach he quickly realized that Dave and Puck were quite skilled at this.  They fed Jake in perfect time: everytime Puck stuffed food into Jake\u2019s mouth Dave would eat a bite for himself and vice versa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for an hour until Jake was so full he had to physically push their arms away, \u201cUgh\u2026 enough, you guys.  I\u2019m full.\u201d  Jake said, rubbing his stuffed belly, which had swelled to twice its original size.  <br>\r\nPuck patted Jake\u2019s belly, grinning proudly at the size of his baby bro\u2019s gut, \u201cGood job there, little guy.  I had no idea you could stuff that much food into this tiny thing.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck rubbed his belly happily and Dave chuckled, \u201cTiny compared to us, babe.\u201d  He said, patting his own fat, fleshy gut.<br>\r\nDave smiled, \u201cBabe, YOUR gut is tiny compared to THIS beast of a belly.  And it isn\u2019t even close to being full!\u201d  Puck said, putting his hands underneath his barely full stomach and lifting it up, showing off how thick, round, solid, and huge it was.  Jake was simply amazed by the size of his big brother\u2019s massive muscle gut and how it bounced despite how thick and solid it was, \u201cWait\u2026 AREN\u2019T full?\u201d  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d  Puck said, smacking his gut, \u201cI\u2019m barely passed empty!  I could keep eating for hours before I got stuffed!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d  Dave said, reaching over and rubbing Dave\u2019s belly, \u201cI might look massive but Puck is a lot bigger than I am.  He could even out eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d Jake said, watching and Puck played with his gigantic, solid gut.  Puck rubbed his belly and looked over at Dave, \u201cSpeaking of, babe, are you still hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave shook his head, \u201cNah, I\u2019m good.  I need to start dinner anyway.\u201d  Dave said before standing up and heading to the kitchen.  <br>\r\nJake looked over and watched as Dave walked towards the kitchen and his eyes traveled down Dave\u2019s monstrously wide back, his eyes instantly locking onto Dave\u2019s insanely wide ass.  Dave was wearing only a pair of skintight boxers that clung tightly to his massive bubble butt, which bounced and jiggled as he watched.  Jake found it hard to turn away from the enormous, spherical ass of Dave\u2019s but he finally did and looked over at Puck, \u201cSo, whats on the schedule today?\u201d  Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Puck said, loading up a gigantic plate of pancakes and bacon, \u201cI\u2019m going to eat the rest of the food here and YOU are gonna go take a shower and get dressed cause we\u2019re going to go buy you some new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Jake asked, excited by the idea of a new clothes that could fit.  He looked at the food on the table, refusing to believe that Puck could eat all the food there.  There was enough food on the table to feed a family of seven.<br>\r\n\u201cYep!  But if you expect me to buy you anything there is one ruke you need to follow.\u201d  Puck said.<br>\r\nJake rubbed his still swollen, stuffed belly, letting out a big burp before looking at Puck, \u201cUgh\u2026 So full.  What\u2019s the rule?\u201d  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can wear a pair of my jeans today but you HAVE to wear your tightest shirt to the mall.\u201d  Puck said, grinning.<br>\r\n\u201c...What?  Why?\u201d Jake asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta get used to showing off that gut of yours, baby bro!\u201d  Puck said, patting Jake\u2019s tight, stuffed belly.<br>\r\nJake groaned at the feeling of Puck patting his belly, \u201cUgh\u2026 fine.  I\u2019m gonna go shower then.\u201d  He said, knowing not to deny his big brother of what he wants.  Jake stands up and walks slowly out of the room, as not to upset his belly, but he could feel Puck\u2019s eyes watching his newly developing bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake reached the bathroom and removes his skintight boxers before getting into the shower and cleaning himself off.  As Jake washed his body he allowed his mind to wonder and as it did the image of Dave\u2019s enormous bubble butt came into his mind.  Jake explored his beefy body and tried his best to push the image of Dave\u2019s monstrous ass out of his head but the idea of topping such a thick, spherical, fat ass was amazing to him.  As Jake felt himself getting hard the idea of topping Dave slowly changed into Jake imagining his massive older brother topping him.  The thought of Puck\u2019s enourmas, thick, solid gut resting against Jake\u2019s back while his own half-brother fucked him drove Jake over the edge and he spent the rest of his shower reliving his pent up sexual energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake entered his bedroom an hour and a half later, having to take a cold shower after what had happened, and saw that somebody, most likely Dave, had set out a pair of Puck\u2019s old pants for him.  Jake slipped on a pair of boxers, which were just as skin tight as the last pair, and put on the jeans he was given.  They fit perfectly on his wider waist and were comfortable on his thicker thighs and chunkier ass.  Jake sighed as he opened his closet and looked for what could possibly be the smallest shirt he had.  He sighed as he grabbed a plaid button up shirt and put it on, struggling to get the buttons on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of struggling Jake was finally able to get all the buttons together and he turned and looked in the mirror.  Every single button on his shirt was straining to stay together and the shirt was tight across his bigger pecs and large, stuffed belly.  Patches of skin showed through the gaps between the buttons and Jake sighed.  Puck was right.  He was going to have to get used to this.<br>\r\nAfter putting on socks and shoes and grabbing a jacket Jake headed down stairs and entered the kitchen, a look of amazement crossing his face.  Sitting back in his chair was Puck, happily patting the massively stuffed gut before him.  Puck had managed to clear the entire food covered table and was now happily rubbing his enormous stomach, which was doubled in size due to the amount of food he had consumed.  Puck\u2019s belly was resting on the table in front of him and it looked rock hard and completely swollen with food.<br>\r\nJake could feel himself once again getting an erection but Puck\u2019s talking finally brought him back, \u201cSup, little bro!  That shirt looks sexy on you.\u201d  He said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d  Jake asked, confused and flustered.<br>\r\n\u201cSexy.  You look big and thick and sexy in that.  While showing off that gut and those cute little love handles of yours theres no way a guy can\u2019t be turned on by you.  Or a girl, whatever you\u2019re into.\u201d  Jake said, lifting himself up and walking over to Jake, his massive stomach sticking out far in front of him.<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Puck, if you don\u2019t mine me asking\u2026  How much do you weigh?\u201d  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\u201cMy weight?  Hmm\u2026 Y\u2019know, I haven\u2019t weighed myself in over two months!\u201d  Puck said, surprised.<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Jake asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  I get so caught up with eating, lifting, my own gaining, Dave\u2019s gaining, and fattening up other guys that I just forget to check my own weight sometimes!\u201d  Jake followed Puck as he walked to the bathroom and Jake\u2019s eyes shot straight to his older brother\u2019s massive rear.  Jake couldn\u2019t believe his eyes; Puck\u2019s enormous bubble butt was even bigger than Dave\u2019s!  Jake thought that was impossible but the proof was right before him.  The thing that amazed Jake about his brother\u2019s ass the most was that unlike the rest of Puck, which was beefy and tight, it seemed as if all of Puck\u2019s body fat collected in his rear end.  Puck\u2019s monstrous bubble butt swayed left and right, bouncing and jiggling as he walked.  When Jake and Puck reached the bathroom where the scale was Puck eagerly got on and looked at Jake, \u201cRead the number for me, Jakey.  I can\u2019t see it over my stomach.\u201d<br>\r\nJake looked under his brother\u2019s belly, trying not to look at his crotch, \u201cOh my GOD.  Dude,  how much did you use to weigh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.  Last I remember I weighed 350.\u201d  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, clearly that\u2019s not the case anymore.  You weight 450 now!\u201d  Jake said, shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA, REALLY?!\u201d  Puck said, a look of pure joy spreading over his face, \u201cTHAT\u2019S 50 POUNDS A MONTH!!  I KNEW I was getting huge but I didn\u2019t realize HOW huge!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuge doesn\u2019t even cut it, Puck!\u201d  Jake said, \u201cYou\u2019re MASSIVE!\u201d  Jake exclaimed, smacking his brother\u2019s tight, bloated gut.<br>\r\n\u201cSure am!  Now, how about you and I get out massive, sexy bodies down to the mall and get you some new clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanna be double-y sure you got m weight right.\"  Puck said, proudly rubbing his huge gut, \"I honestly feel bigger then 450.\"<br>\r\nJake looked down again and his eyes widened, \"WHOA!  You were right, bro - I did read it wrong.  You weight 475!!\"<br>\r\n\"FUCK YEAH, I KNEW IT!\"  Puck said, flexing his enormous biceps, \"Sam weighs 440 and I know for a fact I'm WAY bigger than him.  This is awesome!!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll say...\"  Jake said, feeling himself getting hard as he started at his brother's massive body, \"So, uh, we should go.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!  Lemme throw on some clothes and we'll head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stood by the door and played with his new, chunky belly (rubbing it, squeezing, jiggling, etc) while he waited for Puck.  Puck walked down stairs and Jake was honestly amazed that Puck could even still fit into clothing!  Puck's shoulders were so thick and massive that he had absolutely no neck, his pecs were so gigantic that he couldn't even get the buttons on his shirt over them, revealing his massive chest to the world.  Puck's stomach was by the biggest part of his body, though- it stuck a full foot in front of him and was still as solid and perfectly spherical as ever.  Puck denim jeans looked painted onto his massive tree trunk thighs and calves.  Puck grinned at his little bro, \"Ready to head out?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\"  Jake said, stuttering from how overwhelmingly hot Puck looked.  They both headed to the head and got in before driving off to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the mall took longer than Jake had thought it would, mainly because Puck stopped to get them mega sized chocolate milkshakes at a local burger place, but as soon as they parked the two massive brothers headed inside.    Jake and Puck walked around for bit and looked at a few stores here and there, buying some accessories and a new pair of boots, before they made another food stop at the food court.  Puck bought two of the biggest pretzels, slathered in salt, butter, and cheese, and ate them as the two headed to the store Jake did most of his shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck took a massive bite out of one pretzel in his right hand and swallowed it before looking at Jake, \u201cThis the place?\u201d  He asked before devouring another huge bite of the pretzel in his left hand.<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d  Jake said, heading inside.  Puck finished the two pretzels and wiped his mouth clean before tossing the trash in the nearby bin and following Jake in.<br>\r\nJake walked off towards the jeans he wanted and as Puck walked in a tall, muscular, dirty blonde haired boy named Ryder Lynn turned to the both of them, \u201cWelcome t-\u201c Ryder\u2019s words fell short at the sight of the massive Puckerman and he could feel the blood rush to his face and crotch. Ryder swallowed the lump in his throat and coughed, \u201cSorry.  Welcome!  Can I help you with anything?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yeah.\u201d  Puck said, walking up to Ryder.  He could tell instantly that Ryder was attracted to him.<br>\r\n\u201cWha- what would that be?\u201d  Ryder asked, trying not to stare at Puck\u2019s massive, exposed chest or monster sized belly.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my little brother, Jake.  He\u2019s having a bit of a growth spurt at the moment and needs some clothes that will last for a while.  Hook him up with some stylish new duds that he won\u2019t outgrow in a month and I\u2019ll make it worth you\u2019re while.\u201d  Puck said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a 100-dollar bill, slipping it into Ryder\u2019s shirt pocket.  Puck grabbed the pen the same pocket and took the receipt from the pretzel place out of his pocket, writing his phone number down, \u201cAnd if you do a really good job I\u2019ll swing by later tonight and let you take a ride on the Puck-a-saurus express.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder\u2019s face lit up red at the thought, \u201cI\u2026  Yeah.  Yes, sir.\u201d  Ryder said.  <br>\r\nPuck grinned and looked over, \u201cYo, baby bro.  I\u2019m still a bit puckish so I\u2019m gonna hit up the food court again.  I asked this guy to help you out.  Shoppin\u2019 for a big boy isn\u2019t as easy as you think.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh\u201d Jake said, looking for a pair of jeans he liked in his size.<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \u201cGood luck.\u201d  He said as he walked out, his massive ass swaying left and right and bouncing as he did, causing Ryder to stare lustfully.  Once Puck was done Ryder took a deep breath and walked over to Jake, \u201cHi, my name i- Jake?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?  Ryder?!  Dude, I didn\u2019t know you worked here!\u201d  Jake said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I started last week.  Dude, what happened to you?!  You\u2019re MASSIVE!\u201d  Ryder said, reaching out and rubbing Jake\u2019s gut, amazed by the size and feeling of it, both soft from the fat underneath buy hard from his huge breakfast.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, isn\u2019t it great?!\u201d  Jake said, flexing his arms.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, dude.  You look good.  So, uh\u2026  Let\u2019s find you some new clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder spent the next 2 hours helping Jake pick out new, better fitting, and very attractive outfits.  Ryder took this as an opportunity to feel Jake up every now and then: squeezing his gigantic ass by \u201caccident\u201d, groping his chest while trying to find button ups to fit over them, rubbing his belly as he helped Jake with some outfits.  Jake knew what Ryder was doing and didn\u2019t even try to stop him, because he knew that if the situation were reversed he\u2019d be doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder rung Jake up and Jake thanked him for all his help.  \u201cSee you in school monday, dude.\u201d  Jake called out as he left, wearing a new shirt that fit over his chest and gut much better than the button up did but still showed off his massive he was.  He reached the food court and found Puck sitting back against the booth he was sitting in, his swollen, bloated stomach resting against the table, \u201cSo what did you gorge on for two hours?\u201d  Jake asked, patting his bro\u2019s gut.<br>\r\nPuck smirked \u201c20 double quarter pounders from the McDonalds they have here.\u201d  Puck belched before lifting himself up, his gigantic, powerful muscles carrying his bulk like it was nothing.  \u201cSo, how\u2019d he do?\u201d  Puck asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazingly.  He found me the best stuff in the store and all of it is my size.  He guaranteed that I\u2019d be able to gain another 200 pounds before I need new clothes with these.\u201d  Jake replied.<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \u201cAwesome!  Let\u2019s head home.\u201d  Puck said, turning to head towards where the car was parked, and since he knew Dave wouldn't mind, excited about the idea of coming back later tonight for a hot fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Jake spent all saturday night gorging himself on the buffet sized portions of lasagna and garlic bread Dave made, stuffing himself until he was sick and then forcing down more.  He ended his saturday with two apple pies and three containers of ice cream before passing out in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday, Jake repeated the same process of eating until he passed out, waking up, and eating again, but he would take a few hours between meals to work out with his brom wanting to keep his muscles strong and big.  By sunday Jake had already gained another 25 pounds to his massive frame, bringing him up to 285.  Puck put on another 15 pounds, as he was more focused with helping his brother at the moment, putting him and 490, and Dave gained an addition 10, putting his weight at 410.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake went to sleep that night, excited about his first day back to school after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day at school, after another one of Dave's monster sized breakfasts, Jake ran into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake was feeling good about himself. Even when some of the guys on the hockey team made a joke about him being of mixed race as well as a heavy ass rhino or something, he managed to resist the urge to try to go after them. Well, barely. He had been about to when he heard his brother's voice telling him to count to 10 and keep calm and that it wasn't worth it to go after the bullies, well usually. His size did prevent them from trying anything more and other than namecalling, they didn't seem to keen on doing anything else, especially since it didn't have the desired effect of making him freak out like it usually did. He did receive some weird glances at first from people who didn't recognize him and thought he was a new student but that was okay as he didn't know most of them that well anyhow. He even felt on top of the world as he patted his thick stomach, happily stuffed with eggs and sausage. It was kind of funny how last week this would have shamed him but after only a few days, this was becoming quite fun and he enjoyed the envious looks on some of the guys faces who only wished they could be as big as him. He wondered if he should send any to Puck because Puck did always enjoy helping his clients but for now, he was content to bask in admiration. He was at his locker when he was tapped from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Jake, how was-woah!!!\" Shouted Marley when she saw Jake turned around. Everyone turned to stare and after a few glares from Jake and threatening motions people turned away to mind their own business though he wouldn't be surprised if they weren't trying to listen in as much as they can. Looking back to Marley, he put his fingers to his lips and made a turnlock gesture for her to be more quiet. Marley nodded and when he put his hands down, Marley stared at Jake in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Jake-you're huge! Why-how-you get like this?\" She poked her finger into his gut, surprised at the hard roundness of the stuffed flesh though there was a little give. He let out a little belch as he backed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, no poking right now. I'm kind of stuffed.\" Marley stared as if in a trance.<br>\r\n\"I can certainly see that but you were definitely a lot smaller last week so how did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n\"I had help from my brother Puck. He's an absolute genius for gaining, I mean seriously.\"<br>\r\n\"I can tell...but I just can't believe that you are this big right now. I mean, I can see it...I just can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n\"Believe it sister,\" Jake said smirking.<br>\r\n\"That's what you're going to look like if you eat,\" came the snarky voice of McKinnley's bitchiest girl Kitty. She had been walking by when she saw what was going on. \"Jeez Jake, blimp much? What did you do, eat Marley's whale of a mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Marley said. \"You said you were going to lay off talking about my mom that way and my mom is fine thank you very much. She even lost some weight.\" Kittly rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't being literal...much, though I admit I did wonder if Jake had and well, your mom is big so think of it as a compliment and deal with it. Though really, how the hell did you get so big jock Jake Puckerman? Or rather, ex-jock I guess considering the size of the food baby you're having.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wonder why no one likes you,\" Jake said rolling his eyes at Kitty, trying to keep from flinching at how much that actually did hurt. Those were some barbed words and while he was had been fine, Kitty did manage to titlt him a bit and feel self-conscious all over again but then, she had always been good at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say eat me but I'd worry you'd take me literally and actually do it,\" Kitty sniffed. \"But you never did answer the question.\"<br>\r\n\"Well let's just say Puck opened my eyes.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the guy who loves making people explode is your brother. I hear he's pretty big himself.\" <br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Jake said proudly.<br>\r\n\"If you grew that much in only a few days, I'd shudder to think of what you'd look like at the end of the month or year. Maybe you'd join Marely's mom in whale-dom, no offense Marley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying no offense doesn't make it not hurt Kitty,\" Marley said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever, I'm trying. Still talking to Jake here.\" Jake swallowed. Kitty did bring up a good point and even if growth would be at a far more reasonable rate since there is only so much that is physically possible, he probably would be huge and while Jake enjoyed being big, he did admit he wasn't sure just how big he was willing to get, no matter how fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. Maybe I should talk it over with Puck later so uh, bye Kitty,\" he said tilting his head, indicating he wanted her to leave. Kitty smirked and trounced off and Marley stayed, looking embarassed. \"Geez Marley, I'm still not quite sure about you being her friend,\" Jake said shaking his head. \"She's so horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...she is, but I think there has to be something good inside. I just need to find it.\" Marley said determined.<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the fact that she convinced you were fat and then gave you an eating disorder.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, I know that is bad and it is crazy to want to be friends with her-\"<br>\r\n\"Insane-\" interjected Jake.<br>\r\n\"-but I still want to and she's not always bad...sometimes.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't stop you from making friends with her though I do worry.\"<br>\r\n\"I know Jake, I know.\" She hugged him. \"Wow this is different but you feel nice and huggable.\"<br>\r\n\"...Thank you?\" Jake did not quite know what to say to that. Marley shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Still so weird because I'm not used to it but you are kind of cool like that though I would consider thinking about how big you are going to get.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n\"See you in Glee?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Marley walked off and just as Marley left, he saw Sam and Blaine come over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Jake said, finally getting the books for the day out and closing his locker. <br>\r\n\"So it's true,\" Sam said. \"You have gotten big.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Puck?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Who else?\" Jake countered. <br>\r\n\"Touche. He is insistent isn't he?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"You bet he is,\" Jake agreed. <br>\r\n\"We take lessons with him too,\" Blaine said. \"They work amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"He sure does know what he's talking about,\" Jake said proudly.<br>\r\n\"When it comes to gaining he sure does,\" Sam said. \"He helped me go from a skinny junior last year to the big beefy man I am today and am still trying to grow. He also helped Blaine get big as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was time for a change,\" Blaine explained. \"Kurt was pulling away and well, I don't know, just wanted to do something different and then I saw what Sam was doing, thought it was fun and the rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam poked Jake in the gut causing him to wince. \"Why does everyone keep doing that?\" Jake groused, \"To see if its real or something, I don't know, I just felt the urge to,\" Sam said. Jake rolled his eye. \"So...lunch?\" he asked. Sam and Blaine looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" they said as they walked off. Jake shrugged as he closed his locker and went to his first period class. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first four classes for Jake went by agonizingly slow.  All Jake could think about was food, food, and more food, and his stomach kept letting out growls of hunger.  Jake was able to hold back his hunger between classes by getting a few candybars from vending machines but by the time lunch rolled around Jake wasn't starving anymore thanks to his PE class with his brother.  Puck had loaded his little bro up with 5 huge glasses of their weight gain shakes, and though this would have make Jake vomit before, it only helped to keep his hunger at bay until he could get lunch with Sam and Blaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned the corner and saw Sam and Blaine outside of the choir room, which at the moment was empty.  Jake hadn't noticed earlier what the two were wearing or how big they actual were.  Blaine was wearing a short sleeve, white button down shirt and a pair of black pants and orange dress shoes with no socks.  He also had on one of his signature bow ties, also in orange to match his shoes.  While Blaine had some muscles Jake could easily tell he was mostly body fat, like a less buff version of Dave.  Blaine's face was round and full and he had a very prominent double chin.  His neck was thick and his shoulders were clearly strong (Jake could tell his brother helped Blaine with them) and Blaine's sleeves were straining to fit around his arms, which were both huge with muscles and fat.  Blaine's pecs puffed out a bit and his shirt clung to them, but like the rest of his body, Jake could tell Blaine's chest was on the softer, chunkier side.  Jake's eyes traveled down to Blaine's stomach, which was enormous and continued to give Blaine the look of a less muscular version of Dave.  Blaine's gut stuck out far in front of him and draped down over his waistline, and even through his shirt Jake could tell Blaine's gut was soft and doughy. Jake also noticed that the buttons on his shirt were straining to keep together and Jake was pretty sure if Blaine ate even a bite of food his buttons would pop right off, sending his massive belly out, which was something he wanted to see.  Blaine's hips were wide and his thighs were thick and beefy with muscles and fat and Jake could only imagine how massive and chunky Blaine's ass was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was standing next to Blaine and Jake could tell right away Sam was the bigger of the two.  Actually, now that he got a really good look at Sam, he could tell that Sam was bigger than Dave!  The easiest way to describe Sam's body was that he was a fatter version of Puck.  Sam's muscles were massive, just like Puck's, but he had three times the padding Puck had.  Sam was wearing a stripped tank top that barely covers his belly- it was stretched tight around his fat/buff torso and stopped above his belly button.  He also had on a pair of cargo shorts that were skin tight to his tree-trunk legs and what Jake assumed was his enormous ass.  His face, much like his boyfriend's, was round and he also had a double chin.  His neck was insanely thick and his shoulders were gigantic.  Sam's arms were as big as Jake's head and his pecs were so big they were barely contained by his tanktop.  Sam's gut stuck out far in front of him and resembled a smaller, chunkier version of Puck's - it was extremely round and tight looking but it hung over his waistband a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake couldn't help but think that Sam and Blaine made an adorable and sexy couple.  He walked up to them and grinned, \"Hey, guys!  Where are we headed for lunch?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"We're going to a pasta buffet place that Sam and I really love.  We go there a lot so they already know our orders.\"  Blaine said happily.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude, that place is awesome.  They give you servings as big as an extra large pizza.  I can only eat 6 plates before I'm too stuffed to finish.  Hey, Ryder!\"  Sam said, raising his hand to say hi.<br>\r\nJake turned around to see Ryder and smiled, \"Hey, dude, whats u-\"<br>\r\n\"Look, Jake,\"  Ryder said, a determined look in his eye, \"You are one of the sexiest men I know and I want you to be my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n\"Wha... WHAT?\"  Jake said, surprised.<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend.  I want you to be my boyfriend and don't bother telling me you're straight because I Puck told me you aren't.\" Ryder said, staring Jake down.<br>\r\n\"How did he-\"<br>\r\n\"He said it was obvious by the way you kept staring at him and Dave.\"  Ryder said, answering Jake's question.<br>\r\n\"Look, Ryder, I don't know...\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"I would be PERFECT for you, Jake.  I would help you work out and I'd stuff you with so much food you wouldn't be able to move.  I want to be boyfriend and I want to help you gain weight.\"  Ryder said, pouring his soul out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Jake, do it, you'd have your own personal feeder.\"  Sam said, cheering him on.<br>\r\n\"... Okay.  We can date.\"  Jake said, smiling at Ryder.<br>\r\n\"YES!\"  Ryder said, throwing his arms around Jake and pulling him thick, beefy body in for a hug.<br>\r\nJake hugged him back and the two pulled back, \"Sorry about interrupting like that.  What were you guys talking about?\"<br>\r\nBlaine smiled, \"We're about to head out and get some lunch!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"  Sam said, putting his hand on Blaine's gigantic gut, \"Gotta fill up my boyfriend's big, fat, sexy gut!\"  He said, giving Blaine's belly a smack, causing it to jiggle.  The buttons on Blaine's shirt gave out and all 6 popped, causing his gut to expand outward and jiggle for a bit.  <br>\r\nBlaine laughed nervously, \"Sorry about that, guys.\"<br>\r\nRyder and Jake both stared in awe at the size of Blaine's gut.  \"Don't be...\" Jake said, feeling his pants tighten in excitement.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"  Ryder said, also feeling his own erection begin growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam noticed and grinned, knowing exactly what they're thinking.  Sam reached down under Blaine's overhand and jiggled his belly before running both hands over it, \"You two like what you see?\"  Blaine was confused for a second but he quickly caught on and played along with Sam.  <br>\r\nHe rubbed his enormous gut and smiled, \"Wanna feel it?\"  Blaine asked.<br>\r\nJake and Ryder looked at each other for a second before looking back at Blaine, \"Yes.\"  They both sound out loud and and all four headed into the choir room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine sat down in one of the chairs, though his ass was big enough to fit in two, and Jake and Ryder sat on both sides of them.  The places their hands on Blaine's enormous gut and and started rubbing, squeezing, and jiggling it, which made Blaine grin.<br>\r\n\"You're really proud of your gut, aren't you, Blaine?  It's so soft and doughy.\"  Ryder said before he pressed his face against it, amazed by how soft it really was.<br>\r\n\"I sure am.  Big bulging muscles are hot but I've always thought that a massive, doughy belly was a million times hotter.  No offensive, Baby.\"  Blaine said, looking at Sam.<br>\r\n\"None taken, babe.  I have to agree, your belly is super hot.\"  As Ryder massaged Blaine's gut and continued to hide his face in the chunky mound of flesh, Jake felt Sam's hand grab his head and push it into his own belly, \"How about you give me some of that attention, Jake?\"<br>\r\nJake grinned and quickly went to work at massaging Sam's giant, spherical stomach.  He rubbed and squeezed and smacked Sam's gigantic gut which reminded him so much Puck's.  Soon Jake's hands started wondering and he found himself groping at Sam's massive biceps and pecs, which Sam happily flexed for him.<br>\r\nBlaine stood up and joined Jake in fondling Sam's massive arms and chest, and as he did so, Ryder got a chance to explore all three, eagerly reaching down having fun with three of the biggest asses he'd ever seen.  Blaine's was the widest and fattest while Sam's was the perkiest and most round, as well as the biggest of all three.  Jake's was somewhere in the middle and Ryder couldn't keep his hands off of their huge, plump, juicy behinds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stood in the middle of all of them, enjoying as he was poked, prodded, groped, and fondled.  He began doing the same to Jake and as he and Jake flexed and fondled each other's bodies, their respective boyfriends did the same to them.  After twenty minutes of non-stop groping and a few short make out sessions between the two couples, Jake, Sam, and Ryder's bellies all let out loud grouns of hunger.  All four laughed and Blaine grinned, \"We should probably get lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ryder said, \"But that was a lot of fun and the two of you are really sexy.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should do that again sometime.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sam said, \"As part of our gainer deal with Puck he uses the both of us for sex whenever he wants.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Jake said, \"This is the first I've ever heard of this.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!  Your brother has that deal with everybody he helps to get big.  If he ever tells you about somebody he's fattened up, there'sa 100% chance he's fucked them.  What I'm saying is that I'm extending that same offer the two of you.\"  Sam said with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  Blaine said, \"Just give us a time and place and we'll hook up.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you okay with that, Ryder?\"  Jake asked his new boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"I am if you are.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"Then it's a deal!\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Sweet.  FYI Blaine bottoms in out relationship but we both bottom for others.\"  Sam said, before standing up, \"So!  Let's get stuff these guts!\"  Sam said, slapping his, \"Maybe we'll even out some meat on your bones, Ryder?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe, Ryder said laughing, \"By the way, how much do you two weigh?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm 310 and Sam is 440.\"  Blaine said.<br>\r\n\"That is so hot, oh my god.\"  Ryder said before all four headed out for lunch.</span></div></div>",

I actually don't even know if I have any left that fit me right now,\" Blaine looked down. Ryder reached out and rubbed Blaine smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem, I recently got a job at the mall at a clothing store and its one of the few that actually has clothes for really big people without special ordering. Funnily enough, Jake and Puck had come in during the weekend and I got to pick some out for him. I'll make sure to find some for you once you send me measurements,\" Ryder offered, though a smirk was also there at the thought of how wide Blaine's stomach needed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was hot the way your belly burst out of your shirt like that,\" Jake said which was yet another thing he'd never thought he'd think but with the changes over the last week certainly caused changes in thinking as well. \"How did you manage to even squeeze into it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With way more effort than was worth and quite painfully,\" Blaine said. <br>\r\n\"So what's this place called?\" asked Ryder curious. <br>\r\n\"Lot-O-Noodles,\" Sam said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? That's...uncreative,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but a very accurate description and you know what it is right away. Just follow behind us,\" Sam said getting into his car with Blaine leaving Ryder and Jake. <br>\r\n\"Well, come on, I'll give you a ride,\" Ryder said when he remembered Jake rode the bus or, more recently, with his brother to school and Puck probably wasn't leaving yet. Ryder lead him to an old minivan and they both got in. \"I'm sorry the car isn't great, it's my mom's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No its fine! I like it,\" Jake said. Ryder smiled as he followed behind Sam's Camaro out of the parking lot. \"So how long have you liked me?\" asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a while now, my interest in big guys in general though wasn't made clear to me until I noticed your new size and of course Blaine and Sam.\" Ryder reached over and patted Jake's midsection. \"If I liked you before, this new size of yours has really set it on fire. I'm loving that I get to help you get bigger.\" Jake laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly appreciate that, I look forward to it. Between you and my brother I'm in good hands.\" Ryder looked guilty for a moment and Jake caught it. \"What is it Ryder?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is what?\" Ryder looked over.<br>\r\n\"That face for. You're feeling guilty about something?\"<br>\r\n\"Jake I want you to know...I slept with your brother,\" Ryder closed his eyes, waiting for Jake to explode and yell at him. Jake's temper was well known and he had seen it.<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Jake said and was quiet for a few moments. Ryder was begininning to despair and think Jake no longer liked him when Jake spoke again. \"Was it good?\" That was all.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was.\" <br>\r\n\"I wish I was there,\" Jake said wistfully. \"You guys should have told me.\" Ryder blinked. <br>\r\n\"You don't mind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not, have you met my brother? If it was anyone else I'd have been pissed but heck I'd be all over that too and Puck is Puck. I know he treats people right and works to make sure the other gets pleasure and not just him and him being with only one person is like uh...birds without song, fish that can't swim, being in the desert without water, stuff like that.\" Ryder smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very poetic and yeah, I'll make sure to tell you next time so you can watch or join in. Apparently it was a test of commitment to you and how deep my interest in big guys go or something that I passed.\" Jake nodded. It would be something his brother would do, testing potential suitors...and getting his rocks off with someone as attractive as Ryder because he had a voracious sexual appetite. The thought of Ryder and Puck together doing stuff was fascinating and Jake grew hard at the thought of Ryder being handled by the massive beast that was his brother and Ryder's ecstactic screams of pleasure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you thinking about?\" Ryder asked looking over at Jake who had a very intense concentrated look.<br>\r\n\"You and Puck,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, so good,\" Ryder lowered his voice and reached across and rubbed Jake's stomach and reached lower. \"You Puckerman folks are animals in bed. I was so sore the next day I cried but it was worth it. You won't believe what he can do.\" He rubbed Jake through his pants casuing him to gasp. \"I'm tempted to stop the car and have you now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Because we're going to fill you up,\" Ryder said pulling his hand away leaving Jake panting and disappointed. Ryder felt much the same but he controlled his features. \"Maybe if you're a good boy.\" Jake glared at him and Ryder frowned back before Jake gave up and pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he sulked. Ryder couldn't stop himself from reaching out and massaging Jake's sexy belly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, very soon. Imagine how great it will be after you're nice and stuffed.\" Ryder certainly did which is the only way he refrained from jumping Jake then. It was getting harder and harder to resist Jake, now that Jake agreed to be his. Jake thought for a moment, imagining Ryder feeding him, massaging his aching belly as he got him to eat one bite after another as Puck did. His lips curled up and he smiled. He certainly could live with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jake said. \"Afterwards.\" Ryder focused his attention back on the road and a few minutes later, Sam's Camaro pulled off to the side and stopped. Ryder followed and got out with Jake as Sam helped Blaine get up and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is it?\" Ryder asked. <br>\r\n\"Yep, let's go in.\" Ryder and Jake followed behind Sam and Blaine as they entered the building which was apparently a lot bigger on the inside than it looked on the out. Sam spoke to the hostess who was delighted to see him, affectionately feeling his muscles which he flexed for her and his big belly giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So four all you can eat?\" she asked. \"You know how it works, here's your cups get as much as you want to drink, and go grab and put whatever toppings you want to put on your pasta. You can come back as many times as you want and even get specialty pastas made which will only take a few minutes.\" She left them through, winking at Sam as they went by and Blaine rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing she likes Sam,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, Clary does, always flirts with him like I'm not here. Sam just laps up the attention.\" Blaine muttered. Sam stopped and pulled Blaine to him, nuzzling his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you no I don't like her that way Blaine. She's just really nice and one day she'll realize that I'm not into her that way and she'll stop but as for now, why not let her give attention? Besides it always makes you jealous which is a hot look on you,\" Sam said petting Blaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True I guess, we always do have incredible make-out sessions afterwards..it's just kind of mean stringing her along like that you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. But right now, I just want to eat,\" Sam said, darting for the line. Blaine and Jake quickly followed whereas Ryder got drinks for him and Jake and stopped by in the shorter dessert line already loading up the first couple plates after Jake would finish his plates of pasta. He also snacked on a few as well as he made his way back.</span></div></div>",

He watched as Blaine, Jake, and Sam waddled around the buffet, filling their massive plates with foods.  Ryder didn't understand why they even bothered filling the plates; they were so big that his three massive buddies/gainers/lovers should have just picked up the heating trays the pasta was in and taken them to the trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine arrived first and Ryder smiled, \"You sure look confident without a shirt.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if you've got it, flaunt it.  Thats what Puck always tells me!\"  Blaine said as he squeezed into the booth, his stomach rubbing against the edge of the table.<br>\r\nSam and Jake arrived at the same time and they both took seats next to their boyfriends.  Ryder smirked at the dessert Jake had with him, \"Dessert before dinner?\"<br>\r\nJake smiled, a little embarrassed, \"Yeah, well, if I wanna get bigger I got eat like this.\"<br>\r\nRyder patted Jake's belly, \"I like that idea.\"  He said before feeding Jake a bite of the ice cream sundae he had with him.<br>\r\nJake sat back and let Ryder feed him, focusing on how Ryder rubbed his belly as he took each bite.  Jake never even noticed the eating contest that Sam and Blaine had suddenly started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour went by before Ryder stopped feeding Jake, after having moved to the pasta, and Jake looked at him, confused, \"Is that all?\"<br>\r\nRyder chuckled, \"You're so cute when you're confused.\"  He said before kissing him on the cheek, \"You're just out of food, though I do admit to sneaking a few bites.\"<br>\r\nJake smiled, patting his belly, \"That's okay.  Are you gonna get me more?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  Ryder said before getting up and heading back to the buffet for more food.<br>\r\n\"Wait up!\"  Sam said, following Ryder to get more food for himself and Blaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked over at Blaine and smiled, \"This is the life, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"You said it.\"  Blaine said, rubbing his gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder made his way back, to the line, definitely happy with how things were going. Jake really was awesome and so was feeding him as he was so polite, didn't really complain, and was so gorgeously handsome they could sit and talk there for hours. Plus that gorgeous belly that was peeking out as his shirt rode up as it expanded and swelled with each bite of food drove Ryder absolutely wild. He made sure to get plenty of pasta for both of them, lathered in an alfredo sauce that was to die for. He had never tasted such good sauce before and Jake of course agreed. When he came back, Jake smiled at him, straightening up from where he had been slouching but not before Ryder caught that he had his pants button unbuttoned. Ryder sat down with a heavy plop, sliding the massive tray between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you been up to while I was away?\" Ryder asked slyly which caught the attention of Blaine and Sam who paused briefly in the midst of their binge fest to look at them.\" Jake looked briefly confused before recognizing the expression on Ryder's face before he blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what you're thinking! Not with Sam and Blaine here at the dinner table,\" Jake said gesturing over. \"My pants were just getting a little tight and I needed some breathing room.\" Ryder grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is, whatever you say.\" Sam and Blaine resumed eating and Ryder took up the fork again. \"Ready to continue?\" he asked and Jake nodded eagerly, opening his mouth as Ryder fed him. Time went as Sam and Blaine ate, Jake was fork-fed, and Ryder multi-tasking until with a loud belch that interrupted, Blaine shoved his plate aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuurrpp, you win,\" Blaine said disappointedly to Sam who looked ready to burst. \"Simply can't eat anymore.\" Sam let out a sigh of relief as he pushed the plate away hurriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicc--uuuuurrrrppp-knew it I won, told you so\" Sam said, though he did look a little green. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you eat a ton, we know that.\" Blaine sighed, drumming his fingers against his stomach. <br>\r\n\"So, what did you guys think about this place?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"Really good!\" and \"Awesome!\" Ryder and Jake said at the same time. \"This food is so good.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Blaine, Puck, and I often had feeding sessions here though of course he pretty much outeats us even as he feeds us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was laboring now, chewing slower as his eyes glazed and he slouched as he rubbed trying to ease his his complaining stomach until he at least finished the portion of pasta though as good as it was, alfredo really was a rich creamy sauce and he was getting tired. Ryder was trying to ease him along and Jake reluctantly opened for another bite to pass through. After finishing a tray assisted by Ryder (those trays were freaking huge!) and half of another as well as a rather large sundae before, he just wanted to go to sleep. Even Ryder's excellent hand touches were barely helping him stay awake and his eyes were at half mast as he waved wearily at Sam and Blaine across the table. Yawning, Jake leaned back waving his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want any more, too tired,\" he mumbled. \"Soooo full,\" he groaned as he rubbed himself. Ryder was both disappointed and pleased, disappointed as he had hoped Jake would eat more and actually finish the remainder, and pleased because Jake ate a ton and quite more than anyone expected, expecially with dessert. Jake's shirt was pushed up by the swollen ball that was his stomach and actually rested between his legs a bit which was something Ryder wasn't used to, especially when it came to Jake but he sure as heck liked it. Ryder took another forkful as he fed himself, wanting to finish the small remainder of pasta left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out there was quite a bit more than Ryder had thought left as appearances on the plate was deceptive since there was pasta buried underneath pasta underneath bubbling white sauce but he felt committed to finishing. He couldn't bear the thought of wasting food and the competitor in him wanted to prove that he can eat to so he ate bite after bite while Sam watched. Both Jake and Blaine were sort of out of it and absentmindedly rubbing their poor bloated guts, something which Ryder really wanted to and did join them on as he took bite after bit to seemingly no end in what hadn't appeared that much. Just as Ryder wanted to throw in the towel, Sam spoke encouragingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could do it!\" He said excitedly, having easily figured out what Ryder was doing earlier. \"It's almost finished!\" Ryder looked and indeed it looked like there were only a few more bites left but he thought that before and he had been eating for nigh on another twenty minutes still not reaching the end, though he didn't have the speed or stomach capacity of the guys around him and they probably could have eaten the same amount in a third or half the time at least. He shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n\"This time you really are near the end, just a few more bites,\" Sam said quickly. Ryder turned away, fighting to keep the urge to be sick down. He wasn't sure how they managed to avoid throwing up, he was feeling pretty close to it and he would't be surprised if they were as well. He didn't think he could get another bite down. Jake briefly opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it,\" he mumbled, giving a little squeeze on Ryder's hand. Ryder briefly felt energized enough to think about going for it as he did so. He with excruciating pain, ate the last remaining forkfuls and this time, they really were the last. Ryder sank to his seat in relief and victory having cleared the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I actually did;\" Sam grinned. <br>\r\n\"Yeah you did.\"<br>\r\n\"That's hot,\" Jake added, opening his eyes again. \"So cool. Can we go?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't think any of us is in condition to drive at the moment,\" Blaine said. \"Perhaps not even for getting out of this booth.\" <br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"There's a lounge area for people to wait until they sober or digest or whatever enough,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Jake said. \"I just kind of want to lay here.\" <br>\r\n\"It's only a few steps,\" Sam said carefully. \"Let's go.\" Blaine sat there and tried to get out a moment. \"What are you doing?\" Sam asked/<br>\r\n\"Trying to get out.\"<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" Sam asked worried.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm stuck,\" Blaine said laughing a little.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Guess we wait here then.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that okay?\" Ryder sked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're good.\" Jake yawned loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sleepy. Ryder, com here.\" Ryder did but found himself pulled against Jake's stomach as Jake leaned back and scratched, right below Ryfer's head. Soon Jake was out of it and Ryder almost considered moving away before Jake's arms tightened and well, it was a pretty nice resting place. Sam was causally pretending not to notice as Ryder settled against him with a sigh of pleasure. It was a wonderful pillow and soon Ryder was asleep as well. Sam was the only one somewhat conscious as apparently Blaine checked out after the whole getting stuck thing so Sam sighed. Guess he was staying there so he leaned back against the booth and closed his eyes. Soon the plates were cleared by a courteous staff who did not want to wake them and they were left there to sleep off their binge. </span></div></div>",

I didn't mean too!\" Jake shook his head, wincing a little. <br>\r\n\"Just a little knock, no biggie. See, no blood and no harm done.\" Blaine and Sam were also staring at Puck as he came up. <br>\r\n\"Was it really a surprise?\" Sam asked suspiciously. Puck tried to keep a straight face a moment before laughing.<br>\r\n\"Nope, not at all. I received a call from my friend the owner that you guys were here, eating up a storm of course. He recognized Sam and Blaine from the many times we ate here and he thought you guys might need some help getting home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I could make it back but I'm stuck here until Blaine is free to get out of the seat as he is how do I put it...wedged in between the seat and table,\" Sam explained. Puck looked over at Blaine noticing the quandry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're finally fat enough to get stuck at the table huh?\" he said running his fingers over Blaine's gut. \"You have no idea how much that turns me on right now.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's not really all that much of a mystery,\" Sam supplied helpfully and Puck rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Well whatever. That happens to me sometimes, particularly after a large meal though of course I am much bigger,\" Puck flexed his massive muscles grinnng. \"-but still that's amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"It's amazingly inconvenient,\" Blaine said.<br>\r\n\"I know how to get you out, but it's going to be messy.\" Puck plodded off to the back where they watched him talk to a heavy-set Italian man who although dwarfed in size by Puck and Sam, looked like he rivaled Dave in size, Speaking of Dave, Jake was surprised to hear Dave's voice coming in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, Puck said you'll be here.\" Dave said as he walked over as well.<br>\r\n\"It's turning into a regular party,\" Jake joked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, although it looks like you started without us,\" Dave said, looking them over. <br>\r\n\"Well, we weren't expecting you guys to show up.\" Jake said surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, neither did I until Puck told me on the way over here that he talked to Sebastian and that his friends were here. So how are you guys?\" <br>\r\nJake smacked his gut similar to how he seen Puck do it and belched. \"Overly stuffed and satisfied,\" Jake said grinning. Dave grinned back.<br>\r\n\"You sound just like a mini version of your brother there\" Dave said smirking. <br>\r\n\"Hey babe, what's up?\" Puck said coming behind Dave and wrapping his arms around him.<br>\r\n\"Just listening to your brother be like a mini-you.\"<br>\r\n\"I am not mini,\" Jake pouted and Puck smiled at that. <br>\r\n\"He's not insulting you, that's a compliment.\" Puck explained as he hugged Dave.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay then,\" Jake said blushing a little which caused Dave and Puck to laugh and Dave reached out and pulled on Jake's cheeks which made him blush more.<br>\r\n\"You guys finish lunch then?\" Puck said letting go of Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ryder said and blushed when he felt both Puck's and Dave's attention switch over to him. He definitely remembered the feel of Puck's massive hands on his body...Ryder felt himself grow hard again at the memory of Puck's awesome and mindblowing sex and how much he wanted a repeat though not with Dave there and Jake definitely would want to be a part of that action and not want him to go alone. Puck winked, and Ryder flushed again as Puck's eyes traveled up and down, smirking at the thing in his pants he was trying unsucessfully to hide though Puck seemed to have some sort of inner compass to knowing when someone was turned on anyhow. His eyes widened a bit when Puck scanned further up and he grinned as he reached out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what have we here?\" Puck mused as he rubbed his hand over Ryder's bloated belly. \"Someone enjoying themself I see?\"\" Ryder's stomach chose that moment to respond and he gave a belch of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It speakes!\" Jake said, joining in on the teasing as he rubbed Ryder as well, enjoying the solidness in Ryder's stuffed stomach. He groaned. <br>\r\n\"Quit it, that tickles!\" Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"So, did you finally join ioin on the fun?\" Puck asked Ryder. Ryder shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Nah, not quite. It's just a once in a while thing. I leave the gaining to you guys.\" <br>\r\n\"This is adorable though,\" Jake said playing with Ryder's stomach. Ryder thought briefly and shrugged. <br>\r\n\"No, but we can discuss later.\"<br>\r\n\"So, what are you guys going to do now?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"Well since we finished lunch and there is no more school for the rest of the day, I guess go home,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Cool, is Ryder coming over?\" Jake looked over and Ryder nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine, just curious. Uh, be safe, use protection, and do what I would do.\" Puck smirked. Jake and Ryder both blushed at that.<br>\r\n\"Going to help Blaine since me and Dave want to eat and my friend wants his table back.\" Puck said. He took out some goopy mayonnaise and butter. <br>\r\n\"Going to grease you now,\" he told Blaine as he rubbed it on his stomach. \"Wiggle for me will you?\" he waggled his eyebrows a little and Sam rolled his eyes. \"You push,I pull, you push to Sam...\" with the three of them, Blaine was out in no time and the slippery coat helped as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's awesome. I wish you guys invited me to come,\" Puck pouted. \"Next time you better. Well, uh me and Dave are going to have lunch so you guys can go do whatever.\" Puck shooed them away as he moved to the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess we're going to my or rather Puck's place,\" Jake said looking at Ryder. <br>\r\n\"What are you guys going to do?\" Ryder asked Sam and Blaine. <br>\r\n\"I guess go home as well,\" Sam said. \"See you guys later.\" Sam and Blaine left and after a moment, Jake and Ryder followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gave Ryder directions on where to go and it only took a few wrong turns as Jake was distracting since he kept touching him. He also remembered their earlier conversation and it could not be soon enough when they finally reached Puck and Jake's house. Unbuckling, he helped Jake out and followed him in. Once inside, Jake immediately shoved Ryder against a wall and kissed him hard and Ryder reciprocated enthusiastically. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder groaned into Jake's mouth as the taller teen held him against the wall, moaning happily as their tongues wrestled one another.  Jake pulled his hands off of Ryder's wrists and instantly went to work at removing his clothing.  Ryder did the same, their lips crashing against each other furiously as they pulled off their clothes, only separating long enough to pull their shirts off.Jake pressed his lips to Ryder's neck and sucked on the soft skin and Ryder groaned, his hands sliding down Jake's wider back before squeezing his constantly growing ass.  Jake chuckled against Ryder's neck, \"You like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck... I do.  It's so big...\"  Ryder said, giving one of Jake's enormous ass cheeks a hard smack, causing it to jiggle.  Ryder bit his lower lip as Jake lowered himself down towards his muscular chest and happily teased at his nipple with his tongue.<br>\r\n\"How about..  We take this to the bedroom?\"  Ryder said under his breath.  Jake chuckled and grabbed Ryder's waist, pulling toward the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jake, Ryder, Sam, and Blaine gone Puck and Dave could happily enjoy their buffet date together.  The waitress who was flirting with Sam came over to the tow mammoth men, \"Your table is ready!\"  She said.<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  Puck said happily, \"Lead the way!\"<br>\r\nThe woman lead Puck and Dave to the back of the buffet and into the kitchen.  The two men followed her through the busy kitchen and through another set of double doors that lead to a large room reserved only for those the owner of the buffet deemed important enough to dine in.  Very few dined in this room but the owner believed that Puck, his number one customer and Lima's go to guy for gaining, was important enough for it.  They served buffet sized portions but took away the hassle of having to walk to get it.  Puck and Dave sat their 490 and 420 pound bodies onto their steel reinforced chairs as the waitress made her way back to the front, \"Your waiter will be right with you!\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck scooted his chair forward, until his monstrous belly was pressed right up against the table, \"Heh, I guess I can't really blame Blaine for getting stuck, huh?  My guts so big I can't reach the table if it isn't pressed into it.\"<br>\r\nDave smilled and patted his own belly, \"Blaine might weigh less than me but he has a lot more body fat than I do.  It'll be another 50 pounds before I'm in your shoes, babe.\"<br>\r\n\"And by that time I'll have finally broken the 500 mark.\"  Puck said proudly, patting his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a very overweight teen walked up to the two; he stood at an even 6 feet tall and weighed somewhere around 370 and his body resembled a fatter version of Blaine's but with much bigger thighs and stronger muscles.  His button up shirt was stretched so tightly across his massive, fatty gut and huge pecs that buttons would pop if anything disturbed them.  His work pants were so stretched tight across his enormous thighs (the second biggest part of his body right after his belly) that they looked like they could tear if he wasn't careful.  He had gigantic arms and a huge double chin, as well giant traps and broad shoulders, \"Puck!  Dave!  How are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well as I live and breath, Trevor, is that you?\"  Puck asked, a grin on his face, \"Dave, you remember Trevor?  He's a wrestler back at McKinley that I beefed up last year after I fattened Blaine and Sam up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!  How are you, Trev?\"  Dave asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good!  I got a job here after you helped fatten me up, Puck, and it's been doing wonders for my waistline!  I've gone up 70 pounds since we stopped out gaining sessions.\"  Trevor said, patting his gut which hung over his waistline and work apron.<br>\r\n\"ONLY 70?  Trev, I'm disappointed.  We've haven't had a gaining session in a year and you're only up by 70 pounds?  You should have gained 160 by this time.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I admit, I've slacked off a bit.  But I'm UNSTOPPABLE in the wrestling mat.\"  Trevor said, flexing his huge arms.  The sudden movement of his arms caused all of the buttons on his shirt to pop off, revealing his gigantic, jiggling gut and strong chest.<br>\r\nPuck licked his lips and grinned, smacking the overhanging mass of fat and watching it bounce, \"You might be skinnier than you should be but you're damn sexy, I'll give you that.  Turn around for me.\"  Puck said, making a twirling motion with his finger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor did as he was told and gave the two men a wondeful view of his ginormous ass, which could barely be contained in his work pants.  \"Damn, thats a fat ass.  Though I shouldn't be surprised; wresters always have the juiciest asses.  After Dave and I stuff our guts here how about you meet me behind the building and take that ass for a ride?\"<br>\r\n\"You've got yourself a deal.\"  Trevor said, turning back around, not bother to try and cover up his gigantic belly, \"So, what'll you two boys be having?\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled up at the now half dressed wrestler, \"I'll have the Puckerman burger special.\"<br>\r\nDave smiled as well, but in a much less sexual way, \"I'll have the Puckerman fettuccine alfredo special.\"<br>\r\nTrevor scribbled it down onto his notepad before tucking it away into the pocket under his belly, \"Alright, thats 30 triple cheeseburgers, and a tray of fries for Puck and 10 pounds of fettuccine alfredo with a tray of garlic bread for Dave.  That'll be right out!\"<br>\r\nPuck watched as the massively fat wrestler waddled off to get their food, his eyes following every bounce and jiggle of the huge ass he'd so be fucking.  Once Trevor was out of sight Puck turned to Dave, \"So, what do you think we should do about our little buddies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, Sam, Ryder, and Blaine?\"  Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Puck said, leaning back in his chair and drumming his fingers on his gut, \"Personally, I think they're WAY to skinny, especially that Ryder kid.\"<br>\r\n\"Are he and Jake dating now?  I didn't get to ask.\"  Dave asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are.  It's pretty obvious.  Plus Sam texted me about it on their way here.  I need to make that boy a LOT chunkier if he's gonna be dating my baby bro.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"So how do you wanna go about it?\"  Dave asked, leaning forward.<br>\r\n\"Heres what I'm thinking.  I'll talk to Figgins to get their classes switched up so that all four of them have PE with me that way we can work on their muscles.  Then glee club lets out each day we'll have the four of them will come straight to our house where you and I will stuff them with weight gain powder laced food each and every day.  You and I will be doing the same as well, of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.  It's been a while since I got to stuff some guys silly on a daily basis.\"  Dave said.<br>\r\n\"Foods up!\"  Trevor said, still wearing his ruined shirt, as he pushed a massive cart of food to the two monster sized men.  Eagerly, both Puck and Dave grabbed their food and started shoveling it into their mouths, eating like they hadn't eaten in days (though they still managed to keep clean).<br>\r\n\"If you guys need anything just gimme a call!\"  Trevor said as he waddled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Ryder both fell back onto the bed, sweaty and with big grins on their faces, \"Wow..\"  Ryder said, \"That was... amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it?\"  Jake asked,  rolling to his side and smiling at his boy, \"I didn't think I had the energy in me to do it twice, let alone bottom AND top.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, how could I NOT top you at least once with an ass that sexy.\"  Ryder said before kissing Jake again.  As the town kissed Jake's belly let out a loud groan, \"Huh...  Guess all the fun emptied the Jake tank.\"<br>\r\n\"Jake tank?\"  Ryder said, laughing, \"You sound like your brother.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever, dude.  Get me some ice cream down stairs?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Ryder said before getting up and heading downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed by and Puck and Dave had finally finished their food.  The two of them were able to both eat two orders of their massive meals and Puck let out a strong burp as he leaned back in his chair, a grin on his face.  Puck had lifted his gut up and placed it on the table, moaning happily as he rubbed his swollen belly.  Dave had done the same and the two were both in bloated bliss when Trevor returned, \"Okay, your bill has been payed for by the manager.  He wanted thank the two of you for all of the business you bring in and all of the men you've helped to fatten up in town.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, a heroes work is never done.\"  Puck said, smacking his gut.  He reached into his shirt pocked and handed Trevor a 50, \"Heres the first part of your tip.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks!\"  Trevor said, a grin on his fat face, \"Do either of you need help to your car?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, I can handle it.\"  Dave said, lifting himself up and carrying his bloated body out, \"You two have fun.  I'll be in the car napping.\"<br>\r\n\"I could use some help.\"  Puck said, lying as he rubbed his sexy, swollen gut.<br>\r\nTrevor grinned happily as he helped lift the man of his dreams up from the table and to the large storage closet in the building, \"Promise to go a little easy on me?  It's been a while since I had you fuck me.\"<br>\r\n\"Trev, the Puck-asaurus doesn't GO easy.\"  Trevor helped Puck get into the large closet, though the door was smaller than Puck was and he did get temporarily stuck, but once inside the two went at it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour and a half later Puck and Dave returned home.  Puck had told his boyfriend all of the sexy, juicy details of his buffet sex with the enourmas high school wrestler, \"So yeah, long story short I talked to the owner afterwords and Trevor is now our official waiter.  Plus I talked Trevor into wearing a much more revealing outfit to work and both he and the owner agreed.  After all, if it weren't for me spreading the info about that place around town it'd be out of business by now.\"<br>\r\n\"And let me guess; You'll be fucking Trevor every single time we go there?\"  Dave asked, chuckling and not caring to much about his boyfriend's sexual adventures.<br>\r\n\"Of course!  I got me a beefy, chunky, wrestler boy toy now.\"  The two noticed the clothes on the floor and grinned before heading upstairs to check on Ryder and Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ryder and Jake were cuddling under the blankets, Ryder being the little spoon, and Puck quickly noticed the 5 buckets of ice cream emptied out around them.  He grinned, knowing his baby bro went to bed, and let the two sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Jake and Ryder both woke up to the sound of Jake's alarm, alerting them to get ready for school.  Jake looked at his boyfriend and smiled, \"Morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Morning.\"  Ryder replied and the two got ready for the day.  Ryder was the first to shower and Jake headed downstairs to meet up with Puck and Dave, \"Morning!\"  he said.<br>\r\n\"Morning!\"  The both replied.<br>\r\n\"So how was he?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\"  Jake said, a grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"Good!  I wouldn't want it any other way.  Before breakfast we're gonna do a family weigh in.  C'mon.\"  Puck said as he lead Jake and Dave to the large scale in the downstairs bathroom.  Jake got on first and read his numbers out loud, \"310!  Sweet, I gained 25 pounds!\"  Jake said, smacking his much bigger gut.<br>\r\n\"Not bad, dude.  My turn.\"  Dave said and got on the scale.  Jake read it for him, \"460!\"<br>\r\n\"SWEET!  40 pounds!!\"  Dave excalimed, jiggling his enormous, fat gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step aside, small fries.  Lemme show you how much a real man weighs.\"  Puck got on and Jake was blown away by the numbers, \"535!!  BRO YOU BROKE THE FIVE HUNDREDS!\"  Jake yelled, excitedly.<br>\r\nPuck flexed and showed off his massive body, \"I'm the biggest guy in this whole town!\"  Puck said, showing off his huge gut, massive chest, gigantic arms, and enormous ass and legs.  Without another word the three massive men went to the kitchen and started scarfing down everything Dave had cooked, enough food for a family for 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder walked in just as the three were a quarter of the way through their breakfast buffet, \"Whoa...\" he said, trying not to hide his boner in his jeans.  Puck pointed to the huge shake on the counter, \"Thats your breakfast, skinny boy.  Break 250 and you can eat with us.\"  Ryder, not wanting to anger such a massive man like Puck, did as he was told and did his best to drink it down.  It was so thick that by the time he finished he felt like he had just eaten a full 5 course meal and his stomach was so bloated that it resembled such.  Once Jake was equally bloated he showered and threw on whatever clothes he could fit into before heading out with Ryder to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder was so stuffed he couldn't drive so Jake did, \"You okay, babe?\"<br>\r\n\"Just.... REALLY bloated.  I don't know how you do it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not easy at first but you get used to it.  If you want to that is.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to?\" Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Than I will.  For you.\"<br>\r\nJake kissed Ryder at the stop light and the two kept going to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at school the two held hands they walked to their lockers.  On the way Jake noticed something that he never really noticed before; how fat all of the guys in school were.  Sure there were a few skinny guys here and there but Jake could easily see his older brother's work spread around the school - the majority of it being on the school's athletes.  Jake had thought Sam and Blaine were the fattest guys at school he was clearly wrong.  The two of them passed by football players in the 400s, wrestlers who weighed around 350 (the fattest one was around 370 and Jake could have sworn he saw working at the buffet yesterday), soccer players who weighed 320 pounds, even swimmers and track stars in the 280s.  Jake knew Puck had fattened all of these guys up and Jake couldn't help but love the idea of the entire male student body being huge like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryder, have you ever noticed how fat a lot of the guys at school are.\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Babe.  It's ME.  Fat guys are my THING.  OF COURSE I noticed.  A lot of them are dating one another two.  You big bro can really convert.\"  Ryder said as they reached Jake's locker where Sam and Blaine were waiting.<br>\r\n\"You guys look fatter.\"  Jake said, smiling at the two.<br>\r\n\"Sure are!\"  Blaine said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine was wearing a pastel purple polo that was only tucked in in the back with an black and white argyle sweater vest, neither of which covered up his massive belly that hung over his waistband, and a yellow bowtie.  He had on brown chinos that barely fit on his fat thighs and ass and a pair of black dress shoes with no socks, \"I'm up 35 pounds; I weigh 345!\"  Blaine said, a grin spreading on his round, fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up 45!  That puts me at 485!\"  Sam was wearing a orange and gray stripped tank top that didn't even attempt to cover up his love handles or his massive, overhanging gut.  He had on a pair of skin tight cargo shorts that looked like they'd tear off of his gigantic thighs and monstrous ass, along with a pair of flip flops.  \"What about you two?  I see somebody is on the gaining train.\"  Sam said, poking Ryder's taught gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just started so I don't have much to say.\"  Ryder said.  He was wearing a blue v neck tee he borrowed from Jake's \"skinny\" closet and the same pants he wore yesterday, along with his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at 310, gained 25 last night.\"  Jake said, patting his gut.  He had on an army green over shirt with a tight fitting white and black stripped tee and a pair of jeans over his thick thighs and some boots he borrowed from Puck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get there, little dudes.\"  Sam said, \"See you two in PE.\"  he said before heading out with Blaine.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Puck didn't tell you?  He had the four of us put in the same class.  Apparently he think we're too skinny.  See you there!\"<br>\r\nJake and Ryder were both extremely confused but decided to just go along with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon Jake and Ryder were called into Principal Figgin's office. \"Jake, Ryder, here are your adjusted class schedules. Mr. Puckerman has assured me of the utmost necessity that you be in this specific class and although he has been in trouble many times before, he has become a new man and I trust his judgment especially in the matter of the well-being and physical fitness of our students.\" Ryder raised his eyebrows at Jake in confusion and Jake shrugged while Figgins continued. \"As such your new PE class time starts next block and your lunch has moved afterwards. Most of your other classes will remain at the same time and I wish you luck. Please learn your new schedule and note that all school rules still apply even if Mr. Puckerman is teaching so no thinking of ditching or leaving while he's your teacher. Thank you and have a good day.\" With that Principal Figgin's nodded for them to go and so Jake and Ryder did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was weird,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"The physical fitness of the students? I mean, Puck does help on the muscle side but I wonder what Principal Figgins thinks about the expansion of the student body?\" mused Ryder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he even noticed. What exactly does he do anyways?\" Jake wondered. \"Or if he's in cahoots.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure what he does exactly but he'd have to be utterly delusional to not notice the changes so I do believe he is in agreement with Puck's methods.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so if Puck's teaching. Anyhow, we should get to the gym as my brother will not like us being late.\" Jake headed to the locker room with Ryder following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Jake could see the evidence of his brother's handiwork everywhere among pretty much every guy there. Jake suspected that the entire class was a compilation of various clients of Puck's and if Puck wasn't his brother, it would be kind of creepy to notice just how much the guys at McKinnley were changing. Puck must have other helpers though since no way he could have had the time for everyone, especially since he was spending most of his time with Jake and his friends at the moment. Every guy there though was definitely handpicked as there were some of the biggest guys in school there. Trevor on wrestling, Micah on hockey, Danny on football, Matt on swim (Sam was on synchronized swimming so he knew Matt though Matt did competitve), Devin on Track...it seemed like the entire school elite was in this class and following the Puckerman method which was big and beefy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, doesn't that guy look kind of familiar?\" Ryder asked Jake pointing to Trevor who was putting on his wrestling uniform. Or rather trying too, it seemed a little on the small side on his thick body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh he wrestles and we might have seem him around at the gym obviously though he is a bit bigger than I remember him being a few weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n\"No not that, wasn't he at the buffet last night?\" Ryder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I'm not really sure. It's certainly possible, especially with a gut like that.\" Jake pointed to the bulge of Trevor's skin tight uniform that seemed to be holding on with it's last legs and might at any moment explode off him. Michah walked up then and started rubbing Trevor's gut and playing with it as he pulled Trevor against him. He was one of the very few openly bisexual members of the hockey team many of whom were homophobic though the removal of the main anti-homosexual players or surprise twists with them being gay themselves (like Dave when he was still a bully) relaxed the stance and now it wasn't as nasty as it had been and McKinnley was a bit more tolerant of a school. Not much, but way better than before concerning gays and weight anyhow with the era of Puckerman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you going to put on your uniform or not?\" Ryder teased Jake who had been standing there just watching. Ryder had been too but he had managed to multi-task changing into his uniform while watching which Jake failed at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Jake said removing his shirt bringing Ryder's full focus on him. While he wasn't the biggest person in the room and actually fell more into the middle with all the school heavyweights, Jake was the most gorgeous in his opinion and it's not just because he was Ryder's sexy stud of a boyfriend (though that was another reason and Ryder totally was biased) but also with his gorgeous tannish brown skin-tone and the way his heft so naturally added to the composition of the belly and the light sexy hair trail leading down...Ryder licked his lips and Jake winked at him knowing full well the effect he had. Stretching and posing, he gave his new massive gut a few slaps and watched Ryder's eyes darken with lust which gave Jake a thrill. This would never have happened when he was small and skinny (well he wasn't skinny, he had decent muscle tone but definitely skinny as to now) and Jake didn't miss his six pack abs at all. It'd actually be pretty downright weird if everyone else was getting bigger but he had been ahead of the curve, no matter if it was forced at the start. Jake made a mental note to thank his brother again after class. Bending a bit, Jake pulled his pants down leaving him in just boxers and totally giving Ryder a show. There were some other guys watching with hungry looks. Jake didn't mind that but he had to make it clear who his love was so he pulled Ryder against him in a show of dominance that definitely made clear though he suspected that only turned on some others more. He never realized how erotic a locker room setting was and he wanted Ryder bad but then the whistle blew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck came striding in, his lips curling into a grin at Ryder and Jake's position before his face turned serious and he looked out at everyone. \"Everyone out in 5 minutes. I'm your new teacher Coach Puckerman for this class of some of the biggest people in McKinnley. Many of you know me in other association but here I am your master and you will follow every command without complaint, you got that?\" No one dared say anything even if they did disagree because no one would ever be foolish enough to disagree with Puck head on and Ryder suspected that for other things they were already doing all that and it would just be a continuation at school for most of them. Jake felt the same and a few like Trevor, Danny, and Michah felt it as well with the agreeable and interested motions they nodded along with. Puck left then but not without \"accidentally\" slapping Jake's ass and telling him to get dressed but he definitely had a leer in his eye as he looked between Jake and Ryder that said he knew what they were up to. Jake let go of Ryder briefly as he pulled up his gym pants on and his gym tank rode up and stayed more than half up, having been fitted for when Jake was in the 230 range, not the more recent 300+. Ryder grinned and rubbed Jakes gut, in awe of its thick heavy weight and how it felt so smooth yet hard. Jake blushed but enjoyed the feel of Ryder's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot to ask my brother for better fitting PE clothes as well but I didn't realize my PE time was going to switch to today so I didn't even think about it.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Ryder said. \"It certainly is a view.\" He rubbed it again, \"God Jake you're so thick and sexy..\" he was beginning to pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay time to go,\" Puck said coming in interrupting. Jake groaned because Puck of all people just cock-blocked him and Puck just smirked as he clapped his hands. \"Move it people, time's a-wasting. We're going to partner you guys up and get you started on your sets of your own personalized training schedules for what you need.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Everybody into the weight room,\"  Puck said to his students, \"I have a few things to gather up first.\"  The class watched as Coach Puckerman waddled off to his office before they all made their way to the weight room.  Once inside Jake got the chance to look around at his fellow new classmates; he recognized almost all of them even if he didn't hang out with them outside of classes, or in one guy's case, football practice.  <br>\r\nJake's eyes scanned the room and he listed everybody off in his head so that he wouldn't get names wrong: Micah from the hockey team, a massive beast of a teen standing at 6'5\" with gigantic, ripped muscles all over, was sitting on a bench press with his boyfriend, Trevor.  Micah was wearing the same PE uniform Jake had on but it didn't even attempt to cover his huge muscle gut nor his huge thighs (but Jake could tell his shirt was close to tearing just from the sheer size of Micah's humongous pecs) and Jake could tell that Trevor's wrestling singlet was close to exploding off of his huge, beefy, fat body.  <br>\r\nMicah was jiggling and playing with his boyfriend's huge, fat gut while Trevor rubbed Micah's taught, thick, muscle gut.  \"You know,\" Jake whispered to Ryder, \"Micah might be kind of a jerk but he and Trevor do make an adorably sexy couple.  They both seem to really love each others bellies.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Ryder whispered back, \"I mean just look at their sexy guts.  Trevor's is all soft and doughy while Micah's a perfect muscular sphere.  How could they not want to play with them all the time.  I wonder why Trevor is in that singlet while we're all in PE uniforms though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged and continued to look around the room.  He saw Blaine and Sam talking to Matt and Tyrone.  Neither Blaine not Sam's PE shirts fit over their enormous, flabby bellies and Tyrone and Matt were happily rubbing and playing with Sam and Blaine's fat guts.  Sam and Matt were buds and both were on swim teams, Sam being on synchronized and Matt on competitive) so they were pretty friendly with one another.  Matt was fairly short compared to the enormous men in the room, he was only 5'8\", but the kid was ripped.  Puck had focused more on his muscle training than he did on his weight gaining, though that didn't mean Matt got away from that either - he had a thick, beefy muscle gut, though not as big as Micah's or his boyfriend's, and unlike most of the men in the room, Matt's PE shirt was able to cover half of his belly.  Jake's eyes traveled from the ripped, muscle gutted swimmer to his monster of a boyfriend, Tyrone.  <br>\r\nTyrone was a member of the basketball team, 6'6\", and had a much darker complexion than Jake's.  His body was ripped and massive, similar to Micah's, but Tyrone had much bigger biceps than Micah did.  Jake also noticed that Tyrone had a massive, thick muscle gut and a huge ass.<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of Tyrone and Matt?\"  Jake whispered to Ryder.<br>\r\n\"I think they're both pretty sexy but Matt could defiantly use more weight on him.  That tight muscle gut he has is hot but it would be a lot hotter if it were much bigger.\"  Ryder whispered back.<br>\r\n\"Who do you think has a bigger muscle gut, Micah or Tyrone?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\nRyder thought for a second then whispered, \"Micah, obviously.  He looks like he has at least 30 pounds on Tyrone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked past Sam, Blaine, Matt, and Tyrone over to the two smallest guys in the room, not including Ryder: boyfriends Ricky and Devin.  The two were chatting and leaning against the wall, Devin's arm around his shorter boyfriend's shoulders.  Devin was an even 6 feet tall and a was one of the fastest members of the track team, even despite his added weight.  Devin had defined, thick arms and a defined chest but they weren't massive and his belly resembled that of a beer belly; hairy, perfectly round but soft and he looked like he was always bloated and full.  What his upper body lacked in size his lower body made up for.  Devin's thighs were the biggest part of his body and his legs were extremely thick and muscular.  Jake couldn't tell from here but he knew Devin a massive ass to go along with his massive thighs and powerful calves.  Devin's PE uniform covered half of his belly but his giant thighs and ass turned his shorts into short-shorts.<br>\r\nDevin's shorter boyfriend, Ricky, was mexican and a member of the school's tennis team.  He was the shortest guy in the room, standing at 5'5\", but he clearly heavier than his boyfriend.  He had thick, muscular arms and legs but they weren't massive, which worked for him because of his tennis matches, and he had a similar belly to Devin's only a bit bigger: perfectly round and pudgy and he looked stuffed 24/7.  Ricky's uniform fit much like Devin's around his stomach but his shorts weren't as hiked up.<br>\r\nJake was about to whisper to Ryder about Ricky and Devin when he felt a massive hand on his shoulder, \"Sup, Jake, Ryder.\"  A deep voice said.  Jake and Ryder both turned around to see McKinley High's newest football giant, Danny.  Danny was a linebacker on the team, stood at 6'3\", and was the most muscular guys in school.  His PE shirt was stretched so tightly across his giant pecs, the biggest in the school, that Jake could see a small tear had already formed from how stretched out the fabric was.  Danny's enourmas gut was on full display and was only a few inches away from Jake.  Danny had the second most massive muscle gut in school, Sam's being much bigger and fatter, but Jake could tell Danny was determined to have the biggest muscle gut on campus because the usually massive, tight sphere was start to droop over his waistline and Jake could see some new fat rolls had formed and his love handles were much bigger than before.  Danny's thighs were also massive, much bigger than Trevor's tree trunk wrestler thighs, and Jake knew he had a huge, juicy ass.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Danny!  You're looking huge - Even bigger than normal!  Have you been fattening up?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure have.\"  Danny said, patting his gut and Jake noticed a slight jiggle that wasn't there before, \"Can't let Sam being the biggest student on campus, can I?  Plus I got my two boys here helping me.  Jake, you know Nick and Zach - my boyfriends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's eyes shot between the two humongous twins Danny was dating who were standing on either side of him: Nick and Zach were identical japanese twins who were both 5'9\" but thats where the identical part stopped.  Nick was a member of the baseball team and his body was very top heavy: huge, massively muscular arms (though not as big as Danny's, Micah's, or Tyrone's), big, beefy pecs, and a huge, doughy belly that hung over his waistband.  He had thick thighs and a beefy, chunky ass.<br>\r\nZach, on the hand, was bottom heavy: his belly was gigantic and doughy like his brothers but it didn't hang over his waistband.  Zach also had thick arms and nice, strong pecs.  His legs, on the other hand, were gigantic - Zach had massive, powerful thighs (though not as big as Trevor's) and he had a monster sized ass that rivaled Sam's.  Nick's shirt fit over only the top of his belly while Zach's covered half of his but Zach's shorts were extremely small on him.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!  How are you guys?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"We're doing pretty good!\"  Zach said, \"Nick and I just hit 348!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\"  Nick said, smacking his enormous gut causing it to jiggle and wobble.<br>\r\n\"Nice!\"  Ryder said, \"What about you Danny?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm 390.  I've still got a ways to go before I catch up to Sam's 440.\"  Danny said, happily.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, actually Sam just put on 45 pounds.  He's at 485 now.\"  Ryder corrected.<br>\r\n\"What?!  Aww, no way!\"  Danny said, upset.<br>\r\n\"No worries, babe, we'll get you there.\"  Nick said, patting his shared boyfriend's gut.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I gotta ask.  Do you guys know why Trevor is in his wrestling singlet instead of the PE uniform?\"  Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"Apparently Trev is getting too big for his singlet and Figgins won't order a new one for him until he officially can't fit in that one anymore.  Personally I'm excited to see Trevor's thick, fat bod explode out of that suit.\"<br>\r\n\"I think we all are.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Puck entered the room and all attention was on him: he had on a red McKinley Phys. Ed hat and gray t shirt that didn't even try and cover the biggest gut in the room.  He also wore red PE shorts that looked more like short-shorts on his gigantic thighs and massive, jiggling ass, as well as knee high socks and a pair of sneakers.  Puck was pushing a large steel cart into the room with 13 milk jugs that he had filled with his famous weight gain shakes, \"Okay, everybody line up!\"  Puck called out.  His students did as they were told and all got in line in front of the cart, Trevor at the very front. <br>\r\nPuck passed out the cartons as he spoke, \"Your first assignment is to drink every last drop of these weight gain shakes.  They'll help fatten you up and put some meat on your bones, ya bunch of sticks.  If any of you can't finish then whatever is left goes to...\"  Puck thought for a second, looking through his students, \"hmmm.... Trevor.  Whatever you can't finish goes to Trevor, since he needs to burst out of that singlet soon, but I expect at the very least half of it gone.  Especially from you three,\" Puck said, pointing at Ryder, Ricky, and Devin, \"You three are the skinniest.  Now CHUG!\"  Puck blew on his whistle and each student went to work swallowing down the 1 gallon cartons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, Sam, Blaine, Trevor, Micah, Danny, Nick, and Tyrone all drained their cartons with no problem but Ryder, Ricky, Devin, Matt, and Zach only finished around half.<br>\r\n\"Pathetic.  You five need a lot of work.  Trevor, get your fat ass over her and drain these!\"  Puck yelled at the obese and muscular wrestler.<br>\r\n\"Yes, coach!\" Trevor said as he quickly waddled over, his fat, overhanging belly jiggling in his singlet.  He reached Ryder first and started drinking down the shakes.<br>\r\n\"Once he finishes we'll start your personalized workout routines.  Two groups of four and one group of 5.\"  Puck said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They all watched Trevor as he gulped down the shake, large swallows going down his throat into his massive overly stuffed belly and they were betting on whether he could burst in or out of his wrestling uniform which was definitely looking strained on his thick body. Those who were sure Trevor could make it included Micah, Sam, Ryder, Danny, Blaine while those who were betting against were Devin, Ricky, Zach, Nick, Tyrone, Matt, Jake with Puck abstaining since he wasn't sure  since it seemed to be able to go either way. The guys all put money in the pot and they waited to see which would happen or if Trevor would even finish all the shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Trevor, you can do it!\" cheered Micah as Trevor polished off Ryder's left over amount and moved onto Ricky's. <br>\r\n\"He's going to explode long before his singlet does,\" Nick said shrugging his  shoulders. \"There's no way he can drink all that Puck's shake, especially after having his own.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do believe he will,\" Zach said rubbing his gut and wincing. Danny grinned and moved over to sit between Nick and Zach. <br>\r\n\"I think he can, look at him go,\" he said rubbing Zach's gut helpfully. \"He's definitely used to being fed by Puck.\" <br>\r\n\"He's pretty big already and those shakes are filling. No way can he fit in an additional 2.5 plus his own of Puck's shakes. Maybe if it was normal but its not.\" Devin said skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think he can?\" Jake asked Ryder when he saw that Ryder had joined the Trevor can finish and burst his clothes side. <br>\r\n\"He's massive and drinking those shakes like a pro. Look, he's already finished half number two and has three more to go.\" Ryder explained. It was true and Trevor had thrust aside the second jug, his massive gut jiggling and straining out over the singlet that Ryder was sure that'd explode shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it hasn't exploded yet, then there's no way it is going to today,\" said Devin. \"Good lord it already looks painfully uncomfortable and painted on that should have broken long ago. What is it made out of because that is impressive staying power?\" Trevor looked like he was struggling to breathe with the singlet on but the bet was he would wear it until it exploded off and taking it off would be forfeiting and there was no way he was going to forfeit with an audience and disappoint everyone, especially Micah who was convinced that Trevor would. Trevor took a gasp and let out a massive belch that went on for some time before beginning the third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too late to change bet?\" wondered Ricky as they watched Trevor get a second wind after his release and was chugging down again. <br>\r\n\"No,\" Puck said. He wasn't playing but he had written down everyone who was and what they thought would be the outcome would be and no one was allowed to change their vote once it started. They watched with baited breath as Trevor finished a third and forth remaining jug. The uniform looked hilariously outmatched against Trevor's girth but was still somehow holding together which was ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is a nail-biter\"Jake mumbled and a number of them nodded in agreement. Micah was cheering loudly with every gulp of liquid into Trevor's massive overstuffed stomach that strained the confounds of his uniform more and more and just when it seemed inevitable that the uniform had to break, Trevor stopped as there was no more shake left. Shaking his head in confusion, he looked down to see his way too old and small wrestling uniform still heroically clinging to his massive body. It couldn't contain it at all and his belly was really sagging over and his body was straining it but still somehow it held. With a scream of disgust, Trevor headed back to his seat where Micah was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on Earth, I though it'd finally break,\" Trevor mumbled in between another series of massive belches that rocked his frame. He felt tired  and incredibly stuffed and there was no way he was going to be able to lift that day as he was too tired. Micah patted him worriedly as he called Puck over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck, I don't think Trevor can continue today. Can he sit out of the lesson for the rest of the day?\" Micah asked worriedly. <br>\r\n\"Sure...I guess so...,he'll just have to make up his lifts later,\" Puck said and Micah nodded in relief.<br>\r\n\"Pay up,\" Tyrone said and Sam, Ryder, Blaine, Micah, and Danny reluctantly pulled out twenties that were divided among those who had bet that Trevor wouldn't have finished or failed to break his uniform. Puck looked around, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay gentlemen, now that that business is out of the way, let's get to our lifting groups which will be Ryder, Jake, Trevor, and Micah in one group; Devin, Sam, Danny, Zach, Nick, in group two, and Ricky, Blaine, Tyrone, Matt, in group three. You will work with these groups for a while to do your assigned exercises which I have written down here and will hand out randomly. Will one group member from each group come and get a paper?\" Jake, Danny, and Tyrone got up for their groups and got their paper. When he got back, Jake looked at it and nodded. \"Okay, today we'll be doing chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trevor won't be doing anything.\" Micah declared folding his arms across his massive chest.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jake said. \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n\"Also, stop fucking with Trevor,\" Micah growled, tensing his muscles making him look even more massive and intimating.<br>\r\n\"Uh...what?\" Jake asked confused. \"I didn't even do anything.\"<br>\r\n\"You're a Puckerman aren't you? Related to Puck?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, but I'm actually only-\"<br>\r\n\"I can tolerate Puck having him. He has really helped a lot and even I'm petit next to him which is a weird feeling as I've always been humongous to everyone. I can't argue with him. However, I will not have you having him either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still don't know what you're talking about,\" Jake looked at Micah confused. <br>\r\n\"You shall not touch him or I will rearrange your face and internal organs even if you are related to Master Puck.\" Having said his piece, Micah leaned back and aggressively started lifting an incredibly heavy bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jake muttered absolutely confused and Ryder shook his head confused as well as they watched Michah whoop past his own record. <br>\r\n\"I don't even know dude, ask him.\" <br>\r\n\"No you ask him,\" Jake cajoled.<br>\r\n\"No, you.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine.\" Jake muttered. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everybody had been assigned their workout regimen for the day - group one on chests, group two on arms, group three on legs - class went fairly smoothly for every one.  People laughed, talked, and joked about, all under Puck's supervision, with the exception of one.  Trevor was lying down on a bench press in the corner of the room, both of his huge hands resting on his insanely gigantic and completely stuffed gut.  Trevor groaned as he both felt and heard his stomach working to digest the 3.5 liters of weight gain shake he had ingested in an attempt to finally outgrow his skin tight wrestling uniform, which now clung to his massive swollen gut and huge muscles.  Trevor moaned and was rubbing his stuffed belly when a shadow eclipsed his face.  The brunette teen opened his eyes and saw the shadow was created by his teacher's monster sized gut, \"How ya holdin' up, champ?\"  Coach Puckerman asked, \"Need me to give you a good old Puckerman belly rub?\"<br>\r\nTrevor gave a low chuckle before sitting up, his swollen, shake filled gut resting on his gigantic thighs, \"Thanks but no thanks, Coach - your belly rubs always end up getting a little to intimate and we are at school.  Besides, I'm not sick from it; just REALLY full.\"  Trevor said, letting out a small burp.<br>\r\nPuck chuckled and patted Trevor's swollen, overhanging gut, \"You always were a massive eater - even before I beefed you up into the beast you are today.  If you wanna lay down I have a couch in my office.\"<br>\r\n\"That would be awesome, Coach.  Thanks.\"  Trevor said, starting to get up.  Puck started to help him when Micah's enormous arms lifted Trevor onto his feet,<br>\r\n \"<i>I'll</i> take it from here, Coach,\"  Micah said, \"I finished up my first round of bench press reps so I can afford a short break.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Sure thing.  My door is unlocked.\"  Puck said before waddling off to check on his other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah slowly helped his boyfriend into Puck's office and lied him on the couch.  Trevor smiled up at his handsome boyfriend, \"Thanks, babe.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it,\"  Micah said, lovingly running his large, strong hands over Trevor's swollen gut, \"How you feeling?\"<br>\r\n\"Stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey and ready for a nap.\"  Trevor said with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Babe, thats you ever night.  You can't sleep unless you have at least a two course meal in your tank.\"  Micah said sweetly.<br>\r\n\"I know but I'm never this stuffed at school.\"  Trevor said, patting his gut, \"Not like I had a choice.  Puck asked me to and I still need to outgrow this uniform.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you <i>did</i> just drink three and a half gallons of weight gain shake.  You're gonna gonna get so fat that theres no way this singlet will ever fit you again.\"  Micah said, encouragingly.<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"  Trevor said, hopefully.<br>\r\n\"I know so.\"  Micah said before leaning down and kissing his boyfriend.  The two kissed sweetly for a few moments before Micah pulled back and kissed Trevor's swollen gut, still trapped behind a now very thin layer of wrestling uniform, \"Get some rest, okay, babe?  Once school is out and your stomach is back on empty we'll go to my place for some movies.  We'll even hit up that fried chicken place you love and grab a few buckets.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Micah.  You always know how to spoil me.\"  Trevor said as he watched his boyfriend stand up and head for the door, \"Oh, babe?  One more thing; lighten up with Jake, will ya?  He didn't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, Trev, but he's a Puckerman.  I just KNOW he'll try and get into your pants.\"  Micah said.<br>\r\n\"And if he does try I can handle it and tell him no.  Puck's case is different, baby, you know that.\"  Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"You're right...  I'll try.  See you after class.\"  Micah said before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Micah was back in the weight room with the rest of the guys.  He walked over to Jake, who was spotting Ryder on the bench press, and crossed his arms over his insanely huge chest, resting them on his monstrously huge muscle gut, \"Hey, Jake.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"  Jake asked, a slight irritated sound in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Look...  Trevor talked to me and I realize I shouldn't have been so harsh on you.  Sorry.\"  Micah said, sounding equally annoyed by this conversation as well.<br>\r\n\"What was that even about, anyway?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Your brother is fucking my boyfriend and I'm not happy about it and since you're related to him I'm telling you in advance.  Stay out of his pants or I'll snap you in half.\"  Micah said.<br>\r\n\"I'm dating Ryder.\"  Jake said, glaring at him.<br>\r\n\"And Puck is dating Dave Karofsky but that isn't stopping him.  You might never do it but keep it in the back of your mind.\"  Micah said, slamming his fist into his open palm before walking away to use a free bench press.<br>\r\n\"Ugh... What an ass.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Seriously.\"  Ryder replied, finishing his 50 reps, \"You're up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on one side of the room, Sam, Danny, Nick, Zach, and Devin were all at the wall of dumbbells, each lifting a different set of weights.  Sam and Danny were both using the huge 75 pound weights while Devin, Nick and Zach used the 50 pounders.  Sam set the 100 pound weights down and turned to the mirror wall, lifting both arms and happily flexing them, \"Awww, yeah, thats it!  I just can't stop growing!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Danny said, not stopping, \"No matter how big I get I just can't seem to catch up to you.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean catch up to me?\" Sam asked,  \"You're muscles are WAY bigger than mine!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, my muscles are bigger than everybody's, except Puck's.  I'm talking about weight, bro.  You've got almost 100 pounds on me.\"  Danny said, \"I've even changed my diet so I could start packing on some fat to this big gut of mine.  I'm already the most muscular guy on the football team but I wanna be the fattest too!\"<br>\r\nSam raised his eyebrow and a smirk spread across his plump lips, \"Oh really?\"  Sam had Danny set the weights down before giving his huge gut a nice smack.  Sam watched it jiggle a tiny bit before grinning, \"Yeah, you've definitely started packing on the fat.  Took you long enough.  Though I doubt you'll be able to catch up to this!\"  Sam said, patting his huge gut.<br>\r\nDanny chuckled and put both of his huge hands beneath Sam's gut, giving it a few good natured shakes, \"Heh, we'll see about that!  Man, this a lot heavier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n\"Course it is!  I got muscle under there, too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other guys worked out and watched the two play with their bellies Sam and Danny started to trade tips on how they work out and what they eat to gain.  Meanwhile, Blaine was with his group - Tyrone, Ricky, and Matt, and they were busy with leg squats.  Tyrone was spotting Blaine as he worked, while Ricky did the same to Matt.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, dude, you just don't seem like the athletic type.\" Tyrone said.<br>\r\n\"I'm... not...\"  Blaine said, setting the weights off his shoulders and standing up, \"But I do it to keep myself strong.  I wanna keep gaining but I need the muscle to carry it.  I don't wanna get weak.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not be Puck's TA?  You can still exercise with us.\"  Ricky said as he counted Matt's squats.<br>\r\n\"Thats actually a great idea, Ricky.\"  Puck said, walking over, \"How about it Blaine?  You can keep working out with these guys, plus with your girth, I could always put you in charge of the feeding portion of the class.  You can design meals that are high in protein and will help them bulk.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I like that.  You've got a deal.\"  Blaine said and the two shook on it.<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\"  Puck said before letting the guys bet back to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Class was soon over and they all filed out with the exception of Micah who stopped in Puck's office where Trevor was waiting. <br>\r\n\"Hey, you feeling any better?\" Micah asked Trevor who had been laying down on the couch. With a start, Trevor bounced up confused.<br>\r\n\"Huh whazzat?\" he asked sleepily causing Micah's mouth to twitch with a smile. <br>\r\n\"I asked if you were feeling any better after that little adventure,\" he said shrugging.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, loads,\" Trevor said letting out a huge yawn. \"Man that nap was good but I could really go for another one.\"<br>\r\n\"Class is over,\" Micah said. \"We better go get changed for the remainder of the day.\" <br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Trevor said getting up, his huge belly jiggling. <br>\r\n\"I think you've gotten bigger,\" Micah said as he rubbed his hands over his boyfriend's stomach.<br>\r\n\"I feel like I've gotten bigger with all that drink so I should hope so.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll break out of it soon, god it barely fits you now as it is. You were so close today.\"<br>\r\n\"Too bad it didn't. That would have been awesome. Oh well,\" Trevor sighed as he followed Micah out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still a few minutes left before the final bell for the next class so when they got into the locker room, they talked.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Danny announced. \"I was thinking since its a new class and all and we're all, or at least most of us, sports players and definitely all of Puck's projects that we could have a little get together at my place since we're going to be seeing each other a lot so we might as well be friends right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds cool,\" Jake grinned to where Danny was standing shirtless, his eyes on Danny's massive gut. \"I'd love that, right Ryder?\" <br>\r\n\"Hell yeah I would,\" said Ryder, looking at all the massive and big men around the room. He could use a little eye candy, he'd be with Jake, and he'd love to get to know these new people since he didn't know any of them except Danny except by reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're busy-\" Micah said at the same time as Trevor said \"Sure! Count us in!\" Giving an eye roll Micah crossed his arms again which was a familiar pose to see him in. \"Oh alright, we're coming too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky and Devin looked at each other and shrugged. \"Sure.\" Matt and Tyrone agreed as well and Nick and Zach were already going to be there so they were a given. Danny smiled widely at everyone. \"Thanks guys! This is going to be so much fun I can't wait! Oh and make sure to bring your swimsuits cause there is a pool to go swimming in if you want or games inside, I got the newest big screen television, and foosball, and snacks and prizes so yay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get many visitors do you?\" Micah muttered and Danny glared at him a moment before smiling again. \"This is my address and I was thinking 4:00 if that's okay with everyone?\" It was and it was settled so they continued getting dressed and discussing amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pool sounds like fun,\" Matt said as he pulled on a t-shirt then wrapped around his incredibly tall boyfriend. \"I could model that new swimsuit for you,\" he said grinning as Tyrone's face colored even darker for a second before he pulled up Matt and was kissing him. They were suddenly pulled apart by Puck who had an apologetic expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt, truly I am cause that was super hot,\" Puck grinned a moment before resuming, \"but I am obligated to make sure you all get to class on time and it doesn't look like you'd have gone anywhere for a while. Save it for later...when I can watch,\" Puck gave a lascivious wink before checking the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned to Ryder. \"So that was fun huh?\" Jake said, running his hands over Ryder's stomach. \"I like this here,\" Jake rubbed Ryder's somewhat bloated stomach. \"All expanded and full and you know what I mean.\" Ryder's breath shortened as Jake fumbled at Ryder's pants. \"God Ryder you're so hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I have to interrupt again? Being a teacher during school hours sucks,\" Puck's voice interrupted from behind them. \"I'm really sorry but can it wait till you guys are off of school property so I'm not lawfully obligated to prevent some sexy fun times from activating? Maybe if you had time but you guys have two minutes to get to class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? You never went to class,\" Jake argued. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is a wonder that they let me work here. Then again, Figgins and Beiste know I have a special way of teaching people. So, action later, school now.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you going to that party at Danny's house?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"You know it! I love to party and well what can I say, hanging out with some of my favorite people and people I get to help. Need a ride?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, going with Ryder.\"<br>\r\n\"Kay, see you later then. You too Ryder\" Puck left then and Ryder laughed. Jake looked at him confused.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"You know, you're brother just interrupted us and told us to get to class.\"<br>\r\n\"And?\" Jake asked. Ryder continued laughing but slowed down and stopped when Jake was just looking at him.<br>\r\n\"Cause you know he...aw never mind. Let's just go.\" Shaking his head still confused, Jake followed Ryder into their last period of the day before Glee and a party. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glee club came and went, as it seemed to do most days now, and Ryder had pulled his car into Puck's driveway.  He set the gearshift into park and smiled at Jake, who was in the passenger seat, \"So, I'll pick you up in an hour?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\"  Jake said, \"I just gotta shower and chance for the party.  You gonna go swimming?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll look handsome in your swim trunks.\"  Jake said before leaning over and kissing Ryder, \"See you soon.\"<br>\r\n\"See ya'.\"  Ryder said, stealing one last kiss before Jake got out and headed inside.  When Jake entered the house he was surprised by how quiet it was.  Usually at this time Dave had just finished cooking and they would all sit down to gorge on the massive meals Dave made regularly.  Jake checked the kitchen and he was honestly surprised by what he saw - the kitchen table was litered with the enormous plates and containers Dave used for cooking.  Jake walked over and scratched his head before a nore on the kitchen counter caught his eye.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Jake, Puck told me you were going to a party with him but I decided to stay home - not really my thing.  I had already cooked dinner when he told me so I ate everything I made and went to bed.  Talk to you tomorrow,<br>\r\n                                                            - Dave</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, he ate ALL OF IT?\"  Jake said, shocked.  He looked at the table and was honestly amazed that Dave could do something like that but once he saw the 4 milk jugs of gainer shake Jake realized that the hunger brought on by those, different from the ones Puck had them drink earlier, made Dave hungrier the more he ate.  Jake snuck up stairs and peeked into the shared bedroom of Dave and Puck and saw Dave passed out on the bed, his stomach massively swollen and taking up most of the other half of the bed.  It was huge and tightly pack and Jake thought it was sexy as hell.<br>\r\n\"He must have eaten at least 45 pounds of food.  He's gonna gain a LOT of weight.\"  Jake muttered to himself before quietly shutting the door and heading to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake quickly stripped down to nothing and looked over his constantly growing body: his pecs were much bigger from the workout this morning and Jake could tell he had put on 10 pounds easily from the gainer shake he drank.  He ran his hands over his huge belly, slipping his hand under the overhang and jiggling it a bit, before turning to see his ass which was much plumper now.  He gave it a slight smack and grinner, \"Ryder will have fun with this later.\"  he said before getting in the shower.  Ryder's car pulled up just in time as Jake finished getting his swim trunks on, blue with black palm trees, that clung tightly to his ass, and hurried to the car with no shirt.<br>\r\n\"Hey, sexy.\"  Ryder said, patting Jake's growing belly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, yourself.\"  Jake said, squeezing the little belly Ryder was now sporting.<br>\r\n\"God, you are so hot.  I don't know how I'll be able to keep my hands off you.\"  Ryder said honestly.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, with all the guys at the party?  You won't need to because everybody will be fucking at some point.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"True.\"  Ryder said, \"You're just getting so big and hot.\"<br>\r\n\"Not as big as Puck.\"  Jake admitted, rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n\"No, but someday you will be.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Jake admitted and the two were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's house was actually fairly close and neither boy was surprised that the massive linebacker lived in a huge mansion.  They parked the car behind Trevor's, which had a bumper sticker advertising the buffet he worked at, and the two headed up the long hallway to Danny's door. After a few rings Danny's massive form opened the two double doors and grinned happily, \"Jake, Ryder!  So glad you could make it!  Everybody is in the back stuffing their faces!  Let's hurry before Sam and Blaine eat it all.\"  Danny said as he lead the two boys to the backyard.  <br>\r\nAs they walked Jake couldn't help but look over Danny's massive, wide back that was covered in ripped muscles.  His eyes traveled down the broad back to the small rolls and thick love handles Danny had developed from gaining more fat in order to be bigger than Sam, which Jake thought was super hot, but what really turned Jake on was Danny's glorious ass: perfectly round, insanely huge, and it jiggled and bounced with every step Danny took and his skin tight black swim trunks didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of then reached the backyard where Jake saw Danny's massive pool as well as 4 long tables covered in insane amounts of food, \"Dude, there is no way we can eat all that, even as a group.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"I know.\"  Danny admitted, \"Thats why Puck will - when he gets here that is.  Enjoy yourselves!\"  Danny said as he walked over to the hot tub where Nick and Zach were waiting with huge platters of 30 burgers each, ready to stuff Danny and help their boyfriend get fatter.<br>\r\n\"Dude, is it just me, or is Danny REALLY fuckable?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"You just read my mind.  I couldn't stop staring at his ass.  I could pound that huge thing for hours.\"  Ryder whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked past the twins and Danny to see Trevor and Micah who were also eating at the right of the pool.  Trevor was laying on a pool chair with a massive tray of 30 hotdogs resting on his fat gut, which Jake could tell was much bigger, and he had one hot dog in each hand scarfing them down quickly so he could get more.  Micah was also eating but not nearly as much as Trevor and the two shared a bag of chips and three 2 liters of soda.  Trevor was in a \"4 sizes too small for his body\" speedo that made his huge belly and giant love handles look ever bigger while Micah was in a pair of military green trunks that clung to his thighs nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked over towards the pool where he saw Ricky and Devin, both with tons of food but nowhere near the amount Trevor was eating, happily munching away on burgers and fries.  Both of the smaller boys had clearly put on some weight from the gainer shakes, but since they hadn't finished them, it wasn't much.  Both were wearing tight swim trunks in red and white respectively.  \"Puck really needs to fatten those two up...\"  Jake muttered to himself.  He looked a little bit more to the left and saw Tyrone with Matt, who was still in the water.  <br>\r\nTyrone was standing and waiting for Matt to get out, his sexy black bod barely contained in his skin tight yellow speedo, which made his gut and bulge look huge, as well as his thighs.  Matt got out and he was wearing a super tight baby blue speedo that Tyrone had bought him and made his ass look wonderful, but nowhere near the size of Danny's, Trevor's, Sam's, or Puck's.  His gut also looked much bigger and beefier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake finally looked over at the table where the caters were setting out food, and to nobodies surprise, both Sam and Blaine were sitting there eating everything in sight.  Sam and Blaine's guts were both much bigger than normal and it was clear to Jake that they were having one of their \"couples eating contests\".  Both of their huge guts were covering their laps and swelling thicker and thicker with each bite they took.  Sam was in his school issues speedo, which looked like it would snap at any second, while Blaine had on a tank top that didn't even try fitting and a pair of skin tight swim trunks.<br>\r\n\"They arrived first.\"  Danny said, swallowing down his eight burger, \"and they've been eating ever since.  No worries though - the caters will keep cooking so no matter how much they eat there will be more.\"  Danny said before swallowing half of a triple cheeseburger in one bite that Zach fed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder watched Sam and Blaine eat before looking at Jake \"Hey, Jake, do you wanna-\"</span></div></div>",

We could do the pool later but right now I kind of want warm water.\"<br>\r\n\"It has nothing to do with Danny being there with sexy twins?\" Jake smirked.<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe a little. But I really do want to use the hot tub in addition believe it or not,\" Ryder said striding towards it with Jake a few steps behind. Ryder got in with an appreciative sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so good,\" he slurred and Jake splashed in behind him. \"Hey watch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha sorry. What up guys?\" Jake said over to where Danny and two almost identical twins had gotten into the rather massive hot tub. It was interesting to have a nice counter-balancing body features, especially since everything else looked the same. Though, it was also kind of weird to be so similar and opposite at the same time, at least physically. He didn't know them yet to know if they had similar or opposite personalities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having some fun,\" Danny said, one massive arm around each twin as one fed him a hamburger while the other rubbed his belly and when it was gone, alternated with the other one feeding him and the first feeder rubbing. \"You enjoying yourselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Ryder said staring at him. \"The food tastes great and I love the view.\" Danny laughed. <br>\r\n\"That's funny. I agree, the view is pretty good and I'm excited to actually have people over.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you haven't,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's not that I couldn't but I'm not into getting my house trashed by parties, even if it wouldn't have been me but the servants cleaning it up anyways. I just want to invite people that I'm close to and most people I'm not sure of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why invite us?\" Ryder said. \"Not that I don't appreciate it but I can't say we know you that well.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but since I know Jake's brother and we certainly all have him in common and we're taking his class together, we will be getting a lot closer heh plus it's the best of the best of the athletes in the school which could be our little club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Ryder said and Danny nodded. <br>\r\n\"It sure is,\" he paused letting out a belch. \"Uuurrpp, I am a bit stunned though,\" Danny pointed to where Sam and Blaine were at the tables. \"Even I can't eat like him and it sure is rare for someone to actually be bigger than me, not counting your brother Jake cause he is a freak and I had been hoping to finally edge past Sam today.\" He sighed. \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you haven't met Dave have you? There's another person but anyhow yeah, that's Sam for you. From what I have heard from my brother, he has really exploded over the last two years. He used to have amazing six pack abs and be model fit.\" Jake laughed. \"I wouldn't have believed it but he showed me the pictures and its true! He still is a great model with those massive arms, chest, and everything but flat stomach certainly not!\" Jake shared grins with Ryder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serious? Anyhow, you used to be skinny too Jake. Heck just a month or something you used to be some sort of twig like your friend still is.\"<br>\r\n\"I wasn't a twig.\"<br>\r\n\"Compared to me you were you poor slender thing but most people are.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, then Puck showed me the way.\" Jake patted his belly and flexed his muscles. \"I've never been big like this before and am totally loving it! I feel like a real man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck sure does for everyone,\" Danny grinned noticing Ryder's eyes roaming over Jake appreciatively. \"You too are an adorable couple and I'm glad Ryder is joining you. Make sure to stuff him real good and make that cute sexy belly of his really expand so he doesn't go back to a six-pack, not that yours was ever ugly,\" Danny said apologetically for a moment. \"However you would look even better bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I've been saying,\" Jake said playfully punching Ryder's stomach. \"We'll definitely do that but right now we were hoping to feed you...if that's okay?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nick asked with a hiss and the other one glared at them. Ryder was surprised that they could talk, he hadn't heard a peep from them all day, even in class. He was beginning to think they were mutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Danny said soothingly, his hand caressing Nick's chest. \"I have no problem with them feeding me.\" Zack got a pouty look on his face.<br>\r\n\"But we were,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"I know, but now you guys can take a break and have some food for yourselves. You haven't had any of your own burgers yet,\" he said pointing to the plates they had put down on the edge. \"I don't want you guys to miss out as well and Jake and Ryder are our new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine,\" Nick said grabbing one of his burgers and taking a bite. Zack did the same. Danny nodded to Jake and Ryder pointing to either side of him, rubbing his hand along Jake's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to say little Puckerman Jake I totally dig the beef by the way,\" Danny said squeezing and rubbing. \"Like a mini-version of Puck. I wonder if you would one day get that big. I hope so, but not before me. Nonetheless, you're one sexy stud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought we were helping you,\" Jake said, blushing a little and pleased with the attention. Ryder rubbed Jake's tummy soothingly as well.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are,\" Danny said opening his mouth for Ryder to bring in a hamburger and chewed it. \"I just like playing.\" Nick and Zack nodded in agreement as they chewed their own burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Jake said grinning. <br>\r\n\"When's your brother coming?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet, I think he had something to do first that he had no idea when he'd make it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Danny leaned back, hands placed on his stomach. \"Another,\" he motioned Jake and Jake and Ryder alternated turns one feeding while the other rubbed like the twins had done earlier. They could feel the eyes on their backs the whole time from the twins who watched with barely a sound other than the sounds of eating as food was consumed. Soon everyone's plates were empty and Danny leaned back, his massive stomach packed with food. Giving it a solid smack that didn't jiggle, Danny let out a monstrous belch and grinned. \"Thanks, I needed that,\" he told the rest of them. Nick and Zack moved closer, affectionately rubbing his mountain as he groaned in pleasure, occasionally his hands returning the favor. \"Do you mind if we have a little privacy?\" Danny asked Jake and Ryder whose eyes widened. \"Not that I mind if you really want but right now we're having some fun and while later I would not mind if you joined in with us, right now it's just me and my special guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure,\" Jake and Ryder said as they got out of the hot tub watching Nick and Zack push Danny under the water. \"See you later...\"<br>\r\n\"We should get to know everyone, don't you think?\" Jake asked Ryder. Ryder nodded and agreed.<br>\r\n\"So, who should we talk to next?\" Jake wondered looking around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's do Matt and Tyrone,\" Ryder said and Jake snickered a moment causing Ryder to roll his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you and Puck I swear never think of anything else.\" Jake just shrugged and stared at Ryder meaningfully and Ryder shifted nervously until Jake looked away and they resumed walking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Jake said when he and Ryder reached where Matt and Tyron were where Matt was showing off his swimming ability in the pool while Tyrone looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey,\" Tyrone said before turning his attention back to the pool where Matt was getting out, water dripping down his beefy chest and thick stomach. He tossed Matt the towel who got it one-handed and dried himself off with it before laying down in the next pool chair over. Letting out a sigh, Matt sprawled out and turned to face the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is amazing swimming,\" Jake said. Ryder thought so too and definitely agreed. They got a shrug in acknowledgment.<br>\r\n\"He is fantastic and almost makes me want to swim. Problem is my fat ass would sink to the bottom and I'd drown.\" Tyrone said. Matt sat up and smiled over.<br>\r\n\"I keep offering to teach him but he refuses.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm good just watching you. You are phenomenal,\" Tyrone dragged his eyes over Matt's body causing him to grin and do a hair flip.<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how are things?\" Jake asked not quite sure what to say.<br>\r\n\"Very good, I can't complain really. Your brother being a teacher is amazing. I used to know him before and he never really was a good student but now he's matured.\" Tyrone said.<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Matt licked his lips a moment before laughing. \"It's downright weird honestly.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jake agreed. \"I mean I am a new student but from what I hear it certainly is a change. Putting that aside though, how did you become persuaded by my brother? I thought swimmers were supposed to be trim?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a weird story. I've always been good at swimming but I had at first joined swimming to meet people. There I saw Sam as he turned from a glorious model to a different kind as he beefed up and instead of turning people off I saw he had gotten even more popular in general which was weird. Although it makes synchronized swimming ridiculous I also saw how much it helped his swimming technique except when he just ate and well, I begged Puck to help me and so he has. I also met Tyrone through Puck and let's just say he likes what he sees.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah babe,\" Tyrone said. Suddenly Jake's stomach let out a growl and they all looked at him and he blushed slightly.<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit hungry,\" Jake said rubbing his belly and Matt's eyes lit up excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Are you? Let's go get you guys some food. I want to try that thing out.\"<br>\r\n\"Thing?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n\"Feeding,\" Tyrone explained. \"After Puck's success with him, he thinks Puck is a genius and also he's hooked on feeding people when not swimming.\" Tyrone patted his belly sheepishly. \"Between Puck and Matt, I've really put on the weight.\" Matt fondled Tyrone's beefy gut fondly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how incredibly sexy it is. One of the beefiest, most athletic, sexy guys in the school or anywhere.\" He kissed it before getting up and grinning. \"But I must help Jake's! This is so cool, to be able to help the brother of Puck himself!\" Ryder's stomach chose just that moment to let out a growl as well and Ryder was intimidated by the utter delight Matt had when he jumped excitedly. \"And Ryder our star quarterback as well! This is going to be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you guys feel like having?\" Matt asked as he lead them over to the food table where Sam and Blaine were lounging in a stuffed comatose state, surrounded by a pile of plates that the caterers hadn't gone to yet. There was a lot of good food and Ryder didn't particularly care what he wanted so he let Jake choose as everything looked good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like hotdogs,\" Jake decided and when Matt looked over Ryder nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n\"I'll have hotdogs too then.\" They sat down and Matt pulled over two huge serving plates of hotdogs and put them in front of Jake and Ryder and leaned back excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not having any?\" Jake asked the two of them. Tyrone shook his head no as he patted his stomach. <br>\r\n\"Nah, I already ate and am still struggling to digest. Matt though hasn't eaten yet.\" Matt pulled over a huge plate of linguini for himself and grinned. <br>\r\n\"I wanted to swim a bit but now I'm starved. I'm sure you could eat enough yourself before needing my help so I might as well get some food in,\" he grinned at Jake who grinned back and then took a bite of his first hotdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying attention to his own meal, Ryder picked up the first hotdog on his plate and took a bite of it, loving the taste. It had been a while since he had hotdogs, he couldn't even remember the reason why, but he had forgotten how good they tasted. Jake was pounding through them like one of those hotdog competition guys like kobeyashi or whoever. Matt was watching in shock while he unconsciously shoveled linguini into his mouth and honestly Ryder was too. It was a cross between amazement and how the heck is it even possible and its something that Ryder would probably never lose no matter how much time he spent around the Puckermans. It was even worse as watching Jake suck and then chomp down those hotdogs, his throat muscles moving as he swallowed, reminded Ryder of other things Jake would be good at with his mouth around and now he was very eager to have it happen so he was forced to not go or jump Jake. That seemed like a very good idea at the moment and Ryder might have done it if he hadn't been able to distract himself by shoving more hotdogs into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had cleared his first mountain of hotdogs (20 or so? Ryder wasn't sure) at a time that sure would have made his brother Puck proud and made Ryder and certain anatomical parts excited as well. Ryder was doing well himself though having cleared nine hotdogs so far and still going strong. Matt and Tyrone both were watching them now, well Jake mainly but at least watched Ryder occasionally to not exclude him, with smiles and really impressed looks on their faces. Jake was having the time of his life as he sucked hotdogs down while occasionally sipping from a pitcher of water nearby and sending looks over Ryder's way that certainly did not dispel any illusions of what Jake was thinking when he sucked on a hotdog longer than necessary when not acting like they were at a food eating competition. It took all of Ryder's willpower to not do something or choke on a hotdog when that happened especially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what did seem like forever but really was only like half an hour, Jake has gone through near two mountains of probably twenty hotdogs each which made nearly forty in a sitting, and those were hotdogs with condiments of mustard, ketchup, etc. Leaning back, Jake gave a couple burps as he patted his distended stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuurrrpp oh man that was good,\" Jake said with glassy eyes and everyone there agreed as they watched Jake massage his tanned bloated ball of a belly that was beginning to resemble his brother's. Ryder would have gotten up to help him (quite eagerly) but he was pretty full himself and he found himself unable to really get up so he wasn't too jealous when Matt got up and had his hands all over Jake. Well, not that jealous but he certainly was watching Matt suspiciously who was having way too much fun massaging his boyfriend's sexy gut. Ryder let out a grunt of appreciation at that thought of his boyfriend, not anyone else's. Tyrone got up and approached Ryder and started massaging Ryder and he lost his train of thought at the surprise and a belch rumbled from him causing them to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Jake said lazily and groaned as Matt shoved another hot dog into it with excitement. Ryder wasn't in much of a better predicament when Ryder found one as well being shoved into his mouth by Tyrone and he was forced to chew, despite the insistence of his body of no more and he was going to throw up. It was surprising he hadn't already, not counting the times he almost did when it rose in his mouth and he reswallowed. Jake's groans of tortured enjoyment were almost too much and the way Matt was rubbing Jake's belly and Tyrone his, Ryder was going to go insane from the pleasure and frustration. When Jake gave one last massive belch, Ryder couldn't hang on anymore and exploded as well to the enjoyment of Matt and Tyrone. Sharing a high-five, Matt and Tyrone were very satisfied with themselves as they had the great pleasure of stuffing the popular Jake and Ryder who also had an extreme orgasmic high. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake groaned happily in stuffed, bloated bliss; enjoying the painful but erotic feeling of having his gut so stuffed that he couldn't move.  The bloated, beefy teen look around at the party still going on, enjoying the music blaring from the speakers as he did so.  Jake noticed Matt on the opposite side of the pool and couldn't help but laugh by quickly he has caught the feeder bug.  Jake watched as Matt stuffed slice after slice into Ricky and Devon's tiny (well compared to everybody else's) bellies.  Jake was so full and tired he just sat and watched for twenty minutes, enjoying the show, and by the time Matt was finished he had force fed Ricky and Devon 3 XL pizzas each.  Jake looked over at Tyrone, who was on his 20th hot dog and said, \"Y'know, while Matt is really hot I think he enjoys feeding more than gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone nodded: \"Oh, yeah, he totally does.  He enjoys gaining but I can tell feeding is his true passion.  I've been thinking about having Puck take him under his wing and show him how to properly stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats a good idea.\"  Jake said, rubbing his insanely tightly packed gut absentmindedly.  Jake's eyes drifted over to the hot tub where Danny and the twins were and Jake wasn't surprised by what he saw.  Despite the size difference Danny seemed determine to be the biggest, fattest student at McKinley high, and despite being stuffed by Jake and Ryder earlier, Danny was sitting back while his two sexy boyfriends were shoving burger after burger into his mouth in an attempt to reclaim the fattest student crown from Sam.  Jake couldn't help but think that Danny's ambition was super sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake slowly turned his head to the right and the first thing he saw were Sam and Blaine, stuffed beyond belief.  The two were both passed out, their huge guts resting on the table that separated them.  Jake was amazed by the size of their bellies; he had never seen the two of them get this big before!!  The growing problem in Jake's swim trunks continued to grow at the thought of how big and fat Sam and Blaine would be by the end of the party, especially Sam.  Jake totally understood why Puck considered Sam his, in what Jake would assume would be Puck's words, \"#1 plump pig\".  The guy was MASSIVE.  It was a sheer miracle that Sam could even fit into his speedo, let alone the very small chair he was sitting in.  In fact, since Jake knew that Sam hadn't left that table since he got there, Jake had a feeling Sam's enormous fat ass and thighs actually had him trapped in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake craned his neck somewhat so he could see over the mountain of flesh that is Sam's gut to see what Trevor and Micah were up to.  Jake wouldn't deny that he was insanely attracted to both of them, Trevor more than Micah due to his better personality and over all hotter body, but Jake was legitimately surprised by what he saw.  Micah was laying on his pool chair passed out, his tight muscle gut stretched to full capacity.  The buff teen was snoring loudly as his massive gut rose and fell with each breath.  Jake looked to Micah's left to where Trevor was sitting, and as a surprise to nobody, Trevor was still eating.  The titanic wrestler had already eaten the entire first tray of 30 hot dogs Jake saw him inhaling earlier, and on a small table next to Trevor, sat said empty tray, along with another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake wasn't too impressed that Trevor had only eaten 60 hot dogs, after all, 60 was the number of hot dogs currently sitting in his own gut, but what did impress him was seeing Trev scarf down the last two dogs on ANOTHER tray of 30, putting the almost 400 pound teenager at 90 hot dogs in his monster sized belly.  Jake let out a low whistle, impressed whistle, amazed and turned on by the giant of a teenager, but Trevor continued to impress.  The gargantuan teen lifted himself up off of the chair, his gut sticking out insanely far, and he slowly waddled over, a grin on his face, \"Hey, Jake!  Lookin' huge!!\"  Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Trev.  So do you.  Whats up?\"  Jake asked, a flirty tone in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Just getting some more food.\"  Trevor said, rubbing his rock hard gut and letting out a burp, not noticing the tone in Jake's voice, \"Ever since I finished digesting those 5 milk jugs of gainer shake today in class I've just been STARVING!\"<br>\r\n\"Puck probably spiked them with that stuff he loves to use, you know, the stuff that makes you hungrier the more you eat so you can gain more?\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.  No matter how much I eat I can't seem to get full!!\"  Trevor said, shaking his enormous, blubbery belly.  Jake grinned at the sight and was about to ask Trevor if he could touch it when he heard a familiar voice from the entrance to the back yard, \"No need to wait any longer: King Puckerman... has arrived!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck's deep commanding voice was loud enough that it woke Ryder, Blaine, and Sam from their food comas but Micah remained passed out on his pool chair.  Jake looked over at his older brother and was not surprised in the slightest by his attire.  At first Puck looked like he was totally naked but then he noticed the skin tight, \"would snap at any second how is that thing even on his massive ass\" blue speedo, and even then Jake only noticed it because Puck was currently standing sideways.  Puck's muscular arms and gigantic chest were big as usual and his titanic sized gut draped over his speedo, totally covering it from the front and hanging half way down his thighs.  Puck strutted over to where Jake was, his enormous, blubbery-yet-solid belly shaking with each step, \"Now THIS is what I like to see at a party!!  Nothing but hot, muscular, fat guys all stuffing their faces and getting bigger!!  Good work, Danny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny thanked Puck but his mouth had a triple cheeseburger stuffed into it so it came out muffled.  Puck grinned before speaking again, \"So, everybody, I have a few announcements, which are the reasons I'm late.  First off, Sam, unfortunately, since you weigh almost 500 pounds.. actually, based on how stuffed you are by the end of this party I expect you to be over 500, but regardless, Figgins checked and you currently weigh too much to be on the synchronized swimming team so they had to cut you.  HOWEVER, I was able to talk to the wrestling coach so congrats!  You're the newest, and now officially fattest and heaviest, member of the McKinley High wrestling team.  Sorry, Trev.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Trevor looked devastated to now be the only the second fattest on the team, he took deep breath and smiled at Sam, \"Good job, dude!!  Can't wait to have you on the mat!\"<br>\r\n\"Second,\" Puck said, \"Trevor, Figgins told me that your new wrestling singlet came in today.  He said the singlet is stretchable enough so that you could probably gain another 400 pounds before you'd need a new one.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, lets hope if happens!\" Trevor said, smacking his gut which made Puck happy.<br>\r\n\"And last but not least, while I have everybody here, I need to weigh you all before the night ends.  We didn't do it in class and I have to have a weekly weigh in for your progress.  We can wait till tonight for that though!  For now, lets party and stuff these fat guts!\"  Puck yelled out and all the guys cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was starting to load up on more food when Puck walked over and wrapped his arm around Trevor's massive, meaty shoulders, \"Well, well, well, if it isn't my current favorite fatty.\"  Puck said seductively.<br>\r\nTrevor chuckled and blushed, \"No need for the compliments, Puck.  Whats up?\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he ran one massive hand over Trevor's engorged mid section, \"I couldn't help but notice how huge you are right now.\"  Puck whispered into Trevor's ear, \"How much have you eaten?\"<br>\r\n\"I just scarfed down 90 hot dogs.\"  Trevor admitted.<br>\r\nPuck bit his lower lip, \"Man, I wish I had been here to watch.  That sounds so sexy.\"  Puck jiggled and played with Trevor's huge but stuffed gut with both hands, watching it bounce and jiggle in his meaty paws, \"Mmmmmm, look at that hot gut.  Guess my shakes work really well, huh?  Since Micah is passed out how about you and I head inside?\"  Puck asked, getting closer to Trevor.  The two stood facing each other, their massive, out of this world guts smooshed right up against each other.  Jake and Ryder watched, incredibly turned on by what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, dude.  I mean yeah we used to fool around and stuff but I'm dating Micah now.\"  Trevor said, wanting to but worried.<br>\r\n\"Trev, please.  Micah knows that nobody can say no to me.  If it was anybody else he'd be pissed but this is ME we're talking about.\"  Puck said, jiggling his fat-yet-solid gut against Trevor's, \"So how about you and I go inside for a bit, I stuff you until you can't move, and then we have some extra fun?\"<br>\r\nTrevor thought about for a sec and realized Puck was right, nobody can say to him.  Even Micah would have fallen victim, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\"  Puck said, stepping to Trevor's side and slipping his hand into Trevor's speedo, squeezing the enourmas cheek in his hand as they headed in.  Puck turned around to look at Jake and smiled, \"Hot gut, little bro.  Maybe I'll stuff you next.\"<br>\r\nJake could feel himself get harder at the thought and was insanely jealous of Trevor right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Puck waddles to Danny's couch and pulls out Trevor's wrestling singlet, \"How about we make this even more fun?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHow about we make this more fun?\u201d Puck asked before pulling a surprised Trevor onto down onto the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve got to touch your nice fat stomach and you\u2019re even way bigger now than you had been a while ago. I guess my training stayed?\u201d Trevor nodded and Puck grinned as he ran thick fingers down Trevor\u2019s massively bloated stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking tank man, no wonder you are one of the best on our school wrestling. Very few would have the confidence or proper strategy to take a giant like you down.\u201d Trevor reached out and touched Puck\u2019s massive gut and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but you\u2019re a freaking behemoth. You\u2019re bigger than like everybody, Sam included. How did you get so big?\u201d Puck grinned at the touch and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of hard work, eating, science, and I guess good genetics for it I guess,\u201d Puck said modestly as he slapped Trevor\u2019s stomach watching it jiggle slightly. \u201cNice, you\u2019ve done well but there is still a bit of room in this monster.\u201d Puck played and jiggled Trevor\u2019s gut to his amusement before moving back and leaving the room for the moment. When he came back, Puck had a giant container of ice cream that he threw down with a thud in front of the couch, whip cream, and a bowl with a giant spoon and scooper. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Puck asked in a voice that drew good shivers up Trevor\u2019s spine. Trevor loved Micah a lot but Puck certainly had the effect on people that just drew them in and Trevor was as Puck scooped out some melting ice cream and spread it around on Trevor\u2019s chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re not serious,\u201d Trevor moaned at the cooling feel. \u201cMicah will really not be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe can invite him to join if you want,\u201d Puck said and Trevor thought about it a moment before shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time, babe needs his rest,\u201d Trevor jerked his head in the general direction of outside. \u201cHe also doesn\u2019t really like sharing so the only reason he\u2019d barely tolerate this is because it\u2019s for fun.\u201d Puck shrugged as he grinned and looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, I do love fun, especially with such sexy beefy\u2026dirty studs,\u201d Puck wiped the ice cream around more making sure to really soak it in before he pulled out chocolate sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Trevor grinned and Puck leered back as he spread some out. \u201cI feel really sticky,\u201d Trevor said as Puck rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to clean it all off\u2026\u201d Puck said as he finished his masterpiece, even adding random spots of whip cream. Trevor giggle and then moaned as Puck leaned over and began licking him, massive gut to massive gut. It was even better as Puck was bigger and stronger than him. Licking around the nipples, Puck gave Trevor a tongue bath cleaning up the mess while Trevor moaned and writhed underneath him. \u201cHow does that feel?\u201d Puck asked when he paused, letting Trevor regain his thoughts.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing, I\u2019m totally going to have to have Micah do that,\u201d Trevor gasped out. Puck nodded as squeezed a bit of Trevor\u2019s gut licking his lips. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou should, it\u2019s really fun and both of you will really appreciate it. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get enough of you.\u201d Puck leaned down to continue, groaning against Trevor\u2019s thick body. \u201cSuper nice man, super nice.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nDuring a brief moment of lucidity, when Puck wasn\u2019t vacuuming with his tongue, Trevor asked a question that popped into his mind. \u201cPuck, are you and uh\u2026Dave still good?\u201d Puck stops and stares at him. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d Puck asked surprised at the question.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, you just always seem to go so aggressively after other people that I wondered if there were any problems.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNone that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Puck said. \u201cI just like variety mixes and so does Dave. He\u2019s cool with this. Now stop ruining the mood.\u201d Puck cleaned the rest of Trevor off before leaning back. \u201cI\u2019ll let you either do the same or eat the rest of this ice cream,\u201d Puck said with a grin. Trevor thought a moment before deciding to return the favor. It was only fair after all and so that\u2019s what he was going to do. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nJust covering Puck\u2019s massive body was a treat in itself. Trevor felt just how massively thick Puck was. There was lots and lots of solid muscle and beef and Trevor only wished that he could reach a symmetry like that. It was surprising how defined everything still was and while it was less defined than low body-fat, there were still clear parts of those massive python arms and legs and chest\u2026and it was amazing how such a big massive rounded gut like that was still solid fat and not totally loose extra. Trevor felt a bit jealous actually that Puck and Micah had better more solid muscle guts while his, while not entirely flabby, was definitely looser and jigglier though he did love that too. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nWhen Trevor finished covering, Puck grinned and leaned back as Trevor gave him a cleaning over too giving little noises and cries of appreciation. \u201cHow was that?\u201d Puck asked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Trevor replied. Puck grinned as he took Trevor in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a nice speedo,\u201d Puck snapped it against Trevor\u2019s thick butt a moment, grinning at the shock on Trevor\u2019s face. \u201cJust kidding, it\u2019s time to try out your new uniform,\u201d Puck pulled out the singlet and gave it to Trevor watching as Trevor stretched it on over his thick body. \u201cWe got to stuff you some more, fill it out,\u201d Puck said roaming his eyes over that cladded body. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d They heard Micah\u2019s voice as he came in. \u201cYou look hot babe.\u201d Micah gave a jealous look over at Puck a second before pawing his boyfriend. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cPuck\u2026being Puck so\u2026\u201d Trevor trailed off leaving Micah to make guesses. Micah sighed at that. <br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy about it but\u2026well, he does give good massages I must admit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just for fun?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen I guess that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI offered to let you join us if you want,\u201d Puck said. \u201cHowever you were out at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, was really tired. Still sort of am actually,\u201d Micah let out a burp as he rubbed his bloated stomach. \u201cI got carried away by how much Trevor was eating so I followed suit.\u201d Puck grinned as he reached out and rubbed Micah\u2019s stomach for him. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDamn man, you really did for you. I\u2019m impressed how much you must have eaten to get it this solidly full even after some time passed. We\u2019re trying to get Trevor there too. Want to help?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course.\"  Micah said with a grin looking over at his boyfriend.  Trevor stood there with an excited look on his face, eager to have his massive gut stuffed even bigger with the help of two of the sexiest men alive.  Micah's blue eyes looked over his handsome, gigantic boyfriend's sexy body, loving the way his new uniform clung so tightly to his thick, beefy, flabby frame.  Despite being a brand new uniform it was still extremely snug on Trevor's fat, bloated body; the shoulder straps of the singlet looked thin and small against Trevor's massive, muscular shoulders and pecs and Micah was in love with the way Trevor's enormous, sexy, jiggly belly stretched out the singlet's red material and how the words \"McKinley\" looked stretched out across the front of Trevor's singlet clad gut.  The legs of the singlet looked small, almost like short-shorts on Trevor's tree trunk thighs and it was almost hard to believe that this was his new uniform.  Micah twirled his finger around and Trevor took the hint but turning around for them both, showing off his huge broad back and insanely enormous bubble butt, which both Micah and Puck have had the pleasure of fucking in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, babe, you look fucking delicious in that singlet.\"  Micah said, his eyes locked tight onto the ass of his dreams.<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Puck said, licking his lips as he reached forward and grabbed one of Trevor's enormous, beefy, squishy cheeks loving how even his huge hands weren't big enough to grab the whole thing and how his thick fingers sunk into Trevor's fatty bubblebutt.<br>\r\n\"Hehe.. thanks.  Can we get to eating now?  I know I just scarfed down 90 hot dogs but I'm seriously starving.\"  Trevor said, rubbing his titanic gut.<br>\r\n\"Sure, thing, big guy.\"  Puck said happily, \"How about you slip into your old uniform while I get the food ready.\"  Puck said as he waddled off to the fridge, his mammoth, fatter-than-Trevor's ass bouncing in his speedo as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that.\"  Micah said as he walked behind and stood as close as he could to his boyfriend's back, smirking as he felt his favorite fat bubblebutt pressed right up against the bulge in his swim trunks.  Trevor's ass was so massive that it prevented Micah's torso, save for his gigantic stuffed musclegut, from pressing against Trevor's broad beefy back.  Micah slipped his big fingers under the thin straps of his boyfriend's singlet and easily pulled down the stretchy material, revealing his boyfriend's titanic fat body to the word.  Trevor took a few steps forward so Micah could the throw the new uniform on the kitchen counter and looked over his boyfriend's fat, buff body, \"I'm a little disappointed.  You're still in your speedo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anybody except for you and Puck seeing me naked, babe.\"  Trevor said, \"But I can make an exception this once.\" With a grin Trevor pulled his speedo off, reached over next to the new singlet and grabbed the old one.  Micah watched as Trevor slipped it on and he couldn't believe how much smaller it really was on him than the new one.  The shoulder straps looked like they were gonna snap at any second, he could see the fabric on the very front of Trevor's gut becoming extremely thin (Micah noticed a small tear on it and he was super excited to see his boyfriend's gut tear through it and flop out of the wrecked singlet), and the legs were so small on him that they didn't even cover his legs at all and framed his bulge sexily.  Trevor turned around for Micah and Micah grinned, seeing that his boyfriend's ass was so fat that the singlet couldn't fit around it and that the material had slipped between Trevor's massive cheeks, putting his ass on full display.<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck, babe, you have no idea how sexy you are in that singlet.\"  Micah said, bitting his lower lip.<br>\r\nTrevor grinned as he reached behind him and gave his fat ass a hard smack, which caused both cheeks to bounce, jiggle and wobble, \"Maybe when the party is over you, Puck, and I can all have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better,\"  Puck said, delivering another hard SMACK to Trevor's blubbery bubblebutt, leaving a huge red hand print on one cheek, \"Now lets stuff that gut and get you even fatter, big guy.\"<br>\r\nPuck lead the 370 pound wrestler over to the couch and plopped him down.  Trevor's monster-sized gut pushed forward and spread out across his lap, which caused the small tear on the front of his belly to tear a little more, revealing more of the doughy fat gut Micah was in love with.  Micah sat down next to Trevor as Puck set up Trevor's meal on the coffee table in front of them; a funnel, 5 one gallon tubs of ice cream, 16 huge bottles of whipped cream, and 16 huge bottles of chocolate syrup.<br>\r\nTrevor rubbed the back of his thick neck, \"I don't know Puck, that seems like a lot.\"<br>\r\n\"You drank two and a half gallons of gainer shake today and scarfed down 90 hot dogs.  This should be a cake walk for you.\"  Puck said, grabbing two cans of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah reached down and rubbed and massaged Trevor's bloated gut, digging his fingers into the beefy, blubbery expanse of his boyfriend's enormous belly as Puck uncapped the lids to the two whipped cream cans and stuck both nozzles in Trevor's mouth.  Puck pressed down on both nozzles and filled Trevor's mouth with whipped cream, \"You better start swallowing or it'll spill out cause I refuse to stop it.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\nTrevor took the hint and stared gulping down the creamy white goodness coming from the can.  In under a minute Puck had emptied both cans into Trevor's huge gut, tossing them onto the ground and grabbing two more, repeating the process as Micah jiggled and bounced his boyfriend's gigantic belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPucked grinned as he emptied can after can after can into Trevor's enormous, fatty gut as Micah rubbed, jiggled, massaged, and buried his face into the thick yet squishy expanse, licking and kissing the singlet clad gut and loving how it visibly bloated outward more and more with each can.  After ten minutes Puck had emptied all 16 cans of whipped cream into Trevor's vast tank.  Trevor groaned happily as Micah worshipped his enormous fat, bloated gut.  Puck grinned, \"How about we switch.\"  He said to Micah after testing how solid the ice cream was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah agreed and Puck handed him the chocolate syrup, \"Start with these.\" he told the muscular teen and Micah grinned as he unscrewed the lid and placed it between Trevor's lips,  pouring the thick chocolatey goo down Trevor's throat.  Trevor drank the syrup slower than he did the whipped cream, but it still had the same effect; each bottle of visibly bloated his belly outward more, tearing the fabric little by little around his advancing gut.  Puck was at Trevor's side, resuming the role Micah had been doing of worshipping and playing with Trevor's gut as Micah force fed his boyfriend bottle after bottle of the almost black goo.  Once the fabric tore more around Trevor's fat tank (around bottle 9) and finally revealing his belly button, Puck leaned down and dipped his tongue into Trevor's deep fat belly button, molding the fat between his hands as he made out with it which caused Trevor groan loudly as Micah pulled the 9th empty bottle back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you feeling, babe?\"  Micah asked as he unscrewed bottle number 10 and rubbed the top of Trevor's gut, which Puck was still making out with and leaving hickeys around the belly button.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm hungry... why'd you stop?\"  Trevor asked as he opened his mouth again, ready for another bottle.  Micah smiled and he put the bottle of chocolate syrup back in Trevor's mouth and poured it down his thick sexy throat.<br>\r\nTen more minutes passed and Trevor had successfully swallowed down all 16 bottles of chocolate syrup, his stomach sticking out almost to his knees and the tear bigger than it was before.<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he licked up Trevor's belly as he stood up, his own massive mountain of muscle and fat resting on Trevor's gut, \"Man, you're a fucking garbage disposal, dude.  I'm so turned on right now.\"  Puck said before looking at Micah, \"Move, it's my turn.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Micah asked, \"I was gonna feed him the ice cream next.\"<br>\r\n\"You can do that to him anytime.  I want my turn stuffing Titanic Trev here.\"  Puck said, slapping the fat wrestler's gut.<br>\r\nMicah shrugged, as he really couldn't argue with that logic, and switched places with Puck, grinning as he resumed worshipping his boyfriend's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he picked up one of the 5 tubs of chocolate chip cookie dough, Trevor's favorite ice cream, and popped the lid off, examining the solidity of it, \"Perfect,\" he said, \"it's half melted so it's not too hard.\"  Without a second thought Puck grabbed the funnel sitting on the table and placed it in Trevor's mouth before taking the first one gallon tub and lifting it up, pouring the contents into the funnel, \"Eat up, big guy.  We wanna see that fat guy of your tear this singlet in half.\"<br>\r\nTrevor groaned and leaned his head back as Puck poured the first gallon tub down his throat.  The funnel was big enough so that none of the cookie dough chunks, which were almost the size of whole cookies, slid down his throat with ease along with the ice cream.  Trevor swallowed down the whole first tub, causing the singlet to rip even more and his stomach to bloat out eve farther, but the hefty wrestler didn't even get a chance to take a breather as Puck started with the next tub.  Trevor swallowed down tub after tub, his stomach bloating and growing bigger and bigger with each massive gulp, until they were half way done with the 5th tub.  Puck continued to pour, \"Just a few more gulp.\"  he said encouragingly.  As soon as Trevor swallowed down the very last drop of ice cream from tub number 5...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a loud ripping sound as Trevor\u2019s massive gut finally pushed through the weakened singlet and the singlet tore in two, barely a strip of cloth. The massive belly quivered and Trevor groaned as a massive series of belches overcame him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026..UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP\u2026god,\u201d Trevor wheezed hands on his utterly massive gut that looked like the slightest pressure would pop. \u201cI can\u2019t...UUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPP believe it.\u201d Micah and Puck couldn\u2019t believe it either and Puck whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho-ey, I can\u2019t believe this monster hasn\u2019t popped yet,\u201d Puck said patting the overly swollen stomach that looked more like a stretched to the max balloon. Trevor groaned, still burping piteously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe-UUUUUURRRRPPP neither,\u201d Trevor groaned as he rolled back. \u201cI think you might have\u2026.UUUURRRRPPPP overdid it.\u201d Looking over at him, Puck almost agreed but shrugged.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, but that was all you big guy and you\u2019re still alive so that\u2019s something to be proud of. And you also broke your old singlet like you\u2019ve wanted to for a while from the size of your massive body.\u201d Puck again patted and rubbed Trevor\u2019s belly. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah babe, you\u2019re so huge,\u201d Micah said trying to wrap his massive arms around Trevor\u2019s circumference. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so big even I can\u2019t completely get my arms around you.\u201d He had been able to before, albeit barely, but with the recent massive stuffings Trevor finally was too big to hug all the way which was something that proved to be an awesome turn on since few people could match himself in size. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can get up?\u201d Puck asked and Micah looked back down at Trevor\u2019s groaning mass. \t<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too stuffed to move,\u201d Trevor groaned which made Micah grin since that was something Trevor never said since it was rare that he got so much food and usually he was always hungry and in need of a snack. Puck bent down and hefted up one side. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me get him up Micah,\u201d he said and Micah did, wincing at Trevor\u2019s moans of discomfort and curses. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI think the rest should at least see our big fella here before he goes to sleep don\u2019t you think? Provide a little inspiration for all of them.\u201d Micah briefly glanced down calculating and then nodded. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Trevor, just a little bit more and then you can have well deserved nap and after that,\u201d Micah whispered the rest into Trevor\u2019s ear which perked him up a bit although he was still sluggish and needed them both to hold him steady. Puck who was up ahead winked and lead the way out to where the rest of the party was dying down and people were just hanging out and relaxing, bellies stuffed to the brim. Centering himself, Puck clapped his hands for attention loudly getting the eye of everyone there. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, awesome party huh? It\u2019s all thanks to Danny who is one awesome dude.\u201d Puck waited for the cheers and whistles which did happen but were slightly weaker than normal since everyone was tired, happy, and full. When it died down, Puck nodded and helped Trevor forward which got looks as by all appearances Trevor was completely naked, which he was since he had exploded out of his old clothes, but his gut was so big by this point it more than covered his junk and a good portion of his thighs as well. \u201cTrevor finally broke his record,\u201d Puck stated proudly. \u201cThis massive beast ate 90 hotdogs, 5 gallons of icecream, 16 whip-cream bottles, 16 bottles of syrup, and who knows what else today. He has finally achieved breaking out of his old uniform and will continue on wrestling as McKinnley\u2019s top heavy-weight wrestler.\u201d Some more scattered applause and Puck sighed. \u201cWell that was sort of anti-climatic. Probably should have waited till later for more excitement and energy.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?\u201d Micah said dryly and Trevor let out another impressive burp. Micah turned to Puck with a pleading look Puck understood immediately and he nodded granting permission and Micah grabbed Trevor and hurried him up into the house supporting him as fast as he could drag him. Deciding to give them some alone time, Puck checked to see if there was any food left as he was feeling a bit peckish himself and fortunately there was still a bit left that Sam, Blaine, Danny, Trevor and all the rest somehow hadn\u2019t managed to finish. There had to have been enough food for hundreds of people at this party throughout the day but at least it hadn\u2019t gone to waste like tons of leftover uneaten food tossed daily from restaurants. Grabbing a tray of lasagna, buckets of fried chicken, mac&amp;cheese, and mashed potatoes, Puck got started on feeding his own ravenous hunger. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBy the time the sun was beginning to set two hours later and it was beginning to get dark, Puck had cleaned out whatever had been left. In addition to what he had before, Puck also finished off the leftover hot-dogs, hamburgers, and pizza outdoing even his own records. It seemed to be a record breaking day all-around and even he was wiped out which hadn\u2019t happened since his first year of gaining and he wasn\u2019t the beast he was today. Letting out earth-shattering belches, Puck used all his incredible strength to stand, his massive gut bloated out enormously before him as he somehow walked bounced his way to the entrance of Danny\u2019s house and got inside where he luckily found them all in a room off to the side watching a movie on a massive 72 inch plasma television. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys\u2026what are you, UUUUUUURRRRPPPPPPPPP, watching?\u201d Puck asked making his way in. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThe Avengers,\u201d Jake said from the bean bag where he and Ryder were cuddling together, Ryder\u2019s hands playing with and massaging Jake\u2019s massive belly. Puck smiled from the cute sight and was proud that his younger brother from another mother was getting some. Looking around he felt proud of them all, the massive sexy beasts he either had personally or indirectly assisted helped to grow and train. Puck wasn\u2019t normally so sentimental but he was just feeling it tonight with so many gathered. Shaking his head so he didn\u2019t start doing something stupid like crying happy tears, he sat down with them and saw Iron Man fly into the wormhole that delivered the nuclear bomb to the armada of alien ships. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh this part,\u201d Puck said and smirked when he got shushed by nearly everyone so he went silent and watched the remainder of the movie with them. <br>\r\n\u201cThat is such a good movie,\u201d Sam was saying excitedly. <br>\r\n\u201cI know right?\u201d Jake was saying excitedly back. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like the Avengers?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see The Dark World?\u201d Sam asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, me and Ryder are going to go see it this weekend,\u201d Jake said turning his head towards Ryder. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo who else has seen Frozen?\u201d Blaine asked and to everyone\u2019s surprise, everyone\u2019s hands had gone up, even Micah\u2019s. Puck couldn\u2019t help but look at him in surprise. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It was a good movie.\u201d He said. Puck grinned and smirked. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah it was. Did anyone else notice the similarity between Elsa\u2019s voice and Rachel\u2019s mom\u2019s?\u201d Sam and Blaine nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it kind of did sound like her. Weird huh?\u201d Jake and Ryder had no idea what they were talking about so remained silent. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHmm Kristoff, what I wouldn\u2019t give to get my hands on him,\u201d Puck grumbled and all of his students with the exception of Ricky and Devon who didn\u2019t get it laughed. Puck shrugged. \u201cAnyhow, I am, and I bet you all are too, curious how much we all\u2019ve grown. I mean after a party like that wow, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019ve all put on a bit of weight. Danny, you said you had that scale that could actually weigh up to a ton?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s all set,\u201d Danny said excitedly. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Puck grinned as he and the rest followed Danny to where a massive scale was. With either excitement, trepidation, fear, giddiness, aloofness, or whatever they all got in line to be weighed. Puck went first because he really wanted to know.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWow, 550,\u201d Danny said shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just\u2026wow.\u201d Puck grinned and flexed his biceps as he bounced with pride out. He couldn\u2019t believe it, 550 lbs of mass and still the biggest, buffest, bad-ass ever. After that they went by size. Sam reached 500 which also wasn\u2019t really a surprise as after Puck he was the most ginormous all-round. Danny got on third reaching a really good 405 lbs which was both impressive and disappointing as it was still his goal to somehow beat Sam although he was just less than a hundred pounds behind. Nick and Zack hugged and whispered things in his ear that made him smile again while Trevor went up and was found to be 390 lbs. Micah went up with grim determination and a steely glance went up and was weighed in at 368 made Trevor give a thumbs up and Micah smiled. Nick and Zack went next each oddly weighing the same still at 358. Jake who was now one of the big boys weighed in at 337 which actually was bigger than Tyrone\u2019s 333. Blaine was 352. The lighter weights were Ricky at 296, Matt at 284, and Devin at 270. Finally Ryder who was along for the ride was pushed forward and weighed at 170lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 170 pounds,\" Ryder said patting the new bulge of his stomach. \"I mean the rest of you are fairly big guys but damn, I've put on 10 pounds already.\" Jake grinned as he ran his hand over Ryder's as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks really cute on you too. I mean I've already put on 17 pounds and am making my way up there at 337.\" Ryder looked over and squeezed Jake's protruding ball shaped gut that looked more and more like Puck's by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but this is mainly muscle...with a bit of a fat,\" Ryder said as it jiggled slightly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I think you're tiny precious baby belly is cute too,\" Jake said as he planted a kiss on it. <br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Ryder said grinning as Jake played with it. \"Since you like it so much like I like yours.\" <br>\r\n\"Now you're talking,\" Jake said. Puck gave him a thumbs up over Ryder's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, everybody dispersed on their way home, saying goodnight. When Jake and Ryder got back to the car, they immediately grabbed one another and started kissing. Ryder was especially vocal and Puck grinned as he walked on by. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He checked his phone, noticing that 10 minutes had gone by, and walked over to Ryder's car.  He wrapped his thick fingers around the handle and pulled the door open to find Jake and Ryder making out in the backseat.  Ryder was underneath Jake's 337 pound body, groaning loudly into his boyfriend's mouth at the feeling of all that weight on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck chuckled before reaching before him and grabbing Jake's tight swim trunks, pulling them down to reveal his massive fat brown bubble butt.

Puck took a few steps back so Jake and Ryder could climb out before heading to his car, \"Just be safe!\"  He said before loading his massive frame in and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder hopped into the driver seat and Jake into the passenger seat before the two headed home as well.<br>\r\n\"I noticed Puck went in the opposite direction.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jake responded, \"Probably knows I'm gonna destroy your ass when we get home so he's gonna go distract himself for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"What about Dave?\"  Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"He's probably still in his food coma.\"  Jake said, his hand on Ryder's thigh as they drove. Jake looked over at Ryder cute little belly and licked his lips, loving how Ryder looked that way.<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe,\"  Jake said, \"Pull into this McDonalds up here.  I'm kinda peckish.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake and Ryder left the drive thru Jake had ordered; 80 chicken nuggets, 5 large fries, 10 double cheese burgers, and 4 large sprites.  They parked in the parking lot and Ryder smiled, \"Didn't know you were still hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\"\"Jake said as he unwrapped the first burger and shoved it into Ryder's mouth, \"You are.\"<br>\r\nRyder groaned as he was force fed the burger.  He knew there was no fighting Jake on this and just let him feed him.  Jake was impressed that he was able to get all 10 burgers and two large fries down Ryder's through but he started to get too full to move.  Jake rubbed Ryder's hard belly, smirking at the tightness of it, \"Mmmmm, you're so hot when you're stuffed like this.\"  Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Ryder asked, letting out a large burp.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Jake said, kissing the belly he planned on growing before sitting up, \"I'm not gonna make you sick like Puck does so we're done.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, baby.\"  Ryder said as they drove home and Jake ate the remaining food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake and Ryder reached the house they realized Puck was still not home.  They looked at each other, grinned, and headed inside.  While Ryder's gut was completely stuffed and rock solid Jake had no visible difference despite containing 8 chicken nuggets, 3 large fries, and 4 drinks.  The two made it to their shared bedroom after making sure Dave was still passed out and as soon as the door was shut the two went at it like wild animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went as it normally did that very next morning.  Jake and Ryder showered together and got dressed for school before going down stairs to meet with Dave and Puck for breakfast.  Dave had, as always, laid out a massive buffet of breakfast food for the four of them; enough food to feed a party of 30 but in a matter of half an hour it was all stuffed into the massive growing guts of the four men.  Surprising enough it was Dave was had eaten the most this time around.  After a hard fucking from his 550 pound boyfriend Dave realized how far was falling behind and needed to start gaining weight a LOT faster.  Puck had clearly eaten the second most but Jake had been surprised by how Ryder went back for thirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Ryder headed to school, their stomachs bloated and swollen, stretching the fabric of their shirts, but they liked it that way.  The two reached school and headed onto campus.  Jake gave Ryder a kiss on the cheek as they headed off to their separate first period classes.  When Jake reached his first class 40 minutes early, geometry, he noticed a gainer friend of his was scarfing down a monster sized breakfast he had gotten to go from Carl's Jr; 30 breakfast burgers and 10 large milk shakes.  Jake smirked and sat down next to the guy stuffing his face...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey there Trevor,\" Jake said sitting next to the wrestler. \"I see you have recovered from yesterday. That is impressive.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think there was still some residual effects from those weight gain shakes from gym in being able to recover so fast. Otherwise, I don't think I'd have been able to get up out of bed,\" Trevor said smacking his gut, causing ripples throughout his thick body. \"I've never eaten like that before.\" <br>\r\n\"I find that hard to believe,\" Jake said reaching out and touching the exposed part of Trevor's titanic gut. Trevor's extra-extra-large shirt still could only barely stretch over to cover his beefy pecs and arms to the top half of the stomach but the lower half from his thick bellybutton down were exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's true. I have never eaten so much in such a close time together, and I eat a lot.\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"I'd say, considering if that's what you eat for breakfast,\" Jake nodded over to the mass of burgers and shakes that were laid out. <br>\r\n\"Actually since I still might have the slightest bit of hunger yet in me, I'm making the most of it before it disappears and eating far more than normal. I usually only eat about a third of this.\" Trevor explained. Jake felt his eyebrows raise as he looked over it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why so much?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm actually trying to get bigger than Sam,\" Trevor explained and Jake smirked. Apparently Sam was causing everybody to want to match or beat him because first Danny and now Trevor. He couldn't blame them though. Sam was spectacular though they might as well bump the goal even further and try to match Puck, not that that was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason why the sudden interest in now beating Sam?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n\"Cause he's now on the wrestling team instead of swim. I like him and all and while I don't mind being smaller than him, that's just embarrassing to be a small fry compared to him out in the ring and I have always been the big one.\" Jake scooted closer to Trevor and reached out feeling Trevor's thick body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly call these,\" Jake said squeezing the thick arms and fat biceps, \"small. I'd rather say they were large.\" He flexed his own and held side by side in comparison. \"As big as mine are, yours are far larger. Definition wise mine are better but in pure size yours are utterly gigantic.\" He reached out and started fondling Trevor's pecs through the fabric of his white and blue striped shirt. \"Also these babies here feel great,\" Jake hinted unbuttoning it for easier access and stretching the shirt across Trevor's mammoth chest even more. \"So incredibly large like watermelons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like water balloons,\" Trevor said and Jake grinned. <br>\r\n\"But of pure power.\" Trevor sighed at Jake's seductive touching, one hand rubbing his chest, the other having moved while talking towards a lower area and palming him though the tight pants somewhere underneath all that flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this okay with Ryder?\" Trevor asked his breath quickening.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, he doesn't mind. We both live vicariously.\" Trevor groaned as Jake moved his hand lower towards his gut and started rubbing that as well. <br>\r\n\"You and your brother...you guys do everyone.\" He twitched and moved closer to Jake's touch. <br>\r\n\"Yeah that's our thing. Just can't help it I guess. Too many beautiful people but at least we make it interesting.\"<br>\r\n\"You do at that,\" Trevor moaned before finding his mouth stuffed with a burger. Blinking, Trevor chewed until all the pieces were small enough to swallow and clear his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Trevor asked. <br>\r\n\"You wanted to be bigger so I'm going to help make sure you finish this huge breakfast. After all, you only said you usually eat a third at most of this normally so you're going to need someone to make sure you finish every bite. Do you understand me?\" Trevor looked blank a moment before smirking and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, Master Puckerman sir!\" He shouted, even giving a salute. Jake was surprised but quickly recovered when he figured out Puck sometimes probably did that with other people. Nodding to himself, Jake continued as he saw Puck do. Using one hand to massage Trevor's gut, he used the other to start feeding Trevor the burgers. Being used to this process, Trevor made sure to lean back and let Jake feed him, opening his mouth whenever all the food was gone and to allow the insertion of the next burger. They went through a number of burgers, Trevor letting Jake do all the work before raising a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, drink time,\" he said and Jake grabbed one of the shakes bringing it closes to Trevor's lips who took large swallows before pulling back and letting out a massive burp. \"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrpppp, yeah that's good,\" Trevor leaned back in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've done better like yesterday but still, it is.\" Trevor said. \"Now I'm starting to feel a bit full...\"<br>\r\n\"What really?\" Jake asked. \"I can't believe that.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah the hunger's gone.\" Trevor said. \"Now I just feel stuffed.\" <br>\r\n\"But you still have...20 hamburgers and 9 shakes left. That's not even the third you mentioned earlier.\" <br>\r\n\"Clearly I overestimated and still am recovering from yesterday.\" Jake pulled back and pouted <br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you go without at least eating half.\" <br>\r\n\"Can't,\" Trevor said petulantly which caused Jake to really frown. <br>\r\n\"Can and I will prove it.\" He pulled out another hamburger. \"You still have 5 burgers and 2 shakes to go. You can do this you big lug you.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure...if I was still hungry.\" Trevor said rubbing his stomach furiously. \"Now I'm not feeling so good.\" Jake was torn between letting Trevor go in case he really was sick or keeping him to at least finish the half like he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well we'll provisionally go just a little bit more and you could quit if you're actually dying. You're not are you?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Trevor said clutching his stomach. Shaking his head, Jake started to try to emulate the hand motions he saw Puck use on him and others. It was actually a bit harder than it looked to remember the exact pressure and timing or perhaps Puck just had a gift but he eventually got into the groove and the labored panting noises started turning into noises of pleasure as Jake massaged Trevor's stuffed gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Jake asked as he rubbed the massive drum belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a -uuuuurrrrpppp- little, thanks,\" Trevor said letting out a couple more burps. Jake took one hand off and continued rubbing, as he grabbed another sandwich and raised it to Trevor's lips who took a bite out of it and continued eating. After that little hiccup, Jake tried to as quickly possible stuff as many burgers down Trevor's throat as he could before another interruption could happen. Jake was actually sweating and feeling tired a little and it was a lot harder than he thought and feeding someone kind of felt like a workout in itself. It wasn't quite the same thing but he was definitely more fatigued than expected and he definitely had new appreciation for Puck being able to do it for hours on end and everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now we finished have the burgers. Think you can finish the drinks?\" Jake asked and Trevor nodded. Sighing in relief, Jake stood there holding the cup in both hands as Trevor sipped, occasionally taking one off to rub that big bloated belly or play with Trevor's beefy chest which clearly Trevor enjoyed and sometimes made him speed up. Eventually the three shakes were finished and Trevor sighed as he patted his bloated beefy gut and let out one final huge belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't know what it is about you Puckermans, but even I find myself eating more than I normally would have been able to so thanks for that.\" Trevor said. Jake sat down with relief and took the moment to appreciate Trevor's beefy bloated gut which had managed to expand even further and cause the shirt to rise up even more unable to contain that massive orb. Trevor forcefully yanked it down and had to hold it down to keep from going back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I might have overrate for this,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with the rest of the food?\" Jake inquired, reluctantly tearing his eyes away from the amazing sight before him. <br>\r\n\"I don't know. You could have it or I could give it to Micah or I don't know. Do you want it?\"<br>\r\n\"Not now, maybe later. I already ate and there's no time. It's only 5 minutes until class starts.\" People were beginning to trickle in. <br>\r\n\"You're right, I'll save these for later,\" Trevor said stuffing them into the bag and putting it under the desk. It amused Jake how Trevor tried to keep his shirt down over his massive belly by holding on and he would be spending a long time holding it down. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As class started up and other students began to make their way into class Jake pouted a bit - sad to think that he wouldn't have more time to rub, jiggle, bounce, and play with the enormous fat globe he'd given to his huge nearly 400 pound friend.  He gave Trevor's giant fat sphere a few more pats and jiggles, loving how solid and full it was, before moving to his seat closer to the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor bit his lower lip, struggling to pull his incredibly small shirt down.  Granted, the XXL shirt didn't cover his gut to begin with, but now his entire enormous fat bloated belly was on full display for the whole school to see.  Trevor took a deep breath as he pulled down one last time, his strong muscular arms flexing underneath the layers of fat surrounding his biceps as he tried to get his shirt to lower.  It was finally the sound of Trevor's now skin tight shirt ripping at the seams that finally got the meaty wrestler to give up and leave his gut and huge love handles exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor let out a sigh, <i>'Well, at least gym is after this so I can try and find a shirt that'l fit me...'</i> he thought to himself as he slouched back in his chair - his massive gut resting on his giant thighs.  Trevor was lucky - they were watching an educational video in class today about 'the history of geometry' so everybody sat back and did their own thing as their teacher had fallen asleep at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was lounging back in his chair, his 3DS set comfortably on his fat, spherical gut, as he relaxed and trained his Sylveon in Pokemon X - the sounds of his stomach digesting his huge breakfast luckily being blocked out by the sounds of chatter around him.  Trev looked up and saw Jake had passed out in his seat and Trevor smiled.  Jake was incredibly handsome in the face and insanely sexy in his massive and meaty he was.  As the nearly 400 pound wrestler went back to his game he felt a vibrating start up from his pocket and groaned as he leaned to the side a little but and pulled his cell phone out.  It was a text from Micah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Babe I'm so bored RN This class is gonna be the death of me</i> the text wrote.  Trevor smiled and texted back, his thick, chubby fingers gliding across the buttons on his smart phone.<br>\r\n<i>Srry to hear that babe.  My class is watching a movie so I'm playing PKMN and digesting rn</i><br>\r\n<i>Oh thats right you had that massive breakfast this morning how was it big guy?</i> Micah replied.<br>\r\n<i>SO FN GOOD I'm so bloated babe like I actually tore my shirt earlier trying to my shirt over my gut</i><br>\r\n<i>Mmmm sounds hot send a pic</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor smiled and closed his 3DS before setting it on the empty seat next to him.  He took his phone and held it to his side with one hand as he slid his other hand underneath the massive gut resting on both his thighs.  He lifted his gut up with his whole forearm and quickly snapped a pic - making sure that the tears in his shirt's seams were visible.  He sent the pic to Micah and waited for a response, playing pokemon in the mean time, and when his phone vibrated again he checked the text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck babe I can't believe you did that all by yourself I wanna watch you stuff that gut til you're too fat and full to move</i><br>\r\nTrevor felt his face flush red and replied, <i>Thanks babe but I didn't do this myself</i><br>\r\n<i>What do you mean?</i><br>\r\n<i>Jake is in my class and he stuffed me real good</i><br>\r\n<i>JAKE stuffed you?!</i><br>\r\n<i>Yeah babe he knew I couldn't eat it all she he forced me to eat</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah didn't respond after that.  He was sitting in his history class PISSED at the thought of anybody else other than himself and Puck making his boyfriend fatter.  Micah looked around the room trying to cool off when he noticed Ryder, Jake's boyfriend.  Thats when he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Babe do you have any food left?</i><br>\r\n<i>Yeah Jake wasn't able to stuff me with everything so I have 15 burgers and 7 melted shakes</i><br>\r\n<i>Good I want them</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah left class under the guise of needing to use the restroom and quickly snuck into Trevor's class.  He did his best to ignore the boner in his shorts over his boyfriend's bloated state and took the food, giving him a quick kiss and heading off to stash it in his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass went on from there and as soon as the bell rang Micah got Ryder's attention, \"Hey, buddie, I need to talk to you.\"  Micah said, towering over the lean teen with a small belly.<br>\r\n\"Uuuh sure Micah.. whats up?\"<br>\r\n\"Just uh... come with me.\"  Micah said and had Ryder follow him to his locker.  Micah loaded up on the food and headed to an empty classroom, having Ryder come with him.  He set the bag of burgers and the milkshakes on the table and pushed Ryder into a seat before blocking the door with a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me and you listen GOOD, Ryder.  I don't appreciate your boyfriend stuffing and fattening up MY boyfriend so you're gonna sit here while I stuff that puny little gut of yours.  Got it!\"<br>\r\nRyder attempted to argue back and stand up from the chair but Micah belly bumped back into his seat before grabbing a milkshake and holding Ryder's mouth open, pouring it down his throat with ease.  Micah positioned himself in Ryder's laps - his own weight and huge muscle gut pinning him down as he poured two more down Ryder's throat before shoving a burger into his mouth.  Ryder groaned and gave up, allowing the massive lacrosse player to stuff him rather than argue back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang for class but Micah didn't care - even though he knew he'd be punished by Puck and probably forced to stuff him until he's too full to work out in front of the class.  He grinned as he force fed Ryder another burger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder was cursing Jake mentally as the force-feeding continued. He just had to do Trevor without Micah's permission. Micah was relentless and only allowed brief moments for air or burps before resuming. In a way though, Ryder was also impressed with Micah's knack of knowing the right moments to let him breathe and when to stuff without choking him. Ryder also found it kind of hot having the big beefy blonde's weight trap him, the massive muscle gut and ginormous pecs in his face and that angry determined look...but it was painful. Ryder had quickly figured out that there was no dealing with a sexy, angry Micah and that only caused Micah to go even harder so he tried to sit back to his fate as Michah filled him up with more than he ever had before, even more than at Danny's party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple shakes went down easy enough and Ryder enjoyed the smooth chocolate flavor. The first couple hamburgers as well settled nicely, though a bit sooner than Ryder would have liked. Ryder watched as his stomach bloated out which would have horrified him before, and still did slightly, but hanging with all the huge men of McKinnley certainly changed conceptions and he didn't mind some of the extra pounds. But he was beginning to feel really full and heavy after five hamburgers and three milkshakes. Micah let up for a moment and Ryder breathed in relief as he let out a massive belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp, Michah please, I'm really full. You got your revenge for Trevor so please stop now.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice one, didn't think you had it in you.\" He reached out a hand and rubbed Ryder's bloated belly which had sphered out from the burgers and shake. Poking his fingers, Micah shook his head. \"You've gotten nice and big but you still have just a little bit room in you so not until you're completely stuffed for sure.\" Ryder groaned as Micah resumed shoveling in another hamburger and alternating with yet another chocolate shake. In all, Micah only let up after about seven of the massive hamburgers and four large shakes. Letting up, Micah stood back and admired seeing Ryder lay their, breathing heavily and drained, his belly absolutely stuffed which was more than anything Ryder had ever felt in his life. He was more stuffed now than at Puck's party or going to the all you can eat place. Both could see the big round sphere of a gut Ryder had sitting on his lap, forcing his shirt more than half-way up. When Micah patted it, it was hard and made a drumming noise and Ryder belched at the sudden pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I think you're done.\" Micah said in amazement. \"Looking big little man.\" Ryder groaned as he rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Micah nodded in response because despite Ryder being a comparative twink, he had eaten half of what Trevor did earlier and these were pretty big burgers and shakes. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, quite impressive.\" It was at that moment then that the door burst open, the chair skidding away as Puck came in. <br>\r\n\"So there you two are, what's going on?\" Puck demanded.<br>\r\n\"I was helping Ryder along,\" Micah said innocently but Puck rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know about Trevor. Sorry Jake didn't ask you but he was worried about Ryder when he realized you two were missing. You missed half of Gym. Though I got to say, I don't think Ryder is going to be able to participate.\" Puck strolled over and laid a hand on Ryder's belly, pinching, feeling the heft and weight. \"Damn, this is one fine feeding job I got to say.\" Ryder groaned in agony.<br>\r\n\"I actually would disagree...\" Ryder mumbled but Puck ignored because that was normal after such an intense session like Micah had just given Ryder. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Micah said. Puck looked up at the blonde and smirked.<br>\r\n\"Normally, I would have made you pay for stuffing someone without permission, especially my brother's boyfriend. Instead however, I got something else in mind.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Micah asked, hopeful and trying not to show it though both Ryder and Puck could easily tell. Puck smirked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. You did such a good job helping Ryder that I'm going to give you another task.\"<br>\r\n\"Which is?\" <br>\r\n\"Feeding me,\" Puck said simply. The attempted nonchalant look on Micah's face completely melted away and he was just surprised. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" Micah had heard but he wondered if he had heard wrong.<br>\r\n\"I want you to stuff me. That will be your new job,\" Puck said grinning. \"You're the best feeder I've seen since this side of...well, me.\"<br>\r\n\"Well thanks, coming from you that's an extreme amount of praise but...what?!\" reiterated Micah.<br>\r\n\"You know my goal is to be one of the biggest massive, muscular with some gut guy ever.\" Puck said. Micah nodded. \"Well I've been plateauing recently, and I'm kind of stuck. I've gotten about as much muscle compared to fat as I could obtain so far but now I'm falling short. My new goal is 600 pounds and the only way to break through this streak would be to accept that I'm going to need to switch it up and turn to a more fat diet and just consume calories and relax which isn't something I have personally done in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And you want me to...?\" Micah asked, making sure he understood.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Puck nodded. \"You did such a good job with Ryder that I trust you are going to do the same for me. As further incentive, we could call it part of your grade. The more you make me grow, the better your grade. Or if not, I guess a stuffing for you in return for Ryder...\"<br>\r\n\"No, no, that's fine,\" Micah said. \"I'm jut surprised that you're asking me and not Danny or Dave or Jake or somebody.\"<br>\r\n\"I need someone who is committed and is going to focus on helping me grow. Jake's would be too easy-going on me, Dave would eat more of the food, as would Danny. Besides, you're still focused on the muscle aspect, despite your nice belly that bloomed with it and I know you'll do a good job both for good grades and to not be punished.<br>\r\n\"Well okay then,\" Micah said. \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n\"Follow me to the office and bring Ryder won't you?\" Puck watched as Micah deadlifted Ryder's weight onto his thick shoulders and carried him out, Ryder's head occasionally bumping against that solid back. When they approached Puck's office, they saw Jake waiting for them there. <br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" asked Jake. <br>\r\n\"As you know, Micah doesn't like it when people without asking take it upon themselves to feed Trevor so he stuffed Ryder, really good I might add. To end this feud though, I'm going to give you guys an official assignment. Jake will be feeding Trevor and helping him get bigger while Micah will be feeing me and Ryder.\"<br>\r\n\"No that's not...did you just say you and Ryder?\" Jake asked, surprised as well. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck said grinning. <br>\r\n\"I'm confused,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n\"Micah is going to help me get over my slump and help me get even bigger,\" Puck said, patting his gut. \"I'm also going to join you guys in bulking up as Micah will hopefully get me to at least 600 or preferably more pounds.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay...why Micah and not Dave or me?\" asked Jake, a little sad. Puck reached over and ruffled his brother's head. <br>\r\n\"You still can and I'm going to need as much help as I can possibly get. As you can tell, I'm already quite a big man so this is going to be tough. But Micah is going to be my official feeder since he can be both extremely devoted and he is the best natural feeder after myself that I have ever seen, believe it or not. Besides, you will get to feed Trevor in exchange, right Micah?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Micah said. \"There'll be no problems with you feeding Trevor if I know and I get to be helping Ryder not to mention the Puckasaurus to grow. I've been waiting for that opportunity for a while,\" Micah said determined and looked straight at Puck,. Puck grinned and rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n\"I'm counting on it.\" Jake looked at Ryder on Micah's back. <br>\r\n\"Can you put him down now please?\" he asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Micah carefully lays him down and Jake examines Ryder. Ryder had fallen asleep when being carried by Micah so Jake tenderly brushed Ryder's hair and laid a kiss on Ryder before his fingers traced down to Ryder's exposed bloated stomach. His eyebrows widened comedically when he saw and felt how big it was. <br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Jake said looking over to Micah. \"What did you do to him?\"<br>\r\n\"Fed him seven hamburgers and four shakes of the kind you fed Trevor.\"<br>\r\n\"And it actually fit without him throwing up?!\" Jake was surprised and impressed. Those were actually pretty large sizes and Trevor was almost 2.5 times Ryder's weight and only ate twice as much. Granted, Trevor had been beyond stuffed by multiple meals the previous days but still, he couldn't actually believe Ryder actually was able to hold that much. He rubbed Ryder's belly, loving the solid thickness. As angry as he was that Micah had done it, he was honestly impressed. Maybe Puck's plan was a good idea since Ryder was looking fine with that solid gut. It kept forcing Ryder's shirt up as he breathed in slumber and those pants were definitely looking a little tight. Jake unbuttoned them for Ryder, giving his stomach room to relax and smiled as he rubbed it and laid his head down. No wonder Ryder liked him growing so much, it sure was an experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck went to enter his small office door and got stuck. He really wished that his office didn't have such a small door and he was too distracted by the thought of Micah feeding him to remember to turn properly. Letting out a muffled curse, he wiggled.\"Aww crap, got stuck. Micah, Blaine, can you help me?\" Blaine must have been inside and pulling since Micah didn't see him but they wiggled Puck in. Micah saw Blaine again and cringed just a little. There was good reason that Blaine was called butterball since he was pretty much pure round lard of fat. He was an okay person but sheesh was Blaine fat with pretty much no muscle. It also didn't help that although most outfits were small on Blaine that this one looked really tight and small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you and Blaine are going to help feed me and break my slump,\" Puck said. \"Start with the weight gainer shakes,\" Puck said pointing. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes, sir!\"  Blaine said to his teacher, waddling over to the large refrigerator that Puck had installed in his office.  Micah watched as the 352 pound classmate of his waddled over - his eyes watching as Blaine's enormous fat ass jiggled and bounced side to side in his incredibly small PE uniform.  Blaine's fat thighs rubbed together and his enormous lovehandles bounced over his skin tight shorts.  It wasn't that Micah hated Blaine or thought his fat was disgusting - after all he was dating Trevor was more fat than muscle and he thought he was the sexiest man alive - he just didn't understand why ANYBODY would want to be JUST fat?  At least men like Trevor and Puck had muscle AND fat.  Thats what Micah found attractive.  He even thought Sam, the fattest and heaviest student in school, was more attractive than Blaine because Sam had muscle to go along with huge amounts of plush girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaine opened the fridge Micah saw that it was stocked entirely with nothing but one gallon milk jugs that had been emptied and filled with Puck's signature brand of gainer shake.  Puck leaned over to Micah and whispered to him, \"Look, I know that you don't find butterballs like Blaine that attractive.\"<br>\r\n\"But?\"  Micah said, knowing there was a but.<br>\r\n\"But I need to get over that.  The two of you are going to be working together to fatten me up and I can't have you spending the entire time being grossed out over something as silly as how fat Blaine is.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\nMicah sighed, \"Yeah thats true.  I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n\"Good because you'll probably end up fucking at some point during this.\"  Puck said smugly.<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling.\"  Micah said, sighing.  If thats what Puck wanted than Micah was gonna have to just get over it.  Maybe he could give Blaine some weight training exercises to build up muscle during all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaine was getting everything ready for Puck by the coach near in his office, Puck waddled over to the door to his office - making sure not to let his belly go too far in as to avoid it getting stuck, \"Okay, everybody, heres whats going on.  I'll be in here getting this tank of my filled up-\" Puck said as he smacked his insane huge musclegut, \"-so while I'm doing that I expect every one of you to push it today.\"  Puck looked over at Trevor, who's huge chunky gut was still bloated from Jake's feeding session, \"Trevor, starting tomorrow you and Ryder are on what I call the 'fat bulking regimen'.  You'll be doing non-stop eating and gaining to help raise your body fat percentage.  Jake, you and Micah are on the 'muscle bulking regimen'.  Strict diet to help define your muscles more and non-stop workouts.  Everybody else is to stick to their usual individualized work out plans.\"  Puck said before and shutting the door on his gigantic students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck waddled over to the old worn out couch the school had given him and grunted as he plopped his massive fat ass down on it.  The weight of Puck's beefy 550 pound body rest on the couch was enough to make it creak and groan under him.  Puck spread his gigantic legs wide, his PE coach shorts barely straining to keep together around them, and Puck sighed happily as he felt his giant gut settle between his thighs, \"Okay, boys.  Lets get started!  Blaine you can go first.  Micah you have to go change into your uniform.  School policy.\"<br>\r\nMicah rolled his eyes and left to change.<br>\r\n\"So,\" Blaine said grabbing one of the 6 one gallon jugs, \"You ready, sir?\"<br>\r\n\"Depends.\"  Puck said, \"Are you ready to fatten me up, butterball?\"<br>\r\nPuck nodded happily and walked behind the couch and Puck.  He unscrewed the lid of the gainer shake - which was made with real chocolate ice cream - and placed the open lid to Puck's mouth.  Blaine tipped it back as Puck rested his monster beefy arms on the back of the couch and took big powerful swallows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Puck less than a minute to drink down the entire full gallon and Blaine could already see a visible difference in Puck's gut size.  As Puck let out a huge, long belch Blaine tossed the drained milk jug aside and reached down, rubbing Puck's enormous pecs and playing with his rock hard nipples.<br>\r\nPuck groaned happily as Blaine reached over and grabbed another jug, pouring it Puck's throat like the last one.  Puck sucked down the thick liquid happily, loving the taste and finishing off the entire second gallon with ease.<br>\r\nAs Blaine started feeding Puck the third jug Micah entered the room and instantly got hard at the sight of Puck being fed.<br>\r\nWithout a second though Micah walked over and started rubbing Puck's giant, spherical belly, amazed by the sheer size of it.  Micah reached underneath and hefted the huge thing up, completely in lust with how heavy it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaine finished stuffing the last jug into Puck's quickly growing gut he and Micah switched places.  Micah grabbed the fourth jug and held Puck's mouth open, forcing shake down his throat in his usual dominating way.  Puck swallowed it down as Blaine rubbed and worshipped Puck's gut - both his and Micah's dicks rock hard in their PE clothes.  Micah tossed aside the fourth jug and quickly started filling Puck's gut up with the 5th.  Blaine could physically feel Puck's gigantic ball belly get bigger beneath his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck sucked down the last drop of the fifth gallon jug Micah tossed it aside before leaning down and shoving his tongue down Puck's mouth - making out with him as he rubbed and worshipped Puck's flexed biceps and massive pecs.  Blaine leaned foreward, straddling Puck's swollen stuffed gut, as Micah moved back and Blaine started to make out with Puck as he grinned his hard cock - still clothed in his shorts, against Puck's gut.  Micah waited, knowing he would have to do this eventually, and as soon as Blaine pulled back Micah pulled the shorter, fatter chub into a hard kiss.  Their tongues swirled around as Blaine grinded into Puck's hard bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah reached down and squeezed Blaine's fat, squishy ass - honestly surprised to feel some very solid and powerful muscles underneath Blaine's layers of fat.  Puck grinned, \"Like what you feel, Mic?  Blaine might not be the most muscular but I made sure to give butterball here a huge beefy ass.  He is a -BUUURP-... ooof.... massive cock hound bottom after all.\"  Puck said as ran his hands over the side of his huge spherical gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah pulled back, \"Not bad, fatass.\"  Micah said before forcing the last jug down Puck's throat.  Puck chugged and chugged as Blaine massaged and worshipped his growing gut.  Once the final jug was swallowed down into Puck's enormous belly Puck let out a massive belch that shook his whole body.  Just as he finished Micah surprised Puck by shoving the lid of a 7th jug into his mouth, \"You DID pick me because I'm forceful.\"  Micah whispered to Puck seductively as Puck drained the last jug Micah had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck groaned, actually unable to move from how stuffed he was.  His stomach had swelled up to twice it's size and because of how filling and thick those shakes are Puck knew he'd be stuck there until at least the end of class.<br>\r\nBlaine and Micah stood side by side, admiring their work, \"You really had us go all out on day one, Coach.\"  Blaine said, \"With the amount of shakes you guzzled down you're probably going to gain 30 - 40 pounds!\"<br>\r\n\"Hot.\"  Micah muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n\"Uuuuugh... thanks you two...\"  The bell rang and Puck smiled, \"You two get A's for the day.  Head off to class.  I'll be here digesting all day... if you need me.\"  Puck said, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah turned on the TV before the two headed out, leaving their hugely bloated coach along to digest and fatten up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So what did you guys do?\" Trevor asked Micah as they headed towards Puck's office. Micah grinned.<br>\r\n\"So me and Blaine were paired up to stuff Coach Puck up. It was great.\" Micah said teasing.<br>\r\n\"No, tell me the juicy parts! I know Puck, there was other stuff going on too so tell me! I need to know what to fantasize or have you do later.\"<br>\r\n\"So Blaine and I took turns filling the beast up with gainer shake. Can you believe we actually got 7 down his throat?\" Trevor stopped.<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, there is no way you got seven gallons down Puck's throat. Even I only managed two and an half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true I swear. Then me and Blaine took turns feeling and worshipping, those humongous beefy arms, massive pecs, ginormous gut...\" Micah trailed off with a silly happy expression. \"Um yeah. Then me and butterball Blaine made out because Puck likes to watch that and Blaine, although obscenely fat, has some surprising strength and muscle buried way, way beneath that mound of blubber.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, it's Puck. He wouldn't transform someone without giving them mobility,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I might see if Blaine would consider doing strength exercises with me, to you know, carry all that fat. I don't understand why someone would want to be a complete chub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like and you've helped me being bigger too,\" Trevor said rubbing his gut pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and babe, that's just hot as fuck. It's just you also got strength and muscle too which isn't so obvious in Blaine although I got to say he gets points for mobility and that I do admit he is stronger than I thought.\" Trevor and Micah reached Puck's office and entered, finding Puck still on the coach, awkwardly asleep. Micah again wondered how the couch hasn't broken yet underneath Puck's weight since it sure was creaking and he took up most of the room. Even from the distance of the door, it looked enormous. Trevor and Micah quietly slipped in and Trevor rushed over to the couch as he gently prodded Puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Puck, you awake?\" Micah rolled his eyes when Puck let out an especially loud snoring noise. <br>\r\n\"No he's not.\" Micah said and Trevor shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Just checking.\" He poked Puck's stomach. Then poked it a few more times. \"Wow,\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Micah asked coming closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It jiggles.\" And so it did. Although it wasn't much, there was a certain give when Trevor poked and when he moved it, there was the slightest joggle.<br>\r\n\"He's definitely gotten fatter,\" Trevor diagnosed. Micah moved beside and touched too. Although Puck's gut was still mostly solid, there was the slightest noticeable give and he actually got an inch or two into the balloon. It was...weirder than Micah expected. It must have not really sunk in before but now it was. Puck was going to be getting fat. It honestly just blew his mind since Puck had always been a hard body. A monster-beast-man that started large and somehow became a behemoth and even as he inflated, that belly of his was as solid as a fucking rock all the time and he sweated non-essential fat like crazy. It was both disappointing and exhilarating. Disappointing because, well, it was Puck and that was a body to admire but exhilaration because it pretty much sealed the deal of him being the undisputed champion and best muscle-gut ratio around. Suddenly, there was a loud cavernous yawn and both Micah and Trevor froze as Puck woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi,\" Trevor said awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Sup,\" added Micah.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Puck said yawning, scratching his belly and letting out another impressive belch. \"Did it work?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can say that,\" Micah said. \"You're not as hard in the stomach as you used to be and there is a slight jiggle.\"<br>\r\n\"Sweet,\" Puck said. \"What about other places?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um let me check,\" Micah said. He looked over. \"Besides the soft jiggle, you've definitely added some girth on your manly gut.\" He reached and squeezed Puck's pecs, with admiration. \"Slight softness here too but kind of make it better. You've got an amazing chest.\" He knew what Puck was going to ask next so he had Trevor come over and together with a lot of force, yanked Puck up eventually from the couch. Micah squeezed Puck's butt. \"Yeah, nice, thick, and juicy.\" Trevor felt as well and grinning, concurred. Puck took a few steps, swaying a little and his gut and body actually bounced a little with the motion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is some growth,\" Micah said. Suddenly Jake came in.<br>\r\n\"Hey ready to-uh hey?\" Jake said seeing Puck wasn't alone.<br>\r\n\"Hi?\" Micah said awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Hey Jake,\" Trevor just said happily. <br>\r\n\"So uh, what's going on?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Your brother's gotten fatter.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, no way.\" <br>\r\n\"Way.\" <br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Jake walked up to Puck and tested for himself. <br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you did. How?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I need to keep growing little bro. You know the need? I was getting stuck and the only way to get out would be some drastic measures. 7 gallons of the shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7 gallons?\" Jake was stunned from the sheer thought. \"That's just incredible. How much did you put on?\" Puck shrugged and Jake grinned. <br>\r\n\"Let's find out.\" They pulled out Puck's special industrial scale that could measure up to a ton and Puck got on. Jake whistled seeing the number.<br>\r\n\"Well bro, it looks like you're currently at 570. But drinking 7 gallons. How did you not explode?\"<br>\r\n\"Sheer will and size,\" Puck muttered. Jake patted Puck's belly in encouragement. <br>\r\n\"The goal was 600 right? You're going to cross that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually,\" Puck said plopping down winded. \"But ugh, oh my god those shakes. I can eat mountains and mountains of food but those shakes are kicking my ass at the moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh...I'm on muscle?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n\"Yep. You and Micah will be focused exclusively on your muscle devolpement and feeding Trevor and Ryder.\" Jake turned to Micah.<br>\r\n\"Please don't kill Ryder, I need him okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...but he's sure going to balloon up paired with me.\"<br>\r\n\"That's true...stuff him real good for me.\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Oh I will. He won't be such a twig for long.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure to please Trevor.\"<br>\r\n\"You do that.\" They went silent. <br>\r\n\"So...I'm going to need the car,\" Jake said. \"I guess I'll be driving us home since you're in no condition to drive?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fine.\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder if you'll still barely fit the car seat or if you're going to have to sit in the back.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smartass,\" Puck grinned. \"See you guys tomorrow.\" Jake, Trevor, and Micah all helped Puck hobble to the car.<br>\r\n\"Later guys,\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, later.\" Jake got in the car and Micah waved a hand in goodbye which Jake grinned at. He bet that he and Micah were going to get to be very close friends in the upcoming days ahead. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Jake, Puck, and Ryder arrived at their house they could smell the strong scents of meats and pizza. Dave came out the door and greeted them. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I heard you guys were coming and took the liberty of ordering some pizza if that's okay with you.\" Dave then turned to Puck. \"So is it true? I've heard you're going back to trying to gain more size.\" Puck nodded and patted his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it is. I thought it was time to put on a bit more size anyways just to retain my dominant spot. There sure are a lot more people coming close, not that anyone around is near my size, but more than before. Plus I just really need to step up my game and I was kind of tired  being stuck and wanting to get past the limits.\" Dave nodded happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well come on in, you're just in time since the pizza only arrived just minutes before you arrived so we can get started right now.\" They sat in the living room while Dave brought back a stack, then another, and then another. \"I just went ahead and ordered 40 boxes since you guys must be starving. I also have breadsticks and for dessert got a bunch of icecream.\" Puck nodded and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can count on you always babe. Anyhow guys its an underwear only dinner, to show our gains.\" Immediately everyone started stripping and Ryder blushed because no matter how long he has been around the Puckerman and Dave household, the random underwear only times was still intimidating and he felt so utterly small next to such giants of men. It did make for an awesome view though and as awkward as he felt, he still smiled when he saw Jake's huge massive body. Jake smiled back as he patted Ryder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" Jake said squeezing Ryder's belly which was still slightly bloated from Micah's stuffing him. \"You look so hot, I'm glad you've finally joined us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have much choice in the matter but hanging out with you guys sure does take a toll. It'll still take a while before I'm big as you though,\" Ryder punched lightly against Jake's big stomach and jiggled it. \"This thing is going to be firmed up soon. You're going to be the next Puck with that solid muscle gut and as attractive as the jiggle is, you're going to be amazing at being an a+ solid beef muscle god.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you approve,\" Jake smirked. \"Bro, I'm going to be taking your place soon enough.\" <br>\r\n\"In your dreams. But enough chitter-chatter, I'm starving! Bring out the pizza!\" Dave brought out plates and glasses for everyone and Puck brought out  numerous two liter bottles of cream soda. \"It's a special night boys so I got cream soda.\" Jake grinned excitedly and Ryder made a mental note that cream soda was something Jake loved. Sitting down, Puck grabbed a couple of boxes, Dave grabbed a couple of boxes, Jake grabbed a couple of boxes, and Ryder grabbed a box. Opening them, they all sighed at the delicious smell of the meat pizza before beginning to ravish it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder was still full from the meal with Micah, something which he definitely wasn't happy with Jake about, but he was going to make Jake happy and try to eat as much as he could. He knew that wasn't going to be a problem with Puck, Jake, or Dave though he did wonder how good Puck was going to do after that extremely filling lunch of those weight gain shakes Blaine and Micah had poured down his throat. For now, Puck seemed fine as he was tearing through his pizza like it was the last pizza ever at mind-blowing speed. He could see that Jake too was trying to take advantage of his last day before he tightened up and worked on reducing the flabby bits and be a solid bull. Concentrating on his pizza, Ryder tried to eat it and due to his recent practice was able to continue on and swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all ate their pizza and washed it down with cream soda, pausing every now and then to belch loudly before continuing on and they could all see as their stomachs filled up and expanded with pizza and soda. Ryder was obviously way behind, just calmly and methodically trying to eat his pizza and savoring the flavor. Every now and then he could see Jake in between his pizza and drink, look over and grin silly at the sight of Ryder's stomach. It was nothing compared to everyone else's but Ryder was finally getting a gut and Jake couldn't be more proud. He especially grinned when he saw Ryder cringe and unbutton his tight pants and his little gut spilled out to take up space. It wasn't as little as it was earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all watched Puck though because it was hard not to as he shoveled pizza after pizza into his gaping maw of a mouth in record time. It was around box 12 though that he started slowing down. Dave looked concerned. \"What's the matter?\" Puck paused, thumped his chest and burped extremely loud before groaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPP, ugh so full,\" he grunted, pushing down on his belly and burping again. \"Those shakes from lunch...man I knew I was good. But ugh...man its been a while since I've been feeling so stuffed like this its amazing.\" Putting down his pizza, Puck tried to get up but couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me,\" Dave said as he walked over and started rubbing Puck's belly. \"Wow this thing is tight,\" Dave said as he rubbed Puck's monster gut.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is,\" Puck said proudly before groaning. \"Oh yeah that's the spot.\" Grinning Jake stands up to join Dave as they both started rubbing. Feeling stuffed himself, Ryder still crawled over and joined in putting his hands on Puck's massive gut as well which was so big that they all had their hands on it and still had space to move easy with Jake and Dave running soothing circles. It was a tight drum filled with pizza, soda, and that shake and they tried to soothe the rumbling beast which growled in attempts to digest. Ryder, Jake, and Dave were all in heaven as they rubbed Puck's gut and after some more ridiculously strong proud belches, Puck flopped back and was ready for dessert. All in all the 40 boxes were eaten: 15 by Dave, 13 by Puck, 10 by Jake and 2 by Ryder whose stomach definitely bulged out more compared to earlier. Ryder didn't want to eat anymore but once the breadsticks were out, found himself scarfing a couple down. Puck passed on breadsticks since he only really had room for the massive dessert he was sure would follow and he already had enough bread. Jake and Dave ate their breadsticks before turning to the next part which was dessert. Dave and Jake got up, the only ones really able to at this point though they definitely were getting a bit wobbly with their massive guts bouncing, and came back with the big bowls and massive containers of chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate sauce, and whip cream. Scooping a big mound for everyone, both Ryder and Puck moaned at seeing the size of the bowls of ice cream they had. Normally Puck would have been excited and in love but now he was really feeling it like he was a newbie again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" he groaned breathlessly. \"I don't think I can do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can,\" Dave said. \"You're Puck and you don't back down and as you're still conscious, you still have room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine let's get this over with. Come on and feed me.\" Using Puck's stomach as a table, Dave started feeding Puck, humming some song as he did so. Bite after bite of ice cream went in, the glazed stupor coming over Puck's eyes from complete satiation. Knowing he did not have much time, Dave sped the feeding up, shoveling spoonful after spoonful into Puck's mouth. Pretty soon the bowl was empty and Puck was gone with it as well, head back and snoring, his stomach barely rising as it was already so pushed out. Ryder wasn't sure about his ice cream but Jake came by and started feeding him as well. With frequent belly rubs and quick spoonfulls, Ryder also managed to finish his dessert, beyond bloated and full. He was only vaguely aware but grinned when he felt Jake pour chocolate sauce onto Ryder's stomach before licking it off, his tongue especially teasing the smooth arching planes of Ryder's stuffed gut. Liking Jake's idea, Dave did the same to Puck, having much more of an area to go on. Once finished worshiping their sexy stuffed hot boyfriends, Jake and Dave got some ice cream for themselves to join them in the utterly stuffed disassociated state. It wasn't long before all four were lying there on the floor, their bellies massively stuffed of delicious food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The red lights of Jake's digital clock read 10:14 AM.  Ryder stretched and let out a big yawn before looking down at his enormous, musclechub boyfriend and smiling; Jake was always so handsome while he was sleeping.  Ryder was about to lie back down and snuggle into Jake's large stomach but there was a knock on the bedroom door.  Ryder looked over at it and watched as the door was pushed open by Puck's gigantic belly.  The massive 570 pound man struggled to get into the bedroom; his monster sized gut and insanely fat thighs and hips caused him to get wedged in the door frame but after a little bit of struggling Puck made it out, his entire body jiggling as he regained his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"PHEW!\"  Puck said, wiping sweat from his forehead, \"I really need to get these door frames widened.  I'm getting too big to get through them.\"<br>\r\nRyder chuckled, \"Its actually kinda hot.\" he said, smiling at Puck.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Puck said with a sly grin, \"Well if thats the case maybe I'll keep them this size for a while longer.\"<br>\r\nRyder couldn't help but blush a bit at the sight of Puck; the behemoth of a man was standing there completely naked save for the skin tight star wars briefs that could barely contain his beefy thighs, fat hips, and gigantic ass.<br>\r\nPuck grinned at Ryder and slapped his belly which jiggled with newly formed fat from the 7 gallons of gainer shake, 13 pizzas, soda, and ice cream he had last night, \"I put on 10 more pounds after last night: I'm up to 580 now.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats just... WOW.\"  Ryder said, turned on by the size of his boyfriend's brother.<br>\r\n\"Right?  I'm gonna have to increase my goal to 700 instead of 6.  I gotta get the best out of Micah and Blaine's feeding sessions.\" Puck said before turning around towards the door, \"Speaking of, Ryder, I came in here to get you and Jake.  Micah and Trevor are downstairs waiting for you guys.  I've gotta go to school and fill out some paperwork but Dave is downstairs cooking breakfast.\"  Puck said before leaving the room - but not before spending a good two minutes struggling to get his fat body through the small doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Puck left Ryder woke Jake up and the two headed for a quick shower.  Both Jake and Ryder weighed themselves before heading out to get dressed - Jake had put on a good 8 pounds bring his weight up to 344 while Ryder had only put on 5 putting him at 175.  Ryder blushed at the idea of his body getting bigger and he and Jake made out a little in the bathroom; dripping wet from their shower still before going to get dressed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jake threw on a gray, skin tight v-neck that exposed the very bottom of his overhanging belly, a military green overshirt, brown kahkis, and a pair of sneakers.  Ryder put on on a yellow t-shirt with a short sleeve blue plaid shirt on top, cargo shorts, and a pair of flip flops.  The two headed downstairs to see Micah and Trevor and the four said hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Micah was wearing a t-shirt he had torn up to work out in; the sleeves and sides of the black shirt were ripped open, revealing Micah's muscular arms, lats, pecs, and huge stomach from the side, and only a thin piece of fabric held it together at the bottom.  He work a pair of gray work out shorts with green piping and bright neon green work out sneakers.  Trevor was wearing a blue, white, and gray stripped tank top that clearly did not fit him anymore.  The tank was skin tight and followed the curves of his fat body exactly and only covered half of his large fat gut, the rest of it was exposed for all to see and hung down over his crotch.  He also had on a pair of demin, skin tight shorts and slip on sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice tank.\"  Ryder said to Trevor, who flashed his pudgy grin.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  Trev said, \"People say that horizontal stripes make you look fat - which is why they're my favorite kind!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't need stripes to make you look fatter, babe.\"  Micah said playfully.<br>\r\n\"I don't need them but I want them.  The fatter I look the better!\"  Trev said, jiggling his exposed belly.<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\"  Jake said, rubbing Trevor's gut.<br>\r\n\"So,\" Ryder said, looking up at his enormously tall and beefy feeder, \"Whats the plan?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you and Trev are on the fat bulking plan so I'm gonna take you today and get you nice and plump.\"  Micah said, his enormous hand patting Ryder's beginner belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm taking Trev here to that buffet you, me, Sam, and Blaine all hit up that day.  I'm gonna BLOW you up, big guy.\"<br>\r\nThe grin on Trevor's face was enormous; he could barely contain his excitement at getting fatter!<br>\r\n\"What about us?\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"I was thinking you and I could chill here with Puck and Dave.  With Dave's cooking and my roughness you'll be fatter in no time.\"  Micah said.<br>\r\nWith the Trevor and Jake headed out and drove off in Jake's car.  Once gone, Micah grabbed Ryder by the back of his shirt, lifted him off the ground, and tossed him onto the couch, \"Now you stay right there and relax, pretty boy.  Dave and I are gonna whip up a nice, big breakfast for you.  In the mean time,\" Micah said, reaching into a plastic big on the table and dropping two big pink boxes on Ryder's lap, \"Eat up.  I expect all 2 dozen of those doughnuts to be gone when your breakfast is finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ryder gulped before taking a big breath, pulling off his shirts so they don't get dirty, opening up the first box, and shoving an entire glazed doughnut in his mouth.  He could already tell today was going to be rough.  Micah was gone for about an hour cooking with Dave, which gave Ryder plenty of time to eat those huge doughnuts which were at least the size of Ryder's head.  He swallowed down mouthful after mouthful, forcing himself to eat.  By the time Micah came in with a monster stack of 20 pancakes and at least 3 pounds of bacon, Ryder had</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder had only finished a box by the time that Micah walked in. Micah looked at the still full box and back to Ryder. \"You only ate 12 in an hour?\" he stated. Ryder nodded, his mouth twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those donuts are huge and struggling to stay down. I'm amazed I even at this many.\" Micah nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah understandable. I just had to see your benchmark.\" He came and picked up the empty box, taking it to the trash. \"I won't make you eat the other box, yet. Instead I got you pancakes,\" Micah gestured to the stack he had placed down on the table. Ryder groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can,\" Ryder said, patting his belly. \"I'm kind of full from those donuts.\" Micah moved over and placed a large hand on Ryder's belly, feeling it. \"No, you're not done. You still have plenty of room to grow with. Its my job to help you turn this little gut of yours into a tank to be proud of and how can that happen if you don't eat properly? Dealing with Trevor, I know you still can and we're not done until you're literally too stuffed to move.\" Micah pulled out another plate and put three of the twenty pancakes onto it. Taking out syrup he doused the pile with a good amount of syrup, whip cream, and butter before pushing it over to Ryder. \"They're chocolate chip pancakes,\" Micah informed Ryder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting them into bite size pieces and with Micah's encouragement, Ryder began to eat the pancakes. Surprised, he stopped chewing for a sec before moaning. The pancakes were rich and dense chocolate wonders of delight. It was absolutely phenomenal. Each and every bite was fluffy pancake heaven and slid down much easier than the donuts had, not that the donuts were bad more manageable, less sticky, but despite the rich denseness still somehow lighter in the end. Thanks to his new appetite he had recently been building he managed to eat through the first three pancakes easily, despite his stomach being in knots from donuts and nervousness. Grinning, Micah dropped another three and watched as Ryder turned to wolf those down as well. Dave sure could cook and he was going to have to have some himself, the smell of chocolate was strong and beginning to get to him. Seeing Ryder was doing fine on this second batch, he headed into the kitchen where Dave was still cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any pancakes?\" Micah asked and Dave nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course there is, we have a lot big guy. Help yourself.\" Micah grinned as he took his own heaping plate of pancakes and bacon. Walking back to the living room, he watched Ryder scarf down the pancakes. Ryder didn't seem aware how much his appetite had grown with the Puckerman's but it was showing as Ryder tore through the fluffy pancakes. Plus, they really were just that good but after those dozen test donuts, Ryder was amazingly still kicking. His gut was naturally already bigger and expanding with bite after bite and it was making Micah pretty horny to watch. Ryder was normally a disappointingly skinny twink but watching him now go was fascinating. Micah was shocked when Ryder finished the next stack of three and asked for more, starting on seven through nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure learning to let loose huh?\" Micah asked, in between bites. Ryder took a pause between bites and nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, these are really great.\" Unconsciously patting his stomach, Ryder let out a belch before taking more bites of pancake. <br>\r\n\"Mmh these are so good, I could eat these all day,\" he groaned in delight. Micah nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, these really are good pancakes.\" Some of the best he ever had. Micah considered himself a good cook but he couldn't make pancakes quite like these like Dave had. He grinned as he rubbed his own huge stomach. He'd get utterly massive if he ate Dave's pancakes everyday so it was a good thing he didn't. He loved being big after all but he wasn't going in the same direction that Ryder and Puck were towards fat. He was actually somewhat amazed by how cool Ryder was towards the idea now. Well, a little skeptical but more or less willing to go along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around the twelfth pancake that Ryder's spree had come to an end and slow down drastically. Ryder suddenly stopped and groaned as his fork clattered to his plate. Looking at his stomach, Ryder couldn't believe how distended it was. A rounded gut pushed over the edge of his waist-paints, no traces of his old abs remaining to be seen anywhere. He was 'well and truly fat' now he thought because while still not anywhere near the size of everyone else, he was his fattest ever and straining his last pair of loose pants. He was going to finally have to upgrade his wardrobe as his pants were beginning to pinch around his fleshier middle and no longer contain it. Jake had been thrilled to see that morning how Ryder's shirts were beginning to get tight and emphasize his little paunch and ride up a little. All was fair in love and war since Ryder had continuously enjoyed Jake's happening of that and now it was Jake's turn to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiggling his gut, Ryder was surprised by how heavy it was. Was that really him? He opened his mouth and when what came out was a massive belch that surprised him, he realized it was. Micah grinned. \"Nice one,\" he complimented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, sure,\" Ryder said. Fumbling with his pants button, Ryder had to let the last pair of loose pants that he had which were now feeling quite confining, loose. His belly surged forward a bit more to fill up space and Ryder sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feeling?\" Micah asked. <br>\r\n\"Like a stuffed pig,\" Ryder said. Micah came forward, the bottom of his own massive gut having forced apart the barely held together shirt and rising a little. As he brushed against Ryder's stomach, their own bellies touched and Ryder got a chill. Feeling Ryder's stomach for a moment, Micah jiggled and felt it., <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet, there is still a little more room in the tank.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm stuffed,\" Ryder said dubiously.<br>\r\n\"Nope, there is still some room.\" Micah started cutting up the remaining pancakes before putting them on a plate which he delicately balanced on Ryder's gut. \"You're going to finish all this.\" With that, Micah started feeding him. Ryder tried to complain but got ignored and even had it still shoved into his mouth. Ryder got the picture and let Micah feed him, his mind wandering as he chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, his gut getting more and more impossibly fuller yet somehow not exploding. As Micah was on his knees and within close range, Ryder took the opportunity to touch and rub Micah's own thick muscle gut. It was thick and solid, powerful and had only a little jiggle. Pure solid thick beef, even more than Puck's (at the moment), and Jake's. It was darn impressive to say the least and it entertained Ryder while he tried to block out the thought of how much he was eating. Soon the plate was empty and Micah leaned back, his chest and body flexing with the movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" Micah said. \"You ate all the pancakes.\" Ryder struggled to lift his head up to see his even more bloated curved stomach, the plate delicately bouncing on the middle. Micah removed it and began rubbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest, you have impressed me,\" Micah said, rubbing Ryder's bloated gut. \"You did so well at that it was unbelievable. Look at this tank man! Your belly bloomed like mad.\" Ryder couldn't even tell as his stomach was so distended but Micah's hands were a blessing as he rubbed the swollen mound. \"You kind of remind me of Trevor, you look good like this,\" Micah told him. When Ryder's stomach gurgled and another massive belch and fart happened, Micah continued to smirk. \"Yep, you look good like this.\" He resumed rubbing Ryder's gut with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to help you get so beefy and fat you won't believe it. I had thought I was going to have to help a lot more but you actually did a really good job at the beginning. And no, I am not going to force the second box of donuts or the bacon yet, we'll do that later after you've digested and it's physically possible.\" Ryder was relieved to hear that and enjoyed the feeling of Micah's large masculine hands massage his aching belly. Who knows, he really might enjoy this thing and he was definitely looking forward to more time with Micah and Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took Trevor to the buffet knowing they were going to need quantity. Trevor was a ridiculous eater and they were going to need every morsel they could find. He was looking forward to stuffing Trevor again but he also thought about how Micah and Ryder were doing. He hoped Ryder was doing okay and that Micah didn't break him. Shrugging, he got focused on the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Trevor, what shall we start with?\" he asked. Trevor looked around and thought about it before saying....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Really?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really.\"  Trevor replied as he ran his fat, meaty hand over his gigantic gut, \"Whenever I have a big breakfast feast like this I start with as much oatmeal as I can possibly down because it fills my gut really quickly.  I love to load it down with syrup, chocolate syrup, and sugar too.  I don't even chew it I just put the bowl to my lips and chug it down.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh... interesting method.\"  Jake said, placing his underneath Trevor's massive gut and shaking it - watching the fat jiggle back and forth, \"Well then, lets get this tank even bigger.  Have a seat while I load you up.\"  Jake said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor sat down at the booth and knew instantly that today was going to be FUN.  Not only was the 400 pound too big for the big - his massive stomach pressed tight against the table - but Puck had also called in advanced and reserved the ENTIRE buffet for just Jake and Trevor.  Trevor was going to push himself farther than he'd ever gone before today and he couldn't wait to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake returned minutes later pushing a metal cart that was used to carry dirty dishes but instead was carrying 10 big bowls of cinnamon raisin oatmeal that were slathered in chocolate syrup, sugar, and maple syrup, \"Oatmeal just the way you like it!\"  Jake said as he slid all 10 bowls to the table.<br>\r\nWithout a single word Trevor dug in, lifting the first bowl to his lips and chugging the thick oats down.  Jake was amazed as he watched - the oatmeal was very thick but Trevor was drinking it down like it was water.  Trev finished off the first bowl - not spilling a drop - before setting it aside and chugging the next.  Trev loved the way the delicious cinnamon and sugar mixed together with the plump raisins and various syrups.  The oatmeal sat heavy in Trevor's stomach which only made the wrestler want more.  Jake watched the entire event, totally mesmerized and hard at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes went by before Trevor set the last bowl down and licked his lips happily, \"Oh, fuck, that was delicious.\"  Trev said, patting his fat belly.  Even while digging into the table Jake could see that there was a slight difference in size - it hadn't expanded by much but it was clearly larger.  Jake expected this from Trevor - it takes a LOT of food to make him stuffed to bursting.<br>\r\n\"What next?\"  Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm...\" Trevor thought, \"Waffles with melted cheese, sausage, bacon, ham, and eggs in between.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"Its my usual!  If I have the time every morning before class I make three or four.\"  Trev said, patting the top of his gut.<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be sure to double that.\"  Jake said before reaching behind him, \"In the mean time have a snack to keep you busy.\"  Jake said before setting down a massive plate of bacon that weighed at least 5 pounds.  Jake gave Trevor's gut a hard smack before heading off to make his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jake was gone Trevor did what he did best - eat.  The constantly fattening wrestler ate and ate and ate - shoveling crispy strips of bacon into his mouth one after the other only ever pausing to lick the grease from his fingers.  Each piece of bacon was crispier, thicker, and juicier than the last.  Trevor swallowed another bite and reached down for more but all he felt was an empty plate.  The 400 pound wrestler groaned as he leaned back in his chair, rubbing his filling gut.  As Trevor waited he fantasized about getting bigger, fatter, and more muscular.  Surpassing and outweighing Sam and going back to being the heaviest guy on the wrestling team.  The thought made him incredibly horny  - his already skin tight denim shorts getting tighter underneath his heavy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake grinned as he saw the plate empty, \"Good job, dude!\"  The musclechub said as he rubbed Trevor's enormous gut, \"Now, onto THESE bad boys!\"<br>\r\nJake set down a plate of 8 massive handmade breakfast sandwiches, \"Dude, these are HUGE!!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I doubled what you you asked me to make for you.  Enjoy, big guy!!\"</span></div></div>",

The sandwiches waffles were huge and even bigger than what he normally ate but Trevor was in fine form that day. His hunger seemed limitless despite the bowls of oatmeal and giant platter of bacon sitting in his gut. Giving a thumbs up to Jake, he buried his head into the first massive sandwich piece after cutting them all in half so they would actually fit in his hands without dropping. He could feel Jake's eyes on him and he smirked as he chowed down making sure to give a show. The hitch in Jake's breathing allowed Trevor to know he had affected him as did when he turned his head and saw Jake stroking himself. Like Puckerman like Puckerman, Jake-boy was turned on and horny which made Trevor horny and even more determined to surpass limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped the sandwiches were heavenly. Cooked to perfection, not to toasted, not over-cooked, and each piece done with careful precision. He was kind of surprised Jake cooked that well. It must have been in the genes or something or he learned how from Puck because he never failed to impress. Groaning around the amazing taste of fluffy heaven, ham, sausage, perfectly spread melted cheese, and even more thick juicy bacon, Trevor plowed on through one piece than another. Getting lost in fantasy of taste and size, Trevor zoned out and only when he had reached for the next piece and was unable to grab something did he become aware of what was going on. He had finished the 8 sandwiches, 16 slices cut in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jake said then. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Trevor replied. \"So is there anything more?\" He enjoyed watching Jake's mouth drop open and then the lust returning back to his eyes.<br>\r\n\"We should probably get you out of that booth first though, free up space,\" said Jake pointing. Trevor looked to see his titanic gut squeezed against the edge and spilling over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah good idea,\" Trevor said before trying to wriggle out. It was a no go.<br>\r\n\"Um...I think I'm stuck,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Jake asked examining. \"It does look like your massive ass is too big against the seat,\" he grinned. <br>\r\n\"So a little help?\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Jake said. He tried to reach in and pull Trevor out. Unfortunately, Trevor's huge gut pushed against the table and partly the top kept getting in the way and he was wedged in tight. Jake couldn't move the table as it was too securely bolted to the floor. He then tried to climb over the table and into what little space that wasn't occupied by Trevor and push but that didn't work either. He tried pushing backwards with his back but still nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you're...really in tight,\" Jake panted as he tried to push. \"I don't...think you're getting out anytime soon.\" <br>\r\n\"What about calling your brother?\" suggested Trevor. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, good idea,\" Jake said as he pulled out his phone and called him.<br>\r\n\"Yo, Puck, I think we have a little situation.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" Puck's deep voice commanded.<br>\r\n\"Well, Trevor got stuck in the booth and I can't get him out,\" said Jake. There was silence for a moment before a short laugh.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought it was something serious.\"<br>\r\n\"It is serious. Trevor is stuck in the booth.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, calm down. I'm on my way. See you in 10.\" With that there was a click and Puck hung up.<br>\r\n\"So he'll be here in 10 minutes,\" Jake said to Trevor. <br>\r\n\"Okay.\" There was silence for a moment. <br>\r\n\"So yeah, getting stuck,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Jake replied.<br>\r\n\"First time that its happened. I mean, truly stuck, not just unable to move from fullness.\" Jake looked at him. <br>\r\n\"Really its your first time?\" He licked his lips. <br>\r\n\"Yep. My very first time. I've joined the extreme fatty club where Puck and Sam and the like are.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You've gotten so big it's incredible.\" Jake rubbed the portion of belly that rested on the table. <br>\r\n\"You have too,\" Trevor purred gesturing towards Jake's beefy body. \"At the start of the year you were a skinny twink.\"<br>\r\n\"That's slight exaggeration,\" Jake said frowning. \"I had good muscle.\"<br>\r\n\"True, I guess that would be pushing it. I guess skinny twink in comparison to now.\" Jake laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true,\" Jake flexed his arms, huge boulders appearing in his tight grey shirt. He had taken off the overcoat in the stuffy room and it was just him and Trevor. The shirt looked small on his bulky body and it looked like if his arms flexed any harder he'd rip right out of it. Trevor would have loved to see it but it didn't happen yet to his disappointment. Of course the shirt had ridden up his fat beefy gut which hung over his jeans. Trevor smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" he said to it and Jake grinned. \"Of course, this wasn't here then either. Either way, I must thank Mr. Schue for making me go with Puck to fix my attitude. He sure fixed me straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. You look so good Jake.\" Jake blushed.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Just then Puck arrived. <br>\r\n\"Hey yo Peeps Puckasaurus has arrived to fix all your problems.\" Puck announced.<br>\r\n\"Whee finally,\" Trevor said. \"Not that there was anything wrong with waiting here but I was getting bored.\" Puck examind Trevor.<br>\r\n\"Ho, you really did get stuck in there! I'm proud of you! You're finally a big boy Trevor!\" <br>\r\n\"Cool, get me out.\" Puck disappeared heading to the kitchen and rummaged around before coming back with a few things, namely soap, grease, butter, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jake, lets grease this pig.\" He and Puck worked to make Trevor as slidey as possible before Puck had Jake move to the other side to push while Trevor pulled. With a minimum of effort because of the goopy mixture, they managed to pop Trevor out after a try or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeehaw,\" Trevor said when he was free. \"Thanks guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" Puck grinned. \"You finally got stuck in the booth.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, I did.\" Trevor slapped his fat belly which jiggled. \"It was all thanks to that good breakfast Jake fed me, he was amazing.\" Puck grinned at the pleased and prideful expression on his brother's face and he reached out a hand and ruffled through Jake's short hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a little more though. After all that struggle, I am still hungry.\" Both Puckermans grinned at that as they eyed Trevor's fat belly which he flaunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" said Puck. \"What about icecream?\" Jake looked confused for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Icecream?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Puck said, gesturing to the icecream machines. \"Me and Trev here are going to be having a treat.\" They both looked at him in surprise. Puck shrugged. \"Hey, I'm in the mood for icecream and there is sure to be a lot so let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jake said. \"Should I get bowls or-?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary. Me and Trev here are going to go without aren't we?\" Trevor nodded. He and Puck had done this type of thing in the past where they just stuck their heads under and let it go into their mouths. \"You just have to make sure the lever stays down,\" Puck told Jake. Jake shrugged and stepped back to let them do their thing as they both approached the side by side machines. \"See you on the other side,\" Puck told Trevor jovially and moved his neck into a comfortable position underneath where his mouth could fit and turned it on. Trevor did the same. Jake feeling hungry himself, found some waffles and meat that he had set aside, and turned to eat his own breakfast while he watched as Puck and Trevor laid under the icecream dispensers as mixed chocolate-vanilla poured into their wide open mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while and Jake was long finished with breakfast as he sat watching Puck and Trevor still under the machines. Their stomachs had been steadily inflating from the thick softer serve icecream and both were looking ginormous that Jake wondered how they didn't explode. Twenty minutes and they were still going but finally it looked like Trevor started to struggle as he moved back to take gasping breaths and icecream poured down his face and chest. Puck had to take a few gasps too but not nearly as frequently as Trevor was taking them and Jake was amazed at Puck's control as the icecream still slid down, filling Puck's ridiculously massive body. Soon enough Trevor pulled out in surrender, turning it off. Puck continued on for another three minutes showing off before he too pulled out and turned off. The minute he moved though, the straining buttons of his current shirt zinged apart and flew off as the massive bloated gut spilled out which put even Trevor's tank to shame. Puck grinned and belched, going on for so loud and long Jake expected the place to collapse around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRPPPP, yeah that was good,\" Puck ended before pounding his gut and letting out aftershocks almost as big but eventually stopped. Trevor and Jake were just wowed into silence. <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jake said, stunned.<br>\r\n\"Ditto,\" Trevor said unable to think of anything else. <br>\r\n\"That was some good stuff,\" Puck grinned patting his massive gut. \"I actually feel stuffed. Of course I also ate a lot of Dave's food before this snack so that might help but woof, I feel as stuffed as I did after those gallons of shake yesterday with other things.\" <br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"You bet it is. This is going to help a lot.\" Puck tried to get up but he stopped, his body to heavy laden to do much at the moment so he sat back down.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere for a while hah. Good times, good times.\" Trevor was in the exact same state though he looked a bit more in agony than Puck did. Puck tilted his head towards Trevor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of him,\" Puck said and Jake nodded. <br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n\"Him first. I can do a bit for myself.\" Jake nodded again and moved to where Trevor was and got down on the ground. He then reached out and started rubbing, easing Trevor's pain and aiding digestion. The moans of stomach fullness turned into moans of pleasure and Trevor writhed under Jake's fingertips which erased the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god yes, do it, that's the spot,\" Trevor said and Puck smirked to himself. This was fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next few months, everybody worked on their assigned goals. It was a frutiful period with everybody growing and Puck decided it was a good time for another weigh in to measure everybodys' progress to share and because nothing pleased him more than to have numerical numbers to go along with the qualitative differences. He gathered them all for their lesson, grinning as he saw the remarkable changes most everybody had gone through in such a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, since the semester is coming close in a few weeks after the delicious holiday of Thanksgiving which I expect all of you will take advantage of,  I thought it would be a good idea to know where we all stand now. Therefore, it is time for another weigh-in! You have all done excellent on your progress so we should all share.\" Puck grinned as he patted his monstrous gut and waddled onto the scale. It was amazing and telling of just how strong Puck was that he was at all still mobile and able to move because he was just ginormously huge, his gut having grown even more further out when he switched to focusing on size and stuffing himself instead of the huge but taut tight muscle gut he had for a long time. How he carried himself around looked baffling now. \"Somebody read it to me,\" Puck demanded. Jake looked at the scale and his eyebrows raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"750 lbs bro.\" Jake smiled. \"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph you're huge.\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"That is how you do it, yeah,\" he flexed, muscle rising out of the mass that was his arms. \"How about the rest?\" He looked at them all expectantly so they didn't have much of a choice so they went in order of who looked the biggest after that, meaning Trevor was next. Like Puck, Trevor had blown up in the four months thanks to Micah and Jake who had kept him stuffed at all times and had used the thickest most fattening foods and gallons of Puck's special shakes which not only past, but utterly demolished the steady slope Trevor had been in into a new stratosphere. Trevor got on the scale and Micah read it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"560 lbs,\" Micah said in awe. Trevor had pretty much always been big but this was a record the likes Trevor hadn't had since when Puck first originally trained him. 160 pounds gained in four months from an already heavy plateaued wrestler was insane and averaged higher than what even Puck had originally gotten in four months. Admittedly, Puck wasn't quite as experienced then and there were numerous feeders this time rather than Puck alone but still. It was insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam,\" Puck called and Sam got on. The scale turned and Jake read it as...<br>\r\n\"550.\" There was a silence then as Puck froze. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Puck asked Jake in a silent calm, but deadly voice.<br>\r\n\"5..550,\" Jake said, shaking a little at the tone Puck had. Puck was rarely this serious and the fact that he was meant trouble. <br>\r\n\"Sam, what happened? You only gained 50 pounds in four months. For some people that would be impressive but for you, it doesn't seem like you tried. Trevor just gained 160 pounds and now actually outweighs you and at the start of summer, he was 120 pounds lighter but now is bigger than you. I am very disappointed in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Puck, I was busy.\" Sam tried to explain.<br>\r\n\"No you weren't. Someone of your talent and size should have been able to gain without supervision by this point. Ryder was more busy and he's huge now compared to how he was before. Everyone else has noticeable gains but you...barely any effort. We will have to remedy that after everyone else has finished weighing in.\" He waved his hand and Sam stepped off. Next was Micah who was a literal beefsteak with especially defined bulky muscles which flexed hard with each movement. He honest to god looked similar to how Puck looked two years back, musclegut and all, except more spread out since Micah was a giant 6'8 while Puck was around 6'1-2. Due to that difference, he could probably gain another 75-150 before reaching the same muscle-gut ratio of Puck had at his biggest before the fat started to overtake. Sam took his turn to read it, a bit sourly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"470,\" he muttered. Sam had to admit he was jealous. Micah looked and probably was a heck of a lot stronger than him and only had a thick beefy gut that made Micah even more attractive.\" Micah smiled and flexed, putting everyone including Puck to shame at the sheer visible muscular power. Puck smiled at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is Blaine.\" That was different as Blaine took getting fat seriously. He was even more fat looking than Puck and if they wondered how Puck was mobile, they wondered just as much at Blaine because unlike Puck, there was barely any muscle beneath that fat and he hardly worked or moved at all. Most of the time he was kind of immobile and really only got exercise when he was feeding Puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"450,\" Micah said, after figuring out the best angle to view from without his chest or gut getting in the way. It was a good approximate 100 lbs (actually 98). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Danny who had come in late because he had still been at lunch and missed the announcement to gather there. Getting on the scale, Jake read \"530.\" Danny whooped with excitement as he had really been working hard and it had paid off with a 145 pound gain. Puck glanced towards Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, he's only 20 pounds less than you as opposed to say 115 like earlier. This is extremely DISAPPOINTING for you.\" Sam had to admit he was a little rattled. Everybody seemed to be catching up to him. Perhaps he did slack a little too hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake,\" Puck called proudly and Jake got on. \"450, babe,\" Ryder said, kissing Jake. \"Looks like 106 lbs were added on and mostly muscle transformation at that.\" Like Micah, Jake had a massive protruding muscle-gut that was nonetheless tightly taught and thick. He had slimmed down the extra jiggly fat and everything was bigger and more defined than ever. Ryder loved it though he occasionally missed the extra fat that jiggled but he did that for the both of them, and in a good stuffing, Jake might be able to. Jake especially looked like Puck in his prime when he was focused on muscle, being closer in height and body than Micah (who shruken down probably would surpass both ratio wise). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins Nick and Zach went next, both being 386 and still somehow being total complements of each other. No one was sure how they contunued to maintain such perfect symmetry with each other. Tyrone hadn't grown all that much because he needed to maintain for basketball but he was at 356. Ricky and Devon were 316 and 306 respectively and Matt floated up to 324. Finally Ryder went last who had changed remarkably. Gone was the fit, trim, athletically toned Ryder. He was still definitely athletic but fit and toned, well...not so much. Of them all, he probably changed most drastically going from twink to fat wide linebacker type width. He kept up with Jake when eating, oftentimes even surpassing now on some foods. Ryder got on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"295,\" Jake said in awe as he kissed Ryder back. \"You got BIG.\" It was a gain of 120 pounds. Ryder grinned and jiggled his now beefy stomach. <br>\r\n\"It's all thanks to you and Puck and everyone.\" <br>\r\n\"You did a lot of the work though of eating,\" Jake pointed out. <br>\r\n\"True,\" Ryder smiled. Puck turned to Sam. <br>\r\n\"Ryder gain 120 lbs while you gained only 50. Sure it was easier for him but that is no excuse for you failing so miserably Sam.\" Okay, that was probably true. \"As such, you're going to have to be punished.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punished?\" Sam asked. Puck motioned to Trevor and they both held Sam down. He sent Jake and Micah to bring the gainer shake.<br>\r\n\"This is for failing to live up to your potential,\" Puck said. Micah and Jake gpt out the funnel and after Sam was tied down, they all watched as Micah, Jake, and Puck took turns pouring a gallon of gainer shake each round. Six straight gallons was inflicted which left Sam weighed down, gut utterly stuffed to the brim but super hungry and burping uncontrollably. The rest of the class was spent, stuffing food into the hapless Sam who could't eat anymore but couldn't stop due to the concentration of gainer shake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam groaned, flat on his back on one of the gym bench presses totally stuffed to the brim with gainer shake.  It took the entire class period to get Sam totally stuffed but once the bell rang Puck dismissed his dismissed his class, \"Don't want any of you late.  If theres one thing I hate its being nagged at by other teachers for tardy students.  'Cept for you two,\"  Puck said to Trevor and Danny, \"I need to have a word with you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor and Danny stayed behind as the gym emptied, each taking a seat on the bench presses opposite of the massively bloated Sam.  Both hefty teens groaned loudly as their enormous thighs spread apart- a huge, blubbery gut resting between each set.  Puck did the same - sitting on a bench press opposite of all three boys - his monster-sized gut spilling out before him and taking up every inch of the bench press that his massive ass wasn't already covering.  He gave his huge gut a few pats and grinned, \"You three know why I asked you stay behind, right?  Well, two - Sam here didn't have a choice but thats regardless.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, No, sir, I don't think we do.\"  Danny asked, scratching behind his giant footballer neck.<br>\r\n\"It's simple,\" Puck began, \"The three of you are my prized pupils - the three heaviest students on the entire campus.  While I AM still disappointed in you, Sam,\" Sam groaned in response, \"I am proud of all three of you and I want you all to keep gaining.\"<br>\r\n\"Will do, coach!\"  Trevor said with his usual, chipper grin.<br>\r\n\"And I DO know that the three of you have a bit of a rivalry going on in regards to who weighs the most so I'm changing up your gaining routines.  From now on the three of you are a team - you'll all push each other to gain as much as you possibly can.  Think of it like a friendly rivalry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A team?\"  Danny asked, a little surprised.<br>\r\n\"That's what I said.\"  Puck responded, \"Since Micah is my top bodybuilder he's in charge of keeping track of your progress when you're not in class and Jake'll be his assistant.  I expect the three of you to really blow up in no time!  Especially you, Sam.  You've got a lot of work to do to get back in my good graces.  Who knows?  Maybe one of you'll reach my level someday?\"  Puck said as he lifted his massive 750 pound body up with almost zero difficulty.  The three boys watched as their coach waddled into the back room to do paperwork - the door having been widened about a month ago to accommodate his girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny and Trevor helped the bloated Sam up and the three made their way to the locker room to change clothes.  All three had lockers in different aisles so Trevor had to speak up a bit, \"SO, a team!  Thats pretty cool!!  DUDES we should have like a team name!\"  The portly wrestler said as he slipped into his skin tight jeans, his thick legs and ass pulling tight at the fabric of the whole garment.  Trevor threw on his skin tight blue and white stripped shirt - which covered only a small sliver of his massive, doughy gut at the very top, before putting on a gray overshirt and buttoning only the button above his gut, \"LIke, we could be the fat falcons or the gorilla gainers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... defiantly something we'll keep working on.\"  Danny said as he pulled on his own skin tight jeans and gut-revealing white v-neck before tossing on his signature leather jacket - completing his greaser look.  Danny peeks around the corner to Sam's aisle, \"You doin' okay, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had gotten both his brown khakis and green henley on, which also didn't cover his huge gut in the slightest, with ease and he looked up at Danny, \"Huh?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just-\" Sam paused to let out a huge burp, \"Ugh... I'm just disappointed in myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  Danny asked, stepping closer, his gut only an inch away from Sam's.<br>\r\n\"Well, I did slack on my gaining but I wasn't lying to Puck when I said I was busy.  I was actually focusing all my time on helping Blaine gain.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Trevor said, appearing behind Danny.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam replied, \"He wants to be as fat as he possibly can while still mobile and, well, I love him and wanted to help.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats...\"  Danny said, \"The most romantic thing I've ever heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  My boys want the same from me and it's wonderful!  You might have put your work off but you did it out of love and thats pretty cool, bro.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Sam said, feeling reassured.<br>\r\n\"Tell you what 'teammates', after school lets out lets all go to Dave's new place and gorge until we can't move.  It's out first first day as a team  - we should celebrate!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm up for that!\"  Trevor responded.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\"  Sam said.  The three boys headed out and then all went their separate ways towards their classes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Next period was lunch for the three of them. Trevor and Danny walked ahead, Sam waddling heavily behind them, his gut aching after all the shake that was just poured into it. His gut swayed and jiggled back and forth, protruding proudly and unable to be covered by his green shirt. He'd feel a lot better about it if he didn't feel sick like he was going to throw up or like he was going to explode either from being full, or not full enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got into the cafeteria, they had their own special table reserved for them and those who were in Puck's class. After all, they needed a lot of room compared to normal sized people. Jake and Micah were there waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Jake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck sent us,\" Micah started. \"Now that he has decided it would be more beneficial for you guys to be working together instead of individually, he thinks that a lot more progress would be made. It would be a lot more inspiring for each of you if you worked together to grow rather than separate. That way you know how the others are doing and be all the more inspired to match or beat it. You were kind of doing it unofficially anyways, might as well make it official but in a more structured way. After all, you guys are the biggest in the school, the state, and probably the country for our age, but you never know. Growing up and ever onwards to the limits of human possibility is what you guys are after and it is pretty damn impressive in any case. Having you work together will inspire and push each each other to the best of your abilities.\" Jake brought out a measuring tape and started wrapping it around Danny's arm. \"We already got your weights but just out of curiosity and comparison, I think we should measure the size of everything else.\" (And no, that doesn't include dick size) Micah muttered to Jake. Not that they were unaware but that wasn't what they were measuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Jake groaned while grinning. \"No fun at all.\" Jake looked at the number and nodded. \"18 inches, nice. Hey, it would be easier just to removed those shirts entirely, school code be damned. It's not like those big fat bellies are particularly hidden,\" Jake grinned as he patted Danny. \"It's much easier to measure without the fabric getting in the way. He measured the chest and legs, making humming sounds. Then he tried to measure Danny's gut size. That proved to be a challenge as the tape measure was just simply not long enough to amply circle around the body and thick back. Danny stood their awkwardly as Jake had his head down low and trying to yank the tape together but it just wasn't happening. He almost ripped it a couple of times trying to force it, but managed to avoid doing so by doing a bit of a weird awkward dance shuffle that pressed his head against Danny's gut. Jake put down the tape measure and rubbed it admiringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really going to do that in front of all those people?\" Danny asked, referring to the cafeteria where a number of people were just staring at them.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jake said as he rubbed Danny's thick gut approvingly. <br>\r\n\"Okay, just checking,\" Danny said, Jake's touch. Jake and his brother Puck were very exhibitionist in everything and it was a good thing he didn't mind. Then again, it wasn't like anybody was going to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly grew from before.\" Jake squeezed Danny's arms. \"Flex again for me.\" Danny flexed and Jake grinned. \"I can feel the power. Not as big as my own guns but very impressive.\" Jake showed off, flexing his own huge arms. Micah sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's continue please. What were the numbers?\" <br>\r\n\"Party pooper,\" Jake sighed and whispered them to Micah who nodded and wrote them down.<br>\r\n\"I am not, but I would like to get them measured and eating before the end of lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"It would be a good show,\" Jake offered. <br>\r\n\"Maybe after you measure them, if you promise not to almost dry pound them into the table.\" <br>\r\n\"Would I really do that?\" Jake asked, his voice sounding innocent.<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, yes you would,\" Micah said. Sam, Trevor, and Danny nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"Not that it isn't fun,\" Trevor winked. \"I love when you and Micah do that.\" <br>\r\n\"School rules. Sure they rarely enforce them or really any rule here but very open public relations of that sort are still banned. Besides,\" his normally serious face relaxed a fraction, \"we could do that later. Anyways, let's continue.\" Jake sighed, rubbing Danny's belly one last time and pulled off. Next he went to Trevor, his smile returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sexy,\" Jake breathed in his ear and nuzzling his neck. Micah's jaw twitched. Months of this and he was still jealous, though now it was also mixed with arousal. He and Jake had an understanding but sometimes Jake liked to push his buttons like right now since he couldn't join in. Micah watched carefully as Jake measured Trevor's thick beefy arms 20 in, only a very tiny bit less than Jake's. Jake squeezed and rubbed Trevor's chest grinning as he measured it. There certainly was a lot to grab and play with his manboobs. Trevor bounced his pecs in appreciation under Jake's touch. Jake tried to measure Trevor's body, knowing there was no way it would reach around, everyone was aware of that, but he wanted to see how much it came up short. It came up very short as Jake dug his fingers into Trevor's beefy fatty mass as he went around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he measured Sam who had approximately similar arm size to Trevor  but less chest, gut, legs, and butt. Not that Sam was small by any means but Trevor finally outmeasured him. Trevor smirked. \"Haha beat you,\" he crowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a minor set back, I was busy. Once I actually get back on track I can-uuuurrppp beat both of you,\" Sam said as Jake squeezed hard around his middle, bringing up exhalation and clearing some room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, you're just dethroned. I mean, you're full of gainer shake right now and i'm still bigger than you,\" Trevor smirked. <br>\r\n\"Watch it, I will catch up.\" Sam warned. <br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm the biggest here,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\nSam burped again in Jake's face as he squeezed them together and Jake laughed as he patted Sam's belly. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys, we're being friendly here, not competing,\" Micah reminded them, <br>\r\n\"Aww, a little competing?\" Trevor asked. <br>\r\n\"A little, but you're to help each other, not argue about who is bigger.\" <br>\r\n\"Which is me,\" Trevor said. <br>\r\n\"No it's me,\" Danny grunted. <br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" sighed Micah. \"Let's just get through lunch.\" Jake walked back and pointed to 3 trays, each with five whole pizzas sat. <br>\r\n\"Here we got you started, so dig in and eat!\" Jake and Micah moved back and sat on the opposite side of the table while Danny, Trevor, and Sam sat down. Sam's gut let out a long loud growly gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone's hungry,\" Trevor joked as he dug into the first slice.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" Sam said. He felt ill but at the same time hungry for more despite only a few steps from possible explosion. He sniffed it and groaned. School food was actually good once Puck and some other people got the attention of the school board and started showing results. It might be why everybody seems to have put on a few pounds, even if they had nothing to do with Puck or the school teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tore into it like he was starving and groaned at the delicious cheesy taste. His predicament faded for a moment and the ill feelings were put into the background as he munched the first slice. Then the second.. Then the third. He was actually keeping up with Danny and Trevor despite being out of practice thanks to the shake. Only pausing to let out out thunderous belches, all three ate as fast as they possibly could, trying only to beat each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boost from the shakes lasted four pizzas. On the fifth though, a switch was flipped and the stuffed fullness came back but worse, his gut straining against his pants. Sam unbuttoned his pants and rubbed his massive stomach groaning at just how heavy he was. He ate slower and slower, expecting to pop with each bite but soon enough, he had finished all 5 pizzas. Unfortuantely, he could do no more and was afraid he would explode, even if he didn't. Sam watched, groaning and burping, desperately rubbing his stomach as Trevor and Danny continued on and even got more. Jake switched sides as he sat beside Sam, rubbing his fingers over Sam's stuffed gut and lowering his face down to kiss it as he rubbed. Sam' straightened a moment before lounging back with a sigh when Jake started rubbing down there. Trevor and Danny were too busy competing against each other to notice, and Micah tried to not say anything. Trevor won but in a rare occasion, Danny actually came really close. That made Danny happy and impressed all of them. Soon Danny and Trevor noticed what Jake was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair,\" whined Trevor. \"How about something over here?\" Jake grinned as he switched back sides and pressed against Trevor's back, his thick belly creating a distance he couldn't overcome. Micah couldn't help but grin at the sight, even if Jake was certainly rubbing in school inappropiate ways against Trevor's back. Moving to the front he rubbed Trevor down, Trevor sighing against him as he squeezed and grabbed each and every part. Finally, he switched over to Danny so he wasn't let out of the loving. Danny groaned as Jake felt him up and down and it was really going heavy when Puck pulled off Jake, shaking his head in mock admonishment, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really brother, what have I told you? No doing such hot making out in public at school or at least an unoccupied room seriously. I would recommend a number of nice closets but none of you guys would fit in those spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about in your office?\" asked Jake. Puck opened his mouth and thought about it. <br>\r\n\"Actually, that's not such a bad idea actually since I have my own office. You can take your Puckerman horniness and feel up people there.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Jake said. <br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I have to write you up for this to Sue. Don't worry though, I'm sure she'll go easy on you.\" <br>\r\n\"Yaaayyyyyyyy...\" Jake said sarcastically. Sue was better but still annoying and a hard ass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After lunch was glee so all the glee clubbers said goodbye and headed off to the music room, excited for the best class of school. Lunch period came pretty close but they still loved to perform music. Jake, Ryder, and Sam all waddled in right as the warning bell ended. It certainly was a different looking room from how the year had started but they were still a rather large family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, try come on time okay?\" Will said smiling. They nodded and sat on their side of the room. <br>\r\n\"Today we have a very special guest, the one, the only....\" <br>\r\n\"Rachel!\" Sam shouted as he stumbled slowly over to her arms stretched wide as he scooped her light body up in his massive arms. \"Rachel it's good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to...see you too...can't breathe,\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n\"Oops,\" Sam muttered putting her down. \"Sorry about that.\" Some of the other club members like Blaine came up and hugged her as well. After giving her remaining classmates hugs there was a slam of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone just told me Rachel was here?!\" Puck shouted excitedly as he tried to come into the choir room doorway. He was too big to fit through, he massive body getting stuck in the narrow slot. Cursing, he wiggles back and steps in sideways, pushing his gut up until he squeezes through. Once he's in, he shook his fist at the door. \"Damn narrow choir doorroom...\" When he was done, he turned back to Rachel and ignored everyone who was staring at him. He ran over and picked her up, squeezing her against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you Rach!\" Rachel grinned as she laid against him.<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too. You've gotten even bigger than the last time I've seen you.\"<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" Puck said as he put her down and flexed his muscles. \"No one beats Puckasaurus.\" <br>\r\n\"So Rachel, tell everyone what you're doing here,\" Will Schuester says smiling. He loved it when one of his students came back. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I'm doing a new show on tv and it's being filmed near here so I'm going to be around while it is being filmed!\" <br>\r\n\"No way, why didn't you tell me?!\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"It was a surprise and besides, we haven't had a time we could have talked to each other for a couple weeks. Anyways, I just came in to say hi and see the new changes in Glee club!\" She looks over to the side where Blaine, Jake, Ryder, and Sam were. \"There certainly are big changes. It sure is different now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It actually helps a lot,\" Will said. \"That size gives us the edge and confidence we always needed and although we still need to work on our dancing, it is great for stamina and being able to power-sing, something that we always relied on you and Finn for. Now we have multiple people in Jake, Ryder, Sam, Blaine, Marley, Unique, Kitty...we're so going to win Regionals this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always prepping,\" Rachel smiled. \"It just never ends but we love it.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey, who's that?\" Puck asked when he noticed there was someone else standing in the corner, turned away and studiously looking over the posters on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I almost forgot! Everybody, this is my boyfriend Brody!\" She tapped him on the shoulder and he spun around smiling. <br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" He asked smiling brightly. He turned to Rachel. <br>\r\n\"Almost forgot, really? I'm so hurt,\" he pouted, giving a scolded dog look.<br>\r\n\"You were so quiet and I had to greet everyone first,\" she nuzzled him and he straigthened up and smiled. <br>\r\n\"Tell us about yourself Brody,\" Mr. Schue said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, um, I'm Brody, I'm 25, I'm Rachel's boyfriend, I love to perform, act, sing, and dance, and uh, I finally gave into my girl's desire for me to visit her hometown. She's been begging me for a while, but it wasn't until now that I was really able to do it. Rachel's just been showing me around her old school, home, and stuff. Also, we were lucky and we both are in the same show which is a sort of documentary-expose thing of famous glee choirs and McKinley's is one of the more famous in recent years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you going to perform something?\" Mr. Schue asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rachel said excitedly. \"Brody and I are going to be performing 'Shut Up and Dance With Me.' Ready?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Brody said as he got ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody started, staring deep into Rachel's eyes \"Oh don't you dare look back/just keep you're eyes on me...\" opening. Rachel sang the 'Shut up and Dance With me,' and they sang the final bridge together as they danced around. Ryder and Jake were the first to clap but soon everybody was when it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo! Great job Rachel!\" Puck called. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" she said bowing dramatically. <br>\r\n\"Good job...other guy,\" Puck added. <br>\r\n\"Brody!\" he called back.<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, good job Broseph!\" Puck said, deliberately getting the name wrong just for the fun of it. It actually was a good performance though. Jake was impressed by Brody's dancing skill and while he wasn't quite as good as Jake, he was definitely talented. He also had a surprisingly amazing voice. Everyone else agreed that it was awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great job guys!\" Mr. Schue gushed. \"Brody you can come anytime you like while you're here.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Brody said respectfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a sample of our lesson of the day which is power duets...\" Mr. Schue started in excitedly on his lesson. Puck kept looking at Brody who was eying all the massive guys around him. Brody kept a straight face but it was obvious he was nervous, as he should be. Brody was pretty boy built but not anywhere close to the size of any of the Glee club guys all of whom were much more bigger and stronger. Puck was still Finn's bro and needed to test Brody out to see if this Brody dude was worthy of Rachel. So far Brody seemed great other than being such a small size. Brody needed a true man's size to be worthy of Rachel but fortunately he had many teachers at his disposal. Fortunately since it seemed he would be around, Puck could help him fill that role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Glee was over, Puck followed behind Brody and Rachel. \"Hey Rachel, glad you're back. Are you and Brody doing anything today?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, I have rehearsal but Brody's free.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine. Would you mind if me and some of the other guys showed Brody around?\" <br>\r\n\"Wow, you got my name right,\" Brody muttered. Puck glared briefly before looking at Rachel expectantly.<br>\r\n\"Sure, if Brody wants to..\"<br>\r\n\"You totally should,\" Puck said putting a hand on Brody's shoulder and subtly squeezing. \"It would be a real good idea.\" Brody got the idea.<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure, I would love to hang out with you guys after school.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Puck smiled brightly. Rachel beamed. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I didn't want to leave Brody alone but since he's going to be with you guys, have fun!\" She bounced off. As soon as she was gone, Brody glared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what was that for?\"<br>\r\n\"You're going to be coming with us on a trip,\" Puck smiled. <br>\r\n\"Is this where you intimidate me away from Rachel or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really. That would be up to you. But let's just say Rachel's got certain,,,standards, At the moment you're fine but eventually who knows?\" <br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Brody glowered. <br>\r\n\"Let's just say you're a little...small if you're catching my drift.\" Brody raised an eyebrow and Puck patted Brody's flat stomach. <br>\r\n\"Very nice work. But if you want Rachel, you're going to have to put on some weight.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that Rachel for sure will dump you but it won't hurt to be a bit bigger. You do love her yes?\"<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Brody said seriously.<br>\r\n\"Then meet with us after school at this address. As you can tell, we McKInnley men have a knack for putting on weight. <br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Brody said faintly. <br>\r\n\"We're doing it ourselves but I just can't help but to help another person in need of my expertise. I really hope you consider it.\" <br>\r\n\"I...might. Who else is going to be there?\"<br>\r\n\"Jake, Ryder, Dave, me, and you. Today it will just be us. You don't have to worry about a thing. We will take good care of you.\"<br>\r\n\"Why does that sound so downright ominous?\" Brody muttered. <br>\r\n\"Remember, this address after school. I can't wait to see you,\" Puck said smirking.<br>\r\n\"See you then?\" Brody said uncertainly. He wasn't at all sure about this and it seemed hard to believe that it was true what Puck was saying about Rachel but anything that gave him an edge, will, he did want to try to make her happy. He could at least see what these people were about. </span></div></div>",

Big red and black letters spelled out 'KAROFSKY'S ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BELLYBUSTER!' above the incredibly wide doors.  Brody pushed one of the door open and walked inside, lifting up his sunglasses and looking around.  The place was packed with guys chowing down on huge amounts of food, each one fatter than then last and being waited by on beefy, fat guys in revealing uniforms.  The widescreen tv's placed around the restaurant all had whatever football game was playing live at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody looked around, trying to find Puck amongst all of the portly patrons, when he was approached by a waiter; 20-something years old, dark skin, with thick, muscular arms and a gut that pushed out from under the crop top that read 'KARAOFSKY'S' and hung over the waistband of the booty shorts he was tightly packed into.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Karofsky's!\" The waiter said, \"My names Mitchell - may I show you to a table?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure!  I'm actually here to meet somebody,\" Brody said, a little flustered, \"He's supposed to be here; tall, built like a monster with a huge gut, mohawk-\"<br>\r\n\"OH, you mean Mr. Puckerman!  I'll take you right to him, follow me!\"  Mitchell said as he turned and headed towards the back of the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody's eyes wandered the entire time he walked through the restaurant; flicking between short glances at beefy men shoveling down fattening food and the AMAZING ass on the waiter leading him towards Puck.  Brody wasn't very open about his bisexuality - or his preferences for HUGE men - but he was doing his best not to get a boner as he walked through the buffet.  Mitchell lifted up a curtain in the back and lead Brody to a section of the restaurant that was less crowded and much quieter; the VIP section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were fewer tables and seats, all of which seemed to be made of much nicer material than the ones back in the main section.  The walls were a dark red color with golden accents and Brody could tell from smell alone that the food in there was higher quality than in the main section - not that the food out there didn't smell heavenly too.  Looking around Brody noticed some familiar faces in the room; Jake Puckerman and his boyfriend, Ryder.  The were at one table eating like champs and watching the same football game that was on in the other room.  At the next table was the big man himself; Noah Puckerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody licked his lips a little at the sight of him - it was much different from the Puck he meet at the high school that day.  No longer decked out in his red and white coaching uniform Puck was wearing a faded graphic black tee that didn't cover a single inch of his expansive gut.  Over that was a denim vest with spikes on the shoulders and a pair of dark red jeans and sneakers.  Puck was sitting in a booth - his enormous ass taking up the space of two and a half people and his gut, huge, round, beefy, and plush, had been lifted up on top of the table and was taking up 1/4 of it's space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck was watching the game, shoving a huge slice of pizza into his mouth, as Brody and the waiter approached them, \"Mr. Puckerman, sir, your guest has arrived!\"<br>\r\n\"HMM?\"  Puck said, mouth full of pizza.  He swallowed the food down and grinned, \"HEY, Brodster!  'Bout time you showed up!  Thanks for showing him back here, Mitch, why don't you take 10 and fill up that gut of yours?  You're lookin' thin.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sir!\"  Mitchell said before heading out.<br>\r\n\"Have a seat and order up, small fry!  It's on the house!\"  Puck said, patting at the small space remaining on his right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody went to sit down on the opposite side of Puck but Puck protested, \"Dude, how are we gonna talk when I won't even be able to see you over this baby?\" he said, patting his gigantic gut.  Brody sat down on the opposite side anyway and scooted closer so he next to Puck, though the giant ball of muscle and fat that was the man's belly blocked his view of anything past it.  Brody looked at the table and raised an eyebrow, \"Got enough food?\"  Brody asked and Puck laughed loudly, \"You're funny, Broseph.  I'm only on my 3rd course.  I've got plenty of room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I gotta be honest; are you for real?\"  Brody asked.<br>\r\nPuck smirked, \"All natural!\" Puck said, giving his gut another smack.<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, dude, you're MASSIVE!  Like the BIGGEST person I've ever met!\"  Brody said, a little red in the face.<br>\r\n\"Aww, stop, you're making me blush.\" Puck said as he shoved the last slice of pizza into his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Why did you invite me here?\" Brody asked, \"To watch you eat?  Cause I've other things I could be doing.\"<br>\r\nPuck swallowed and smiled, \"I invited you here because you're as thin as a branch.  I've known Rachel for YEARS and trust me when I say she prefers a heftier man.\"<br>\r\n\"Like you?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, NOBODY can resist me, but yeah.  Which is where I come in.  I'm willing to fatten you up for free, Broster; I don't offer this to many people.  Rachel's an old friend and she deserves the best.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, thats nice and all,\" Brody replied, \"But I can't.  If I gain more than twenty pounds they'll kick me off the show; it's in my contract.\"<br>\r\n\"I've never heard something so sad.\"  Puck responded.  \"Well, you might as well eat SOMETHING, dude.  It'd be rude to my boyfriend, the OWNER, not to.\"<br>\r\nBrody sighed, \"Might as well.\"<br>\r\nAs Brody looked over the menu he heard something and peeked over his menu; Puck was struggling to reach the next Pizza with his gut in the way.  Brody pushed the pizza closer to Puck and the enormous man snatched it up, \"Thanks, man!\"<br>\r\n\"No problem...\" Brody said, a little turned on by the sight now that he'd settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, uh, Puck.  How much do you weigh if you don't mind me asking?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"750 pounds!\" Puck said proudly.<br>\r\n\"750?!\"<br>\r\n\"and growing!\"  Puck said, flexing his massive arms, \"Course it's not all fat.  I'm actually mostly muscle.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can tell.\"  Brody said, more turned on than before.<br>\r\n\"Dude, if you're not gonna eat than you might as well make yourself useful and feed me.\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Brody replied.<br>\r\n\"Feed.  Me.\"  Puck repeated, \"Shove food into my mouth.  I have a saying, small fry.  Skinny guys are only good for two things - feeding you or fattening up themselves.  Since you won't do the later than you might as well start shoving it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody swallowed the lump in his throat and scooted closer to Puck, lifting up a slice of pizza from the tray on the table and holding it over Puck's mouth.  Puck opened wide and took the entire thing into his mouth - surprising Brody.  Brody kept it up, slice after slice disappearing into Puck's giant gut.  Brody looked back at the table and saw 5 more piping hot pizzas.  He grabbed one and just kept going, Puck's hot, plump lips closing around his fingers as he dropped slice after slice into his throat.  In no time at all the 5 pizzas vanished into Puck's mass and as if on cue another waiter pulled up with trolley of at least 20 pounds of spaghetti and meatballs with a huge platter of bread.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody scooted around to the outer edge of the table and went to work on that as well, stuffing the coach with meat and pasta.  Once all of the spaghetti, meatballs, and bread were down Puck's gullet Puck...</span></div></div>",

He looked at Brody. \"Oh hey, when did you get here?\" <br>\r\n\"A while ago,\" Brody laughed. <br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry for ignoring you man, I didn't even notice you arrived.\" Ryder groaned and Jake turned his attention back as he lovingly rubbed Ryder's stuffed belly. \"Just a little more...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a massive groan Puck pushed himself up and Brody was amazed when Puck actually got out of his seat and edged along until he was free of the table and actually stood. Brody couldn't figure out how Puck was able to move, let alone get up by this point. When he arrived, Puck had already been eating and he had just fed Puck by hand five whole pizzas and and a ridiculous amount of pasta and bread. It was almost like feeding a black hole although clearly the food was going somewhere as Puck's stomach was a massively bloated oblong ball that hung over and blocked the view of his pants. Actually, Brody was also amazed that there were even pants that came anywhere close to Puck's size. Brody watched Puck walk, his massive body plodding ahead and well, he was aching by this point by the strain in his pants. Thinking of unsexy things was not helping now since he had a full-on view of Puck's entire body and he wasn't focused on other things and he was going to have to go to the bathroom so he got up but Puck turned to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked smirking. Brody quickly sat back down. <br>\r\n\"Nowhere,\" he said quickly.<br>\r\n\"Right. After all, its your turn.\" <br>\r\n\"My turn to what?\" Brody asked. <br>\r\n\"To eat of course! I mean you're here after all and I want to help you too.\"<br>\r\n\"But my contract...\"<br>\r\n\"Says more than twenty pounds. Which means you could gain up to.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's really the point...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever want to cut back and relax? To not have to worry about dieting?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...\"<br>\r\n\"It's a rare opportunity to have the Puckasaurus help you and to get food for free to boot.\" Brody's stomach let out a gurgle at that moment. It had been a while since he ate and smelling the aroma of food and talking about all this eating was making him hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, fine then I suppose I could have a little something.\" There was a snort giggle across the room that was either Jake or Ryder but wasn't clear who. Puck grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'll order a 'little' something.\" Puck went through a door in the back and was gone for a few minutes before coming back. \"Okay, I ordered and your food will be out shortly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That is fast and...wait what did you order?\" <br>\r\n\"You don't mind do you?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Not really, I'm not going to be picky but I am curious.\" Puck picked a  chair that was back against the wall and brought it to the table. <br>\r\n\"Move over here please?\" Brody was confused at first but then he realized Puck probably couldn't get into the booth again, not without extreme difficulty. Actually thinking about it, it was amazing Puck had even fit to start with getting in but now that he was stuffed, he couldn't push in. There was a massive creak as Puck sat in the chair and Brody was impressed that the chair didn't break under that massive fatass of Puck's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chairs are all reinforced for our patrons,\" Puck said, seeming to read Brody's mind since he was staring at the chair. \"As you see we have a lot of big people that eat here and it makes sense to have chairs that don't break under people's weights.\" He patted the booth near him again and Brody scooted there. \"Oh and I ordered the staples really. Pizza, pasta, mashed potatoes, the works. Let me warn you right now, you're going to lose your mind when you taste it, it's so good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet,\" Brody said. Puck asked him some questions about how Rachel was doing before another massive waiter rolled up a multi-level cart to the table that was loaded. \"That's not all for me is it?\" Brody asked wide-eyed. \"I can't eat all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't expect you to eat all of it,\" Puck said. \"Just a lot of it. What do you want to start with?\" <br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just going to...\" Puck reached out and held on. <br>\r\n\"You got to chill Broseph. Now, what do you want to start with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess the Spaghetti looks good,\" Brody said. Actually, it looked and smelled downright heavenly and was making his mouth water and his stomach roar ravenously. He was even hungrier than he realized as it had been hours since breakfast and he only had a small snack on the plane. He and Rachel had only arrived that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck took a plate from the stack and scooped a massive serving of spaghetti and meatballs onto it, setting it in front of Brody. \"Bon Appetite,\" he grinned handing Brody a fork. He leaned and watched as Brody took his first bite of Dave's cooking. Puck smirked as he watched the starstruck amazed look cross across Brody's face. People always looked like that after tasting Dave's food for the first time, and with good reason. Dave was a fantastic cook and made everything taste exceptionally amazing. There really were no words to describe it but mind-blowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody was hooked after his first bite. The taste just danced on his tongue and he eagerly continued eating, shoveling it into his mouth. Normally he wasn't a messy eater but he couldn't have enough as he slurped and shoveled it into his mouth. It even got the attention of Jake and Ryder who also stared in shocked amusement as Brody ravenously sucked the noodles down. They were shocked not because it was exceptional, this was a rather common experience with them, but it just seemed so amusingly incongrous with Brody's reserved polite manner. Sauce splattered over his face and rather fancy clothes. Soon it was done and Puck quickly scooped more onto Brody's plate. Brody eagerly started sucking that up as well. After that, Brody opened his eyes to see them all looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he burped before he could stop himself. He flushed a little red with embarassment.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he muttered. Jake, Puck,, and Ryder all laughed making Brody flush more. <br>\r\n\"It's okay man, you're in the company of men. Also, it'd be rather weird and rather insulting if you didn't. Anyhow, are you thirsty? I kind of forgot that,\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could use a drink,\" Brody replied. <br>\r\n\"Jake, go get the man a drink,\" Puck ordered and Jake smirked at Brody as he got up and left. Puck and Jake were having way too much fun with this. Soon Jake was back, bringing back a massive pitcher of Dr. Pepper which he put down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" he said as he sat down. Brody felt a little weird now since he was  surrounded by three massive guys who were all sitting near him and watching very intently. They seemed way too interested in this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you move back a little?\" he asked and Jake and Ryder moved back a smidge. It wasn't very far and made Brody roll his eyes but he decided to eagerly start on the next plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was massive scoops of mashed potatoes. He took the gravy pot and covered them in gravy because that is the only way to eat mashed potatoes: smothered in delicious gravy. Even though he was ready and prepared, the first bite of the potatoes still nearly floored him. It was so good! Moaning around it, he scooped the perfectly mashed and fluffed potatoes into his mouth, his hands moving of their own accord as he ate bite after bite after bite. He was seriously going to have to learn how to make these for sure as he had never tasted such perfect mashed potatoes anywhere before. He paused only briefly to drink some Dr. Pepper before returning back to the potatoes and gravy which easily went down and he had two massive plates of just potatoes and gravy. Once he had finished the second plate, Brody leaned back for a pause. He was feeling pretty laid back and content. He rubbed his stomach surreptiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some pizza?\" Puck asked. Brody thought about it. <br>\r\n\"I guess a few slices won't hurt,\" Brody said. He was beginning to feel pretty full but he did have room for a slice or two maybe. Especially if it was the same quality as the pasta and potatoes. Puck put two slices onto his plate and Brody started. He was right, it was amazing. Brody ate those slices. Puck put two more down. Brody shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine. Two slices are enough for me.\" Puck frowned. <br>\r\n\"You still have room.\" <br>\r\n\"No, I'm pretty full. Thanks for the meal though,\" Brody burped and rubbed his gut. \"I haven't been this full for a long time.\" <br>\r\n\"You still have room for more though,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, I'm-\" Brody was cut off when Puck grabbed his mouth with one massive hand and with the other shoved a pizza slice in. Brody rapidly chewed as Puck kept pushing it in. \"No I'm-\" he was cut off again and again as Puck fed him another slice and then another. Realizing it was futile, Brody stopped talking although he did try to keep his mouht shut. Jake was there however and held his mouth open for Puck to put it in. Only after Brody had eaten ten of the slices did Puck let him go. Brody leaned back winded, feeling incredibly stuffed. Not even caring they could all see this now, he unbuttoned his pants and the straing buttons of his shirt, letting his bloated belly spill out into the now free space. Brody was shocked by how bloated his belly was at the moment. It strained forward and weighed down. Not even a hint of his abs were visible under the bloated ball. He just felt heavy. Raising heavy eyes, he saw the eager looks on Puck, Jake, and even Ryder's faces as they stared intently at it. He felt like a big fat balloon ball on display but he was too stuffed to even care at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well make yourselves useful and rub it,\" Brody said tiredly to them, groaning as the pain really hit him. He rubbed frantically at it, trying to relieve the pressure. Puck, Jake, and Ryder grinned to each other over his head and leaned down rubbing. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sharp, high pitched screech of Puck's whistle filled the air of the McKinley High gym.  All 10 boys of the varsity wrestling team stopped the chatter jogged over to Puck - thick thighs jiggling and enormous bellies bouncing as they did.  All 10 of them, each one thicker, beefier, and fatter than the last, were all in skin tight red-and-white wrestling singlets.  Trevor and Sam were the last two to make it to the group, huge, fat guts jiggling in their singlets as they waddled over.  Puck dropped his whistle, which landed snuggly in the cavern formed between his monster pecs, and placed his fists on his insanely wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck looked at his team silently for a while behind his black aviator shades, each boy standing still and waiting for their coach to speak.  Puck wore an 8XL red polo, custom made, that was tucked snugly under his gut and into his white 78 inch shorts which clung tightly to his amazingly huge thighs and massive round ass.  On the left breast of Puck's polo read the words \"COACH PUCKERMAN\" with \"WRESTLING\" underneath and his mohawk was hidden beneath his McKinley High baseball cap.  Puck removed his sunglasses, tucking them into the open collar of his polo, \"Okay, team, you all know we've got a BIG match coming up against the Carmel High Great Whites.  I expect EACH and EVERY one of you to put your all into this!  I want each of you to break up into groups of two.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The team knew each split into 5 groups of two; Trevor and Sam obviously sticking together.  Puck smirked at this sight, and then assigned numbers 1-5 for each group, Trevor and Sam being #1, \"Okay, person the left of each group, you're A.  Everyone else is B.  You'll practice basics for 15 minutes and when I blow the whistle person B of each group will go to the next number.  1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.\"  The 750 pound coach said, waving his hand in the air.  Puck then blew hard into his whistle and the 10 boys scattered to the training rings set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck waddled over to the two folding chair and table set up for him and groaned as he sat his 750 pound body down, one massive ass cheek per chair.  The cheap folding chairs groaned and creaked under Puck's mass - the metal legs visibly bowing under the heft of the obese-yet-ripped coach.  Behind Puck, on the school bleachers, sat Jake and Ryder watching with perverse eyes as the wrestling team trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jake's eyes scanned the room, subtitling point out each guy to Ryder and mutter their weights to him, \"220.. 360... 280-ish...\"<br>\r\n\"Ill never get over how you're so good at that.\"  Ryder said to his huge boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"It's a gift.\"  Jake said, winking before looking back, \"410,\" he said, point out the 3rd biggest guy on the team, \"And he's got a hot pear shape to him as well; Nice thick thighs and a fat ass.  He actually sits in front of me in english, too.  That meaty ass of his doesn't even fit in the school's seats anymore.\"<br>\r\nRyder chuckled, enjoying the way his boyfriend rambled on about guys he wanted to fuck.  Just then the doors to the gym opened and in came Rachel Berry, heels clicking against the floor as she made her way in, Brody sheepishly following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jake leaned forward so Puck could hear him, \"Looks like somebodies in troooooubleeeee~\"  Jake said, teasing his big bro.<br>\r\nPuck rolled his eyes and placed his meaty paws on his thighs, pushing to help him lift his heft which bounced and jiggled as he did so.  Puck waddled over towards Rachel, which wasn't more than a few steps since she didn't stop walking.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rach!  Brod.\"  Puck said in a flirtatious manner, leaning slightly to the side to acknowledge Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cut back on the charm, Puckerman.  You know what I'm here.\"  Rachel said, crossing her arms angrily.<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't happen to be about that 17 pounds of pudge Brody is trying so desperately to hide under a slimming black t-shirt and cardigan, is it?\"  Puck said, raising his eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is!\"  Rachel said, taking a step forward - only an inch or so between her and Puck's massive overhanging gut, \"You KNEW about Brody's contract but you couldn't help yourself anyway, could you?  You just HAD to stuff him?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\"  Puck said, nonchalantly, \"Rach, his contract says NO MORE than 20 pounds.  Brody only gained 17 pounds from his little lunch at Dave's buffet with me.  I don't see the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The problem is you don't have any self-control, Noah.\"  Rachel said, \"Once you start you can't stop fattening up a guy until he's massive.\"<br>\r\n\"I still don't see the issue.\"  Puck said totally honestly.<br>\r\n\"Look, you know I don't actually care that you fatten guys up for a living.  But you knew Brody could get in trouble and he almost got fired this morning.  I'm not gonna stop you from doing it but don't.  Do.  It.  To.  BRODY.\"  Rachel said, poking Puck hard in his pec with each word.<br>\r\n\"Owwww... Fine.\"  Puck said, rubbing the sore spot on his pec, \"I won't fatten Brody up again UNLESS he asks me to.  Deal?\"<br>\r\nRachel stared at him for a moment before giving him a small chuckle, \"Deal.  C'mon, babe, we gotta get back on set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brody stared at Puck for a bit, a little flustered, before speaking, \"See you guys.\"  He said before following Rachel out.  Puck smirked before taking his whistle and blowing hard into it, signaling for the boys to switch partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hour later the heavy-set boys of New Directions (Jake, Ryder, Sam, and Blaine) were all gathered in the choir room for a fitting of the outfits they'll be wearing at Regionals next week, having won sectionals earlier that year.  Mr. Schue had left room to get some coffee while the boys undressed and tried on their new clothing - all of which had to be custom ordered for their sizes.  As Jake slid into his perfectly fitting black dress pants he looked over at Blaine, \"So, Blaine, where were you today?  You're Puck's official assistant and I didn't see you at wrestling today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thats true,\" Sam said, buttoning his shirt down.<br>\r\n\"I was off campus, actually.  Mr. Schue needed to grade papers so he had me drive to the tailors to pick up the clothes.  Puck didn't mind.\"  Blaine replied as he struggled to tuck his shirt in under his gut.  \"Y'know, I love weighing 450 pounds but it makes getting dressed a pain in the ass.\"<br>\r\n\"Ain't that the truth,\" Blaine's 550 pound boyfriend replied, finally tucking in his dress shirt and throwing on his red and white blazer.<br>\r\n\"Its the price we pay for vanity, I guess.\"  Ryder said, buttoning his blazer up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All four fatties looked each other over, turning around showing off their new outfits.  Each of them were in red blazers with white piping, white dress shirts and red ties, with black dress pants and red dress shoes - all of which fit perfectly.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys look great!\"  a voice said.  All four boys turned to see Puck and Trevor standing outside the classroom.<br>\r\n\"OH, hey guys!!  C'mon on in!\"  Sam said, grinning.<br>\r\nTrevor waddled in first, his fat gut and hips brushing the sides of the doorframe.  Puck was another issue as the school had enough in the budget to widen the door of his office.  The 750 pound man struggled as he pushed through, his fat molding around the door frame as he tried in vain to get through.  Finally, Puck POPPED through into the room, his heavy body shaking the room a bit as he landed on his feet - fat jiggling all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck was still in his coaching uniform but Trevor had changed into the outfit he'd worn all day; a light blue button up (the buttons straining to contain his massive, flabby gut), a pair of dark jeans, and his WHHS letterman jacket, \"Outfits for regionals?\"  Trevor asked with a interested face.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  They're custom made, too.\"  Ryder responded.<br>\r\n\"New Directions is actually pretty famous on the show choir circuit.  Partly cause we've won a bunch of times.\"  Blaine said before he was cut off by Sam.<br>\r\n\"Recently, though, it's cause of these bad boys.\"  Sam said, placing his hands under his fat gut, lifting it, and dropping it - the massive ball of fat bouncing in Sam's perfectly tailored uniform.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweet!\"  Trevor said, scratching behind his head, \"Hey, umm, I was wondering... Do you guys have any room in the group for new guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You thinkin' of joining, Lloger?\"  Puck asked, calling Trevor by his last name.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually.  I've wanted to for a while but I was always worried I was too, well, BIG.  Silly, right?\"  Trevor asked.<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\"  Mr. Schue said as he walked back in, Puck noticing his sweater vest a little tighter around the middle than usual, \"But your audition will have to wait until after Regionals.\" Will said, \"We've already got out routine planned out around these big guys.\"  He said, pointing to the other four.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, no worries!!  Trev said, excited.</span></div></div>",

This place is packed!\"  Puck said as he and Dave waddled into the theatre that Regionals was being held in.  Every seat in the house was taken by attendees from all over the state of Ohio - each one eager to see the school they're rooting for win and head to this year's nationals.  Dave and Puck were both dressed semi-formally; Puck was wearing a dark red graphic t-shirt with a black blazer, a pair of khaki pants, and dress shoes (all custom ordered for his size) while Dave was in a blue button up, jeans, and dress shoes.  Dave's wardrobe wasn't as perfectly tailored for his bulk as Puck's was - the button up stretched tightly across his fat gut and thick arms and his jeans looked painted on to his thigh thighs and huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck and Dave made their way down to the seats that Will had reserved for them along with Rachel, Brody, and Trevor; a favor Puck asked Will to do for him.  The two reached the aisle where their seats will and Puck let out a sigh of irritation, \"Schuester, I thought you said these seats were front row?\"  Puck said, staring at the small space between the seats and the back of the next row.<br>\r\n\"I said <i>near</i> the front row, Puck.  You'll just have to squeeze in.  This was the best I could do; you're lucky I was able to get you two seats.\"  Will said, looking back down at the program.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Puck!\"  Trevor said, sitting next to Will.  Trevor was also dressed semi-formally; a plaid button up with the sleeves rolled up, a dark blue jacket, and jeans with nice sneakers, but like Dave Trevor looked like he'd burst out of it any second.<br>\r\nPuck sighed and turned sideways, \"Hey, Trevor,\" he said sucking in his gut the best he could as he shuffled to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trevor lifted up the arm rest between Puck's two seats seconds before Puck dropped his 775 pound body onto them; the soft, plush theatre seats audibly groaning under Puck's heavy mass.  Puck let out a deep breath and his gut surged forward, filling up the remainder of his lap and pressing up against the back of the two chairs in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Trev.\"  Puck said, before chuckling, \"And thanks for getting me the two seats, Will.  It's kinda impossible for me to sit anywhere without two now.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  Will replied.<br>\r\nDave sat down in the seat next to Puck's, grunting a bit as he did.<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, babe?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, these seats are a little too small for me.\"  Dave said, trying to find a comfortable way to sit in the slightly-too-small chairs.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're pretty thin,\" Trevor responded, \"Took me a few minutes to set comfortably myself.\"  Puck looked to his left and saw that Trevor looked like he was practically pouring out of the small chair.<br>\r\n\"You're looking huge, Trev.  That team I put you on with Sam and Danny working for ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah!!\"  Trevor replied, \"The three of us all put on about 20 pounds each this week!  I'm still the biggest.\"<br>\r\n\"580, huh?  Good job.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"You remember why weight?\"  Trevor asked.<br>\r\n\"Course I do, Lloger\" Puck replied, \"You're the heaviest guy I've ever made - how could I not remember my star pupil's weight?\"<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\"  Trevor said, his face turning beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, backstage, The New Directions were getting ready for their performance.  They were scheduled to go first and everybody was preparing and getting into place.<br>\r\n\"Has anybody seen Sam?\"  Marley asked.<br>\r\n\"He's kinda hard miss.\"  Artie replied jokingly as he wheeled over.<br>\r\n\"No, I know that but I haven't seen him since we arrived.\"  Marley replied.<br>\r\nJust then Sam's familiar heavy footsteps could be heard as he waddle-jogged in, \"Hey, guys, sorry about that.\"  Sam said as he reached the group, \"I was having a bit of a wardrobe problem.\"<br>\r\n\"That's pretty clear.\"  Kitty said, looking Sam over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam's once perfectly-tailored uniform was now tight across his thick, fat frame.  Sam's white dress shirt was snug along his giant, flabby gut; the buttons holding on well but it was visibly clear that the shirt was tighter than when he wore it a week ago.  His red and white blazer was button but the buttons looked like they were gonna pop off at any second and his pants looked painted on.<br>\r\n\"Sam,\" Blaine said, an upset look on his face, \"You know we were supposed to lay off the gaining this week so these would fit perfectly.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Sam replied, \"But Puck was so upset with me that I couldn't help myself - and it's just 20 pounds.\"<br>\r\n\"20 pounds makes all the difference,\" Unique said as she walked over, unbuttoning Sam's blazer and adjusting his tie, \"There, now nobody in the audience can tell.\"<br>\r\nJust then the stage manager informed the group it was show time and the lights were dimmed as New Directions made their way on stage.</span></div></div>",

Ryder and Marley took the next verse; Ryder singing the first two lines and sharing the next line with Marley before she sang the last two, dancing in sync as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">We were victims of the night,<br>\r\nThe chemical, physical, kryptonite<br>\r\nHelpless to the bass and faded light<br>\r\nOh we were born to get together,<br>\r\nBorn to get together.</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jake took over the next two lines before all three sang the chorus together:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"She took my arm,<br>\r\nI don't know how it happened.<br>\r\nWe took the floor and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh don't you dare look back<br>\r\nJust keep your eyes on me.<br>\r\nI said your holding back,<br>\r\nShe said shut up and dance with me!<br>\r\nThis woman is my destiny<br>\r\nShe said oh oh oh<br>\r\nShut up and dance with me!\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The song continued - New Directions giving back up and dancing as Ryder, Marley, and Jake sang the rest of the song.  Jake's solid, beefy muscles flexed in his perfectly tailored suit and Ryder's chunky belly, thighs, and ass shook and jiggled as he danced.  The last few chords were played before the music stopped and the group posed, waiting a few seconds as the audience cheered.<br>\r\n\"We totally inspired them.\"  Rachel said, leaning over to Brody.<br>\r\nThe next song started up right away with Unique and Kitty singing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"Because you know I'm all about that bass,<br>\r\n'Bout that bass, no treble.<br>\r\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble<br>\r\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble<br>\r\nI'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, bass, bass, bass, BASS\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two girls moved as Sam stepped through them, a cocky grin on his fat face as he sang:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two<br>\r\nBut I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do<br>\r\n'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase<br>\r\nAll the right junk in all the right places.\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Sam sang he swirled his hips and did his signature body wave move, which he learned from back when he was a stripper.  As Sam danced his enormous gut bounced around, his huge, fat body jiggling in every way as he performed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the magazines working that Photoshop<br>\r\nWe know that stuff ain't real<br>\r\nCome on now, make it stop<br>\r\nIf you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up<br>\r\n'Cause every inch of you is perfect<br>\r\nFrom the bottom to the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unique and Kitty sang along with Sam during the last two lines before Blaine joined in, his gargantuan body jiggling and shaking just as much as his boyfriend's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size<br>\r\nShe says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night<br>\r\nYou know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,<br>\r\nSo, if that's what's you're into<br>\r\nThen go ahead and move along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The four sang the rest of the song, Sam and Blaine taking most of the lines while Unique and Kitty chimed in here and there; the rest of ND doing back up.  The song ended and group posed once more as the audience cheered and clapped.  Puck, who thought it would be best to wait until everything was over to stand up, leaned over to Dave, \"My idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The music started up again, this one much slower than the previous two.  The glee club members took their places before Ryder stepped forward, singing;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"I know I took the path that you would never want for me<br>\r\nI know I let you down, didn't I?<br>\r\nSo many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me<br>\r\nWell I'm just a slave unto the night.\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jake stepped forward next, on the opposite end of the stage of Ryder;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me<br>\r\nRemember when I broke you down to tears<br>\r\nI know I took the path that you would never want for me<br>\r\nI gave you hell through all the years\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a pause before the music kicked up and the entire club started singing the chorus, moving about the stage the same way they'd rehearsed;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"So I, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you<br>\r\nI, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam stepped forward next, singing his verse, followed by Blaine;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams<br>\r\nWould I come running home to you<br>\r\nI've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth<br>\r\nThere's you in everything I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me<br>\r\nRemember when I broke you down to tears<br>\r\nI know I took the path that you would never want for me<br>\r\nI gave you hell through all the years.\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole club chimed in again;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">\"So I, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you<br>\r\nI, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you\"</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All four boys stepped to the front of the stage, paired up by relationship, and sang together;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"Don't tell me that I'm wrong<br>\r\nI've walked that road before<br>\r\nAnd left you on your own<br>\r\nAnd please believe them when they say<br>\r\nThat it's left for yesterday<br>\r\nAnd the records that I've played<br>\r\nPlease forgive me for all I've done\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One last time all of the club members sang together for the final chorus;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"So I, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you<br>\r\nI, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you<br>\r\nI, I bet my life, I bet my life<br>\r\nI bet my life on you!\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody bowed their heads as the lights shut off once the final note ended and the audience cheered louder than they had the entire time.  New Directions quickly left the stage, grins on all their faces because they pulled that off flawlessly.  The group reached their waiting room as the next school performed and all of them took a minute to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be honest, Sam, I thought your shirt was gonna burst open when you were dancing.\"  Ryder admitted, patting Sam's huge gut.<br>\r\n\"I did too, honestly.  Thank god it didn't.\"  Same replied.<br>\r\nThe rest of the group all sat down and waited until they were called on stage again for the announcements of who got took what place.  Everyone was nervous but the second they heard \"NEW DIRECTIONS\" as the winners it all melted away and were replaced with cheers and laughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest however were excited and they all got into their cars and followed behind Puck and Dave to the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everyone?\" Sam asked when they got out and saw the parking lot was pretty much empty.<br>\r\n\"I closed the place down for the day so it would be just our group,\" Dave said. \"It is a special occasion after all that should only be celebrated in the company of friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind of you Dave,\" Mr. Schue said.<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure,\" Dave grinned as he took out his keys and opened up. \"Just let me tell the staff we're ready. Of course, a lot of food has already been prepared since we knew we had big eaters coming.\" Dave went in and headed straight to the back where he talked to the staff before returning. \"Okay, we're good to go. Sit anywhere you like and food is set out already. If you have any special requests of course, just talk to a waiter and we will get right on it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEerybody headed in and got started right away in getting the first course. There was a huge variety of food set out and something for everyone. There was eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc for those who liked breakfast for dinner; different types of pasta like lasagna, angel hair, spaghetti, fettuchini, linguini; hotdogs, pizza, meat platters, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, barbecued ribs, soups, jello, cake, salad, and so forth. The two long tables were overflowing with food. They all grabbed what they wanted and moved to sit down at another long table that they pushed together from smaller ones as they sat and ate together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an awesome set we did, Vocal Adrenaline did not know what hit them!\" Jake was narrating with exaggerated epic detail of how they trounced the other groups. \"They were in total awe of us when Sam, Ryder, Marley, and I did those incredible twirls because  no one expected us to be able to dance so well with how large we are.\" Suddenly there was an additional ching of the bell as another person stepped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room for one more?\" the stranger asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, this is a private gathering for the New Directions and invited guests so if you come back another time...\" Puck got up and started saying before he screamed. He wobbled for a moment before he ran towards the figure and squeezed them hard against his stomach. \"OH MY GOD I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE YOU AGAIN!!!!!!\" Puck bellowed loudly at the top of his lungs and he actually started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey, you are...oh my god, is that you Puck?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes it is! You have no idea how much I missed you! If this wasn't so such a happy moment, I'd kick your ass black and blue because how dare you for not calling, texting, or communicating! I must admit I was beginning to think you were dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck, who is that?\" Rachel called out, getting up. <br>\r\n\"You would not believe who just came in the door! It's Finn!\"<br>\r\n\"Finn?!\" Rachel shouted loud. Everybody else in the group became excited when they heard the name. <br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Finn's back?!\" Sam yelled excitedly as he got up and ran to join Puck and Rachel. So did all the original glee club members, leaving only Jake, Ryder, Brody, and Trevor at the table as they weren't too familiar with Finn. Of course, Jake and Ryder had heard stories of the legendary Finn who had been leader of the Glee club until he had graduated and vanished so they were curious but at the moment, everybody else was surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this. Finn, you're back!\" Artie said surprised.<br>\r\n\"I missed you Finn,\" Tina said, also joining in the crying tear fest.<br>\r\n\"It's been ages! What have you been up to?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go and I'll tell you,\" Finn said gasping for air and Puck, Rachel, Sam, and the rest quickly let him go. Finn took a gasp of air, wheezing. <br>\r\n\"Whoo, thank goodness, it was beginning to go black.\" Finn took a step back and blinked when he saw Puck, Sam, and Blaine. \"Woah, who are you guys.\"<br>\r\n\"It's Puck, Sam, and Blaine,\" Rachel told him.<br>\r\n\"Oh Rachel, I missed you-WHAT?!\" Finn reared back in surprise. \"That's Puck, Sam, and Blaine! They're...they're massive!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, while you were away, we had some BIG changes. Emphasis on big,\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"But...oh my god Puck, what happened to you?\" He looked up at Puck who now was just a few inches taller than he was and had expanded out in every direction. \"You're so...so...so...\" Finn stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Puck asked grinning. <br>\r\n\"Well yeah!\" Finn said. \"I just...how...you're bigger than I am by far!\" He turned to Sam and Blaine and blinked rapidly. \"I must be seeing things because you guys are too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, we've grown!\" Sam and Blaine told him. <br>\r\n\"A lot has changed since you were gone,\" Rachel told him. <br>\r\n\"I see that...\" Finn said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"I just mean, wow.\"<br>\r\n\"So, want some food?\" Puck asked. \"We have a lot to talk about because I want to know why you didn't talk to us for two and a half years.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that.\" Finn said. Seeing the loaded plates everybody else had, he loaded his up and pulled up a chair next to Rachel and Puck. <br>\r\n\"Hey Finn!\" Mr. Schue said excitedly. \"How was your trip?\"<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Finn said. \"Very long but I was happy to see it.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, you actually saw us perform?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard it anyways. You guys did an amazing job.\" <br>\r\n\"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST FOREVER?\" Puck asked loudly. \"I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME WITHOUT TELLING ME OR THAT YOU ICED ME OUT FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww, you don't have to yell in my ear,\" Finn moaned, clutching his ear. <br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that. But where where you?!\" Puck demanded.<br>\r\n\"I was various places here and there, traveling around and finding my calling. I tried the military before I got kicked out for sucking at it and I floundered around for a while, doing odd jobs and performances but was unable to find anything that stuck. I almost came back in defeat before I was recruited as a teacher in various third world countries and Africa where I helped out in charity work, education, and singing and performing. It was a bit all over the place but none of those areas had a good phone or internet connection and I guess...I guess I was just scared of calling for a long time. First I was scared of admitting I was a failure for the first year and a half and after I began to do meaningful work I was scared to call because I haven't contacted any of you in such a long time that you would be angry at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So instead you decided to do a surprise visit out of the blue?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. That way if you're mad at me, you couldn't just hang up the phone or turn off the computer on me.\"<br>\r\n\"Good point, because right now I'm torn between more manly crying or killing you for what you put us through. Put ME through,\" Puck emphasized. \"You know I would never judge you and it was thanks to you I was able to pull myself together and graduate and become the successful man I am today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Do you know how much that hurt Finn, being cut out like that?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n\"We would never judge man, we're family,\" Sam sniffed.<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, I was being stupid. I'm sorry for cutting you all off like that. But I'm back and I plan to be sticking around for a little bit. If I ever do need to leave, I will make sure to tell you and will not leave you guys in the dark again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Puck said raising his voice. \"Everybody, keep digging in, we got lots of good food to share.\" Finn took a bite and moaned.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what is this? Did I die and go to heaven?\"<br>\r\n\"No, that is Dave's delicious food.\"<br>\r\n\"Dave? As in Dave Karofsky?\" Finn asked shocked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've been gone for a while but Dave is a really good cook,\" Puck told him. <br>\r\n\"Dave Karofsky...can cook? I have been gone for a while,\" Finn said, feeling extremely guilty. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will get you all caught up on everything that's changed. Of course, a lot has changed since High School,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see that,\" Finn said looking from Puck to Sam, to Blaine. \"Puck...how...\"<br>\r\n\"I came to a certain epiphany of growth, discovered how much I enjoyed it, and now share the gift with others,\" Puck summarized.<br>\r\n\"Still, you guys are so large...I mean, damn I have never seen anyone as large as you, ever Puck. Not with mobility anyways,\" Finn said. \"How could you get so large, especially so quickly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a lot of effort, training, formula, and FOOD.\" <br>\r\n\"But you always loved being so muscular,\" Finn said. \"You used to have six pack abs and everything and I was always jealous of you for that.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, funny that. Of course, I love being muscular and size but I realized that in order to get even bigger I will have to go to the extreme and well, bigger is better.\" Puck patted his massive stomach. \"Plus, I happen to love food and stuffing myself to the brink, constantly getting bigger and stronger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about everyone else?\" Finn asked. <br>\r\n\"More or less the same really,\" Sam replied. \"Except Puck all showed us the way. He's really persistent at that.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow...first time I ever felt tiny,\" Finn said looking around. <br>\r\n\"Try being surrounded by them,\" Artie said. \"It was hard enough when they were normal sized big but being surrounded by all these beefed up giants is intimidating.\" He pushed his glasses up. \"It's a very different place now.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Artie and Tina were the first to leave, followed soon by Will and then Rachel and Brody.  Though they had all left the food never stopped flowing and Dave\u2019s cooks brought out piles and piles of delicious, fatty food for the group to chow down on.  As Trevor, Sam, Blaine, Ryder, Jake, Finn, Dave, and Puck all ate one by one they each reached their break point and had to call it quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ryder was the first to give in, his stomach bloated and tight from the 13 plates of chicken tenders and fries he wolfed down, though his dress shirt and pants remained buttoned on his pudgy frame.  After Ryder was Jake, hitting his limit after eating 12 steaks \u2013 undoing the button on his pants himself as he sat back and belched.  Finn was the next to quit; shocked at how he was able to eat 11 triple cheeseburgers and at least 4 pounds of fries.  Blaine and Dave both quit at the same time, the button on Blaine\u2019s pants bursting off as he sat back, his flabby gut surging forward and stuffed to the brim with 16 cherry pies.  Dave, however, quit before reaching his breaking point, leaving the table as he went to the kitchen to talk to his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As everybody sat back and rubbed their stuffed bellies Puck, Trevor, and Sam all kept going, devouring as much as possible.  Puck was on his 24th deep-dish pizza, Trevor was scarfing down his 18th enormous bowl of fettuccini alfredo (pausing every so often eat huge loves of garlic bread) and Sam had eaten close to 200 buffalo wings.  While Puck was stuffing his face he noticed that Trevor and Sam seemed to be in a competition all their own.  They both ate as fast as they could but in the end it was Sam who caved first \u2013 the buttons on his dress shirt bursting off and his huge gut flowing out into his lap, reaching almost to his knees.  Trevor gave up only 10 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck sat back and chugged the last of his soda before letting out a massive belch, \u201c30 deep dish pizzas; new personal best.\u201d  He said, slapping his gut.<br>\r\n\u201cHow much do you weight now,\u201d Finn asked, \u201cLast time I saw you you were only 270.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting close to breaking 800.\u201d  Puck said with a grin.<br>\r\n\u201c800 POUNDS?!\u201d  DUDE, how are you even WALKING?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDaily leg workouts,\u201d Puck said, \u201ckeeps me mobile AND makes my ass look amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d  Everybody said at the same time.<br>\r\n\u201cMan, to think we started gaining together and you\u2019re almost 500 pounds heavier than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait,\u201d Sam said, \u201cYou two started gaining together?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure did,\u201d Puck said, \u201cRight before graduation.  Looks like all that traveling didn\u2019t help you grow, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Finn said, \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck at 300 for months now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, buddy,\u201d Puck replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll fatten you up in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon after the guests, as well as all the chefs, went home as it was getting close to 2 am.  Puck was standing outside, playing a game on his cellphone, as he waited for Dave to finish locking up.  Puck\u2019s once perfectly tailored shirt was now skin tight and covered only half of his gut, which spilled over his waistline down to his knees and stuck out nearly 2 feet in front of him.  As Puck had reached level 20 he heard a noise in the alleyway; he tucked his phone into his jacket pocket and waddled over to the alleyway, which Puck was almost too fat to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside the alley was a kid, 17-18, with a tall green mohawk and shaved sides, a soul patch under his plump lips, tan skin, a strong, muscular body, and porky pot belly that was just starting to droop over his waist.  The kid was wearing a black long sleeve thermal, which was tight on his biceps, pecs, and pudgy gut, as well as a denim vest covered in studs, black jeans, and knee high boots with spikes.  Puck thought he was quite attractive, and would be even more attractive with an extra 300 pounds on his frame, but then Puck noticed the graffiti on the wall of Dave\u2019s buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After snapping a quick pic Puck called out, \u201cHEY!\u201d<br>\r\nThe kid turned to see him and Puck noticed his pierced eyebrow and snakebites.  The kid ran in the opposite direction and Puck chased after as best he could \u2013 his fat hips, lovehandles, and gut only inches away from both walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The kid reached the end of the alley but tripped, landing on his stomach.  The punk rolled onto his back just as Puck stood over him and sat down \u2013 pinning the vandal under his 775-pound body.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, C\u2019MON LET ME GO!  YOU\u2019RE CRUSHING ME!\u201d  The punk said.<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re fine.  I\u2019m only on your legs\u201d Puck said, though his gut was covering the punk\u2019s entire torso, \u201cNow, what were you doing to my boyfriend\u2019s buffet?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNone of your business, FATASS!\u201d  The kid said.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u201d Puck said, lifting up his gut dropping it on the kid, knocking the wind out his lungs for a sec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Puck looked back at the graffiti and chuckled, \u201cY\u2019know, that reminds me a lot of my old work.\u201d  After thinking for a second, Puck stood up, helping the kid to his feet as well, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Evan.\u201d  He said, coughing as he took deep breaths.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, Evan.  This thing weighs a ton.\u201d  Puck said, patting his gut.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll say.\u201d Evan replied, \u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Puck said, \u201cnobody comes down this alley anyway \u2013 it\u2019s fine.  BUT you have to do me a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Evan asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t call the cops and YOU let ME take you out to eat.\u201d  Puck said.<br>\r\nEvan stared at Puck, confused, but shrugged, \u201cI can\u2019t really turn down free food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two exchanged phone numbers and made plans to meet up next week at Dave\u2019s buffet at 3.  Puck waddled out first, being the biggest, and Evan left shortly after Puck and Dave drove away; finishing his art before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That next week at school\u2026</span></div></div>",

Puck was surprised that he hadn't known Evan went to McKinnley though he shouldn't be since everybody who lived in the county went there. Still, how'd Puck miss someone like Evan before was irritating since now that he knows Evan's existence, it was pretty obvious. Puck almost walked on before he did a double-take, eying Evan again who was busy twisting in the combination of his locker. Puck had an eye for the beefy and Evan looked even beefier than he had last week. He had clearly gained weight with how skintight stressed his pants were clinging that plump ass and thighs and when Evan turned, his jacket was open and his white shirt rode up, exposing a stretch of stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you,\" Evan said when he saw Puck. \"I didn't know you went here.\"<br>\r\n\"I actually am the gym teacher and coach,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Evan eyed him skeptically. \"I find that extremely hard to believe, especially with how big you are.\"<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Puck said smirking. \"Anyways, I thought I recognized all, or at least most students who go to this school but I can't believe I never saw you before until this day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family actually just moved here,\" Evan said. \"Today is my first day in this school.\"<br>\r\n\"Your family actually moved here?\" Puck was surpised. \"Why would anyone actually move into Lima, Ohio?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Evan shrugged. \"My dad got a job here and mom just followed.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you gain some weight?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"Wow, that's direct,\" said Evan. <br>\r\n\"But you have,\" Puck said smirking.<br>\r\n\"Okay maybe a little.\" Puck just rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Tha'ts a lot more than a little.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I did get bigger,\" A lot bigger. Evan was unconsciously patting his bulging stomach.<br>\r\n\"Tell me how,\" Puck cajoled. <br>\r\n\"Well I had to try out the buffet that happened to be right there. I like food a lot as you can tell. But man that place...is good. I've gone a couple times already and I always leave there utterly stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave's food will do that to you,\" Puck said grinning. \"I had been hoping to witness your first time tasting food there but at least I can see the results.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sticking out like a sore thumb,\" Evan groaned. <br>\r\n\"It's awesome,\" Puck smiled. \"By the way, don't forget we're going to be meeting there after school today as per our agreement.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah...\" Evan groaned. \"Can I change or something first beforehand so I don't ruin my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sincerely doubt you'll be wearing those again for a long tme,\" Puck gestured, \"given how tight they are now. Besides take pride in your being a big sexy guy. Also, it's rather expected and par for the course at the buffet and especially after eating Dave's food. Our regulars have been growing a lot in general as you know. So, see you at 3?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine, see you then,\" Evan said. Puck started to walk away before he stopped. \"Hey, show me your schedule. I want to put you in my PE class along with my other students.\" Evan handed it over and Puck scribbled and signed a note. \"There, you are in my class so I expect to see you tomorrow. And no ditching that one,\" Puck admonished. \"Well, no ditching any of them, except maybe math. I ditched that one myself plenty of times, but I especially don't want you ditching mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I got it,\" Evan mumbled as he turned away. \"I'm off to history now so bye.\" Puck nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Puck said, not really believing it from the way Evan glanced down as he said it. \"But just know I am keeping an eye on you and if you do make some graffitti markings, I recommend the back dumpsters because no one ever goes to check back there.\" Evan eyed Puck before walking away and Puck did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three o'clock as they had agreed, Evan was there. Puck was rather surprised at how punctual he was as he had only just arrived to find Evan already there waiting for him. \"Wow, great job of being ontime,\" Puck grinned. \"It's nice when people are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's just do this. I'm starving for this delicious food,\" Evan said cutting to the chase. \"By the way, are you some sort of kinky sex pervert that gets off on watching other people eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that in such a negative way but I definitely enjoy watching and helping people grow,\" Puck grinned. \"Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess not. I was just wondering though given how big you are how into this you.\" Evan gestured to his protruding gut. <br>\r\n\"Well, that is true, I do like that a lot.\" They headed into the buffet which was at low tide in the number of people there which is why Puck chose then. There was slightly more privacy, he can get food quicker, and he wanted this to be fun and actually hearing and talking to Evan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Puck,\" Finn said, waddling over to them. From the looks of it, Finn had been there for at least an hour or more already with the way his shirt had ridden up and exposed Finn's slightly hairy bulging gut. \"I was just having some lunch while I was looking for work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Puck's face lit up. \"Dude, you should see if you can assist Mr. Schue with the Glee Club!\" <br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. Hey, whose your friend?\"<br>\r\n\"This is Evan,\" Puck said introducing him. \"Finn, this is Evan. Evan, this is one of my best friends in the whole world Finn.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Finn said, holding out his hand. Evan stared at it and did nothing. Finn shrugged. \"Okay then. Hey, he kind of reminds me of someone though, I can't put my finger on it...oh wait, you Puck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, but I actually liked you though,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"With everyone else I mean but yeah, Mohawk, shirt, size queen...\"<br>\r\n\"Size king Finn, not a queen,\" Puck interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah size king...a lot like you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm still here you know,\" Evan interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Finn patted his stomach and burped. \"Uuuuuurrrppp, yeah, sorry about that. Finally have room for some dessert so see you guys later,\" Finn said walking off. Puck would have loved to have checked on Finn but he had Evan to worry about. Next time would have to do. Puck lead Evan to the back area he loved to sit in. Surprisingly, they weren't alone because Brody and Rachel were there as well, Brody stuffing his face with cheesecake with Rachel rubbing his belly and occasionally taking nibbles from it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey,\" Puck said surprised. \"I didn't expect to see you guys here at this time.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it is less busy now,\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n\"What about whatever contract you guys were on?\"<br>\r\n\"We finished today and needed to celebrate. The food here is very good,\" Rachel said. Brody moaned in agreement. Rachel leaned over and kissed him, her hands massaging his bloated belly. She then started feeding him slices of cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty good at that Rachel,\" Puck said impressed. She didn't respond but Puck could tell she was pleased. Anyways, this remind him that he needed to feed Evan. \"So what do you feel like having?\" he asked Evan who was staring a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry, let me think for a moment.\" Evan watched interested as Rachel fed the last pieces of cheesecake into Brody's mouth. Brody was flagging a little bit but with encouragement he managed to get it all down. He sagged back, against the seat and his shirt rode up, exposing his bloated stomach which bowed over his pants. It wasn't huge at all and by Puck's standards was just a baby belly, but it was looking pretty big on Brody who only a couple weeks before had six-pack abs before he got to them. Sometimes, Puck felt so evil. On the other hand, Rachel clearly wasn't complaining as she laid kisses up and down his stomach and playing with it. Hmm, weird actually since while he had always known-suspected that Rachel enjoyed Finn's heft for example, he had never pegged her as a feeder sort but maybe it was just with some people. Evan was also interested and Puck wondered which part he was thinking about, or perhaps both? He will ask later but first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to have?\" Puck asked Evan again. Evan looked away and said, \"I will have...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll tell Dave you're ready.\" Puck got up and went into the backroom. Evan looked around. There were only a few people there like the Finn guy who was Puck's friend and the girl and guy couple. She was rubbing his very bloated belly as he laid back and panted a bit, but there was a look of satisfaction on his face. He was enjoying it and so was the girl. Evan's attention snapped back when Puck and Dave came out, rolling over a large trolley with the selected items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to introduce you to Dave, the owner of this place and the main cook,\" Puck explained. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm Dave. I understand you're Puck's new personal project,\" Dave told him. \"I totally agree, this is going to be awesome.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Evan growled. \"I'm no one's project. <br>\r\n'I'm certain the police will be interested in some very interesting information then,\" Puck told him. \"Besides, you ate here a couple times already. It's not so bad. I just want you to do what you already are clearly good at doing.\" He nodded at Evan's belly. \"Eating and growing that big boy. You know you like it.\" Puck was right of course but it was the principle of the thing.\" Evan almost got up and left but the smell of the food made his tummy grumble. He always did have a weakness for food, especially for mac n' cheese and wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine whatever, let's get this started with the macaroni and cheese.\" Evan loved cheese and this was so him. Puck placed a massive deep dish pan in front of Evan, several layers thick of the stuff and Evan had to admit he was impressed. That was a lot of macaroni. Picking up the fork, Evan scooped the first spoonful into his mouth and groaned at the taste. It was so gooey good that Evan nearly cried. It was the best tasting macaroni and cheese that he had ever tasted. The cheese danced on his tongue, a pleasure and delight to taste. Eagerly, Evan shoveled in another bite and another bite. He couldn't get enough and he wondered why he didn't have the macaroni earlier. This was good stuff. Layer after layer went into his mouth, his gut expanding. He didn't care as he always liked the feeling, to see how far it could go. The macaroni was very filling  and eventually he scraped the bottom of the deep pan. Evan rubbed his gut and burped, and he grinned feeling Puck's eyes on him. It was interesting to know that this guy was really interested. Evan still didn't really know what to think about Puck. He seemed nice enough but blackmail was not cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan did get free food though which is worth it. Evan nodded towards the mashed potatoes  and they were placed in front of him, a massive white mound that was thick and high on the huge plate. This was going to be tough, especially after all the cheesy goodness of macaroni. Evan was up for it though and started right away, stuffing as much as he could down. It naturally tasted great. He slowed down as his gut gut fuller and fuller. Finally, he was at the bucket of wings. He didn't even need to taste those before he knew they were going to be good, especially after what he's eaten so far. Evan almost gave up but he felt fuller than he had in a long time and it felt good. His stomach was bloated out onto his lap and he reached down and undid the button of this pants, letting his gut spill out. Ahhh, that felt good. Evan sighed in relief as he spilled out. He needed that in order to get ready for the rest. And then a bucket of chicken wings was placed in front of him. He didn't need to taste to know it was going to taste absolutely amazing. They couldn't serve anything that was less than excellent and he could smell it. Evan happily picked out a handful from the large bucket and bit into them and groaned. Yep, they tasted amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings were far easier to swallow than the macaroni and cheese or mashed potatoes. There was a quite a bit in the bucket but considering the multiple layers of macaroni and cheese he had to get through or white potato mountain, those were definitely harder. With wing after wing going into his stomach, he absent-mindedly rubbed his stomach letting out some loud stuffed belches of his own. Somehow he managed to finish through and there was only crumbs left in the bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job,\" Puck said. He had been watching Evan eat the entire time but Evan had just about forgotten he was still there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, -uuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrppppppppp hey. Man I'm stuffed.\" Puck grinned and left for a moment again. Evan laid there rubbing his stuffed stomach. He was surprised though when Puck came back with a massive sundae that he dropped in front of Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about dessert?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"No--uuuuuuurrrpp thanks,\" Evan burped again and felt queezy. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can handle it, just like everything else,\" Puck said confidently. <br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Evan muttered. <br>\r\n\"You're doing it,\" Puck said, giving the look again that he made when he talked about when potentially calling the police.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Evan said. He took his spoonful and slowly dug in. It was a very rich chocolate and vanilla swirl and he almost threw up. This was going to be the activity that defeated him. There was no way he was going to be able to finish. After a number of bites, Evan flung the spoon down in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I lost. Sorry I couldn't finish it.\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can. Let me help you finish it. Evan tried to say no but didn't have the energy when the spoon was roughly shed into his mouth. Evan swallowed and tried to complain but another spoonful was shoved into his mouth. Fortunately, Puck's other hand was rubbing and soothing Evan's belly at the same time and he made it feel really good. With Puck's help, all the icecream was soon gone and Evan was more stuffed than he had ever been in his life. He was bigger too and Puck was definitely having fun taking care of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to do this again sometime,\" Puck grinned and Evan groaned at the thought but oddly excited, especially with how Puck's touch on his tautt-full stomach. It felt good and he wished for it to happen again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud, almost echoing belch filled the nearly empty room as Puck sat back in his seat - one hand on his gargantuan gut, which had doubled in size from his massive meal, and the other picking at his teeth with a toothpick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty as always.\"  The nearly 800-pound man said as he patted his gut, a satisfied look on his face.<br>\r\nEvan sat across from Puck, still bloated from his meal but not nearly in as much pain as he had been two hours ago.  His full, swollen belly was fully exposed, his shirt ridden up and refusing to go back down, but it was the stunned look on the punk's face that made Puck raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"You just ate enough food for like... 12 people.  How are you not in a food-coma?\" Evan replied, still in shock.<br>\r\n\"Oh, psssh,\" Puck said, waving his hand dismissively, \"That was nothing, trust me.  It takes a lot more than that for me to get totally full.\"  Puck placed his toothpick on top of the stack of plates before scooting to the side of his booth and standing up - showing off the full circumference of his stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck's enormous belly hung low and jutted out far; the massive mound of muscle and fat reached down to Puck's knees and stuck out nearly 3 feet in front of him.  Puck turned towards Evan, his body jiggling with each step, and he placed his hands on his hips, \"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Evan said, his face red at the sight of Puck's godly body, \"Y-yeah.\" he finally stuttered out, trying to regain his demeanor.  Evan exited the booth and the two walked (or in Puck's case waddled) out of the buffet.  Once outside in the chill, November air, Puck turned to Evan.<br>\r\n\"So,\" he started, \"You know why I asked you lunch?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"You mean blackmailed me?\" Evan replied.<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, blackmailed you,\" Puck responded, \"But, no, I brought you here because I see a lot of myself in you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm like one-third your size.\" Evan replied sarcastically.  Puck replied with a punch to the arm.<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.  You remind me a lot of myself when I was your age and, truth be told, I don't wanna see you make those same mistakes.  Home isn't that great, is it?\" Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan was quiet for a bit but then answered, \"Not really.  It's not like, abusive or anything, but it's almost like I don't even exist anymore.  My parents are so busy with everything all the time that I just feel... ignored.\"  Evan chuckled, covering his face with his hand, \"God, I can't believe I'm even telling you this.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Puck said, \"Look, think of me as like... an older brother figure; someone to look after you and keep you outta trouble.  I know your acting out is just cause you're seeking attention and I'm willing to give you that attention.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Evan asked, a confused look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Really.  On one small condition, though.\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess - you wanna fatten me up?\"  Evan replied with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct-amundo.\" Puck said, patting Evan's gut, \"In a few short weeks you'll be a big 'ol butterball when I'm done with you.\"<br>\r\nEvan thought about it for a second and then shrugged, \"Why the hell not?\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\"  Puck said with a grin, \"I've already talked things over with Dave and he's agreed to give you a life-time 100% off discount.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner - all of it is free.\"<br>\r\n\"How the hell you'd pull that off?\"  Evan asked.<br>\r\n\"Dave's my boyfriend.\" Puck answered.<br>\r\n\"Not surprised.\"  Evan said, rolling his eyes, \"Gimme a lift home?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month had passed since then and the chill air of November soon froze over into the frigid, snow filled month of December.  All the schools were on winter break and had been for the last 3 weeks and extra time off only fueled the gainers of WMHS to pack on more weight.  The digital numbers of Trevor's brand new scale flashed changed at a rapid pace the second the wrestler's titanic ass stepped on: 275, 318, 464, 499, 526, 587, and finally resting on an even 600.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, you gotta read it for me, I'm too fat to see past my gut.\"  Trev said with glee.  He had been too fat to see past his own stomach for some time now but saying it always made him giddy.<br>\r\n\"Well, congrats, babe.  You finally hit 600 pounds.\" Micah said, placing his massive hands on his huge hips.<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE KIDDING!!!\"  Trevor practically screamed, stepping off of the scale and doing a little happy dance.  His entire body bounced and jiggled as he did so and Micah couldn't be more proud or turned on than he was now.<br>\r\n\"I'M SO HAPPY!\"  Trevor said, wrapping his arms around Micah's huge musclegut before looking at his bodybuilder boyfriend, \"I can't believe I finally broke 600!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you.\" Micah said before leaning down and kissing his butterball of a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet kisses soon turned hot and heavy as Micah's tongue slid into Trevor's mouth, his powerful hands gripped Trev's strong ,beefy thighs, and the huge juggernaut lifted his 600 pound boyfriend off his feet and pressed him against the wall.  Trevor's arms wrapped around Micah's thick neck as they made out - only being supported by Micah's powerful arms.  After a few minutes they slowed down, foreheads pressed against each other, and they grinned before Micah lowered Trevor back down this feet.<br>\r\n\"You hungry?\"  Micah asked.<br>\r\n\"Always.\" Trev responded and the two headed down stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor plopped his massive, fat frame onto the couch while Micah's hulk-like body headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Pasta okay?\" Micah called to his boyfriend.<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!  And don't forget the garlic bread!  I bought 3 loaves yesterday - go ahead and cook 'em all.\"  Trevor replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah hummed in the kitchen to himself as Trevor sat on the couch, watching TV and playing with his fat.  Trev was surprised as he felt Micah's hands grab and pull off his crop top before reaching down and fondling Trevor's soft pecs, \"Water's boiling.  You're so huge and soft, babe.\"<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Trev said happily, \"I can't wait for Puck to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got quiet and Micah slipped his hands off Trevor's moobs.  It took Trevor a few seconds to realize and when he looked up from his gut Micah was already back in the kitchen.  Trevor lifted his heft off the couch and followed.<br>\r\n\"Everything okay, Mike?\" Trevor asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything's fine.\" Micah replied.<br>\r\n\"No it's not,\" Trevor said, \"I know when you're keeping something secret.\"<br>\r\nMicah took a deep breath and sighed, \"You... You still love me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor blinked, confused, before speaking, \"Of course I still love you.  Where is this coming from?\"<br>\r\n\"Puck.  It's coming from Puck.\" Micah said.<br>\r\n\"Puck?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  He's all you talk about lately; 'how big do you think Puck'll get?  Do you think I'll impress Puck with my weight when school starts again?  How fat do you think Puck'll make Evan?'  It's like you don't even care about me anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Babe... look, I know I talk about Puck all the time but that doesn't mean I don't love you!  I mean, yeah, I have a bit of a crush on him, but he's my idol!  I wanna be as big as him - even bigger!  I'm attracted to him but I'm not in LOVE with him.  I'm in love with you.\" Trevor said, turning Micah around.<br>\r\n\"You mean that?\" Micah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Puck can fatten me up and fuck my ass raw but he's not interested in me romantically the same way you are.  You take care of me when I'm sick, you comfort me when I get scared.  You know all my secrets.\"<br>\r\n\"Like your toy collection.\" Micah interrupted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I'm turned on by Puck but I'm in LOVE with you.\"  Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled for a bit and Micah wrapped his obese boyfriend in the biggest of bear hugs, \"I love you too.  I'm sorry about all that.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Trevor said, \"It's partly my fault.  Let's get this food finished, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Winter break continues and a month passes. During that time, Evan faithfully ate at Dave's buffet every day which was the new place to be. While there, Evan got priority and privacy in the back though away from the noisy crowd outside for him to eat in peace. At the current time however, Evan was at home, sorting through the mail when he saw a red envelope with his name written on it. Curious, he opened it and was shocked to find a Christmas card. Inside was a message that invited him to a Christmas party at the Puckerman house. It didn't take long at all before Evan decided he was going to go. It was going to be a quiet Christmas at home anyway of awkward small talk since his parents barely knew anything about him and most of the time didn't care to. Around the holidays, they get reminded they have a son whom they try to awkwardly communicate with but it never went well and someone left the table angry. Sometimes it was Evan, sometimes his parents, but the sad thing was they had absolutely nothing in common. Evan supposed it could have been worse, they could have been abusive and beat on him like other kid's parents. He was most certainly glad his parents didn't. But what a pathetic standard it is that at least they don't abuse him. They  did provide for him, especially funds for food as well as schooling, but nothing much else. He wasn't even sure if they had noticed any changes in him at all as sad as that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving to the house, he heard Christmas music playing through it and smelled delicious smells that he could smell even outside before he even got in. There wasn't much snow on the ground at the moment so it was an open window. Evan went to the door and rang it. The door was opened to reveal Jake filling the doorway. \"Oh hey Evan, come on in.\" He gestured stepping aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to ask, aren't you guys Jewish or something?\" Evan asked as he walked in. \"I wouldn't have thought you would celebrate Christmas.\"<br>\r\n\"We are, at least I'm half Jewish. We're not so religiously inclined and while we don't celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday, we find nothing wrong with celebrating Christmas as a secular holiday that celebrates friends and family coming together, having a good time, and exchanging presents. We celebrate Hannukah later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then,\" Evan said. Looking around he saw a massive tree decorated with lights in the corner of the living room and also multiple tables put together where there was already a massive placement of snack food. Considering who was there, it made total sense. There were already a couple of people there who were stuffing their faces. Trevor, a big hulking blonde giant who was probably one of the most massive guys Evan had ever seen, second to Puck but on the other hand, this guy probably towered over Puck about a foot. At least almost a foot. There was another big round beefy blonde similar in size to Trevor who Evan remembered was named Sam. There were some unfamiliar people Evan had met before, yet another blonde who seemed to be kissing Jake enthusiastically that Evan guessed to be Ryder, and Finn Hudson. It was odd because Evan was one of the smallest people there which was a rare thing before he stepped foot into the town of Lima, Ohio but here just about everyone was massive. At least, the people who knew Puck were the ones who were massive. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my names Tyrone,\" said a very big black guy shaking Evan's hand. <br>\r\n\"Um, I'm Evan,\" Evan said awkwardly. <br>\r\n\"It's good to meet you. I assume you're Puck's new project? He definitely loves to talk about it,\" Tyrone said. <br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know how I feel about using the term project, but yeah, I guess I am,\" Evan told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's really excited about you. Well, he is always excited about growing everyone, but he's especially excited about blowing you up big. Something about you reminding him of himself.\" Evan noticed Finn glaring at him from across the room when Tyrone said that. He must have heard. Evan made a face at him just because and chuckled when Finn turned his head away. Geez, what was that guy's problem? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Evan reached out and grabbed one of the cakes and took a bite out of it. It was cream flavored and very yummy. Evan quickly swallowed it down and grabbed another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good talk then,\" Tyrone said and moved off to talk to the really big blonde giant. Sam and some other guy were staring at each other and gesturing to one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I can eat more,\" the guy Evan didn't know at all was saying. \"You stand no chance.\"<br>\r\n\"But I've been practicing and this time I will beat you,\" Sam said smirking. \"This time the crown will be mine Danny.\"<br>\r\n\"You know you'll always be behind,\" the guy said whose name was apparently Danny. Next thing Evan saw, he saw the two big beefy guy each dig into a massive plate of cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really competitive those two,\" said a voice behind Evan. Evan jumped a little and turned around to see Ryder and Jake stand there. \"Both are competing to be the biggest guys in school. Well, after Puck and Micah.\" Evan guessed that the really big tall blond stud had to be Micah. \"Last time Danny won and it shocked Sam who had been falling behind and slacking. Puck showed Sam up in front of everyone and poor guy had to suffer drinking gallon after gallon of Puck's special weight gain shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to know, I guess,\" Evan said. He looked Ryder over. He was the only guy currently there who was approximately Evan's size though a bit smaller. He did have a pretty decent sized pot gut that stretched his white wife-beater. Jake tapped him and Ryder opened his mouth which Jake stuffed  pieces of cheescake into and grinned wolfishly as he put massive hands on Ryder's stomach and felt him up right in front of him. Well okay then Jake was definitely a Puckerman. What was even the point of that? To make a message that Ryder was his? Evan didn't know. Ryder was pretty cute though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in come that guy and girl couple. Evan recognized them as they showed up every now and then at the buffet. She never ordered anything but kept sliding dishes to her boyfriend. While he wasn't big in the slightest by people fed by Puck or these giant standards, Evan did notice that the guy had gotten bigger since he had seen them last at the buffet. The buttons of his shirt were straining around a rounded gut and looked ready to pop. They were each carrying a couple of boxes with presents and dumped them under the christmas tree before coming back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Evan said to them. They turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you must be Evan,\" the petite girl said to him. She might have been small but she somehow exuded an intensity and energy that intimidated Evan a bit<br>\r\n\"You must be Evan. Puck certainly has been excited to have a new guy to feed. My name is Rachel and this is my boyfriend Brody.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Brody said putting out his hand. \"I think I've seen you before.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at the buffet. I go there a lot and I've seen you their plenty too. Dave can sure cook.\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Brody blushed slightly as he patted his belly. \"The food really is good and I can't stop eating there. The food...oh my god, there is just no way to describe it. I've put on a few pounds ever since Puck took me there for the first time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a few as Evan had been a brief witness to many of the times they came in and getting slightly bigger each time and he was tempted to tease but didn't. Puck had already come up and was squeezing Rachel to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could come! I'm always happy to see my favorite girl!\" Puck said excitedly. Rachel gasped and struggled a bit before Puck let her go. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I wish we could stay longer,\" she said. \"But honestly we're just here to drop off some presents, wish you and Sam a merry Christmas, and be on our way to another Christmas party we are obligated to attend. If we could stay, we would have but unfortunately we have to get going soon. Where is Sam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam's that way,\" Puck pointed to where Sam and Danny were neck in neck demolishing gingerbread cookies. Rachel chuckled and shook her head. \"We've really come a long way since freshman year of high school haven't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we have grown up,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"And out. Very, very out,\" Rachel smirked. <br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah,\" Rachel headed over and poked Sam on the back a couple of times in the interim where he didn't have a cookie in his mouth. It took a couple of tries to get his attention but eventually Sam turned his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel!\" He cried out and hugged her. \"Danny, give me a few minutes okay? I got to welcome my favorite tiny diva. Merry Christmas! How are you Rach?\"<br>\r\n\"Doing good. I can't remember if I mentioned this but you guys did excellent at competition. I was a bit worried since with your extra size, who knows what could have happened, but it worked out all right. Also, great song choice in 'Shut up and Dance With Me'. Glad to have inspired you.\" Puck came towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can't stay a few minutes longer? We haven't even served food yet. I'm sure Brody would love some,\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, but we can't skip out on this event. It is mandatory attendance for everybody that was on the show. If I could have, I would have loved to celebrate Christmas with you guys. I hope you like the presents I got you though.\" She smirked. \"And yeah Brody would have loved the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is too bad. We need to hang out again sometime Rachel,\" Puck told her. <br>\r\n\"Of course. Well, see you later,\" <br>\r\n\"Rachel,\" Finn said coming up to her. <br>\r\n\"Go away Finn,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Please talk to me,\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have any time right now Finn and I am still mad at you,\" she told him.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know but I was hoping we could get past that. \"ere <br>\r\n\"Mmh how do I say this...I am very angry with you for not calling or sending even a message for a long time. I had no idea if you were alive or dead.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, I messed up but I'm back now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, everybody hungry for the big meal? Trust me, eat as much as you want, we have plenty. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As all of the massive, meaty guys in the room waddled to the dining hall Puck took one of his thick hands and grabbed hold of Finn's sweater sleeve, pulling him aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, listen,\" Puck said, looking up at his tall, chubby best friend, \"I'm saying this because you're my best bro; Rachel's over you and you need to move on.\"<br>\r\nFinn eyebrows crinkled together, distraught, but his expression softened as he took a deep breath, \"Yeah, you're right.  I just... I just don't now what to do now.\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"I know exactly what you should do.  Take all that sadness and anger you got inside and put it all into this baby.\"  Puck said, patting Finn's chubby gut.<br>\r\nFinn chuckled, \"Good idea.  Thanks, man.\"<br>\r\n\"No prob,\" Puck replied, \"How much you weighin now?\"<br>\r\n\"340.\" Finn said, lifting up his sweater to show off his fatter body; the tall teen's moobs were bigger and his gut stuck out farther, drooped a little lower, and he had a few new stretch marks.  Puck placed a hand under it and give Finn's belly a few jiggles.<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\"  Puck said, \"Keep up the eating and you'll be a real fatty in no time.  Now go get some grub.\"  Puck said with a grin, smacking Finn's chubby ass as the two headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Finn took his seat Puck stood at the (newly expanded) entryway to the dinning room, placed his hands on his hips, and looked over his enormous guests.  Everyone at the table was stuffing their faces with as much food as they could possibly shovel into their mouths.  Strong biceps and pecs bounced as they reached for more food, bellies expanding and filling up their huge laps with each bite, asses so round, beefy and fat that they spilled over the sides of the chairs or through the backs.  Puck smiled, feeling his cock get rock hard at the thought that none of these men would be the sizes they are if it weren't for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny, Trevor, and Sam, Puck's fattest projects, were gorging themselves on mashed potatoes and ham, an attempt to not only out eat each other but to be the fattest guys in school.  Micah, Jake, and Tyrone, Puck's musclechubs, were stuffing their faces with as much turkey as they could.  Dave, Puck's own fat boyfriend, was happily chowing down on massive portions of everything, while Finn, Ryder, and Evan - the 3 smallest guys there, were all eating as much as possible to catch up the other's sizes.  Puck grinned as he waddled over to the two chairs in between Evan and Dave and sat down - the two chairs barely able to contain his gargantuan cheeks.  Without a word Puck dug in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party went on for another 5 hours - four of which everyone spent by stuffing their guts.  Buttons popped off, pant seats tore, and Trevor, the fattest (but not heaviest) guy there actually destroyed the chair he had been sitting on with his fat rear.  Belly's were stuffed, bloated, and two, almost 3 times for some, their original size and everybody was loving it.  The last hour was spent relaxing and opening presents that they had all brought for each other.  Eventually the party died down and most everybody left fuller and fatter than when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Ryder had gone upstairs, turning in for the night, while Dave was in the kitchen washing up.  Evan was in the living room, watching a movie while he lied back on the entire couch, rubbing his swollen, stuffed belly.  As Evan relaxed, attempting to soothe his gut, Puck waddled in - his own monstrously fat belly sticking out a good three feet further than usual, and he grinned as approached Evan.<br>\r\n\"How's my pudgy punk feeling?\"  Puck asked, rubbing Evan's swollen belly.<br>\r\n\"Like I'm gonna pop.\"  Evan said, between deep breaths as Puck's hand worked it's magic.<br>\r\n\"Thats what I like to hear.  You're plumping up nicely, Ev.  You'll break 500 in no time.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n\"I haven't even hit 400.\"  Evan replied.<br>\r\n\"You will soon,\" Puck responded, \"Then you'll break 500, then 600, and on and on.\"<br>\r\n\"How fat are you planning on making me?\"  Evan asked, his face turning red at the thought.<br>\r\n\"As fat as I want you to be.\"  Puck said before lying his 830 pound body onto Evan's - his fat gut spreading over the punk's frame and surrounding him in soft, warm flesh.  Evan groaned in ecstasy, loving the way Puck's massive frame squashed him, his tongue forcing it's way between the teen's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made out for a bit, Evan's cock rock hard from the weight of Puck's 830 pound body on top of him.  Puck finally pulled back and grinned before using his powerful arms to lift himself off Evan and sitting down - his wide body taking up two and a half cushions leaving very little room for Evan.<br>\r\nEvan smiled up at Puck, \"Sounds fun.  Maybe one day I'll get as big as you.\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled back, \"Thats the plan.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn, school is starting and nothing fits,\" Evan muttered to himself. He had gone shopping over the break but with all the eating Evan had been doing, even the new clothes he had gotten to cover his newer figure were already starting to get a bit tight and cling against his big belly and gut. He had seriously exploded over the break with all the meals at Dave's buffet and the massive epic meals at Puck's house over Christmas and New Years really pushed his body to the limit. Evan smiled, excited as he remembered cocky Puck's fervent lust and desire when Puck grabbed his belly and kissed him many times over Christmas and New Years. Evan wasn't an idiot, Puck was a sexual poly omnivore who was interested in everyone who is growing so any long term exclusive relationship was never going to happen. On the other hand, Evan didn't need it too be exclusive and it was nice to be wanted and desired and Puck was very interested in Evan's new fat belly, having grabbed and played with it all winter long and stuffing it full of good food plus he was heavy and dominant and really knew what he was doing. Evan was going to play it as long as Puck wanted to and he was curious as to how far that he would be able to take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to see just how big he was now, Evan got up on the scale and with craning was able to see that he could just barely glimpse the numbers that were showing. It looked like he was an incredible 380 pounds which was ridiculous since only a couple months ago he was 265 and in the course of six weeks had somehow managed to put on over 115 pounds which was just ridiculous until they realized how much heavy fattening (and frighteningly addictive good tasting) Dave's food was and he ate there everyday for almost if not all the meals for over six months and really packed on the pounds. No wonder Puck and his group kept getting bigger and bigger with food like that available. His parents had been a tad shocked and disappointed but it only reinforced how useless or uncaring they were that they barely said anything but gave him the money for bigger clothes. He would have ignored them anyways, but they could have at least made an effort to be actual parents for once that cared that somehow their son managed to put on over 100 pounds in a rather quick period of time and was nearing a healthy 400. Only twenty more to go from his actual 380. Well, if his parents didn't care, nor would he. He didn't have anything else so tight clothes that showed off the bottom half of his fat and slightly hairy stomach would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan needn't have worried however about being embarassed. The moment he went in, he noticed something incredibly odd. It looked like everyone in the school was a little, if not a lot heavier than he remembered. Everyone had at least the beginnings of a baby belly that was apparent from their tighter clothes, or even full blown guts, some of which were flaunted. As far as he could tell, there wasn't a single skinny person left in the school. Even the teachers seemed to have put on weight since the last time Evan had seen them in class. It was getting a bit freaky. Most of those people he had seen at Dave's buffet so he could guess the source of their new bellies. If he didn't know better, Evan wondered if he hadn't somehow ended up in invasion of the body snatchers or beamed up in a Twilight Zone episode 'To Serve Man' which was one of his favorites. He wasn't sure if this wasn't exactly what had happened with Puck and how he brought food to everyone. Well, it was none of his business and he was as much a part of it as everyone else. In fact, he kind of liked it, a world of everyone being bigger. He felt downright normal in comparison and while he was definitely bigger than a majority of the human body in this school still, he was downright small compared to Puck's boys. He could see Trevor shuffling down the hall, his wide body taking up halls space. That was a big one and while not as big as Puck and Micah, he was still one of the largest guys Evan had ever seen period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going?\" Evan asked Trevor. He and Trevor had some interesting conversations over Christmas and New Years and it seemed like Evan was going to be Puck's new project. Trevor had been slightly jealous but they hashed it out since Micah had been concerned about Trevor leaving him for Puck and Trevor reminded him that as much as he was into Puck, he wasn't emotionally committed to anyone but Micah and not to mention Puck is always with everybody  anyways. Puck was good at many things but a monogamous relationship was not one of them and Trevor did value intimacy and closeness and while Puck could be intimate, it just wasn't really the same as with Micah and Trevor had been shocked at hearing how Micah had been really scared of Trevor leaving him. Micah had never said anything and been stoically tough so Trevor had never even known there was a problem until it just exploded out. They fixed it though which pulled Trevor back enough to be very happy that Puck had found someone else to feed. Though in truth, he was still just a little envious that Puck would be focusing so much on Evan. He didn't blame Evan at all though, Evan was a great guy and much like him, but not as cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, gained a bit over vacation. I'm now at 640,\" Trevor said proudly. He certainly looked it. Evan could not understand how the fabric wasn't jumping off from Trevor's fat body with how tight it was clinging and revealing gaps of his thick fleshy stomach. Then again, if there were somehow clothes that could fit Puck, they could find things that could fit Trevor...just not very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great,\" Evan said. <br>\r\n\"Also, I'm going to be joining the Glee club. You should audition too,\" Trevor added. <br>\r\n\"What, you are? I mean, you can sing?\" Evan asked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can. I'm pretty good too. I'm also bringing Micah in so we can do it together. He gets nervous but I think that's silly because he's even better than I am with such a deep masculine manly voice it gives me shivers to listen too and no one would dare mock him for it. He'd have knocked them out either by his talent, or by his fists. But I definitely think the first is more likely if he would just get up and do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know...\" Evan said. \"I'll think about it. It's not really my thing but there are some cool people there and I have heard good things about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, auditions are later at 3:30 if you can make it,\" Trevor said. \"I'm going to class now,\" Trevor headed into the next room and got stuck in the doorway. \"Ummm, well, that's not good. These doorways are too small for my body to fit through. Hey, does anyone want to help me? Evan, if you're still there, can you help a guy out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright,\" Evan muttered as he got behind Trevor and started pushing. \"How are you going to get back out later?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no clue. How does Puck deal with these again?\" <br>\r\n\"How do you not know, you see him everyday?\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but usually I'm thinking of other things and it's usually not doors these small. The gym doors are a lot wider.\" With some struggle and pounding against Trevor's thick rubbery body, Evan managed to push him in. Sweating from the effort he wiped his forehead. \"There you go, you're in!\" He called out. \"Find your own way out later, I have my own class to get to!\" Evan turned around and saw that there was a crowd of impatient students who had just witnessed what had happened. \"Uh, you're free to go in now,\" he said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" a number of them muttered under their breaths as they trudged in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan thought about it. Did he want to do Glee club? Could he even sing? He had done it a couple times but he didn't exactly practice or do it very much. It wasn't his normal thing but then again, this wasn't a normal school. Here Glee club was actually kind of popular after having won numerous years in Regionals and making it to National Competitions a couple of times and here the greatest people lived. Also here was the legend of Noah \"Puck\" Puckerman who had been in Glee club and was now making everybody play along to his tune in weight gain. Trevor and Micah were trying out, he knew Jake and Ryder from Puck's parties and they were pretty cool, and any form of anything interesting that happened in this town related to the Glee club somehow. Perhaps there was no risk in at least trying out in any case. Perhaps he will. He was going to think about it after lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was...interesting since the tables were designed for normal sized people and since everybody was now bigger than they originally were, some a lot bigger, seating was impossible. After numerous fights over precious table space, the administration acknowledged they might have a weight problem and that for the meantime, they were going to split lunch into staggered shifts throughout the day, starting the next school day. As for the first day, people could either eat outside, or if they were able to drive, to leave campus and eat elsewhere. Many did since there wasn't enough prepared if everybody's appetite increased. So when Evan arrived at Dave's buffet, he wasn't surprised to find the parking lot full of students and people having to park in the street or further down and having to walk in. It was the most busy and packed Evan had ever seen it and he wondered where everybody had come from because although it had been busy, there were never this many people. He was fortunate to have a connection with the propietor as he got his normal table as he saw people having to be turned away just for space and safety laws. It was complete utter havoc but at least he got food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the mess that was lunch, Evan drove back to school because why not? He wasn't the biggest fan but things were getting interesting  that everyone was getting big. Just staring at all those extra pounds on everybody just made things much more entertaining. He also wondered about joining the glee club. Perhaps he should. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan's belly gurgled as he drove back to campus, each bump and crack in the road causing his bloated belly and new blubber to shift about.  The way Evan's fat jiggled and bounced as he drove was something he still wasn't used to, since he was constantly growing, but it was a feeling he was absolutely in love with.  Evan had always been a chunky punk, partying and a bad diet will do you that to you, but now that he was blowing up at such an alarming rate every pound added on his body just made him more and more turned on by his own bulk.  Evan pulled his car into a parking spot on campus, exited, and tugged at his, now tighter, shirt as he made his way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan's appearance had truly changed over these last six weeks and it wasn't just his new blue mohawk; Evan now sported chubby cheeks and a large double chin, huge moobs, thick, beefy arms, big love handles, a massive meaty bubblebutt, huge thighs, and a fat, doughy gut that was beginning to hang over his waistline.  Evan's gut was already pretty big but the massive meal he had scarfed down at Dave's had bloated it up to twice it's normal size.  The husky punk pulled at the hem of his graphic tee, which refused to go down past his belly button, before sighing and giving up.  Evan then adjusted his stuffed leather jacket and scarf, tugged at the waistband of his dark red jeans that kept slipping down his ass, and dusted off the snow from his heavy boots before walking into campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody on campus had gained some kind of weight but it was incredibly clear that the male student body had been hit the hardest - there wasn't a single pair of abs left on campus and the poundage gained ranged somewhere from 20 to 100.  Evan wasn't nearly as flustered over his ill-fitting clothing since the clothes on campus now were too snug for most.  As Evan turned the corner and made his way down the hall towards the locker room he noticed a few of his classmates, Trevor, Sam, and Micah, were standing in front talking.  Evan had become good friends with Trevor and Sam but Micah's size and mass was a bit intimidating - even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor was a massive 640 pounds; a triple chin was beginning to form under his round face, his moobs were massive and beefy but also sagged to the sides, his love handles hung over his wide waistline and stuck out far, and his gigantic, blubbery belly hung just above his knees.  Trevor was, by far, the fattest boy on campus and Evan could tell just how much he loved it.  Trevor wore a dark blue sweater with a light blue button up shirt underneath, neither of which could really cover the massive gut he was sporting, a blue beanie, and a pair of khakis (that his monster ass would most likelt split soon) with boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was the second fattest kid in campus and it showed; his 630 pound body was near identical to Trevor's in every way except for his love handles, which were bigger than Trevor's.  Sam was wearing a bulky, military green jacket with an orange plaid button up underneath and a white t-shirt beneath that, a pair of winter boots, and some jeans.  Sam had given up on buttoning the orange shirt once it reached his gut and his white shirt could only cover the top of his belly - exposing most of his flab to the cold weather and his fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah was a monstrous, hulking 520 pounds of pure muscle; huge traps, biceps the size of watermelons, gigantic pecs he can't see past, thighs that could crush a man's skull, and a musclegut so gigantic it entered any room before he did.  Micah was wearing a yellow hoodie, a pair of matching track pants with thermals underneath, all of which were skin tight and showed off every muscle, and work out shoes.  He was also carrying a single 90 pound hand weight that he was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys, what's goin' on?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck canceled weight training.\"  Micah said, visibly upset by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  That doesn't sound like Puck at all; why would he cancel?\"  Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself!\"  Trevor said, pointing over his shoulder at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I'm not surprised,\" Sam said, \"We've been having similar problems all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan raised an eyebrow before walking in, making his way through the locker room and into the weight room.  Everything seemed normal until Evan turned his head and saw what the guys had meant.  Sticking out of the doorway into the teacher's office was Puck's titanic rear, flabby love handles, and massive legs; two gigantic globes of beef and fat clad in skin tight red-and-white track pants.  Puck's 880 pound body was trapped in the small doorway that lead into his office, and from the way Puck was struggling, it looked like he couldn't get out.  Evan dropped his backpack to the ground and walked behind Puck, crossing his arms and enjoying the view of his nearly-900 pound boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Puck, you KNEW this was bound to happen.\"  Evan said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, babe, is that you?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me, and lemme tell you,\" Evan said before placing both hands on Puck's asscheecks, squeezing and jiggling the huge globes, \"I'm loving this view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!!\"  Puck said, trying too look behind him but unable to, \"You KNOW you're not allowed to touch the Puckster's ass.  It's one of our rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a no?,\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say stop - just that you're breaking one of my rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but Puck,\" Evan said, pulling down Puck's track pants and smacking his monser-sized jock-strapped fatass, \"That's part of why you like me - I don't follow the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck chuckled, \"Enjoy it while you can cause I'm gonna crush you with this fat ass once I'm out of here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven grinned as he massaged the bulge in his pants, pressing his crotch between the two gigantic cheeks that were bigger than his own torso, before leaning in as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to it.\"  Evan said in a naughty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck heard the sound of Evan's zipper going down and he grinned - proud of his pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourty-five minutes later Evan hoisted up his pants, still struggling to get them over his own fat ass, before pulling Puck's track pants back up - which was a challenge all it's own.  Once done Evan picked up his backpack and walked around to the other door in the room, opening it and walking in to look at Puck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven chuckled, \"You look like Winnie the Pooh.\"  He said, entertained by the fact that Puck's own fat was keeping him trapped in the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny,\" Puck replied, \"At least I got a hot fuck out of it - it's been a long time since I bottomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really hot,\" Evan said, leaning in and making out with his trapped boyfriend, \"You should let me top me often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smirked, \"Hit 600 pounds and we'll talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Evan replied, kissing Puck again, \"Need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine.\"  Puck said, still trying to push his way through every now and then, \"I already had a talk with the principal - the fire department will be here once school's over so it doesn't cause a scene.  The school's also gonna be closed for a few weeks so they can renovate the door frames and get some reinforced chairs.  I heard Trevor shattered his chair in first period when he sat down.  I am so proud of that boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan chuckled, \"Well, if you don't want my help I guess I'll go.\"  Evan made out with Puck for just a bit longer before grinning, \"See you tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I'm not trapped - yeah.\"  Puck replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan grinned and headed out towards his next class.</span></div></div>",

Please have an idea for a part of a song you want to sing.\u201d Flyers were up everywhere for auditions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we should totally do it,\u201d Trevor said when he saw one. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Micah said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it will be fun! You wanted to spend more time with me and do stuff together and this is a wonderful thing we can do. Plus, we already know a number of members and former members of the club already so we\u2019re sure to get in. Plus, you have an amazing voice and mine\u2019s not too bad,\u201d Trevor pleaded. <br>\r\n\u201cAlright, sure, why not?\u201d Micah said and Trevor grinned. \u201cThis is going to be so much fun! I always wanted to sing.\u201d Micah sighed a little but at the same time, the idea did have a bit of an appeal since Trevor was excited by it and after their heart to heart moment, they really should do more stuff together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvan?\u201d Puck called to him. <br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re auditioning for glee club right?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to,\u201d Evan said. <br>\r\n\u201cWell now you are planning to and I expect you to actually try. I can tell if you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, but why?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMany reasons. You can make friends with people, you already know a number of them, plus it\u2019s something fun and good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Evan said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can consider it a rite of passage that we all went through. I mean, I did it and loved it. I still love it. But if you need another reason, you can call it you\u2019re doing it or you can be prosecuted for vandalism and other crimes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously blackmailing me, again?\u201d Evan asked in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is also another glee club tradition and the school\u2019s to get members by blackmail. You can be spanked the hard way or the easy way. Now will you at least try voluntarily or do I need to make calls as a duty you have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUgh fine.\u201d Evan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in the auditorium at 3,\u201d said Puck. \u201cI\u2019ll be watching. <br>\r\nEvan wasn\u2019t sure what song he wanted to do as he hadn\u2019t planned on participating but now that he had to, he thought hard about it. He was stuck until he heard the perfect song on someone\u2019s ringtone and decided that was a song he knew that was pretty good and sure to wow the crowd. <br>\r\nAt three, everybody went into the auditorium. There weren\u2019t many sign-ups, which was a bit disappointing because while Glee club was not a pariah anymore, most people still didn\u2019t want to sing or whatever. There was Micah, Trevor, Evan, and a couple other random people who were either bored or brave enough to try their hand at singing in a performance drama group. There were only a few open slots but at least they didn\u2019t have to cut that many people. One of them was okay, not bad, but not spectacularly amazing either. One had a voice that irritated like nails being dragged down a chalkboard. Another was a stoner kid who got confused and thought they were a group for being happy. That one was honestly confusing because if he was a new student that might have been plausible, but he was a senior and had attended McKinley for every year that Glee club actually went to state and nationals. How could he still not know? Evan who was a little nervous, became confident when the other people went. He might not have been enthused about having to do this, but at least he was better than those other people. Plus, he might impress Puck and the others. Readying himself, Evan strutted onto stage and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got those jet pack blues<br>\r\nJust like Judy<br>\r\nThe kind that makes June feel like September<br>\r\nI'm the last one that you'll ever remember<br>\r\nAnd I'm trying to find that peace of mind<br>\r\nBehind these two white highway lines<br>\r\nWhen the city goes silent<br>\r\nThe ringing in my ears gets violent<br>\r\nShe's in a long black coat tonight<br>\r\nWaiting for me in the downpour outside<br>\r\nShe's singing \"Baby come home\" in a melody of tears<br>\r\nWhile the rhythm of the rain keeps time<br>\r\nAnd I remember \"Baby, come home\"<br>\r\nI remember \"Baby, come home\"<br>\r\nI remember \"Baby, come home\"<br>\r\nI remember \"Baby, come home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sang his heart out. There was some stunned silence and then clapping and whistling. He looked over into the audience to see the Glee clubbers clapping and cheering for him. Puck was the loudest and most noticeable but it was hard to not notice him. He saw Sam, Blaine, Artie, Tina, etc. Finn was there with some strange look on his face that seemed a cross between disgust and confusion, like he had tasted something sour or something. It was obvious the guy was jealous. From the moment they met, Finn was very jealous over Evan\u2019s relationship with Puck and the Glee club. It wasn\u2019t his fault though the guy had issues. Well, whatever, Finn could think what he wants. The only people whose opinions mattered was Puck and the rest of the Glee club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in!\u201d Mr. Schue said excitedly. \u201cExcellent job Evan, that was excellent singing!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you Mr. Schue, I just really like that song.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you sing all songs like that, I know you\u2019ll do great.\u201d Mr. Schue praised. Next up was Trevor who sang Maroon 5\u2019s Sugar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down<br>\r\nI need your loving, loving<br>\r\nI need it now<br>\r\nWhen I'm without you<br>\r\nI'm something weak<br>\r\nYou got me begging, begging<br>\r\nI'm on my knees<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't wanna be needing your love<br>\r\nI just wanna be deep in your love<br>\r\nAnd it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,<br>\r\n'Cause I really don't care where you are<br>\r\nI just wanna be there where you are<br>\r\nAnd I gotta get one little taste<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sugar<br>\r\nYes, please<br>\r\nWon't you come and put it down on me?<br>\r\nI'm right here, 'cause I need<br>\r\nLittle love, a little sympathy<br>\r\nYeah, you show me good loving<br>\r\nMake it alright<br>\r\nNeed a little sweetness in my life<br>\r\nYour sugar<br>\r\nYes, please<br>\r\nWon't you come and put it down on me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy broken pieces<br>\r\nYou pick them up<br>\r\nDon't leave me hanging, hanging<br>\r\nCome give me some<br>\r\nWhen I'm without ya<br>\r\nI'm so insecure<br>\r\nYou are the one thing, one thing<br>\r\nI'm living for<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked at Micah as he was singing it to let him know. As he had unexpectedly discovered recently, although Micah was the toughest looking, and actual toughest person Trever could imagine, Micah really cared about him and was worried about Trevor leaving him for Puck. An absurd notion because Puck was great at many things like sex and making people become massive, but Puck was not a monogamous person. At all. In the slightest. When Puck liked you, he was a devoted lover. He certainly was a devoted feeder. But as fun as Puck was, which is especially incredible for an individual of his size, Trevor wanted someone more stable and who actually liked him for him and not just his size. Puck was a size fanatic. Micah smiled at him and Trevor bowed as the rest of the Gleeks cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could sing,\u201d Jake said. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, apparently I can,\u201d Trevor said. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nFinally it was Micah\u2019s turn. Ironically he chose My Chemical Romance\u2019s Teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're gonna clean up your looks<br>\r\nWith all the lies in the books<br>\r\nTo make a citizen out of you<br>\r\nBecause they sleep with a gun<br>\r\nAnd keep an eye on you, son<br>\r\nSo they can watch all the things you do<br>\r\nBecause the drugs never work<br>\r\nThey're gonna give you a smirk<br>\r\n'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean<br>\r\nThey're gonna rip up your heads<br>\r\nYour aspirations to shreds<br>\r\nAnother cog in the murder machine<br>\r\nThey say all teenagers scare the living shit out of me<br>\r\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed<br>\r\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose<br>\r\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me<br>\r\nThe boys and girls in the clique<br>\r\nThe awful names that they stick<br>\r\nYou're never gonna fit in much, kid<br>\r\nBut if you're troubled and hurt<br>\r\nWhat you got under your shirt<br>\r\nWill make them pay for the things that they did<br>\r\nThey say all teenagers scare the living shit out of me<br>\r\nThey couldn't care less as long as someone'll bleed<br>\r\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose<br>\r\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me<br>\r\nOhh yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment before Puck and Trevor began clapping as did the rest of them. It was an interesting and quite appropriate choice of song since Micah was huge and frankly did terrify many of them. \u201cGreat job Micah, you have a wonderful deep voice. We are always in need of one of those to have counterpoint to all our higher singers and girls. All three of you are in,\u201d Mr. Schue said. \u201cWonderful job, wonderful job.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI am going to miss using the choir room though. There are a lot of fond memories in there. At least we managed to get a permanent reservation on the auditorium that Sue didn\u2019t steal.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cExcellent job,\u201d Puck said to all three of them. \u201cYou all did great, which is no surprise to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did good,\u201d Finn told Micah and Trevor with a smile. The smile wasn\u2019t so real when he got to Evan. \u201cYou did good too\u2026I guess\u2026\u201d Finn mumbled<br>\r\n\u201cSuch enthusiasm,\u201d Evan rolled his eyes. \u201cI feel so welcome.\u201d Puck elbowed Finn, nearly sending him to the ground. <br>\r\n\u201cI mean, welcome to glee club where everyone may join, even you.\u201d Finn said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Evan rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t really want to, especially if Finn was going to be there a lot like this. Then again, pissing Finn off sounded fun since he was such a baby about it. <br>\r\n\u201cSee you all in the auditorium tomorrow. I need to go figure out what I\u2019m going to do with the choir room since we can\u2019t use it anymore\u2026\u201d Will Schuester said. <br>\r\n\u201cI have some ideas,\u201d Puck said walking with him as did Finn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School was postponed for a month in addition to Christmas break due to needed renovations. McKinnley was getting old and always needed them but now there was the additional factor that a lot of the students and teachers were a bit larger than they used to be and it was so widespread that it was necessary to upgrade. There was a lot of things that needed to be added like bigger reinforced chairs that could handle heavier weight, widening the doors, etc. Everyone was excited to hear about the extra days off...until it was revealed that due to the necessity of education standards it will be made up for over time with additional days during the summer and weekends. Nonetheless, it was a very exciting time as people went on vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very filling holiday season for everyone filled with food, fun, games, and more food. Without school to keep people occupied, there was a lot of free time on people's hands. Many went to Dave's buffet because it really was the best tasting food joint in town. The other food places in order to not go out of business partnered up and became part of Dave's and also learned what made him so successful. Puck and Dave never expected to set up a restaurant chain but now that it was happening, they were excited to be able to spread the love. It was a good thing too as the original was always packed with people, especially with school out and being the place to meet up for teenagers and young adults and eventually everyone. Once the franchise was expanded, they were able to diffuse the amount of people to the other locations again making the other shops happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was a good thanksgiving for Dave and the Puckermans who were now getting quite wealthy in the restaurant and food business and grabbing the attention of some major food stores. Not that that was the only goal and they didn't really need money except for food and the other essentials, but it was really nice to have. Jake was super excited to get a vehicle that he could get into without getting cramped since one of the downsides of size was getting squished in smaller cars. He sometimes wondered how Puck dealt with it. Puck's newest project Evan was at their house everyday for a session with either Puck, or if he felt like sharing, Jake. Needless to say Evan was getting bigger quickly and it almost seemed like he was every time Jake saw him. It was cool but Jake was more interested in his and Ryder's growth. Jake was much more easygoing with people than his brother and was more than happy to let people move at their own pace without forcing them, but Jake was eager to see Ryder grow a little faster. Fortunately, Puck's and Dave's food was good for that and it broke the flat slope Ryder had been stuck at, especially with so much more time for eating, video games, movies, etc. Without football to keep him busy, Ryder fell into a lazy routine of video games, food, tv, books, more food, etc. He barely ever had to get up since Jake was more than happy to bring down food and snacks and to play with him and he started to food graze. Jake worked out when not spending time with Ryder since someone in the house had to be responsible and active plus needing the strength to support his heavier boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the time came that the repairs were finished and they had to go back to school. The work wasn't entirely done but they couldn't really delay any longer and all the important things were finished so it was back to school which was a sad but also happy day as people were beginning to get bored and want to go back to school. Nobody missed school homework but they did miss seeing their friends and not having to sit around in their house or at the mall or a food place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 11:40, Trevor wished he was back at home or anywhere else. The teacher was droning on about something math, numbers, factorials, slopes, angles, nothing that Trevor really cared or was good at. He was also hungry as boredom always made him hungry and even if he was interested or good at math, he wouldn't have been at this moment anyhow with how hungry he was. One would have thought that with how things had changed that people eating would be a more tolerated thing but in fact it was still against the rules. Well, it made sense because if people were eating, they wouldn't really be listening to the teacher talk but still, he was starving. He scribbled down a note and passed it to Micah who also looked bored. It wasn't because Micah didn't understand this stuff because he actually did, but it was a secret thing that almost nobody knew except for maybe Puck and Trevor that he was actually too good at it and already knew all this information. He was just plain bored. Micah opened up the note and scanned it before nodding. They both raised their hands and asked to be excused and while the teacher glared at them, they were able to get a pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh finally,\" Trevor said. \"I can't stand math.\" <br>\r\n\"Math is fine, but Mr. Gold is just not very interesting. I can certainly eat though.\" Micah said. \"When did Puck say it would be open?\"<br>\r\n\"He said that the fridges would be stored in the choir room and stocked daily for any who need a snack.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's do that.\" They walked to the old choir room and went in one at a time. \"So how does this work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know, we each have a personal fridge filled with food that we could eat throughout the day and there is a signup sheet detailing whose timeslot it is although if the room is unoccupied and they elect not to use it, then anyone can. Of course, it's because only 3-4 people can reasonably squeeze in here being so large and with the refrigerators and we can't have a jam. Fortunately, Puck gave us a time slot at math since he knows how much we don't need that class and he is working on getting us a free period so we don't even have to lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make me feel better,\" Micah opened his fridge and pulled out some massive sized meat sandwiches. Unwrapping one he bit into it and groaned in pleasure. \"Puck and Dave really do make the best damn food,\" he said. Trevor nodded as he pulled out a massive juicy hamburger, bacon, cheese and everything on it and dug into it. When one was finished, they would move onto the next selection like hefty portions of lasagna and turkey. Pushing aside milk Micah saw a massive chocolate cake that somehow ended up in his fridge and was probably meant for Trevor. Micah was going to give it to Trevor but the strong sweet smell was overpowering and he couldn't resist having a couple pieces. Trevor looked at Micah and grinned seeing that and Micah rolled his eyes. He might have indulged over break but that was then and this is now. Still, it did seem look good cake and he might as well have some. Taking out the provided silverware, he popped a chocolate piece into his mouth and moaned. It was such good cake! He shoveled it into is mouth while Trevor munched on a bucket of chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like your food?\" came Puck's voice and they both turned around to see him standing and filling up the doorway space. <br>\r\n\"Oh it's quite delicious,\" Trevor said grinning. \"Tell Dave thank you and that the fridges are an excellent idea.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course they are,\" Puck grinned back. \"I can't have my people starving at school can I? I would hate for my favorite guys to waste away to nothing can I?\" Micah rolled his eyes because as if that would ever happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm sorry for the mix-up, the chocolate cake was supposed to be in Trevor's...\" Puck said before seeing what was in Micah's hand. \"Huh? You're actually eating it?\" He asked excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little...\" Micah said, blushing a little. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, he just couldn't help himself,\" Trevor grinned. \"His strict diet edict against sweets is temporarily down.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? What happened?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"He was Santa for Christmas!\" Trevor smirked. Micah blushed more.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Puck asked intrigued. \"How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I was hired to do the Santa Claus at the mall given how big I am but it turned out I was too big for any of the uniforms.\"<br>\r\n\"Hah, really?\" Puck grinned.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So I couldn't do it but Micah was with me and they took a look at him and asked if he could do Santa instead because they needed someone immediately the next day. They also asked if he was interested in doing security but he said 'no not really, I still have school and sports to play.' He was willing to play Santa however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, to save you the embarassment,\" Micah said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever. It turns out he's great with kids and they always love him once they realize he's not a monster going to eat them.\"<br>\r\n\"Just stop it,\" Micah said.<br>\r\n\"Well, he did that throughout the holidays. It was rather humorous though because Micah is a muscle monster so they asked him to soften up a bit to fit the role of buff santa better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it for the kids,\" Micah muttered.<br>\r\n\"I know, and I love that you cared so much,\" Trevor said, walking over and hugging him. \"We have to go for accuracy. So whenever he went out for Santa he had to eat their cookies and drink their milk.\" Trevor grinned. \"I made sure that there was always a lot of cookies because Santa is very hungry.\" Micah pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did! I knew it!\" Micah shouted.<br>\r\n\"Be honest, you loved making those kids happy by eating their cookies and carrots and letting them ride big Santa.\"<br>\r\n\"That is true,\" Micah admitted. <br>\r\n\"They especially loved rubbing and hugging his full belly for luck,\" Trevor smirked. \"It was a game to see who could fill up Santa more and make him unable to move because he was so stuffed.\" Micah huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Puck looked him up and down. <br>\r\n\"Ah I see. That us amazing and man I wish I could have seen it.\"<br>\r\n\"I have pictures,\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare,\" Micah said.<br>\r\n\"Oh alright fine. I won't show Puck right now.\" 'Later' he mouthed to Puck when Micah wasn't looking. Puck nodded back. He turned his attention back to Micah and grinned, a plan forming in his head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye for now, I'll see you guys later,\" Puck said, smiling deviously.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The final bell's ring echoed through the now empty halls of McKinley High, signaling the beginning of the next class.  As the growing student body all settled into their now reinforced seats - Puck's boys were all getting reacquainted back in the weight room.  The winter holidays, as well as the extra month off they got during renovations, had really taken a toll on every one of their waistlines.  There wasn't a single boy amongst the nine students who hadn't gained weight or muscle during that time and every one of them was showing off and examining each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys had all paired off into two groups, per Puck's request they had all received via text that morning.  Trevor, Sam, Danny, Ryder, and Evan were Puck's \"fat boys\" and as such they were all sittin in a group on one side of the room, while Puck's \"buff boys\", Jake, Micah, and Tyrone, were on the other size.  Every single boy in the room was dressed in their school's required PE uniforms but there wasn't a single one that actually fit any of them.  Massive moobs and pecs were squeezed tight, and huge guts, either rock hard and solid or blubbery, spilled out from underneath skin-tight shirts.  Love handles hung over every pair of gym shorts and there wasn't a single pair of said shorts in the room that weren't about to burst at the seams thanks to monstrous thighs or enormous fat asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe how you've blown up, Evan!\" Sam said to the blubbery punk of the group, \"How much you weigh now?\"<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Evan admitted, patting his big, soft belly, \"Puck's the only one allowed to weigh me; it's one of our rules.  All comes with being his 'pet project'.\" Evan said with air quotes.<br>\r\n\"He got you on any kind of weight lifting regimen?\"  Danny asked, curiously.<br>\r\n\"A little bit; he wants my gaining to be almost 100% fat so he only does enough to keep me strong and mobile.\"  Evan replied happily, \"Y'know, I wasn't sure about all this at first, but now that I'm this big?  I'm totally on board with the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n\"What's... Puck's current goal... for you?\"  Sam asked in between bites of the one dozen donuts he'd brought as a pre-class snack.<br>\r\n\"He's never given me a number - he's only ever said 'I'm gonna make you as fat as <b><i>I</i></b>want'.\" Evan replied, emphasizing the I.<br>\r\n\"Dude... you're gonna be massive,\" Ryder said in response.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Evan said with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"Lucky...\" Trevor mumbled under his breath as he swiped a donut from Sam's box and shoved into his mouth, despite being bloated from his massive meal with Micah.  Evan and Trevor were friends but that didn't stop Trevor from being jealous of all the attention of Evan got from Puck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the room, the \"buff boys\" were showin off their own gains, but the conversation subject was focused on Micah's new pudgy gut.<br>\r\n\"DAMN, Micah, you got CHUNKY!!,\" Jake said with a cocky grin as he gave the 6'8\" beefcake's gut a couple smacks, chucklin at the slight jiggle it now had, \"Never thought I'd see the day where Micah \"muscle-god\" Von Haller started chubbin up.~\"  Jake said teasingly.<br>\r\nMicah swatted Jake's hand away, his brows furrowed in annoyance, \"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.  I'mma melt all this extra fat off in no time, just you watch.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll see it when I believe it,\" Tyrone replied, \"I wouldn't let Puck find out if I were you.  You know he'll do everything he can to keep that chub on ya.\"<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" Jake replied, \"You might as well get used to havin' that extra jiggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the newly expanded door of Puck's office opened and their massive teacher waddled out, followed closely behind by his personal assistant, 'butterball' Blaine Anderson.<br>\r\n\"All right, boys, I've got an announcement!\"  Puck said, hands on his wide hips, \"As some of you may have noticed our class has shrunk.  Over the holidays Matt, Devin, Nick, Zack, and Ricky all left school for various reasons.  It's sad but hopefully they're all still gainin wherever they are.  OKAY, line up; it's time for your first weigh in of the new year!\"  Coach Puckerman said as he stood next to the their new industrial sized scale.  \"All righty, Blaine, you're up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese teen waddled over to the scale, his gut jiggling under his slightly-too-small cardigan and polo, and stepped on.  A digital screen placed on the wall flashed several numbers before landing firmly on an even 500 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Nice, nice!  Proud of you, Anderson!\"  Puck said with a grin, \"Trevor, your turn big guy.\"  As Blaine stepped off he wrote down his weight on his clipboard as Trevor waddled over and took his place.  One by one the rest of the class stepped on got weighed and each number was written down on Blaine's clipboard for Puck's files:<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><br>\r\n\u2022\tJake - muscle - 530 lbs<br>\r\n\u2022\tRyder - fat - 355<br>\r\n\u2022\tSam - fat - 675<br>\r\n\u2022\tBlaine - fat - 500<br>\r\n\u2022\tTrevor - fat - 700<br>\r\n\u2022\tMicah - muscle - 560<br>\r\n\u2022\tDanny - fat - 650<br>\r\n\u2022\tTyrone - muscle - 430<br>\r\n\u2022\tEvan - fat - 450<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme just say I'm VERY proud of all these numbers,\" Puck said, looking over Blaine's writing.  He handed the chart back to Blaine and grinned, \"But lemme show you how a pro does it.\"  With a cocky swagger in his step Puck hefted his mighty frame onto the scale and watched as the green numbers flashed 920 lbs.  The ENTIRE room was stunned by that massive number and smirked when he saw the way Evan was biting his lip, no doubt thinking about a future where he's that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, with that extra motivation, each and every one of you get some massive gains this year.  Now, lets start class.\"  Puck said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass came and went; every boy in the room chugged a massive gallon of Puck's patented protein shakes before heading off to their assignments.  The \"buff boys\" stayed in the work out room to do some weight lifting while the \"fat boys\" all waddled off to the empty gym where Puck had laid out a massive lunch for them - catered by Dave of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class...</span></div></div>",

Danny was okay, he wasn't mean or anything. Actually he was really nice like when he had the entire class at his house for that party and catered to everyone. That was a good day. However, he had never spoken to Danny that much before so this was really random. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Tyrone said. <br>\r\n\"That was an amazing shot and you can really dribble,\" Danny said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but...why are you talking to me?\" Tyrone asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Is there a problem with me talking to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well no but...it just seems so sudden since you never have before one on one. It just seems like you have some sort of angle.\"<br>\r\n\"No, no angle...other than asking if you want to go out with me,\" Danny said quickly. \"I just think you're really good looking.'<br>\r\n\"Is this because you're two boyfriends left because I don't want to be somebody's rebound like that.\"<br>\r\n\"It actually doesn't. I miss them a lot but since it was over break I have had time to get over them. They were pretty but to be honest, between the two of them, they only had one brain. They really weren't that smart which I guess I kind of ignored because two sexy twins with complimentary bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not really helping your case,\" Tyrone said, finishing putting his large shirt on. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just think I've always liked you. You're an absolutely amazing player. Also, I've seen your test scores. You're actually really smart and I like that.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well thanks for that.\" Tyrone got up to leave but Danny got in his way. <br>\r\n\"Just hear me out okay? You're like the perfect package. Smart, strong, excellent player, big, kind...I've been to all your games and think you would do great going pro. I know people.\" Tyrone paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do, do you?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes. I'll be happy to talk to them if you want. I just think you should at least give me a chance?\" Tyrone wished it hadn't come down to bribing but Danny offered a good deal. It mattered the people you know and the successful rich all know each other very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine,\" Tyrone agreed. Danny smiled at him. <br>\r\n\"That wasn't so awful was it? Anyways, that was a very interesting class.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we lost a lot of people to moving or switching schools.We just dwindled down to the primary.\"<br>\r\n\"Think Micah will still fall on the muscle side?\" Danny asked. \"I'm still in shock at seeing him heavier with actual jiggle and softer fat. If I know Puck, he's probably already scheming things to keep Micah from losing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no doubt Puck is but Micah is not a gainer like you, Sam, Trevor, or Puck. He definitely is a behemoth tank. Still however that was just woah. It's just...so different. Good for him though whatever happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking I could have another party and invite everybody again? The last one went really well. Team morale and everything.\" <br>\r\n\"Go for it.\" Danny whipped out his phone and sent out the mass text to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swim party at my place after school! Hope to see you there!\" which is all he needed to say as everybody knew that Danny's parties were awesome. This one however he was going to keep among their class because it was special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope to see you there especially,\" Danny said seriously to Tyrone. <br>\r\n\"Whatever, see you later.\" Tyrone walked out towards the next class while Danny alerted the staff that they were going to have company after school. </span></div></div>",

He opened it to find it was a single sentence \"Meet me in the office once you read this. -Puck.\" It was a little bit presumptuous but he was now a teacher and he would have gone anyways. Sam shrugged and headed to the gymnasium and towards the widened door office that the school finally fixed and updated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck?\" He called out. \"I'm here. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n\"I can't say hi to a friend? I'm a bit hurt,\" Puck rumbled coming out in just some really small looking on him shorts. His hair was wet and he had just come from the shower.<br>\r\n\"Nah, nothing wrong with that,\" Sam agreed. \"I was just curious as to what's so urgent you actually sent me a note. Also, you actually sent me a handwritten note, there is a thing called texting now,\" he said sarcastically but grinning nonetheless.<br>\r\n\"This way was more fun and traditional . Anyways Wwell I, was just curious to see how you are doing and hang out a bit. Free you from class for a while. Are you and Blaine still together?\" Sam looked a bit suprised and a bit sad. <br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"I have my ways,\" Puck said lowering his voice to do a mysterious feel before returning back. \"Anyways i'm sorry to hear things aren't going so well.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, technically we're still together as we haven't broken up yet.\" Sam said. <br>\r\n\"It's only a matter of time though?\" Puck guessed, genuinely sorry for Sam's predicament even if he was a little relieved too.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just never thought that he and Kurt would get together again,\" Sam said. \"It's a shock since he swore to me Kurt wasn't his type and all that and I walk in going to surprise Blaine and there he was kissing Kurt. Though it probably wouldn't bother you given you're many, many activities and partners.\"<br>\r\n\"In which I am very clean and careful,\" Puck said. \"No, that wouldn't really have bothered me except for wondering why he'd be interested in such a skinny twink over a blonde beefcake like you. It seems totally absurd.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Sam said frowning. \"I just don't know what to do or feel about it so we're on a bit of an unofficial break.\"<br>\r\n\"I definitely think you know what you feel,\" Puck said. \"You're definitely betrayed and upset.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn right I am,\" Sam said sourly.<br>\r\n\"So why not dump him and move on? Honestly Blaine was never really your type, Just too...passive and chubby and feminine.\"<br>\r\n\"Right, and you are?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course. Far more than Blaine. And you know I'm good,\" Puck smirked. \"I remember a time or two when we did some very fun things.\" He leaned over and whispered them into Sam's ear. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sam said blushing a bit. \"Those were good.\"<br>\r\n\"And since you're not with Blaine anymore...\" Puck grinned and reached out trailing his hands up Sam's beefy fat chest, rubbing gently. \"You won't feel so bad if I did this. I've wanted to fuck you again for a while. I've never had you at such a large size.\"<br>\r\n\"Always so forward,\" Sam grinned. <br>\r\n\"You love it. Blaine never did that unless it was in song.\" Puck reached behind and teased Sam's butt swatting plsyfully. \"You need a real man again.\" Sam let out a startled yelp when Puck hit but nodded in agreement. \"Y-yeah.\" \"Well I got just the thing\" Puck grinned. \"You're a massive stud and growing so well. The second biggest after me.<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you are gargantuan though. I could never reach that.\"<br>\r\n\"No, but you're a gorgeous hot as fuck blonde beefcake that I want now,\" Puck grinned twisting Sam to hiss and moan. Puck always did know what people like. \"Help you forget Blaine for a bit, what do you say?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I say okay,\" Sam grinned as he tried to reach around Puck who was so wide he couldn't reach the back. Sam scooted behind so he could admire. Somehow Puck still had the most fantastic perfect butt despite all the muscle and chub streyching him out into a behemoth musclefat well freak. Much nicer than Blaine who really was a butterball. Why did he like that again? He couldn't remember what with Puck now touching him. He couldn't think much at all as Puck expertly undone him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huge, thick hands exploring what they could of each other's wide bodies; Sam squeezing and groping at Puck's pecs while Puck happily fondled Sam's giant, plump gut.  Their lips separated briefly as Puck pulled Sam's shirt up and over his head, exposing his fat-and-beefy frame that made Puck's mouth totally water.  Soon, Sam found himself with his fat-strong chest and blubbery belly pinned to the wall as Puck eagerly pulled down Sam's skin tight shorts and grinned as he prepped that gigantic husky ass for the pounding of it's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's breath was heavy and labored as he slowly pulled his shorts back up - exhausted from the hot hour long fucking he just received from Puck.<br>\r\n\"Bet Blaine's never given you a pounding like that, huh, big guy?\" Puck asked happily as he began to actually get dressed, tucking his coach's polo into his painted on short shorts and under his giant gut.<br>\r\n\"That was actually my first time bottoming since I dated Blaine.\" Sam admitted, embarrassed as he actually preferred to be the bottom.<br>\r\n\"Such a shame, too,\" Puck said, grabbing a handful of the deliciously fat ass that was Sam's, \"You're a natural at it.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Sam replied, his face getting even redder.<br>\r\n\"Now get to class; i'll explain to your teacher from the period you just missed that you were in here helping me with something; which isn't entirely a lie~\" Puck said with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Puck exchanged one more hot, quick make out session before the enormous blonde beefcake waddled off to class, Puck enjoying the sight of his fat gut and recently fucked ass as they bounced and jiggled out of the room.  As soon as Sam was gone Puck's expression had changed from a happy one to a very angry one.  He still had to deal with the other half of the recently broken up couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, Coach?\"  Blaine asked as he walked into Puck's office.<br>\r\n\"Sure did, Blaine; have a seat.\" Puck said, not looking up from his clipboard.<br>\r\nBlaine took a seat on the couch Puck had in his office - an old, scratchy piece of junk that Puck's gigantic 920lb ass had crushed in the middle the day before so it sunk inward.  Blaine tried to sit on the edge but found himself slipping down into the sofa crater that Puck had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaine, do you know why I called you in here?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Ummm, to congratulate me on being a good assistant?\" Blaine asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n\"No, though you are.\" Puck said as he put the clipboard down as slowly advanced on Blaine, \"I called you in here to tell you that you and Sam are officially through.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry wh-\" Blaine's words were cut off as Puck grabbed the back of Blaine's head and pushed it into his gut - the combo of muscle and fat silencing the the chubbier, meeker boy.<br>\r\n\"I said, you and sam are done.  He told me about how you cheated on him and after I gave him the fucking of his life he and I are a thing now.  You're going to make it up to him by tripling his regimen - I want my blonde beefcake to be my size as quickly as possible.  Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaine nodded his head, unable to speak as Puck's gut would drown out his words.<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  And as for ME - you're going to make it up to me by being my new, personal throw pillow for the rest of the day.\" Puck said, releasing Blaine's head from his grip.<br>\r\n\"WHA-\" Blaine was unable to let out a protest before all 920lb of Puck's musclechub god body came crashing down onto Blaine, pinning the poor boy to the couch as Puck placed both hands on his gut and grinned.<br>\r\n\"I guess being a butterball has it's perk, Blaine, you're incredibly comfy to sit on.  Now enjoy your time under my ass; my lunch should be delivered any sec~\" Puck said as he waited for his 30 pizza order to arrive.</span></div></div>",

Though he wondered what it was they just had as they were definitely giggling and laughing hard and eye-fucking so hard he could imagine feeling the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor and Micah came together said hi and they stared at Jake and Ryder who were staring at each other trying to make each other blink but it didn't last long as one or both kept cracking up unable to keep a straight face. \"Well they're having fun,\" Micah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they started early,\" Danny shrugged. \"Anyways, glad you could make t,\" he brofisted Micah and Trevor. \"How are you guys doing?\" <br>\r\n\"Quite well, thank you,\" Micah said. \"So going to be just a few people this time?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the main ones I like,\" Danny said. \"Anyways its just going to be low-key and hanging out rather than anything super wild.\" A thud as Ryder jumps on Jake. \"Well, minus that. Hey! Don't break anything!\" He shouted. \"Take it outside if you're going to do something extreme!\" Jake and Ryder ducked down. The bell rang again and this time it was Sam and Tyrone who just happened to arrive at the same time. \"Hi guys,\" they say and head in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just us today,\" Danny told them. \"Us and Puck. I'm hoping to maybe become a closer friend to all of you plus just wanted something small...well small number of people,\" he smirked a little given how much space they all took up. \"We just need Puck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry I'm late! The party has arrived!\" Puck boomed.<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil,\" Danny said in amazement.<br>\r\n\"No, I just made sure to enter for the right moment. I was actually already here but it happened while you guys were distracted and wanted to surprise you,\" Puck smirked.<br>\r\n\"Indeed you did surprise me,\" Danny said impressed that none of them heard how a man as big as Puck just managed to sneak in. He was utterly massive and nearly a 1000lb Danny thinks how did that even happen? Must be the thick carpeting but still that was skill to still sneak up. But why even question it? It was Puck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we're all here then?\" Danny asked. <br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Evan, one of Puck's projects said coming out. <br>\r\n\"Wait Tyrone?\" Micah asked and Danny nodded right. Still had to wait for him.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, practice went on a bit longer than normal,\" Tyrone said coming in still in his basketball uniform.<br>\r\n\"It's alright you didn't miss anything. Anyways it's just us if you wanted to play Mario kart and/or brawl,\" Danny said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm game, let's do it,\" Tyrone said. Danny set it up while they all gathered around. <br>\r\n\"Anyways, I have a snack buffet style snacks and dinner that was made for when we're hungry that you can help yourself too whenever you want in just the next room over. We have the house to ourselves so we can be as loud as we want although please don't break anything.\" He looked over at Jake and Ryder as he said it who looked at him uncomprehendingly. \"That means you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oooooooohhhh....\" they said.<br>\r\n\"Anyways we can start with either but what do you want to do?\" Danny asked his guests. \"Games or food first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder danced his touchdown dance as Jake caught the ball and scored the winning points for their team. Everybody surrounded Jake congratulating him and each other for a game well played while the the opposing time filed with heads down in disgust off the field. Laughing, Jake pulled his helmet off shaking his head as they hoisted him for the victory toss which was far better than the dumpster toss of loserdom. Ryder's heart lurched at the sight and he shook his head trying to make the feeling go away. For a whole while now everytime he saw Jake Puckerman he felt...stirrings for him. Ryder had at first tried to make them go away permanently but they kept coming back and he couldn't, not anymore. Jake was in a lot of his classes as well and between his dyslexia that made reading difficult and the the other mere presence, it was a lot harder than it should be to maintain at least a C+. At least his parents now knew what was up and that he wasn't stupid of his own fault. Jake's unveiling of his deepest secret and fear turned out to be one of the best things to happen which made the admiration he felt for Jake before multiply ten-fold. His parents actually understood and even accepted that (or at least were trying, his dad was having a bit of trouble but it was far better than what Ryder had feared at first) and his grades were somewhat improving. Overall he felt a lot better about himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too bad Jake didn't seem to feel the same way about him since he seemed into Marley Rose. Ryder wanted to hate her, he really did at times but she was just so nice. It was sickening the way Jake always followed and looked at her. Why couldn't he look that way at him? It was hard enough to get his attention except in competition. Those weeks with Sectionals were some of the best as Jake helped him with his dance moves. He certainly learned some stuff but somethings Jake had just been better at like Gagnam style for one. Watching Jake dance like that was freaking amazing and Ryder considered himself pretty good. It was too bad that Marley had almost cost them Glee, another reason he should have hated her but he couldn't because again he was just too friggen nice and she really was sorry and had her own issues. That made him feel kind of guilty because he knew, or at least suspected, that she was doing unhealthy things but didn't tell anyone. It had cost them at sectionals so perhaps in a way it was his fault. If he told someone...if he told Jake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Jake would have been the first person he would have told if he had, he did not know. Perhaps because Jake liked her. If he knew how messed up Marley was....but no, that wasn't a nice thing to do. It didn't matter anyhow as everybody knew and although Marley almost caused the Glee club to be disbanded, she also was the one who found a loophole to save them which was a relief. He rather liked Glee club and he knew Jake loved it. If Glee club disbanded for real, Jake would have been devastated. He heard about the tantrum Jake had thrown when his audition had been cut short. He wished he could have seen it because in a way, Jake had been right to do so as it had been quite rude to cut him off only partway into the song. Ryder would have loved to listen to the whole song repeatedly. Jake really had a good singing voice in Ryder's opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder watched breathless as Jake took off his football gear and paddings and removed his grass and sweat-stained shirt. Now there was perfection. That tanned smooth skin, built chest and abs, those strong yet lithe arms, and a lack of a third nipple as far as he could tell. He had no idea what was up with that ridiculous rumor Kitty was spreading around about Jake having a gross third nipple. He'd seen Jake shirtless plenty of times, very glorious beautiful times, and he'd never once seen such a thing. Kitty was either lying or it was in another place, though that would be kind of disgusting and weird if it was true. On the other hand, he'd probably still like Jake either way, but he was glad Jake didn't. Anyone who knew what Jake looked like knew the whole third nipple thing was absurd but then again, people who didn't like Jake believed it even if it was untrue. He couldn't understand why anyone would dislike Jake, especially for being black, white, and Jewish. It was selfish of him but Ryder wished that bi or gay could be added to the list. That way at least he could have had a chance at Jake's affections...a groan in the bench alerted Ryder to the presence of someone sitting next to him. Turning his head, he saw it was Sam Evans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sam,\" Ryder said politely before looking back towards Jake's direction, pretending it was the lockers behind Jake rather than at Jake since Sam was there. \"What do you want?\" He didn't know Sam that well but as far as he could tell, Sam was really nice and in Glee club with them. He used to be Quarterback the previous year but with the changes he went through was now a linebacker and Ryder could see why. Sam wasn't the most massive linebacker McKinnley had ever had, they had Shane and Lauren Zizes (for a temporary time) for example, but he was up there and pretty big. He was over 360 lbs and was real massive. He made Ryder feel tiny. He had no idea why Sam had sought him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your looking at Jake,\" Sam nodded towards Jake.<br>\r\n\"No I'm not,\" Ryder denied.<br>\r\n\"I know you are, I've seen you watching him. Just so you know he watches you too.<br>\r\n\"He does?!\" Ryder exclaimed in excitement. \"Not that, you know, it matters to me...but he does?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, he kind of likes you,\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"You're pulling my leg aren't you,\" Ryder said bitterly. \"Getting my hopes up...again not that I care if he does or not...but he likes Marley. It's obvious.\" Sam laughed.<br>\r\n\"Jake and Marley are no more than friends. No I can assure you that Marley is not his type but you are...or rather, have the potential to be.\" Ryder raised his eyebrows. <br>\r\n\"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"He likes them big. Real big if you know what I mean. There's a hint. Think about it and talk to me later if you're interested.\" Sam got up and started walking away.<br>\r\n\"Why won't you tell me now?\" Ryder pleaded.<br>\r\n\"What would be the fun in that? You have a clue so figure it out and talk to me later once you do.\" With that, Sam got up and walked away leaving Ryder sitting there, trying to figure out a mysterious message. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours later and Ryder was at home in bed, racking his brain trying to figure out what Sam meant by \"He likes them big\".  What does that mean?  Maybe Jake likes guys who are taller than him?  If thats the case then Ryder fits the catagory; he was 6 feet even.  Did Jake like gigantically buff guys?  Or guys with big cocks?  Ryder couldn't figure it out and it was really starting to upset him.  He rolled onto his side and closed his eyes, finally getting some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school was a nightmare.  Ryder could barely focus in any of his classes because all he could think about was Jake, Jake, Jake!  By the end of sixth period Ryder had convinced himself that Jake was attracted to the bodybuilder type.  He would have to start working out every single day if he wanted to have a body that Jake would find attractive, but before anything happened, he had to confirm this with Sam.  The bell rang and Ryder left class, speed-walking down the hall towards Sam's locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was standing in front of his locker, putting his stuff away, and as Ryder got closer he actually noticed, for the first time, how massive Sam really was.  Sam was at least an inch taller than Ryder, but was almost three times as wide.  He was wearing a pair of skin tight cargo shorts and and even tight blue polo.  He had a round face with full, chubby cheeks and a very prominent double chin.  His neck was almost non-existent, surrounded by his enormous trapezius muscles and hidden under his double chin, but from what Ryder could see, it was as big as one of Ryder's thighs.  Sam's arms were terrifyingly huge, almost 24 inches around, and the sleeves of his polo were stretched tight around them.  Ryder was sure if Sam flexed his arms right now the sleeves would rip completely.  His back and shoulders were so massively wide that as Sam stood at his own locker his body blocked the two next to him.  Beneath his gigantic neck were the biggest pair of pecs that Ryder had ever seen, and like his arms, his polo was stretched tight across them, doing its best not to rip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder's eyes continued to trail down, leaving Sam's pecs and finally looking down at the biggest part of Sam's body; his belly.  Sam's huge, billowing stomach stuck far out in front of him, almost a foot and a half, and draped down over his waist and crotch.  Sam's polo shirt wasn't even trying to cover his belly, which was peeking out of the bottom of his shirt, and was stretched tight across the mammoth mound of flesh and fat.  Ryder's eyes crossed from Sam's belly to his inhumanly massive ass.  Ryder had always thought that after a certain point, butts that big would begin to sag down, but not Sam's.  His huge, globular ass was massive, perfectly around, and surprisingly perky looking.  Ryder was certain he could set a glass on that giagntic bubble butt and it wouldn't fall off.  Beneath his huge butt were a pair of thighs so massive they had to be twice the size of Ryder's own torso, and below those were two gigantic calves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder took a deep breath before finally reaching Sam, \"Hey, Sam?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Oh, hey, Ryder.  What's up?\"  Sam asked, turning his massive body towards the thinner boy.<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to you about what you said yesterday...  about Jake?\"  Ryder asked, keeping his voice down.<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Did you figure out what I meant?\"  Sam asked, smiling at Ryder.<br>\r\n\"I think so...\"  Ryder began, \"when you say he likes them 'bigger', do you mean like, bodybuilders?\"<br>\r\nSam chuckled, his voice deep and hearty, \"No way, dude.  Well... kind of.\"<br>\r\nRyder looked even more confused than before, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\nSam chuckled again, \"Ryder, Jake is attracted to guys like me.\"<br>\r\nRyder blinked, \"You mean fat guys?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"  Sam said, \"I'm not all fat.  I've got some major muscle under here.\"  Sam lifted up one of his gigantic, 24 inch arms and flexed it.  Ryder was right, not only were Sam's arms the biggest he'd ever seen in his life, but his shirt was so tight on him that the sleeve tore right in half, \"Aww, damn.  I liked this shirt.  Oh, well.\"  Sam flexed the other arm and it did the exact same thing, \"I'll just turn it into a sleeveless shirt when I get home.  Anyway, Ryder, listen.  Jake is attracted to gigantically, humongous, MASSIVE bulls!  The bigger, fatter, and buffer you are, the more likely he'll be attracted to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder shook his head, \"No way, Sam.  Don't get me wrong, you're size is definitely sexy, but I don't think Jake is the type to-\"  Just then, Ryder was cut off by the sight of Jake walking down the hall towards them.  Ryder swallowed back some saliva as Jake made his way over, \"He- hey, Jake.\"<br>\r\n\"What's up Ryder?\" Jake asked.  Ryder was about to responde but then he noticed Jake's free hand slide behind Sam and squeeze one of Sam's massive butt cheeks, \"Hey, Sam..  See you tonight for tutoring.\"  Jake's hand left Sam's ass and he continued on down the hall.<br>\r\nSam raised an eyebrow at Ryder, \"See?  He can't resist a big, beefy, chunky guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait... Why are you telling me what Ryder finds sexy if you're fooling around with him?\"  Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"Jake and I are just fuck-buddies, Ryder.  No emotional connections other than sex.  I know this, he knows this, and both of my boyfriend's know this?\"  Sam said.<br>\r\n\"BOTH of your boyfriends?\"  Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep.  I'm dating Dave Karofsky and Noah Puckerman, Jake's big brother.  We're in a three way relationship.\"  Sam said.  He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet, giving Ryder one of the business cards inside, \"Here.  Check out this website tonight and come back to me tomorrow here at school.  If you're interested, Dave, Puck, and I will help you get as gigantic are you want so you can get with Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder looked down at the card, which had the website URL \"www.Gain4Puck.com\".  When Ryder looked back up Sam was walking away, his massive ass swaying left whenever he took a right step and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after Ryder had finished his homework, he popped open his laptop and typed in the the website.  He quickly scanned over the front page of the site, which had several before and after shots of men he didn't recognize, but ALL of them were huge.  He eventually found a video and hit play.  The video had Noah Puckerman, sporting his signature mohawk, \"Are you tired of looking like a skinny wimp?  Are tight, cut abs not the thing you want?  Do you want to be big, HUGE and powerful?  Muscular but gigantic belly?  Then you've come to the right place!  My name is Puck and it is my mission to make you as BIG, BEEFY, BUFF, and FAT as you want!\"  The video then showed several more before and after photos, along with their weights before cutting back to Puck, \"So you if you want to kiss your old, skinny life goodbye, then I'm the guy you need to call!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder looked over the before and after photos more, amazed by the size differences.  Eventually, he found one that really amazed him: before and after shots of Sam.  The after shot looked exactly like the Sam he talked to today, but the before shot was what really amazed him.  Sam had the exact same body one year ago that Ryder has now.  Ryder closed the laptop and grinned, determined to get huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for 6th period rang and Ryder almost ran out of class to Sam's locker.  When he got there, he was confused about why Sam wasn't there, but then he realized he had gotten there first.  Sam walked up to Ryder, wearing a tanktop that was even smaller than his polo shirt from yesterday, and a pair of jean shorts that were just as tight on his gargantuan thighs as his cargo shorts were.  His chubby faced grinned, \"So, did you like the website?\"<br>\r\n\"I loved it.  I'm in.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\nSam put his meaty hand on Ryder's shoulder, \"Awesome!  So, have you thought about how big you want to get?\"<br>\r\nRyder nodded.</span></div></div>",

Jake really does like big guys?\" <br>\r\n\"Dude I wouldn't lie about that. Besides, you yourself saw. With a brother like Puck and hanging around with me and Dave all the time, something is bound to rub off.\"<br>\r\n\"Makes sense. So I guess sign me up for the program.\" Sam smiled at that.<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'll tell Puck and you could come over today for your first session if you want. Who knows, Jake might even be around which he does every now and then. He might even feed you.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Ryder asked surprised. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does help when he feels like. You might even get lucky, who could say? When it's not him it's generally Puck. It's a not so secret he loves doing that. By the way, how big are you planning? Just for an idea.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess whatever it takes for Jake to be interested but I guess if it must be somewhat similar but rather smaller in scale compared to you. Your muscles are impressive but a bit to wide, not to mention your huge stomach, no offense.\"<br>\r\n\"None taken. I'd have been more concerned if you wanted as big or bigger. Kind of like being the big guy, outside of Dave and Puck, you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"So, a miniature version of me?\" Sam asked. <br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess...easiest way to describe. Big and beefy, but not like that, unless Jake decides otherwise.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to assume for now something like Puck,\" Sam said. \"If you recall what he looks like.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah kinda.\" <br>\r\n\"Cool. Well see you after school, at Puck's place. Just go to the address on the site and if you need any directions just ask or google map them.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sam,\" Ryder smiled. \"For everything and uh letting me have Jake.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no worries, it's no problem. I'll slightly miss his attention and the sex of course but I have my other lovers and I see how you look at him. It'd also be cool to get more people in the big club at this school that are awesome like you and I won't be alone here.\" With that Sam walked away. Ryder waited a few moments before heading to the next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another boring lecture in Mr. Leonard's class so he did what he normally did when his mind wandered and watched Jake make random doodles in his notebook, some of which were quite funny. He really tried to pay attention since his grades were already pretty bad but Mr. Leonard had to be the most boring man ever that he'd rather listen to anything else and he didn't feel as bad for not listening. Even the teacher's pets kids and those who try to hard could barely hang on and had glazed blank expressions and were sagging in their seats. 90 minutes of pure boredom. Thank god for Jake and giving him something to look at in these boring times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that torture they went to PE with Coach Beiste which was one of Ryder's favorite times. It was something he was good at that didn't require studying and had Jake in it. It was PE where he figured out that he was gay or at the very least heavily preferred men though he hid it. While McKinnley was far from welcoming of gay people, from what he understood it was far better this year than ever before what with the Glee club and the graduation of the biggest bullies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Jake removed his shirt, exposing his smooth muscled chest and really tanned skin. Ryder wasn't quite sure what ethnicity that was and Jake was touchy about that but he rather liked the color. It was different and unique like Jake and reminded him of a chocolate bar. A chocolate bar he really wanted to lick, maybe in a sundae with bananas and whip cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude you coming?\" Jake said waving his hand in front of Ryder's face. Ryder blinked, startled out of his fantasy. <br>\r\n\"Oh, uh yeah, of course. Just a sec\" Jake smiled. <br>\r\n\"Well hurry up or Coach Beiste will make you run extra laps.\"<br>\r\n\"Definitely don't want that,\" Ryder laughed as he finished changing and followed Jake out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after school he checked his phone for ther address to where he was going and and drove there. It was a pretty decent sized residence and looked rather nice. He pressed the doorbell and a few seconds later the door opened to reveal another massive guy though not as much as Sam but far more intimidating in his opinion. He recognized this as Puck or Noah Puckerman on the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Ryder?\" Puck asked and Ryder nodded intimidated. Slowly Puck smiled and the menacing demanor dropped. <br>\r\n\"Well nice to meet ya! Sam told me you were coming by! You hoping to get bigger?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ryder said. <br>\r\n\"That's awesome. Come on in.\" Ryder followed Puck in.<br>\r\n\"Until we get an official building which I'm still working on, I meet clients in the house,\" Puck explained. \"I'm very selective of the people I personally work with but I heard wonderful things about you from Sam. You're my brother's friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jake is great,\" Ryder said. <br>\r\n\"He is. I heard you even might be interested in him.\" Ryder stilled sensing the tension in his voice.<br>\r\n\"M-maybe,\" he squeaked.<br>\r\n\"You seem cool and all but if you break my brother's heart I'll tear your inside out understand?\" Puck said as he punched a fist in his left hand. Ryder gulped. <br>\r\n\"Y-yes. I really like him and promise that won't happen. If anything he'd be the one dropping me.\" Puck nodded at that answer. <br>\r\n\"True enough. Well I'm more than happy to help.\" Puck smiled flashing brilliant teeth. He lead into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"You know what you're getting into?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ryder said. \"I'm getting big.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. You okay with that? You can back out.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, this way Jake will be interested in me.\" Puck smirked. <br>\r\n\"Good answer. You can leave anytime no hard feelings.\"<br>\r\n\"Right now I'm good,\" Ryder said. \"Is Jake coming by today?\"<br>\r\n\"Possibly, we'll see soon enough. Right now I'm going to help you. So we're going to start out with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see, in the past, I used to just stuff guys with food and have them lift weights to make them as bulky and fat as possible, but lately I've been making plans for my clients to help them gain in a much faster manner.\"  Puck grinned, \"So, Ryder.  Do me a little favor and strip down for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Wha- WHAT?!\"  Ryder said, his face turning red at the idea of naked in front of someone as big and sexy as Puck.<br>\r\n\"Not like butt-naked, dude.  Down to whatever undies you got on.  I need to get an idea of what I'm working with.\"  Puck said, watching Ryder.<br>\r\nRyder sighed and did as he was told, removing his clothes until he stood there in just his Superman boxers and socks.  Puck circled around Ryder's body, looking him over.  Ryder stood there awkwardly, trying not to cover anything up, even though he felt like he was being circled by a gigantic, bulky bird of prey.  Especially with how Puck kept eyeing his ass and crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..  Not bad.\"  Puck said, putting his hands on his wide hips, \"You'll definitely be a lot hotter once you've bulked up.\"<br>\r\n\"Uuuuh...  Thanks?\"  Ryder said, feeling awkward.<br>\r\n\"So, Sammy told me you want to be big like me.\"  Puck said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.  I mean, don't get me wrong, Sam's body is hot in it's own aspect, but he's too doughy.  You're big and strong and thick, which is what I want.\"  Ryder admitted.<br>\r\n\"And you're doing this so that Jake would be attracted to you?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Well...  yeah.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n\"Well, heres the thing, Ryder.  You want Jake to be attracted to you but you also keep saying that YOU want to have a body like mine.\"  Puck told him.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I want-\"<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEH.\"  Puck interrupted, making a sound similar to buzzer going off, \"Wrong answer.  You want Jake to be attracted to you.  So it's not about what YOU want.  It's about what HE wants.  I could spend all this time giving you a powerlifter body like mine but that wouldn't matter because maybe he doesn't find you attractive still.  So, do you want to have a body that you want or a body he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder scratched the back of his head, \"Umm...  What he wants.\"<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"THAT, my Superman-fanboy-friend, was a test.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Ryder asked, a little shocked.<br>\r\n\"Yep!  I wanted to see if you would put Jake before yourself.  Look, heres the truth.  Jake is attracted to BIG men, as you know.  Jake is attracted to guys like me, my boyfriend Dave, who is TWICE the size of me, and my other boyfriend, Sam.\"  Puck told him.<br>\r\n\"OTHER boyfriend?\"  Ryder asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"Yep!  Dave, Sam, and I are all dating each other and we couldn't be happier.\"  Puck said, smiling happily.<br>\r\n\"So... you know about Jake and Sam having sex?\"  Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"Of COURSE.  I was the one who told Jake it was okay.  He's has sex with me and Dave also\"  Puck said.<br>\r\nRyder looked just as confused, but he pushed it aside, \"So, what are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Like I said, Jake is attracted BIG, HUGE guys like me, Dave, and Sam.  I have a powerlifter body: I'm full of GIANT, strong, powerful muscles and a huge, swollen ball belly.  Go ahead, give it a push.\"  Ryder pressed his palm against Puck's stomach and pushed against it, amazed by how solid it was.  \"My boyfriend, Dave Karofsky, is the exact opposite of me.  He's got gigantic strong muscles like I do, but his body is more on the fat side.  Sam is a prime example of the best of both of our bodies: he's a fatass with enormous muscles.  If I had to put a percentage on us I'd say I'm 80% muscle, 20% fat, Dave is 70% fat, 30% muscle, and Sam is 50/50.\"<br>\r\n\"Right...\"  Ryder said, listening.\"<br>\r\n\"So. here's what I'll do for you.  I'll bulk you up close to my size and we'll see if Jake likes it.  If he wants more fat on you then we'll stuff you until he's happy.  Deal?\"  Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"  Ryder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\"  Puck said, walking into the kitchen and opening a cabinet full of gainer substances, \"Here.\"  Puck said, putting a full container of \"Gain N' Grow\" on the counter, \"I'm going to do everything I can to get you as big as possible in the shortest amount of time.\"  As Ryder got dressed Puck went over his game plan for him, \"Drink 3 weight gain shakes per meal using this powder and ice cream, quadruple your food intake, and triple your time in the gym.  You are to report back to this house every single day after school.  You'll be here from the time school ends to 10 at night and you'll be doing nothing but eating, lifting, and eating.  You'll be eating the exact same amount of food at school that Sam is everyday and you are REQUIRED to keep up with him.  If you can't finish the same amount of food Sam eats then he will eat the rest and your meals here after school will be doubled, including the amount of shakes you drink per meal.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder nodded, determined to get huge.<br>\r\nPuck smiled, \"Good.  Let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So three of these shake things?\" Ryder asked looking at the container. <br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Puck nodded. \"I'll make you some right now,\" he said, scooping out some powder into a blender and going to the freezer. \"Any particular flavor of icecream you want? Icecream adds delicious flavor.\"<br>\r\n\"Why? Is it bland or awful tasting?\" Ryder asked.<br>\r\n\"Nah, not in comparison to other weight gainers but yeah, icecream is great for enhancing flavor and it would be silly not to.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, makes sense. Um...I guess just chocolate chip cookie dough if you have that.\" Puck checked the freezer. <br>\r\n\"Yep, got cookie dough, nice choice by the way.\" Puck scooped a massive scoop out and plunked it into the blender and hit the start button. When it was liquid, he paused, poured a cop of powder in and resumed blending. When he was finished, he poured it out into a big glass and handed it to Ryder then started the next one. Ryder tilted it, swirling it around a moment before he shrugged and started chugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid was much thicker than it had appeared and Ryder slowed down as he swallowed. It actually tasted pretty good which was a welcome thing although maybe it was just because it was cookie dough. Ryder kept on drinking in between gasps of air. The only thing was when he wasn't drinking it, it felt rather heavy in his stomach and Puck kept giving him nods to keep going so Ryder did. When the first glass was finished, Ryder gave a belch and sighed. Puck came out with the second glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a rather weak start but its a good thing you have me to motivate you. One glass? That's way too easy and soon it will be for you too.\" Ryder shrugged helplessly.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm just new at this, I'm not very good am I?\" Ryder asked devastated. Puck wrapped an arm around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude if you start crying I'm going to slug you. With my help you'll eventually be able to chug those shakes down like nothing and yeah, you're just new. We were all there. I remember my first one. I puked it back up although I kind of forgot the icecream. It's not that it tastes bad but icecream definitely makes it taste better and is more settling and it is heavy stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say that makes me feel better,\" Ryder muttered. Puck shrugged as he handed Ryder the second. <br>\r\n\"Drink,\" he commanded as he moved his hands underneath Sam's shirt causing him to sputter. <br>\r\n\"Dude what the hell are you doing?\" Ryder shouted. Puck rubbed a bit before looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping of course and easing the passage,\" Puck said. Ryder sighed as he allowed Puck to rub. He won't deny he enjoyed having Puck's rough and thick but surprisingly dexterous and soft hands rubbing his tummy as he swallowed the second shake down. It really did help and although he felt ill, Puck's skill kept him from throwing up. Ryder closed his eyes and fantasized it was Jake as he grudgingly tilted his lips and started the third one. As Ryder choked it down, Ryder felt fingers dig in deeper and more agressively almost hurting but it was necessary and shocked him enough to get the last bit down. He felt the glass removed from his lips and he opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, good job for your first time,\" Puck said. \"Most people generally have thrown up by this point.\" Ryder gave a sick smile. <br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I can see why.\" A massive wet belch rumbled from Ryder and he flushed a bit. Puck grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah, that was a good one, could be less glurpy and sick though but yeah, nice one! Um yeah anyhow. It gets easier over time, much easier and I bet by the second or third time you won't be feeling the need to throw up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Ryder muttered and Puck grinned as he rubbed Ryder's stomach. Ryder didn't really have the energy to tell Puck no and it felt really amazing as he burped again. Ryder was nervous for the moment because he couldn't imagine doing anything like that on a consistent basis and he almost told Puck he changed his mind before an image of Jake popped in his mind. Jake liked big people, really big people, and these methods had worked on people like Sam to make them said really big. Jake wouldn't be interested and it wasn't in him to give up. Although he really wished the pain was not part of it. At least Puck was enjoying himself, rubbing his stomach and it really really helped as well in the not vomiting or room spinning. Ryder sighed as he focused for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what next?\" Ryder asked panting. Puck shrugged. \"You like pizza?\" he asked innocently. <br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Ryder said. <br>\r\n\"Good. That will be your next first meal to eat an entire pizza.\"<br>\r\n\"What? An entire pizza? After that?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Puck smirked. <br>\r\n\"..damn,\" Ryder said. </span></div></div>",

In the future yes, but they haven't taken effect yet. There will be pizza for you but only as much as you or I think you can handle and the rest is for me and the rest of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ryder asked. Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"It's a guy get-together of course for everyone.\"<br>\r\n\"Who is everyone?\" Ryder asked confused.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...let's see,\" Puck said, rubbing his chin in thought. \"Jake, you of course, Sam, Mike, Finn, Dave, Brody...\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, who's Brody?\" Ryder asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Rachel's new boy since Rachel and Brody are visiting after she finally managed to somehow talk him out of New York which is a miracle in itself.\"<br>\r\n\"Who...oh, that Rachel,\" Ryder said. \"The Rachel who is a star that you guys kept fighting over for a while. Will I meet her?\"<br>\r\n\"Potentially. I'd have hesitated to put Finn and Brody in the same room together but now that Finn's moved from Rachel, I think it's safe.\"<br>\r\n\"So when will this be?\" The doorbell rang and Puck grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess about now since it'll be an all day or longer thing.\" He ran up the stairs, an interesting sight to say the least, and Ryder could hear Puck's voice as he welcomed them, thanked them for coming said how much fun they were going to have, the other guys weren't there but one, etc. When Puck came down, Ryder recognized Sam behind him and then someone he kind of did although he looked different. It was Mike and he was now sporting a bit of a belly that Ryder couldn't remember him having when he had come and helped choreograph Grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Mike,\" Ryder said. \"Where'd that come from? You didn't look like that before.\" Mike nodded over and smiled. <br>\r\n\"Hey Ryder, I didn't expect you here but at the same time it shouldn't be surprising. Puck has always been very convincing.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was Sam who brought me to him,\" Ryder corrected. Mike shrugged though.<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless, who directed and made Sam? Anyhow, I've put on a bit of weight recently and actually by the way, I had some before, just bigger now.\"<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Ryder argued. \"That was totally flat last time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was easier to hide and was wearing loose clothing. I've gotten bigger since then and there'd be no point hiding here. If anything, I'm the baby of this group, outside of you.\" The doorbell rang again and Puck ran up the stairs again to get it and they could hear excited screaming and pounding from jumping footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?\" Ryder wondered wide-eyed.<br>\r\n\"My guess is Rachel,\" Mike said. Sam noddend in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely Rachel.\" They watched as Puck came down followed by the second or third most gorgeous man Ryder had ever seen (first being Jake and potentially Puck in his opinion but man if he saw this guy before Jake...) who was lookin around. He was pretty built too since he was wearing a sleeveless tank exposing pretty muscular arms. He must have put some weight on recently or something though because it stretched slightly across a beginner belly and rode up a little exposing the slightest bit of skin. He blushed a little and moved to cover it before Puck stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no covering up allowed. There is no reson to be embarassed since it's just us men here having a good time as well as similar goals of getting bigger.\" Puck leaned down and poked mischeviously. \"Besides, this here ain't going to stay down now, let alone later. Anyhow, glad you're here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks I guess?\" Brody said not sure what to say. Puck chuckled. Brody looked around and saw Sam, his eyes going wide. He had a similar response to Puck when he first met him a bit back but he was used to it now but Sam was in a different class. He had no idea people could get so big. \"Holy sh-, err wow hi big guy?\" Brody said to Sam intimidated, a feeling he never liked to feel but it was understandable since the guy had biceps that were bigger than his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm Sam,\" he said friendly and Brody slightly relaxed. <br>\r\n\"I'm Brody Weston, Rachel's boyfriend. I guess she told you about me?\" Sam smirked. <br>\r\n\"Nah, she only talks to Kurt, Santanna, Puck and Finn.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't forget Quinn,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, Quinn too.\" <br>\r\n\"Is he going to be here?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"He..oh its you,\" Finn said coming down the stairs. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Rachel finally got me to come visit Lima while on holidays as she really wanted to see her folks and I guess some of you guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's great, I guess. You treating her nice?\" Brody relaxed even more as he had fully expected Finn to try to attack him like he had before. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we patched things up and we're going good again.\" <br>\r\n\"Good, otherwise I would have kicked your sorry butt out the door.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Puck,\" said yet another massive guy. \"Sorry I'm late.\" He kissed Puck on the cheek which made Puck smile.<br>\r\n\"This is Dave Karofsky, one of my significant others,\" Puck said introducing Dave to Ryder and Brody. \"The other being Sam\" <br>\r\n\"Is that everyone who's coming?\" Sam asked. Puck shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Jake is coming but let me count who we have...we have me, Dave, Sam, Ryder, Finn, Brody, Mike...was Blaine coming?\" <br>\r\n\"Err I think he was sick,\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"Well damn, no Blaine then. I guess just Jake then and we can get started.\"<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, sorry I'm late,\" Jake said coming down the stairs. \"Had to finish something but i'm here now.\"<br>\r\n\"So what exactly are we doing here?\" Dave asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of bro time with my bros, having fun, and eating what do you think?\" Puck said. \"I already took the liberty of acquiring a bunch of food and snacks. So until they get here, do whatever and introduce yourselves, have fun, etc.\" Ryder immediately looked over at Jake and Brody looked around torn a moment since he didn't really know anyone there but Puck when he was on skype and then followed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, uh who are you?\" Jake asked when he saw Brody come over. <br>\r\n\"I'm Brody, Rachel's girlfriend.\" Jake looked blank for a moment before a lightbulb flashed in his head. <br>\r\n\"Oh the Rachel of Glee club who is my brother's friend. Yeah, nice of you to come visit. Will you be here long?\"<br>\r\n\"Just visiting for a few days with Rachel and she decided to leave me here since Puck was having a gathering of friends and I guess she wanted me to mingle.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's great to have you her. My brother's influence?\" Jake said pointing down and Brody nodded when he saw what Jake was pointing at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it kind of is,\" Brody said blushing a bit as he rubbed his belly. \"Rachel is on a bit of a cooking craze and she makes me taste test everything and I can't say no and Puck certainly gives her all sorts of additional ideas.\" Jake laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does at that.\" Jake looked at Ryder. \"And I'm surprised to see you as well Ryder. What are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ryder started. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryder was about to tell Jake the truth, that he was gaining for him, but the sound of Puck's deep voice interrupted, \"Well, that was the pizza place.\"  He said as he put his phone away in his pocket, \"They said it'll take an hour and half for the pizza to get here.\"<br>\r\n\"Why so long?\"  Mike asked, rubbing his hungry tummy.<br>\r\n\"I ordered 30 XXL 4 meat stuffed crust pizzas.  It'll take some time to cook.\"  Puck said, patting Mike's baby belly, \"Don't worry, little guy.  We'll get this nice and big in no time.\"<br>\r\n\"Why so many?\"  Ryder asked, honestly surprised.<br>\r\n\"5 for me, 5 for Dave, 5 for Sam, and the last 15 are for you, Mike, Brody, Finn, and Jake to split.  Any leftovers go to me.\"  Puck said, slapping his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always.\"  Sam said, leaning down and kissing the behemoth belly of his boyfriend before reaching under and giving the huge thing a few loving jiggles, watching it the huge solid thing bounce.  <br>\r\nPuck grinned and flexed his huge arms, \"Just you wait, guys!  Soon all of you will be this big!\"<br>\r\nRyder quickly became hard at the sight but it didn't take him long to realize that every other man in the room was hard as well.  It was incredibly obvious that every single guy in the room was gay, or at the very least, attracted to men and woman.  This put Ryder at ease a bit knowing that all of the men in the room were the same as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea!\"  Finn said, adjusting his boner in his pants, \"Why don't we all weigh ourselves?  If we're all here to gain weight we might as well find out where we are.\"<br>\r\n\"Great idea, Finn!\"  Jake said, \"Since I'm not a gainer I'll take notes.\"  Jake lead the massive men in the basement rec room to a giant scale Puck had installed down there.  \"Let's have the biggest guy here go first!  My sexy big bro!!\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he strutted over to the scale and every single eye in the room was locked onto the fattest ass any of them had ever seen, following each and every bounce and jiggle.  Puck got up on the scale, his massive gut pressed against the basement wall, and watched as the digital numbers on the wall screen read his weight.<br>\r\n\"540!\"  Jake said, writing it down.<br>\r\n\"FUCK YEAH\"  Puck said, fist pumping the air which caused his ass and belly to jiggle, exciting all the boys again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?\"  Jake said and Dave eagerly walked up, taking off his shirt and happily showing off his fat and muscles for the boys.  The guys all cheered for the fat and muscular football player as he jiggled his belly and flexed his pecs.  He turned around and got up on the scale as Finn and Mike both gave Dave's massive ass cheeks a hard slap each.<br>\r\nRyder chuckled and enjoyed the way all the guys were so open with each other.  The numbers on the screen flashed and Jake read them off, \"490!\"<br>\r\nThe crowd of boys cheered again and Jake called for Sam to come up as Dave got off.  The massive blonde teen walked up and turned to the guys before getting on.  He lifted up both arms and flexed his huge biceps, a grin spreading across his big lipped mouth as his sleeves were ripped to shreds by his biceps.<br>\r\n\"THATS MY BOY!\"  Puck said, proud of his enormous boyfriend.  Every guy in the room could feel themselves get harder at the sight and Sam got on the scale which read his weight at 380 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sam came Finn, who weighed in at a tiny 270, Brody who only came in at 250, and Mike who weighed only 230.  Ryder, embarrassed by his small size, came up to only 190.  The group cheered him on, screaming encouraging cheers like \"You'll get there!\" \"Don't worry, little guy, we'll fatten you up!\" and \"You're gonna be so hot with a fat, juicy ass!\".  All of the complements from so many hot guys was great but all he cared about was what Jake thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake finished writing down the notes and grinned, \"Can't wait to see you gain, little guy.  You'll be sexy once you're a lot bigger.\"  Ryder grinned and got off the scale.<br>\r\n\"Well, the pizza won't be here for a while but that shouldn't stop you guys from eating!  You wanna get fatter you better start eating everything I put out for you guys!\"<br>\r\nRyder looked over at the massive pile of party food on the huge table.  The dinner table was surrounded by 3 couches; one that was big enough to hold Puck, Dave, and Sam, another for Mike, Finn, and Brody, and third for Jake, Ryder, and Blaine who didn't make it.  In front of all of this was a massive flat screen tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck popped in a comedy movie and everybody got settled in to eat and watch.  The dinner table was covered in party food; chips and dip, boneless buffalo wings, quadruple cheeseburgers, chili dogs, mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, french fries, 3 different kinds of cake, and bottles after bottles of soda.  What Ryder didn't know was that Puck had laced everything with his special weight gain powder to increase their waistlines and make them even hungrier as they ate.  Ryder was stuffed a little bit ago, and even though he was bloated before, his stomach BEGGING for food.  Everybody sat down and Puck hit play and in no time every single guy in the room was stuffing their faces with food with the exception of Jake who knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody talked as the movie played because everybody was too busy eating and all of them had claimed at least one food to only themselves.  Puck had claimed the quadruple cheeseburgers for himself and was eating two at the same time, alternating between hands as he stuffed down burger after burger, eager to every single one in the massive pile he had cooked.  Dave was doing the exact same thing Puck was only he was gorging on the hotdogs, doing his best not to get chili anywhere as he stuffed his fat gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was a bit greedy as he refused to let anybody else touch the chicken nuggets and fries.  The monster sized blonde had a cycle going: he shoved 8 chicken nuggets into his mouth at once, eating them before shoving a fistful of fries in.  Once he ate the fries in his mouth, he would shove another 8 chicken in and then back to fries once those were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn had taken every single bag of potato chips and the several massive bowl of dip Puck had made.  Rather than just dipping the chips  Finn opened the 6 bags and poured the chips into the 6 huge bowls of dips, mixing them up with a huge spoon before using said spoon to just eat the dip and chips straight from the bowl.  Brody had grabbed the seven huge trays of boneless tangy bbq buffalo wings and was popping then into his mouth like crazy, scarfing down 4 or 5 at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was eating the mozzarella sticks like a mad man, scarfing down the semi-hot fried cheese like he'd never eaten a day in his life.  He would eat 7 or 8 at a time before going back for even more.  That left Ryder, the skinniest guy there, forced to eat the 3 massive cakes Puck had made.  Ryder didn't know what came over his but the second he ate the powder laced cake he couldn't stop and just kept going, almost inhaling the cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sat back and watches, eating some cookies he brought with him himself.  He knew better than to eat his huge bro's cooking.  He watched as all these sexy, big men stuffed themselves and Jake couldn't help but massage the massive bulge in his jeans.  All the guys would take breaks just long enough to drain entire 2 liters of soda before going at it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was finally gone after an hour of eating and all of the guys were leaning back in their seats, their guts bloated and stuffed and perfectly round.  Even Puck was able to stuff himself to being bloated, both surprised and impressed with himself.  Puck could still move but he decided to relax next to his bloated boyfriends instead.  Jake knew that these massive guts wouldn't be full for long - the amount of gainer powder they ate would kick in soon and they'd all be starving for more food soon.  Luckily the pizza would be there in 30 minutes which gave Jake just enough to time to rub all of their huge bellies, as well as a few other places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake decided to start with the guy who needed his magical belly rubs the most... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake moved over to the massive couch that somehow managed to miracleously fit and support Puck, Sam, and Dave and proceeded to sit between them on Puck's lap. Feeling a lot like he was visiting Santa but much sexier considering who it was, Jake lifted up and removed the remnants of Puck's tattered dirty shirt that had ketchup and chilli sauce spilled on it from Dave's food making a note to throw it away as it was no longer really fitting and it was disgusting by this point from countless meals and well, Puck was much better shirtless. Cracking his knuckles, Jake got to work as he made sure his brother's agony turned to pleasure and to get him ready for the pizza he was going to consume and Jake trembled at the thought of this massive gut getting any bigger and he shifted. Puck who had been watching him grinned and slapped his gut approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I know you want this,\" Puck said as he bounced and pulled Jake closer against him so he could feel little big Puck pressed against him. Jake looked at Puck with desire as he squeezed Puck's massive pecs and massaged the massive belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so huge, you're a fucking beast. A massive he-man of pure perfection,\" Jake slaped Puck's gut dredging up a massive burp that went on for a long time and Jake almost came then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrppppppp pppppppppppp, thanks bro,\" Puck said relieved as he rocked against Jake causing him to whimper a bit. Puck grinned and pulled Jake against him, burying his face against his massive body. Jake laid still a moment before reluctantly pushing off as he looked nervously back at the other guests who were looking a bit disturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Puck, people are here,\" Jake said, though rather reluctantly Puck noticed grinning. Rolling his eyes he sighed dramatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine, later then,\" Puck winked. From where Ryder was sitting, he didn't know whether to gag and be disgusted, be totally creeped out, or oddly find it rather erotic as he had all three feelings. Ryder totally understood why Jake might be interested and technically speaking, neither Puck nor Jake were related closer than half-brother which was further than cousins which was still legal in some areas. Even if they were, they were both male which made the other side of incest non-sequitar. That didn't mean that Ryder wanted to watch, though admittedly at the same time he was curious as Puck was big...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake moved onto Sam and Dave, playing with their bellies and fat, rocking them, squeezing their massive chest and biceps to the amausement of Puck who was following everything. Looking at his watch, Jake moved onto the smaller group which included him, Finn, Mike, and that Brody guy. He didn't spend that much time with Finn and Jake smiled awkwardly as he rubbed Finn's stomach as he just couldn't get the thought of Finn being their teacher for a time out of his head. He didn't know Mike that well and he seemed to need it less and was even more awkward for Jake with Mike than it was with Finn. Reaching the last two guys,he grinned at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brody is it? Glad you could make it today. You're doing a great job by the way,\" Jake said as he rubbed his hand over Brody's bloated stomach. \"You look good with the extra weight.\" Brody rolled his eyes and mumbled something and Jake just grinned as he continued rubbing. \"You'll see.\"  He patted the stars tanned flesh and tweaked the nipples grinning wildly in his familial greeting. Stopping at Ryder, Jake cocked his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm especially glad you're here, it's been a while since we could hang out. You need to come more often and eat as you're too cute to be so skinny.\" Jake squeezed Ryder's stomach and rubbed it grinning. \"Well, not right now, I was impressed by those cakes, I had no idea that you could eat that many by yourself.\" Jake winked and Ryder felt like he was missing something from the weird way Jake was looking at him but he couldn't figure out what it was. He was distracted by the feeling of Jake's hand on his poor stuffed stomach and how it felt so nice there. Jake was going to do more but the sound of the pizzaman that finally came distracted them and Ryder let out a groan at the ringing doorbell. He wanted to spend more time with Jake and the whole massage thing was intimate not to mention, he just needed a massage to reduce the stress in his poor tummy. They all got up and went to get the pizza and suddenly everyone was hungry again like they hadn't just stuffed themselves silly even before pizza. As they divided the pizza up, Puck and Jake shared a look and grinned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody reached into his mail box deposit picking up his mail and heading towards his room. He had a date coming up with Rachel soon so he had to get everything ready. A perfectly appropiate vegan candlelit dinner for them (or rather Rachel, he could barely stand the stuff and made his own food as well) was a bit cliche but hey, why depart from the classics of a good formula? It took a while to wear Rachel down from that Finn guy but after Thanksgiving and now that she was back from her cruise he had a very good feeling that they were finally going to start dating. Humming he set the plates as he looked through his mail. Junk, school announcements he knew, junk, junk, bill, junk (he wondered exactly how he was getting advertisements in a college mailbox, that just wasn't right) bill, announcement, ooh discount for free frozen yogurt! That would be useful. The final letter though looked official and not a billing statement so Brody was curious what it would be. Carefully opening it, he pulled the nicely typed document out and scanned it. Then he read it again. And a third time his mind in a state of shock then excitement. He had been chosen to play in a new Broadway show as one of the major leads! Not a minor role but an actual lead! Over who knows how many aspiring actors who worked years they had chosen him, Brody Wes, to play the lead in actual broadway show...he hoped he wasn't going to faint. He took a tentative step. Okay he wasn't...Broadway hit him again and he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Brody are you alright? Do I need to call an ambulance? I was just coming in to see where you where and then I saw you passed out on the floor and...\" a worried voice talking a million miles a moment reached wherever Brody was and he groaned as he started coming to. Blinking heavily he looked up and saw Rachel was standing over him still talking. He interrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Rachel, you're back. Was it a fun cruise?\"<br>\r\n\"Why yes it was Brody but you're hurt. Can I do anything for you, get you ice, tea, warm glass of milk?\" Brody shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good, I'm good. I love your voice but can you be quiet for a moment until my head stops hurting please?\" Rachel backed off and nodded silently. Brody gave her a grateful look as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not bleeding am I?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Rachel confirmed. <br>\r\n\"Well that's good.\" He hobbled over to the chair and sat down.<br>\r\n\"Brody, what's going on and why were you on the floor?\" Rachel demanded. <br>\r\n\"I passed out,\" Brody deadpanned. He smirked a little at the 'no duh' look on her face.<br>\r\n\"I could see that. But why?\" Brody's grin grew even bigger as he picked up the unnoticed letter on the floor. <br>\r\n\"Because of this. Read it.\" Brody handed it to her and he watched her eyes glance over the page and widen.<br>\r\n\"Is this...is this what I think it is?\" she asked shocked. <br>\r\n\"It is.\" He laughed.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Brody that's wonderful and amazing!\" She said jumping up and down squealing excitedly.<br>\r\n\"I know right? I'm going to be a lead in a Broadway show!\" he joined her in their happy jump dance. After jumping up and down and squealing as Brody lifted Rachel up and swung her around, they settled back down and Rachel looked at the letter again. She blinked and looked back up at Brody. Then back down. Then back up. Brody watched her confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rach what is it?\" <br>\r\n\"There is...there is a clause though.\" Rachel said carefully. \"They chose you for your potential but there will have to be some things you do before you get the part.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, what?\" <br>\r\n\"The director thinks you're perfect for the role because you're sexy and talented...\" Rachel started<br>\r\n\"Why thank you very much,\" Brody smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"-and look like who they have in mind for the role but that person is a lot bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Brody asked trying to see now. Rachel moved back as she kept reading.<br>\r\n\"Since it's a musical about differing body types they were hoping to get someone to fit the role and you were the best by far in everyway but that. However, everyone else who was the appropiate body type or close either are horrible actors, can't sing, couldn't do it, or weren't the same attractiveness necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to the point,\" Brody said with a sinking heart not liking where this was going. He didn't get the part did he?<br>\r\n\"You got the part but if you want to keep it you'll have to...\" Rachel trailed off.<br>\r\n\"Just spit it out Rachel, I can take it,\" Brody hoped he could anyways. <br>\r\n\"Well you have to gain weight and bulk up quite a bit. They need a 'big star'\" Rachel said in quotations. <br>\r\n\"I already am,\" Brody protested.<br>\r\n\"Not enough. Again emphasis on big.\" Brody slumped in his chair. <br>\r\n\"Rachel, what am I going to do?\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I have an idea.\"  Rachel said, walking over to the coffee table and opening Brody's laptop.  She continued talking as she pulled open facebook, \"You see, back in my senior year of high school, one of my glee club friends ended up realizing a few things about himself.  First, he realized just how attracted he was to men, and second, that he was mostly attracted to BIG men, and by big I mean the kind of big you have to get to, Brody.\"<br>\r\n\"Right...\"  Brody said, wondering where Rachel was going with this.<br>\r\n\"Well, the thing is, he found several of the guys in Glee club to be VERY sexy, but he just couldn't bring himself to date any of them until he.. well, look.\"  Rachel said, showing Brody a picture of her friend, Sam, \"This is Sam when he rejoined Glee club last year.  And this,\"  She said, changing the picture, \"Is him today.\"<br>\r\nBrody couldn't believe what he was seeing.  This Sam guy, at the beginning of last year, looked just like Brody does now; buff and muscular, but not gigantic.  But now, gigantic was the ONLY word he could use to describe the guy in the picture.  Sam Evans looked like he weighed around 450 pounds, with his massive stomach, wide hips, and huge ass.  What really shocked Brody, though, was how muscular he was at the same time.  Sam's arms were the biggest he'd ever seen, and he had huge, beefy thighs to match, and his chest was strong and solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so your friend did THAT to him?\"  Brody asked.<br>\r\nRachel nodded, \"And not just him.  Mike Chang, Rory Flanagan, Joe Hart, even several members of the football team like Shane Tinsley.\"  Rachel said, showing him all of the enormous men that this friend of hers had grown.  All of them varied, which was what surprised Brody: some had more muscle than fat and vice versa.  Rachel pulled up the man's facebook page, \"His name is Noah Puckerman, but most people call him Puck.  I don't.  As you can see, Noah did some gaining as well.\"  She said, showing off Puck's new bulk.  Brody was amazed, the dude looked massive!  A huge, round, solid looking gut and a giant arms, legs, chest, shoulders, and neck.  \"The only guy he didn't get his hands on was Finn, but thats because we were dating at the time.\"  Rachel pulled up her Ex's profile picture, \"And as you can it didn't take long for Puck to fatten him up too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody was amazed that somebody could get so many people to get THAT BIG that quickly.  He couldn't even say anything, he just kept staring.  Rachel continued, \"This is the guy he started on, Dave Karofsky.  He's also the biggest guy Noah's ever helped.\"  She pulled up a picture of Dave at the gym and Brody almost fell over in shock.  The dude was MASSIVE!  He looked like he weighted over 600 pounds, the majority of it being fat, but he could NOT deny that Dave had the biggest muscles he'd ever seen, even bigger than that Sam guy from before.  \"Puck and Dave are dating, now.\"  Rachel said, looking back at him, \"Listen, Brody, if you're really serious about getting this part then Puck is your best chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody stared at the computer screen a bit longer, thinking things over.  He finally took and breath, \"Lets do it.\"  Rachel smiled, \"Perfect.  I'll send Puck a message right now.\"  Rachel's fingers began typing and it only took a few minutes for Puck to reply, \"He says he'll do it but he'll need a place to stay.\"<br>\r\n\"He can stay here with me.\"  Brody said, \"I have an extra room he can sleep in.\"  Rachel told Puck that and he replied saying he'd buy the first ticket he could and he'd be on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day Brody is sitting in her living room, watching TV, when the doorbell rings.  Brody gets up, answers the door, and realized just how massive Puck actually was.  The powerlifter physic he carried on him was so massive that he was actually wider than the door frame.  He wore a heavy jacket to keep himself warm in the NYC cold, but the black t shirt he wore under it was skin tight against his massive traps, gigantic pecs, and monstrously round and tight gut.  His denim jeans cling to his tree-trunk thighs and thick calves.  Puck grinned, \"So, you must be Brody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Noah, right?\"  Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"I prefer Puck.  C'mon, man, you gonna let me in or what?\"  Puck grinned, excited to help this skinny guy before him grow to his fullest potential.  </span></div></div>",

Puck smiled as he tucked his  and moved sideways through the opening.<br>\r\n\"Who's that Brody?\" Rachel called from the bathroom where she had been freshening up when the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n\"Oh it's your friend Puck!\" he called out and the door opened with a bang as Rachel came exploding out of the bathroom and reached them. <br>\r\n\"Oh my god you're here! I can't believe it! I'm so excited and it's so very nice to see you again and thank you so much for doing this,\" she said as she hugged around his middle. <br>\r\n\"It's cool Rachel,\" Puck said. \"More than happy to and I had been looking for my next client. It's kind of a business you know, makes real good money.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Rachel said snuggling him. \"Not to mention it suits you well. I'm so proud of you Noah.\" Brody was amused to see a blush form on Puck's face although he was the only one who could see it. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, well uh thanks. Anyhow from what I understand Brody here needs to put on some mass for some weird-ass show?\"<br>\r\n\"Noah, language,\" Rachel scolded affectionately. Puck grinned.<br>\r\n\"Yeah so some weird show?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much,\" Brody said. \"Apparently I'm not 'big enough' or something,\" he said doing hand motions with the quotations. Puck looked him over critically. <br>\r\n\"Well in the idea of size that Rachel told me is required, you really aren't, not that you're not attractive but not nearly manly enough to pull such a role off like that.\"<br>\r\n\"That's why you're here,\" Brody said and Puck smirked. <br>\r\n\"Feisty, shouldn't be surprised. No one else would have suited Rach.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you saying I'm not lovable?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n\"No, but it certainly takes a specific type of person to keep up with you.\"<br>\r\n\"I have standards,\" Rachel said. \"I mean you have to be nice, kind, a good performer, an amazing singer...\"<br>\r\n\"Cute but I don't need to hear the list,\" Puck said. \"Anyhow, the plane ride went on for a while so I thought why not get started on training and I am kind of hungry and this baby needs constant feeding,\" he patted his massive gut. \"Metaphorically speaking, I'm not actually pregnant so you know.\" <br>\r\n\"I didn't say anything,\" Brody said putting his hands up innocently. <br>\r\n\"No, but I can tell when someone is thinking that but hey, I don't blame you. It kind of is my baby.\" Puck and Rachel laughed at that.<br>\r\n\"So before we start,\" Puck said when Rachel finally let go of him. \"Are you a vegan as well like Rachel?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not really,\" Brody said and Puck sighed in relief. \"Thank goodness, vegans are tough to know what they can and can't eat and make it real hard since let's be honest it may or may not be healthy depending but either way vegan food is generally crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Rachel said a bit offended. \"Is not...\"<br>\r\n\"Most of it,\" Puck clarified. Anyway its not awkward that for Rachel to eat her stuff and you to eat whatever?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not really, she has her meal and I have mine,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"Cool. So I hear New York has some amazing world-class pizza.\" <br>\r\n\"You bet it does,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"Well we could go get some,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"That's a good idea! Let me go get ready,\" Rachel said rushing to her room. <br>\r\n\"I have to get started sometime soon I guess,\" Brody said. \"Going to be really weird eating whatever.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah it always is at the start for most people but you become used to it pretty quickly, a couple of days or a week generally.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're a dancer?\" Puck asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, dancer, singer, performer, actor, did ballet, martial arts, variety of things.\" Brody replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel did show me some of the stuff you guys did, it was amazing.\" Puck smirked and licked his lips. \"I can't believe she actually wore that low cut black dress in 'Oops I did it again' which by the way was really hot. She always wore cute animals sweaters in high school and was embarassed to show even the slightest bit of skin let alone her boobs like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, was a bit of a surprise as well but she was determined to prove she had sex appeal and well I wasn't going to stop her, though even if I did want to I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n\"Once Rachel sets her mind to something she does it. That is one of the things I always admired about her. She inspired me,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" Rachel asked coming back having changed into clothes more appropiate for going out. <br>\r\n\"What an inspiration my wonderful girl is,\" Brody said kissing her. She laughed and hit at his head. <br>\r\n\"Hey, not right now. I just put on clothes and don't want to have to take them off again.\" Puck raised his eyebrow and whistled causing Rachel to glare at him.<br>\r\n\"It's not what you're thinking, I mean I don't want to go out in public with rumpled clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure,\" Puck said laughing. \"Though now I am curious...\"<br>\r\n\"Not going to answer that question Noah,\" Rachel said smartly. <br>\r\n\"Aww no fun,\" Puck said. <br>\r\n\"So are we going?\" Rachel asked. <br>\r\n\"I guess so whenever Brody here is ready. I assume you're getting the vegan or vegetarian option?\" <br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Rachel said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, I'm getting meat and uh you have whatever. Doesn't really matter till we get there there. Show the way Rachel.\" Rachel smiled as she lead the way out, Brody following, and Puck side-stepping after them. They walked along the path and Brody could tell that everyone they walked by was staring at them, or rather at one individual in particular which wasn't him or Rachel for once. Puck just lapped up the attention of the random passer-byers occasionally sending winks and smiles or growl as he flexed his massive muscles which brought uncomfortable memories back to Brody's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not do that please?\" Brody asked Puck. Puck was about to say something but the look on Brody's face stopped him and he nodded, trying to ignore the prying eyes the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mario's Pizza buffet?\" Rachel asked. \"Some amazing people and well a buffet because you know,\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Brody replied and Puck agreed as well. They went in and sat down while Puck flirted with the waitress as she took their drink orders.<br>\r\n\"I thought you were gay,\" Brody said once the waitress had taken their drink orders. Puck laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am, but I like both and she was quite pretty and was certainly interested.\" That certainly had been true, the waitress hadn't been able to tear her eyes Puck the whole time when she took their orders and Brody was making a bet with himself how long it would take before the woman jumped him. \"Mayhap she and I can have some fun time together later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you and Dave together?\" Brody asked really confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we have an understanding. Of course I'll always have Dave first but that doesn't mean I can't have some fun with others.\" Brody didn't know what to say to that. <br>\r\n\"Anyhow, so let's eat,\" Puck said getting up. \"Come on Brody,\" he called as he walked to the buffet lines. Brody looked back at Rachel and she nodded as she headed over to the much smaller (but still there) vegan and vegetarian options. With a sigh wondering just what he was getting into, Brody got behind Puck in line. </span></div></div>",

Once Brody was up to pick he grabbed four slices of pepperoni pizza, two more slices then he normally would eat, assuming that Puck would be okay with that much.  Puck, being almost a head taller than Brody and almost three times as wide, looked over Brody's shoulder, \"Dude, thats it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked back and up, confused, \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Thats really all you're going to eat?  I thought you wanted to bulk up?\" Puck asked, unimpressed.<br>\r\n\"I do.\"  Brody said, looking at his plate.<br>\r\n\"Well you're eating the Puckerman Pizza Special tonight.\"  Puck took the four slices on Brody's plate and put them back on the rack before grabbing the entire rack.  He grabbed another with his already full hand and two more with his free hand, \"Brody, grab two baskets of those quadruple cheesy bread sticks.\"  Puck said before heading back to the table.<br>\r\nBrody, shocked by the amount Puck was taking with him, did as the massive beast of a man told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table Puck set the four racks down and looked at Brody, \"Start eating.  I need to go get mine.\"  Puck said before walking off.  Brody turned around and watched Puck walk away, his eyes traveling down Puck's insanely wide back and locking onto his massive rear end.  Puck had the biggest, chunkiest bubble butt that Brody had ever seen.  It swayed to the right when he took a step to the left, and vice versa, and bounced and jiggled ever so slightly.  Brody ripped his eyes away, feeling his face flush a little, and sat down to eat.  He looked at the massive meal in front of him, sighed, and dug in, devouring his first slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even into his second bite Puck had returned with 6 whole normal size pizzas, 4 baskets of quadruple cheesy bread sticks, and 3 huge pitchers of soda.  He had to have a waiter help him carry it all back.  The waiter walked away and Puck settled into his seat in the booth, his belly pressing up against the table, and grinned at Brody, \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel returned a few minutes later with her own meal: a salad and a few slices of veggie pizza.  She didn't comment on the amount of food Brody was going to have to eat, but he could see on her face she was a little worried.  They all started eating and Brody did his best to keep up with Puck but there was no possible way to do that.  For every slice of pizza Brody ate, Puck had already devoured 4 slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes passed and Puck groaned happily as he sat back in the booth, his stomach bloated and stretched out before him, causing his shirt to ride up.  He had eagerly devoured all 6 pizzas, all 4 baskets of bread, and all 3 pitchers of soda.  Puck placed his hands under his belly and lifted it up, resting it on top of the table, \"Oooooh, shit, that was good.  How you holding up, Brodster?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody swallowed the piece of crust in his mouth and sat back as well, groaning loudly because he had done what he thought was the impossible: he had eaten all 4 smaller personal sized pizzas and both baskets of bread.  \"Finished...\"  he said, his stomach bloated and stretched out in front of him, his skin tight V-neck clinging tightly to the ball of food stuffed flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his belly and groaned loudly as Puck grinned, \"Well, well.  Looks like somebody is a big eater.  Guess you're ready for...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A nice massage to ease your stomach,\" Puck said. \"I'm pretty good at it and people tell me all the time how wonderful it is. Course, I only give it when people do a good job and well I think you have.\" Puck got up and moved to sit beside Brody and Rachel. Fortunately the booth was in a rounded half-circle rather than a straight table so Rachel and Brody could scoot over as Puck took up most of the room as he switched spots. Dramatically cracking his large fingers, he laid his hands on Brody and got to work. Lightly rubbing his large fingers over the stretched taut stomach, he patterned circles and squeezed together as he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel watched with avid interest in the proceedings as she had always wanted to learn the proper technique of a massage (the few times she tried, people said she went to fast and rough). Who knew that fingers so big could so delicately tease and rub like that? Brody seemed to be enjoying it quite a bit as he tried to move closer to the smooth touching fingers so it could cover all the areas. Rachel could also tell he was making happy (and some pained but mostly happy) gasps as Puck gave his bloated belly his full attention. Rachel knew Brody was a somewhat big eater and had been trained to hold back but she didn't know that he was that big of an eater. He did splurge a bit on Thanksgiving but nothing compared to this. Then again, at Thanksgiving they had all those weird friends of Kurt's boss (Rachel wondered how many actually were and how many were friends of friends that came along uninvited) over and far more than expected so they had run out of food fairly quickly. It had still been fun though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody made such a funny face as he released a couple of huge burps as Puck massaged that Rachel couldn't help but laugh long and hard. They were both staring at her as after a couple minutes of laughing and pounding the table she finally ran out of air and was coughing as she kept laughing. Brody was about to do the heimlich if she was about to start choking to death but Rachel waved him off smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine,\" she said smiling before hiccuping and another peal of laughter. <br>\r\n\"What the hell Berry? Are you on something?\" Puck asked shocked. <br>\r\n\"No, no I'm not,\" Rachel said finally settling down. <br>\r\n\"Then what the fuck was that?\" Puck demanded.<br>\r\n\"Noah, language,\" Rachel reminded. Rolling his eyes Puck tried again.<br>\r\n\"What the name of motherflipping love was that?\" <br>\r\n\"I was laughing.\" At the sight of Puck's and Brody's rather murderous faces she backpedaled. \"Sorry Brody, you just had the funniest face expressions when Puck was rubbing you that I couldn't help myself. Not to mention it is cute when you burp which is rather manly.\" Puck grinned and Brody's face flushed slightly in embarassment. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you did look rather funny,\" Puck teased. Brody pouted and Rachel moved to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a turn Puck?\" Rachel asked, batting her eyelashes a little. He raised his eyebrows but allowed her to place her own hands on Brody causing him to shiver.  Rachel rubbed Brody, occasionally helped by Puck as he corrected her when she was going too hard or too fast. He also gave tips and advice as he fixed her position when it was too much. Brody was in euphoria and it was almost too much and yet not enough. He made an embarrassingly whiny noise when Puck and Rachel both stopped and drew back. Rachel smiled at him and kissed his cheek whispering later. Brody really wished it was later then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you think you can walk or will we need a cab?\u201d Puck asked. Brody blinked, his mind still focused on the pleasure he had earlier when Puck and then Rachel then both were rubbing him. <br>\r\n\u201cHuh, what?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cCab or walking?\u201d Brody looked down at his still hugely swollen stomach that pushed his shirt up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCab,\u201d he said immediately, not enjoying the thought of walking back, if that was even possible in his condition. He kind of doubted it. \u201cCab definitely. It\u2019s too far for walking.\u201d Rachel nodded as she went to go flag one down. Puck helped a groaning Brody up and Brody would have been embarrassed to need help like that if he wasn\u2019t so full or that Puck would definitely draw far more attention than him. Brody was waddled, pulled, and nearly had to be carried out. Thankfully there was a taxi where Rachel was waiting and they got in. It was a really tight squeeze with Puck in there and Brody was frankly surprised that he fit. Then again, he was all but pushed into the side door so he was thankful when they got back home after dropping Rachel off at her place. Puck followed behind him as he stumblingly made his way in and opened the door. Heading to the bedroom, he called out \u201cmake yourself at home! I\u2019m going to take a nap, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d Brody got on the bed and as soon as he did, was out like a light. Puck looked around awkwardly and then decided to tuck Brody in before going to the couch and watching Brody\u2019s surprisingly huge flat-screen tv. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody groaned as sunlight flitted in through the blinds in his bedroom and hit him in the eyes.  He grabbed the bed sheets and rolled over in his bed, covering his face.  The sounds of the busy New York city streets filled his room; cars honking, New Yorkers cursing each other out as they drove through the busy streets.  These were all sounds that Brody had grown used to and at this point in his life were sounds that lulled him to sleep.  However, there was a new sound in Brody's life that he wasn't used to yet; the loud sounds of a 560 pound man wandering through his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody did his best to ignore the heavy footsteps in his living room but he couldn't help but think that the sounds were getting closer.  Brody buried his face into his pillow and rolled onto his stomach, trying his best to fall back to sleep.  Just as Brody was about to slip back into dreamland the door to his bedroom door opened up and Puck entered clad only in his boxers, \"Morning, Brodster!  Time for another big day of eating!\"<br>\r\nBrody groaned, \"Can't we do it later?  It's still early.\"  He mumbled into his pillow.<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right?\"  Puck asked as he was finally able to squeeze his enormous, bigger-than-the-doorframe-body into Brody's room, \"It's never to early to turn somebody's chiseled abs into a big, thick, sexy ball of fat.  Now get up!\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Brody protested, wrapping his arms around his pillow.<br>\r\nPuck raised an eyebrow before grabbing the comforter, \"C'mon Brody.  Get... UP!\"  Puck said, pulling the comforter off of him.<br>\r\n\"NO.\"  Brody protested again, refusing to wake up at such an ungodly hour for anything other than school or rehearsal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck stood there and looked over Brody's body; his body tight and muscular, his legs were strong but not thick (they reminded Puck of Mike Chang's legs before he fattened Mike up into the 480 pound dancer he is today), and his ass was tight and perky.  Puck licked his lips, excited to watch said ass grow wide, thick, juicy, and fat.<br>\r\nA deep chuckled escaped Puck's mouth, \"Okay, fine, sleep in.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Brody mumbled.<br>\r\n\"No problem.  You're right though, it is super late.  I think I'll head back to sleep too.\"  Puck said as he walked over to the side of Brody's bed he was sleeping on.  Puck patted his monster sized gut a few times before positioning himself and then letting his gigantic body fall onto the bed, completely covering Brody's body with his own.<br>\r\nBrody let out a loud gasp as he felt 560 pounds of muscle and fat suddenly surround his body.  He grunted and groaned as Puck adjusted himself so he was lying on top of Brody in the same position Brody was lying.<br>\r\n\"Night, little dude.\"  Puck said to Brody, a grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"Get... off...\"  Brody said as he struggled underneath Puck's massive frame, feeling his thick, solid, yet still somewhat soft belly mold around his strong back.<br>\r\n\"Only if you agree to get up so I can stuff that tiny gut of yours.\"  Puck said, grinning.<br>\r\n\"Ugggh... FINE!\"  Brody said before taking a deep breath of air once Puck had rolled off of him, \"What the hell, man?!\"  Brody yelled, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned and slapped his gut before jiggling it a few times, \"Just giving you some motivation!  What, you didn't like it?\"<br>\r\n\"NO!  Of course not!\"  Brody said, falling onto his back and laying there next to the mountain of a man who was going to make him equally as mountainous.<br>\r\nPuck grinned as he reached one of his massive hands down ran it across the huge erection that Brody had in his boxers, \"Really?  Cause this seems to think differently.\"<br>\r\n\"DUDE, WHAT THE HELL?\"  Brody said, covering his crotch, \"I'm not gay.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"  Puck said before getting up to his feet and standing with his back turned to Brody, \"You're bi.\"<br>\r\nBrody's eyes shout straight down to the insanely fat and round ass Puck had, \"No I'm not!\"<br>\r\nPuck turned around, \"Yeah you are.  I went through your phone and found all of the naughty pics you have of yourself with other guys.  Not to mention all of the texts you get from both men and woman asking for hookups.  Lemme guess, you're a male escort to pay for school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody sat there, speechless for a bit, before sighing, \"Yeah, I am.  I guess you think I'm some creepy sex pervert now, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Course not!\"  Puck said, a bug grin on his chubby face, \"Dude, any job that leads to sex is an amazing job.  You think I've fattened up all those guys and DIDN'T fuck them?  Whatever you gotta do to make money is fine by me, Brody.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Brody asked, honestly very happy with what he heard.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"  Puck said, \"I gotta question for ya.  Do you top or bottom?\"<br>\r\n\"Top, I'm not into bottoming.\"  Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.  I can work with that.  Good news Brody.  Once you pack on your first fifty pounds I'll let you take a ride on the Puck-asaurus's caboose.\"  Puck said, turning around and pulling his boxers down, revealing his enormous, fat, spherical ass.<br>\r\nBrody's face flushed red, \"Wha- what?\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me, Brodster.  Gain 50 pounds and you'll get to plow these huge cheeks.\"  Puck said, slapping his ass causing it to jiggle and bounce, \"Normally I'm only a top but mixing it up could be fun.\"<br>\r\nBrody reached out to grab it and Puck pulled his boxers back up, \"Nope.  Here's the deal.  Gain twenty-five pounds and you can touch it.  Then once you hit fifty you can fuck it; I'm being pretty generous here.\"<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"  Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Good!  Now lets get you stuffed!\"  Puck said as he walked towards the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody watched Puck's ass as he walked, enjoying how it swayed and bounced, and was so enthralled by it that he didn't even notice Puck getting stuck in the doorway again.<br>\r\n\"Little help?\"  Puck asked as he tried to get out.  Brody walked over and put his hands on Puck's wide back, pushing until he was lodged free.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  Puck said as he head for the kitchen to see what he could make for Brody.<br>\r\n\"No prob...\"  Brody said, not wanting to admit that seeing Puck's monstrous body trapped in his doorway was insanely sexy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So like, where are you staying?\" Brody asked Puck, watching him move about the kitchen as he got out supplies to make pancakes. Puck thought a moment.<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about getting an apartment outside the city and take the train in.\"<br>\r\n\"You could stay here,\" Brody offered. \"Could use extra rent and it will still be easier and more affordable and save on traveling everyday. It also will allow you to be nearby.\" Puck smiled at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be awesome. You really don't mind?\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't offer if I did,\" Brody said. \"It is just me at the moment though. I had been going to move in with Rachel but then Kurt and Santanna came and there wouldn't be much room with all of them since they're all space hogs from what I gather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, best not to interfere and feeding you will be much more convenient alone. I can't wait until you start getting bigger, you'll look fantastic with a gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, uh whatever, thanks,\" Brody said awkwardly. He still had to wrap his mind around the idea that he was going to be deliberately gaining weight and quite a bit of it too. He had never really been fat before in his life. A slight bit of stubborn pudge when he was younger that had persisted all the way till his first year of College at Nyada but he had never been really fat before, or whatever term they were going to use. Probably better to say beefy or husky, beefy definitely, than to imagine it fat. This was going to be a real different experience but he was an actor and good actors would expand their ability to include all sorts of diverse roles of which this was going to be one. Plus, if weight gain had to happen at some point, why not at a time when he was in control and would enjoy it? He just had to remember that and not think too hard that he was going to lose his wonderful abs that he had worked hard for. At least on the bright side he'll definitely be enjoying food more and well, Puck's proposal certainly was an intriguing one. Puck was right of course that he was bi. He was an actor and it would only make sense to enjoy both and why limit to one? He still wanted Rachel as his number 1 girl but if Puck was offering and Rachel was okay with it and she seemed to have been, that Puck could be his number 1 guy. Yeah Puck was dating someone else but Puck certainly didn't let that limit him and Brody assumed that anyone who would be with Puck would have to accept that Puck liked to spread around since he certainly wasn't quiet or secretive about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck was making pancakes while Brody pondered where Puck was going to sleep if he was going to stay with him. Possibly the couch though he couldn't imagine that being comfortable while an inflatable mattress sure wouldn't work. He'd offer the bed but he wasn't sure if the bed could support Puck's weight nor sure of how Puck would constantly get in and out with the smaller doorframe than the entrance to the apartment and Puck being too wide to get through easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could sleep on the floor,\" Puck said startling Brody. \"I don't really mind and I don't think I'll want to daily tangle with your door and more than necessary unless you want to knock it down and expand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't mind the floor?\" Brody asked. <br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm good wherever I lay. So, chocolate or blueberry pancakes?\" Puck asked, changing the subject.<br>\r\n\"Chocolate,\" Brody grinned. \"I love chocolate.\" <br>\r\n\"Who doesn't?\" Puck said back as he sprinkled chips in.<br>\r\n\"People that lack personality, a soul, or are allergic,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"All of those would be unfortunate, but especially the last one. That'd be like, awful.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Brody continued watching as Puck expertly flipped the pancakes over. <br>\r\n\"So, what made you decide to get so big?\" Brody asked curious.<br>\r\n\"Well it was in the second year of high school and well let's just say I got introduced to it by a woman named Lauren Zizes. She was a bit of a bitch really but she was absolutely right that I was tiny in comparison to her. She was a big girl, on the wrestling team, you know. I think she would have been on the football team if she had tried out for it but she never did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's...big.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was. I thought I was pretty strong then too but she knocked my clock and actually saved me from being locked in a porti-potty.\"<br>\r\n\"Eww,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was disgusting. I fell in love. Well, that was a mistake but she did make a very important lesson to me as she introduced me to the gaining world.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. She thought I was small and I'll be honest, compared to her and her family I was. I met her brother once and whoo he was big. I actually kind of want to see him now to compare sizes but that is beside the point. Anyhow yeah, I got shooken up by the sight of her family and decided to try follow their direction. We didn't last long as a couple but those first few times feeding...mmh I will be  forever grateful for that at least. We broke up and well I found ways to spread what I learned to others and I assume Rachel told you the rest. I have since then built a kind of feeding empire helping people all over the world.\" Brody was surprised when Puck stopped flipping. He had been so interested in Puck's story that he hadn't noticed that Puck was finishing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck put two plates down in front of Brody, each with their own stack of five. \"I think ten pancakes should be good right? If you need anymore, I'll be making some extra for me. Syrup?\" Puck asked holding out the syrup bottle and when Brody nodded, squeezed a generous amount out over both and topping them off with butter and whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you?\" Brody said a bit unsure. \"Those do look rather nice. But I don't know if I can eat all that...\" Puck grabbed Brody with surprising speed.<br>\r\n\"You want that role right?\" Brody nodded. \"Then work for it. I know you can and of course it's going to be hard but that won't stop you now will it?\"<br>\r\n\"No?\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Say it like you mean it,\" Puck demanded. <br>\r\n\"NO I won't be stopped.\" <br>\r\n\"Who's big and bad?\"<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"Well, actually that'd be me but that works too,\" Puck smirked. \"Anyhow, who did better than they thought las night?\"<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Brody said sounding more confident.<br>\r\n\"And who is going to finish all those pancakes?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Brody said, sounding confident. He staggered then said it again. \"I am.\" Brody took the knife and fork which had appared in Puck's hand, and started cutting them as he got ready to eat his big breakfast. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Brody took a bite of his pancakes, he was absolutely stunned by how good they were and for a moment thought he had died and gone to pancake heaven. \"Oh my God,\" Brody said staring at the pancakes, \"these are fantastic. The best pancakes I've ever had and that's saying something. How did you learn to make such good pancakes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I often had to cook breakfast for me and my sister so I got a lot of practice,\" Puck said from across the table. \"You think they're that good?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do. I'm in love with them. They're so good, especially with those chocolate chips.\" Brody eagerly shoved another forkful into his mouth before looking around, sensing something missing. \"Hey, wasn't Rachel coming for breakfast or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she called earlier while you were still sleeping to apologize and say she couldn't make it since there was a pop morning exam or something that Cassandra wanted them to do so she had to hurry on over. She also sends her love and wishes you the best of luck.\" Puck rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Cassie, yeah, she loved to do that. She's an awesome dance teacher but kind of crazy. That was the hardest part for me with the random tests spread out at the weirdest times and never knowing when she would assign one. We once did a really complex line number at two in the morning for god only knows what reason. Oh and tell Rachel I love her too and not to let Cassie drive her insane.\" Brody smiled and Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already taken care of. Anyhow, she'll be back later or something so you can go back to eating.\" Puck confidently leaned back in his chair and Brody had a flash of fear for the safety of his chair before Puck straightened back out again. Brody was actually surprised they weren't flattened yet when Puck sat down but that could change at any moment so he had better continue eating his heaven bound pancakes before Puck got restless or something and did flatten them. Not to mention, those pancakes were to die for and why exactly was he still thinking instead of doing? Shaking his head a moment, Brody dived back into his pancakes with gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck who had stopped eating his pancakes to check on Brody, resumed but didn't take his eyes off the sight before him as Brody happily shoveled in pancake bits with abandon. There was always something amazing and awe-inspiring about someone enjoying their food and it was one of Puck's favorite parts, though really, the others were his favorites as well. This was special though and he kind of missed it last night since he had been really hungry and distracted himself that he couldn't watch Brody as closely as he would have liked. Puck listened to the little grunts, moans, and noises of appreciation which shot Brody up into one of Puck's favorites to feed, even after only one session. There was just something about the way Brody did it that really made it fun...not as much as with Dave or himself who were still number one but damn, Brody was talented and no wonder Rachel liked him. Puck thought that Brody should also consider doing movies as well as Broadway, he certainly had the face and voice for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy around pancake seven Brody started slowing down. His eyes were getting that awesome glazy look as he movements went down to a crawl as he struggled to scrape up bite after bite. Puck was actually moderately impressed since although he had hoped Brody would have been able to do more on his own, at his stage he had actually done better than most people and with less complaining. The lack of complaining in general was especially commendable since although Brody definitely voiced doubts and hesitations as they all did before and undoubtedly will after, he didn't utter a single word during his actual period of eating the pancakes. Almost everyone complained at some point during a meal but not Brody. He had all the makings of a good feedee and Puck was definitely going to enjoy helping this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his chair, Puck moved to sit down next to Brody who definitely looked unhappy. \"Hey, you did an awesome job, I'm going to help you now,\" Puck said. Brody groaned as he leaned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't finish...pancakes...too fluffy and chocolaty\" he ground out, clutching his stomach. Puck definitely understand as they were very fluffy and definitely expanded, especially with chocolate. But he had faith that Brody would eventually finish as he did so well already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can so I'm helping you,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Please don't,\" Brody pleaded. Puck ignored him as he placed his hands on Brody's stomach and started rubbing like he had after dinner the night before. With all the food intake from the night before and the expansiveness of Puck's pancakes, it had expanded out and was back into a stuffed ball on his lap. Rubbing it, Puck with the other hand fed piece by piece into Brody's mouth who resisted and tried to bite him but was unable to move. Puck rolled his eyes as he dodged which was something he got good at as everyone got good at biting. Wheedling, dealing, and using underhanded tricks, he fed the last couple of pancakes to Brody who was alternatively pleading or glaring death rays at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, just a few more,\" Puck encouraged. \"You're doing much better than I thought.\" \"Hey, you are one of the best I've ever had so keep it up.\"<br>\r\n\"You have to for the show.\" \"You're a real man, not some reluctant pussy so eat like one.\" \"I can't wait to have you,\" Puck wiggled his eyebrows sexily on that last one and Brody rolled his eyes though was admittedly intrigued. It distracted him long enough for Puck to slap in the last pieces of pancake and force it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, all done,\" Puck said proudly and in relief. Brody blinked and looked down to see the empty plates. \"See?\" Puck asked. \"I knew you could do it.\" He laughed at Brody's stunned face. \"I know, it is amazing isn't it?\" Brody nodded and then burped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP,\" exploded from within Brody and he flushed red while Puck laughed.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Brody murmured and Puck shook his head. <br>\r\n\"It's all cool dude, only natural. By the way, nice one. It's time to help you up.\" Puck got up and picked Brody up as if he weighed nothing and carried him to the couch. \"I'm going to be make plans for lunch and I guess you could watch tv or play video games or something while I decide what to do next. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you...can you rub my stomach some more?\" Brody asked, embarrassed but hopeful. Puck shrugged as he sat on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd love to,\" Puck said as he started. Brody definitely was surprising him because it was rare he got asked so soon. Most people were disturbed and in pain and it took a number of sessions before they got over the embarrassment of asking but Brody asked right away. Placing his hands on Brody's gut, Brody leaned back and sighed in relief as Puck started rubbing. Grinning, Puck knew that he was really going to especially enjoy bulking up Brody Weston and if he continued to act like this, despite any protests to the contrary, Puck couldn't help but suspect that Brody was interested as well, unconsciously or consciously. </span></div></div>",

He yawned and adjusted himself on the couch, lying down and resting his defined legs on Puck's massive, chunky thighs, though there wasn't much room - Puck's gargantuan belly took up almost all of his lap.

They're expanding some of the classrooms to make more room and since all of my classes were in the west wing I get a week off.\"<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Sweet!  Why don't you get some rest while I straighten up and clean from breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, dude..\"  Brody said as he started to nod off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours went by and when Brody's eyes flickered opened again he yawned and sat up, scratching the back of his head.  He could tell Puck turned the heat up, though it was obvious Puck didn't really need it, and the house was nice and warm as opposed to the crisp NY winter outside.  Brody looked over the couch and saw his small kitchen completely clean with all the dishes put away.  Brody flopped back onto the couch and grabbed the remote from the coffee table, flicking through channels until he landed on some reruns of a sitcom he enjoyed.  His eyes drifted down to the cable box that said it was 11 AM.  Brody noticed the blanket Puck must have put on him and pulled it up to his waist, leaving his still bloated but shrinking belly exposed.  As he watched he mindlessly stroked his new growing tummy and his focus drifted a bit from the tv to the sound of the shower running.  \"Puck must be showering...\"  Brody thought, letting the idea of Puck washing that big, beautiful, sexy body of his enter his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody felt himself grow hard at the idea of Puck's strong hands running across his enormous pecs, lathering them in soap before drifting down to the wide, beautiful expanse of his gut.  Brody imagined the way Puck's strong yet soft muscle gut jiggled and bounced and Puck cleaned each and every inch of it - and then there was that big, beautiful, fat ass Puck had.  Brody was close to heading into to his room take care of his problem when he heard the shower turn off and he knew he didn't have long to hide his erection.  Brody adjusted it so the waistband of his boxers held it to his upper thigh so it wasn't noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or two passed and Puck walked out in a clean pair of boxer briefs which Brody was amazed fit Puck, \"I mean this as compliment when I say that I had no idea they made boxer briefs that big.\"<br>\r\nPuck chuckled, \"They don't.  These were custom made so I can grow without worry of buying new boxers.  They have an elastic waist band so that they fit my constantly growing waist and they're made with elastic in the fabric so they fit over my tree trunk thighs and fat ass.\"<br>\r\n\"And what a fat ass it is.\"  Brody said, half-jokingly.  Puck turned around and gave it a hard smack and Brody couldn't stop watching it jiggle and bounce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck waddled over to his suitcase, which was by the door still, and dug through his clothes before pulling out his outfit for the day.  Brody watches as Puck struggled to get into a pair of skin tight denim jeans that Brody could tell were close to tearing.  Puck's huge beefy, chunky body jiggled a bit as he struggled to get them over his thighs, and once he did, continued to struggle to get them over his monster sized ass.  Once Puck's enormous, spherical ass was tightly packed into the jeans, Puck took a deep breath before struggling to get the button close.  It took a minute but Puck got the button into the clasp and he let out a big sigh of relief as he belly lurched and hung happily over his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that hurt?\" Brody asked, concerned for the tightness around Puck's waist.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"  Puck said, grabbing his shirt, \"The pants fit me about 100 pounds ago and I've gotten used to the feeling of super tight clothing so it doesn't hurt at all.  Plus I love the feeling of bursting out of my old clothes.  It means I've gotten bigger!\"<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't the button have popped off by now?  100 pounds is a LOT of weight.\"  Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"It should have but my gut is keeping it in place.  The second I sit down it'll pop right off.\"  Puck said a she pulled on a graphic V-neck shirt that only covered the top of Puck's gut no matter how hard he pulled.  Brody could see the seams were close to tearing on this shirt from how his pecs and arms strained the fabric, \"I save all my currently fitting clothes for when I go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\"  Puck said, fully dressed, \"What do you want for lunch?\"<br>\r\n\"How are you at grilled cheese?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Brody, you shouldn't have asked that.  One grilled cheese buffet coming up.\"  Puck said as he waddled to the small kitchen that barely contained him and went to work.<br>\r\nAs Puck cooked Brody peeked over the back of the couch and watched as Puck's massive, sexy, 560 pound body went to work.  Even in skin tight jeans Puck ass jiggled and bounced as he moved, making grilled cheese after grilled cheese.  At one point Puck could tell Brody was staring and purposefully flexed his arm, sending a massive tear through his sleeve.  After that Puck flexed his whole body, ripping his V neck to shreds which drove Brody crazy!  Brody's eyes followed Puck's wide, muscular back and he loved it was both muscular but had adorably sexy fat rolls.  Brody constantly found his eyes drifting back to his favorite part of Puck's body, that gloriously bountiful ass of Puck's.  It was just so big and round and juicy it drove Brody mad and made him even more determined to gain that first 50 pounds!  Puck had his back turned to Brody the whole time, which did make Brody sad because he didn't get to see his second favorite part of Puck's body, his huge gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody wasn't ready to start flirting, and he knew Puck wasn't opposed to groping, but for now Brody was content with just watching as his massive new chef, feeder, and life coach showed of his sexy body.<br>\r\nAn hour passed before Puck spoke, \"Grilled cheese is done!  I figured since you did such a good job at breakfast I'd up the portions.  If you could eat 10 pancakes then 20 grilled cheeses should be a no sweat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although he had finally almost recovered from breakfast, Brody was still skeptical about eating 20 sandwiches but he shrugged and kept his mouth shut. He might as well give it a go and surely they couldn't be thicker than the pancakes and he had somehow managed to finish them with Puck's help though he had eaten seven of Puck's pancakes on his own. That was amazing in of itself so Brody was happy and Puck was fun to be around so he could definitely see how Puck convinced all those other guys to intentionally or otherwise gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck smiled as he put the plate of grilled cheeses in front of him. \"Here you go Brodster, dig in and enjoy.\" Normally Brody would have been irritated to being called a nickname like that but with Puck being so kind and helpful it was hard to get mad plus it sounded pretty cool coming from Puck's mouth so if Puck wanted to call him that then fine. Picking up a sandwich Brody bit into it and smiled as the cheese melted into his mouth. Seriously, was there nothing Puck couldn't make that didn't taste amazing? Chewing and swallowing he gave a thumbs up in Puck's direction. \"This is really good. I actually doubt there isn't anything you couldn't make that doesn't taste amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that, there are a few things that I have no idea how to make...\" Puck started, \"...but when it comes to staples then yeah, I got a lot of experience making those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all modest are you?\" Brody said half-joking and half-serious. Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"If it's true then its true.\" <br>\r\n\"True that,\" Brody nodded as he started on his next sandwich. \"Are you going to sit down anytime soon?\" He asked wondering why Puck was still standing.<br>\r\n\"I will but I'm just waiting for the right time,\" Puck explained.<br>\r\n\"The right time for what?\" <br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Puck said in a mysterious voice and Brody rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay, whatever then.\" Brody ate in silence his grilled cheese, letting out occasional moans and smacking of lips in appreciation that made Puck shift. While feeding generally was erotic and a turn-on, Brody was somehow really raising the notch just from the way he ate and appreciated his food and Puck wanted him. He wanted him bad and it was still early in the training and usually it took a lot more to raise Puck's interest. If Brody was this awesome now, Puck couldn't imagine how sexy he'd be with added weight. No wonder Brody was popular if even his voice or the way he eats already got him excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody was doing a good job as he tore into those delicious grilled cheeses and he was glad that he could finally let loose after years of diet and exercise and have an excuse to do so without feeling guilty or regretful about it. Well, mostly not guilty or regretful, he was going to miss his well-trained gorgeous six-pack and he could only imagine what some people like Cassie would do when she saw what he was doing. She'd be happy about him getting a role and understanding why he had to but he couldn't imagine her reaction which could be anything, many of the outcomes unpleasant or violent. Brody also wondered about Rachel. Sure she seemed okay with it, more than okay and all for it considering she brought Puck over in the first place and she didn't seem to mind but he still couldn't help but worry if he would get too big or if she didn't know what she was getting into and he disgusted her. Then there were his clients...damn, he didn't think about that. He couldn't afford to lose his clients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck, I have to ask...what happens if I lose my clients?\" Brody was starting to panic. \"What if I get to big or disgusting for them...\" Puck began to laugh at the high pitched panicky tone in Brody's voice. \"This is serious!\" Brody whined. \"That is a lot of my livelihood when I'm not acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I understand,\" Puck patted Brody on the shoulder. \"Undoubtedly you will lose some but you'd be surprised at just how many people actually do like big guys and the thing with six-packs I've found is that they're nice if you have them, there's no denying that they're certainly well appreciated, but in many cases if you have enough personality and charisma, people will still want you. You have those things and actually, although you lose a subgroup, you gain another subgroup that I've found even bigger of people who do appreciate guys with a bit more mass to them like me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have more than a little mass, you're a freaking planet.\" Puck shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that did certainly change the population of people who were interested. Most people are terrified with the exception of my clients and I don't blame them cause I am pretty big and its mainly guys now which is okay as I generally with a few exceptions prefer guys who get it and are far less demanding and stressful than girls and while I love Rachel, she's demanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're telling me,\" Brody said. \"I love her but sometimes she just needs to chill out.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. Trust me Brody, you won't be losing much business. If anything, I rather guess you to get more since you're already hot and you won't believe how much appeal it is for hot guys to gain weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody shrugged. \"We'll see. I hope you're right.\"<br>\r\n\"I always am,\" Puck shrugged. \"It's one of my many talents.\"<br>\r\n\"But that time you tried to steal an atm and drove into a pool?\" Brody asked. \"I heard that story from Rachel.\" Puck winced. <br>\r\n\"Okay fine, not my proudest or smartest moment I admit that. Every other time I'm generally right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody thumped his chest and burped, sighing with relief. \"Excuse me,\" he said and Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"I don't mind at all. Do all you want.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good. I'm kind of done now though.\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"But you only ate 10 sandwiches,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm still kind of full from breakfast. I had been feeling better but now I'm not.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, a few more?\" Puck pleaded. <br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Brody said. \"But you can have them since I don't think you had anything yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Puck said sitting down. \"A teaching lesson so pay attention.\" Brody rolled his eyes but leaned back, attentive his eyes flickering to Puck's strained jeans and back to his face. Grinning, Puck took a bite out of a sandwich and then exploded eating at a ridiculous pace. Puck was a competitive eater and it shocked Brody at how fast Puck gobbled down two sandwiches in less time than it took to comprehend what was just happening. In way too short of a time he had eaten all ten sandwiches leaving Brody in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Brody said, unable to control the awe in his voice. \"That was impressive.\" Suddenly there was a creaking and then a snapping sound and suddenly Puck's gut spilled forward over his lap, no longer able to be held back by the pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck just happened?\" asked a confused Brody.<br>\r\n\"My pants which I was going to retire broke like I hoped they would.\" Puck said. Puck looked around before laughing. Brody raised a questioning eyebrow before looking down and couldn't stop himself from laughing. Puck's pant button had landed directly in the center of Brody's empty plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's...that's funny,\" Brody said clutching his stomach which twinged and he winced remembering how stuffed he was. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it only took forever. You must be my good luck charm.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure that I had nothing to do with it,\" Brody said skeptically, his eyes roaming over Puck's massive gut.<br>\r\n\"It was your sandwiches so I should thank you,\" Puck grinned. <br>\r\n\"Well, okay then, yeah.\" Brody said. He looked back over at Puck's gut and he walked over and looked closely. <br>\r\n\"You do know I wouldn't mind if you wanted to rub and touch it,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Ah...can I?\" Brody asked uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I wouldn't mind,\" Puck said leaning back, thrusting his massive belly forward and invited Brody to rub and squeeze. Uncertain at first, Brody could no longer resist the temptation he had been feeling for over a day and speechlessly rubbed, utterly astonished and amazed by the absolute girth, heft, and feel of that massive sphere known as Puck's gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the fact that surely it must be a clich\u00e9 by now, Brody couldn't help but be utterly astounded as he rubbed Puck's massive gut. Never in his life had he ever thought that he'd enjoy touching someone so incredibly large yet here he was, rubbing his hands all over Puck and he was loving it. The way his arms couldn't stretch the circumference of the massive ball stomach and got lost in there. It was also a very interesting mix of soft and unyielding he could not figure out since his fingers could first sink in and then suddenly feel like hitting stone. The sounds of appreciation Puck was making as Brody massaged him got him probably more turned on than he ever felt before in his life, other than Rachel's singing and Brody definitely could understand why Puck was so eager to help. This was...this was awesome. Feeling inspired, he licked up Puck's chest, teasing with his tongue getting an even deeper grown from Puck and boosting his confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I am still nervous about many things but I am beginning to really see the appeal in why you like being large and helping others be the same. There is something...appealing about it, especially with that confidence of yours. I like that in a person and with a body so incredibly muscular and big well...wow I don't even know what to say but damn I want that. I never knew fat could even be attractive but the way you do such an incredibly muscle-fat build is amazing. You're one heck of a guy-or four, or however many it would take to match you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody,\" Puck said opening one eye from his relaxed state. \"Awesome speech, not entirely sure what it was that you all said what with you doing that thing with your tongue which was incredible by the way, but thanks and its not going any further until we reach your first goal. Though continue making-out that was good. I never met someone who was just as experienced as I am.\" Suddenly Puck checked his watch and sighed as he got up. \"Or maybe not, got to get dinner ready. I don't even know where the time has gone.\" Brody pouted but smirked as Puck got up with a titanic thrust and waddled off to the kitchen and Brody took the opportunity to give a swat on the butt, causing Puck to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no touching, off-limits for a while yet, though look all you like,\" Puck said as he shook causing Brody to stare. It was getting more and more interesting as time went on and Brody kind of wanted it now like Puck probably dug into succulent pies which probably helped make it. Shifting his eyes up he focused on Puck's back before shaking his head and looking away before he tried to jump him which would not end well for him, Instead he tried to think of Rachel which did not help at all as it turned into Puck, Rachel, and him having some very kinky fun. She'd probably enjoy that right? He'd probably bet on it because even though a lot of the times she seemed innocent and pure, there were times when she just surprised the hell out of him like when she did the sexy dance...this was not helping at all. Brody ran to the bathroom where he beat out his frustrations most thoroughly, hoping he could pass the first goal soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brody came back, Puck has pasta boiling in a massive pot and Brody sniffed the air appreciatively. \"Smells good,\" he said sitting down. <br>\r\n\"Its linguini with alfredo sauce,\" Puck told him. Brody was about to tell him no sauce before he remembered that of course there was going to be sauce. He was no longer really on a diet that restricted so he could have all the alfredo slathered pasta he could handle, that amount yet to be determined. It was an incredibly thick, creamy, and heavy sauce after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Rachel call?\" Brody asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's going out tonight but she will be over to check up on us tomorrow and she is curious to see how we're getting along and how progress is going.\"<br>\r\n\"Well okay then,\" Brody said. <br>\r\n\"So here we go,\" Puck pulled out two massive plates of pasta and put them on the table, drowning them in sauce leaving Brody to wonder just how much Puck made or where he got such massive dishes from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know I had dishes that big,\" Brody said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I found them buried somewhere in a cabinet so yeah, it works. I wasn't expecting them either earlier,\" Puck said. \"Now how about we dig in and fill that tiny belly of yours up shall we? You should probably either find an old shirt you don't mind getting stains on or go without though because this can get messy.\" Brody nodded as that made sense as he got up to look in his room for an old shirt he didn't care for. He could go without but he wasn't ready for that stage and he could use a visual cue for inspiration seeing the changes. Also, there was just one button up that quite frankly he just couldn't stand and would be an excellent tool to measure up with and give hope to destroying the darn thing. Putting it on, he was surprised to it already being a bit snugger than he remembered. Granted, it had been a few years since he had last worn it so maybe it was nothing. Either way, he was ready for battle which was what meals with Puck were. A battle to eat and not throw up or explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back, he sat down and nodded to Puck as he dug into his pasta, already anticipating but nonetheless blown away by how amazingly good it was. Shoveling as much as he could into his mouth, he dripped stains everywhere which while he was normally a very careful eater, it was amazingly hard to resist and he didn't exactly care about ruining the shirt. Gulping and munching, Brody tried to consume as much as he could before the feeling of fullness could get to him from the thick heavy sauce and he was doing a good job at it, moving at a fast pace. He almost even rivaled Puck at the moment which was a surprise to both though Puck still chugged through it way easier and Brody was only seconds away from finishing the first plate with Puck. That got an appreciative smile as Puck ladled more pasta onto their plates and they went back. Brody couldn't maintain the pace with Puck for long, dropping far behind a mouthful on the second plate but considering how big the plates were that were more like three or four servings on regular plates, it had been amazing he had kept pace at all the first time. Of course, Brody was already feeling full, his stomach pressing against his tight shirt and he unbuttoned, freeing himself with a sigh as he struggled on, trying to fit as much as he could into his stuffed full stomach, rubbing in between and panting and burping. Puck finished the second plate and was already on his third and Brody eventually gave up after finishing what was another half on his plate, unable to go on but impressed nonetheless. Puck whistled a moment, pausing before continuing and Brody watched in awe as Puck kept going on for a while longer with ease before getting into trouble around plate 5 or 6. After that, they both sat there satisfied, rubbing their aching full bloated bellies and unable to move further than that. </span></div></div>",

He looked at the clock by the door and saw that it was around 10 AM but it right after that he smelt the delicious smells of Puck's world-famous pancakes.  Brody got up and walked over, his eyes washing over the massive man standing in his kitchen, \"Those smell as delicious as you look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck turned around and was about to make a snarky but sexy comment when he got the biggest smile on his face, \"DUDE, LOOKE AT YOUR GUT!\"<br>\r\nBrody looked down and his eyes widened.  What used to be the location of rock hard abs was now the home to a small but obviously growing belly.  A big grin spread on Brody's face, \"WE DID IT!!  Let's go check my weight!!\"  Brody headed for the bathroom in his bedroom where he kept the scale but Puck stayed behind.  There was no way he could even fit through the small frame of Brody's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom Brody hopped onto the scale and looked over his beginner belly, \"15 POUNDS!\"  He yelled from the bathroom.  He made his way back into the kitchen just as Puck was setting a stack of 15 pancakes on his plate, \"Each of these are pound so lets see you eat your own new weight.\"  Puck said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody was feeling good and encouraged by his progress. It had only been a few days and already he put on 15 pounds! It was going to be both harder and easier in the future but for now he was just excited and excited about being excited. Rubbing his gut, he mused on how only days ago he had six pack abs to be envious of. They weren't from being thin either and while he would not say he had been super bulky, he was definitely more muscled than most with his dancing, karate, and other physical activities. He squeezed and rolled a bit of new flab between his fingers. Had this always been so much fun? It had seemed awful when he was younger and it probably was. No kid should ever want to be fat and he would honestly question the sanity of someone who suggested it. As an adult however? This was way more fun than he had ever realized and he had to thank Puck for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This did not mean letting go though,' Brody thought as he got ready. He was seeing the fun of a belly but he still definitely wanted, and needed, to be strong. He now thought Puck's approach was the best and Brody was surprised it had never been apparent to him before. Strong with a nice big belly, friendly, capable. Not a useless slug like those who just got fat and didn't do anything, Brody needed to be active. It also wasn't like having a six pack either since one didn't have to worry about what to eat or when. It really was stressful and he had never realized stressful it was until he got that letter and Rachel brought Puck in. Strength and size though had the best of both worlds...like Puck. Of course, Puck might have gone overkill since he was monstrously big. Quite a turn on but rarely practical but the principle was sound. Plus Puck looked very, very hot filling up the space in his apartment and getting stuck in the door...but what on earth was he thinking? He should be eating those delicious pancakes that were calling to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate pancakes?\" he asked Puck, tying a bib around his neck, one that ironically said 'kiss the cook.' He sure wouldn't mind doing that...or some other things. Puck grinned and nodded as he sat down and one again Brody was left to marvel how his furniture managed to not be squished under the beast. They were definitely worth the money he and his parents had spent on them. The smell of chocolate was now beginning to tickle his nose and Brody inhaled with a sigh of pleasure as he examined the stack. Okay, fifteen pancakes. That was more than twice what he had managed to eat on his own the last time and half a time again what Puck had somehow managed to stuff into him. Brody didn't particularly expect to beat the record but he hoped to at least impress Puck and himself with improvement. Shaking off all further thoughts, Brody dove into the pancakes with ferocity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely ate quickly but at the same time made sure to savor the taste of flying away to chocolate heaven. Brody couldn't resist the moans of rapture and prayer that flew from his lips in between bites or the constantly running monologue in his head that essentially went 'oh my god chocolate, I love chocolate, this chocolate is so good, fuck I love chocolate, Puck and Rachel wrapped in chocolate...' and he lost his mind a bit as he scarfed down the fluffy as sin pancakes. Time was in a haze and Brody was a machine until the chocolate pancake high he was on was shattered when the first pain signals reached his brain that he was reaching his limits and he was forced to slow down. He was panting and he turned to see Puck watching intently, panting a little too but for a much different reason. Groaning, Brody put his fork down and rubbed his stomach which had vastly expanded with every bite of those fluffy miracle wonders. Already it was bigger than he was used to ever before, sitting in his lap and peaking cautiously from underneath the bib. He rubbed it fretfully as he tried to not throw up and he already missed his the chocolate pancake high that had ended far too early for him. There were only a few pancakes left on the plate, three of them, but it felt like an open infinite chasm as Brody tried to keep the nausea down. Puck scooted the chair over next to Brody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Puck asked concerned. <br>\r\n\"Never...never better,\" Brody wheezed.<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can finish?\" Puck asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Not really,\" Brody laughed deprecatingly and winced as he rubbed his stomach. \"I'm fuller than full, fuller than like ever, even in the past couple days.\" Puck raised his eyebrows impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't go soft do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I always go hard when I want to achieve something. However, I don't think I can finish those last remaining pancakes.\" Brody let out a massive burp and clutched his stomach again. \"Yeah, I think I'll go lie down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I rub you and feed you the rest?\" Puck said. \"At least as far as you can go. I know it kills you to give up.\" Puck also figured there was no way he was going to turn down a belly rub from him and he was proved right as Brody rubbed his head a moment before giving in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just a little bit more,\" he conceded. Puck rubbed him with pleasure as Brody leaned back. With one hand, carefully alternating every now and then, Puck cut up the rest of the pancakes into little sizable bites and popped them into Brody's mouth who seemed only semi-conscious at this point, in full thrall of Puck's touch. Puck had to admit, he was both impressed and a bit unnerved at how quickly Brody fell in thrall to his massages and while most people generally did sooner or later, nobody enjoyed it quite so much or conked under to let him do his thing as quickly as Brody did. Shrugging his shoulders, Puck continued to feed Brody who didn't even seem to notice, or if he did the effect was small enough that Puck's ministrations quickly soothed it over, the bite sized pieces and in short work, the last three pancakes were gone and Brody had managed to have eaten every bite. Looking down, Puck was amused to see that Brody now seemed fast asleep like a babe. Puck grinned as he moved his hands under him for support and with hardly any trouble, bent his legs and heaved up and carried Brody to the couch like he weighed nothing. Turning Brody on his side, Puck feasted his eyes on his new favorite student who learned well. Only a few days of protestations and Brody was already on board with the plan and enjoying it. Brody was an amazing natural gainer and learner. Already after only a few days his rock hard abs were already being replaced by a sexy growing gut which was beautifully stuffed at the moment. He looked beautiful lying there and Puck sat on the ground in awe. He could only imagine what Brody would look like in the weeks to come. For now though, Puck had to get ready for the rest of the day. Laying a kiss on that tummy (he couldn't resist, it just begged for it), Puck got up to make some phone calls and to set things up for the next portion. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A half hour went by and Puck emerged from the bathroom after a nice warm shower.  He was wearing his massive boxers, as there were no towels big enough to reach around his massive 60 inch waist, but was completely dry.  His enormous gut covered his crotch easily and hung down to his mid-thighs.  The gargantuan almost-naked Puck waddled over to Brody, who was still fast asleep on the couch and Puck nudged him with his muscular thigh, \"Hey, wake up, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody groaned before looking up, getting a face full of Puck-belly and grinning, \"Hey, whats up?\"<br>\r\n\"We're heading out to lunch.  Rachel is busy so she'll meet us at the mall after.\"  Puck said before he went to get dressed.  Brody admired the shake and jiggle of the fattest ass he'd ever seen as he did so.<br>\r\n\"Awww, okay.\"  He said before getting up and heading for the shower.  After a quick shower and doing his hair, Brody hurried from the bathroom to his bedroom to get dressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the doorknob when he heard Puck's voice, \"I already got your clothes.\" he said.  Brody turned to look at Puck and saw that he was already dressed for the day.  Puck was wearing a skin tight white long sleeve shirt that was tucked into his jeans (though Brody was amazed that Puck owned a shirt that covered the massive overhang of his gut).  Over that was a gray skin tight v-neck sweater that, unlike his white shirt, didn't cover his belly so Puck's clothed overhanging gut was on full view.  On top of that Puck wore his thick military green winter jacket, as it had started snowing outside, as well as his big fabric mohawk beanie and fingerless gloves.<br>\r\n\"Really?,\"  Brody asked, \"I thought you couldn't get that fat sexy body of your in and out of my room without getting stuck in the doorframe?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me I did get stuck.  It was a miracle I could even get out of that skinny ass door.\"  Puck said as he rubbed his gut.  Brody could feel himself getting hard at the thought of seeing Puck stuck in his doorframe again, a kink he was starting to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, now that your gut is starting to show progress, I want you to wear this.\"  Puck said, holding up a small white button up shirt, \"You're gonna end up destroying a LOT of these as you get bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Look forward to it.\"  Brody said as he dropped his towel and put on the boxers Puck had set out for him.  He threw on white tank top first before putting on the tight button up.  Brody had some trouble getting the buttons on and once they were connected you could see them visibly strain around his new belly.  Brody threw on his black winter jacket and a pair of brown khakis and some boots before styling his hair.  Once the two were ready they headed out, though Brody did have to push Puck out because he had gotten stuck in the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed down the stairs to the busy NYC sidewalk, snow falling all around them, and made their way to the subway.  Once there they board the F train, which Puck specifically chose as a fun reference to their weight gaining, and the two headed off.  The subway car was packed so Puck and Brody were crammed very close to each other, but neither minded.  Brody loved the way Puck's enormous gut felt pressed up against his entire torso and how it jiggled and bounced as the train did and Puck enjoyed the feeling of having Brody's smaller body pressed against his massive frame.  Eventually the train got off and the two entered Grand Central Terminal.<br>\r\n\"What are we doing here?\"  Brody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch, remember?  We gotta stuff that gut to max capacity if we're gonna get you clothes that'll fit.\"  Puck said and the two of them went to Frankies Dogs on the Go, a famous hot dog restaurant in GCT.  Brody grabbed a booth as Puck walked over and waited in line to place the order.  After a few minutes Puck came back carrying four trays, balancing two on his arms, and set them down in front of Brody, \"I made sure to get the dogs that'll really pack on those pounds: Frankies cheesy dogs.\"  Puck said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked down at the four trays and counted his meal; Puck had bought him 16 hot dogs, all topped with cheddar and mozzarella cheese, and 8 double twist pretzels, each one smothered in melted cheese.  There were also 4 bags of chips and a large root beer.  Puck sat down next to Brody, his massive 560 pound frame squeezed into the boot so tightly that his enormous gut pressed into the table.  Brody blushed a bit, \"Uhh, theres umm... room on the other side?\"<br>\r\n\"I know, \" Puck said, \"but with my bulk in the way you have no choice but to finish all of it cause I refuse to move until you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody took a deep breath and started chowing down, blowing through the first few hot dogs with ease.  After hot dog number 5 Brody started to slow down, his stomach bloating out a bit and getting full but he pushed on.  After around hot dog 14 Brody groaned and rubbed his bloated gut.  Puck grinned, \"Let me.\"  He said as he picked up the last two hot dogs and stuffed the first one into Brody's mouth.  Brody protested but Puck pushed the whole thing in, amazed by Brody's lack of a gag reflex (that'll come in handy) and watched as the stuffed college student chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n\"Puck... you have to... be so forc-\"  Brody's words were cut out as Puck stuffed the entirety of the long hot dog down Brody's throat, loving how thick beefy fingers felt in in his mouth before pulling out and watching Brody eat.  Brody gave up the protests after that and sat back as Puck force fed him the 8 massive pretzels and the entire 4 bags of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody moaned loudly, his belly stuffed as much as it had ever been before, as Puck lifted up the drink.  Brody wrapped his sexy lips around it and started drinking.  He could physically feel his gut straining and growing as he drank and he soon as he finished the drink and pulled his lips off Brody felt his button up shirt burst open and heard three buttons ping against the seats on the other side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck grinned, \"Atta-boy!\"  He said as he patted Brody's bloated gut, \"Now you wait here while I get my food.\"  Puck said as he waddled off.  Brody sat back, rubbing his gut as he waited and in no time Puck returned with the same order Brody had but twice as much.  Brody just sat back and watched as Puck devastated the 32 hot dogs, 16 pretzels, and 8 bags of chips.  The massive man washed it all down with his soda and smiled, \"Mmmm, that was good.  If we weren't on such a tight schedule I'd go back for seconds.\"  Puck said. \"We'll leave when you're feeling up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make it...\"  Brody said.  Puck shrugged, wiggled out of his extremely tight booth, and the two hopped back on the train as it departed for the Manhattan Mall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Riding the train was slightly nauseating after that but by some miracle Brody didn't throw up. He had no idea how Puck could stand so calmly but maybe he was just so heavy he was like a boulder in the middle of a stream forcing the water to go around, just like getting on the train. People couldn't help but look over since Puck was kind of hard to miss and whenever he did he smirked at them which was kind of funny, especially the people who were shaking their heads in disgust or the people who giggled and liked it. Brody was especially partial to the latter group, especially those who took pictures which Puck made silly faces at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they got off and went in towards the center where Rachel was waiting. She didn't see them at first since she had her back turned and was talking on the phone so Puck picked her up in a giant bear hug which caused her to scream at first but then turned into a laugh when she realized it wasn't some stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck!!!\" she squealed loudly in excitement and Puck laughed as Santanna's voice came swearing from the phone. It was still on and Santanna was nearly deafened by the shrieking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puck! God damn it I thought she was being attacked and was getting ready to come on right over to kick some ass after I would have set the cops on those fucker's trail who would make the mistake of making Rachel a target. But its only you and now I'm deaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, I couldn't resist surprising her. It's nice to hear from you too.\" <br>\r\n\"Well we should get together sometime since from what I understand you're going to be staying a while with donkey face?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm with Brody and really Santanna, that's not very nice to say of my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, you know I do that with everyone giving them a special name to remember them by. I'm actually calling him it nicely. So what are you and donkey face Brody up to? I am getting pretty much nothing from Rachel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing my thing,\" Puck said grinning.<br>\r\n\"Which thing-oh you mean...no way!\" Santanna started cackling. \"Mr. Perfect six-pack abs and everything is actually getting the Puck treatment and getting bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's for some future play thing but really, he's getting to love it. One of the sexiest best natural eaters I ever had the opportunity to work with.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm actually surprised. I'm kind of curious what he looks like...\" Rachel grabbed the phone back. <br>\r\n\"Santanna, aren't you late for your appointment?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh shit yeah well tell donkey face hi for me and bye to Puck and that I want to see what Brody looks like and that we should all go out together sometime.\" Santanna quickly hung up the phone and Rachel shook her head smiling. <br>\r\n\"Abrasive as ever. Well then I'm glad you called to go shopping as I haven't done so for a while and this is the perfect opportunity to get some of those new shoes and that dress I want but where's Brody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here beautiful,\" Brody said grinning as he did the same thing as Puck wrapping his arms around her from behind. \"It's so good to see you since you're so busy with rehearsals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know how it goes,\" Rachel said sighing against him. \"I would love to see you more too. But I have some extra free time so...\" she stopped and moved out from under his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody?\" she said in surprise when she stared at him. Brody blushed nervously since while he knew theoretically she was okay with it maybe she hadn't been thinking all the way through and she might change her mind and decide she didn't want a bigger him. Sweating nervously for a moment, Brody relaxed when she smiled and placed a hand over his swollen gut and rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I could see why you need new clothes already. I can't believe how much you've grown in such a short time.\" Smirking, Rachel's face turned devious as she squeezed. \"Or that you got on the train coming here looking like this,\" she said pointing to the battered button up with three missing buttons and his tank-top that couldn't cover his burgeoning gut and showing skin. \"So how much have you gained?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last official count was 15 but considering the lunch I was just put through more like 20.\" Puck came and grinned as he poked Brody's gut too. <br>\r\n\"I say more like 25 probably,\" he said patting it. \"You're doing great.\" <br>\r\n\"Clearly it's a good thing I called then,\" Rachel said smirking a little. \"Puck sure knows his stuff and how to get people to do things. So are you ready?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brody said.<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you guys alone. I have some other things I need to get and might as well get some extra stuff for myself. Meet you guys later? Maybe you, me, Brody, Santanna, and Kurt could go out to dinner or something.\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm yeah I'll call her and ask,\" Rachel said. \"See you later!\" She waved by to Puck as she took Brody by the arm and pretty much dragged him behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm so bigger clothes that will fit and grow into.\" They went into Macy's and she started running down the aisles and grabbing stuff from the racks.<br>\r\n\"You do know I can choose my own clothes right?\" Brody asked smiling.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...well...just felt like choosing stuff that would look good on you.\" Rachel stammered. <br>\r\n\"So you really don't mind this?\" Brody asked pointing to his gut. <br>\r\n\"Of course not, if I did, I wouldn't have called Puck. Once he discovered his talent he went crazy with it and have you seen him? If I can handle that size, I can handle just about anything though I would be worried if you were planning to get that big.\"<br>\r\n\"No, not that big. So you don't feel disappointed about me losing my abs?\" Brody pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to smack some sense into you? I said no I don't care. While I did love your abs...really loved them, I have no problem with you getting bigger, especially for a role or if you just want to. I would like you either way and Finn was still chubbier than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good...but did you just have to bring up Finn? I don't really like him.\"<br>\r\n\"The feelings mutual though I don't understand why you guys couldn't get along.\"<br>\r\n\"He still wants you back,\" Brody grumbled and Rachel grinned. <br>\r\n\"We talked about it and we agreed to see different people. Besides, he's busy on some secret project where we're not really allowed to talk or make contact anyhow. It drives Puck crazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet,\" Brody said feeling just the slightest tinge of irrational jealousy over Finn and Puck being so close. He even knew it was crazy since Puck and Finn were best friends for years before and there was absolutely nothing wrong with Puck being friends with Finn who he hadn't even seen for a while but it was still annoying. Maybe he just wanted to be that close to Puck as well who was really beginning to grow on him along with Rachel.\" Rachel gave him a warning glance and Brody shut up quickly not wanting to push her mood. Rachel was awesome in so many ways but when she was in a mood she could go utterly ballistic and he did not want to be alone with her should that happen. She opened the door into the dressing room and put the clothes in and before she could get out Brody grabbed her and shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave yet, I miss you and haven't seen you for a couple of days.\" Brody ripped off the button-up and the tank-top loving the way Rachel was eyeing him. She was telling the truth, she was still as into him now as she was when he had the more traditionally perfect body. He felt both relieved and just the slightest bit insulted but relief was the stronger. He had been a bit worried as he hadn't had the opportunity to work out for a few days and while he was onboard with the whole gaining process it was slightly bothersome to feel like a slug and the softness forming in his pecs and arms and gut (when not utterly stuffed to the brim by meals that were more like feasts for each one). They were still pretty respectable since it was only a few days but given a few days more might not be so pretty so he was going to have to talk to Puck about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had gotten the picture and was removing her shirt as well showing off her perfect boobs in that black bra Brody loved. Licking his lips Brody grinned. \"So you were ready for me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had been hoping,\" Rachel said, putting on the sex voice that made Brody real excited. He pushed her against the wall and started kissing her causing her to moan and driving them both more excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...had been...missing this,\" Brody breathed heavily as he kissed and sucked on her mouth, neck, everywhere he could get his hands on.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too. It's...been a while,\" Rachel said heavily. \"I was saving these for later but since we're doing this now I thought...\" she said pulling out a bunch of condoms. Brody smirked and he moved his hand lower and reached out for one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later after they were finished Rachel smiled and kissed Brody. \"You are wonderful. I hope we didn't spend too long.\" <br>\r\n\"You know you're totally awesome. I never would have thought you'd be the type to go for a quickie in a public place.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah well it's been a while and you were looking good to me and I am a performer.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah you are,\" Brody said lazily as he reached out. \"Want to go again?\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, we got to try out clothes to fit you that will also be able to grow into so you hopefully won't need to for a while.\" She reached out and fondly played with Brody's gut.\"After all especially with Puck, you're going to get so big.\" She grinned as she reached around and slapped him on the butt. \"This too.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm beginning to suspect that you might like that,\" Brody said grinning. <br>\r\n\"Maybe just a little. I do like to cuddle.\" Rachel said. Though she said it somewhat flippantly, it had to be true since she seemed to love that and feeling his belly and chest when they were doing it. Putting her clothes back on, she fixed her hair and went out. \"Make sure to model for me!\" she called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody looked at the clothes seeing 40s length pants which seemed huge but when he put them on actually fit somewhat decently and were excellent belted with room to grow into and he probably would with Puck and Rachel's help. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody sorted through the clothes Rachel brought him and was pleased with most of her choices except some bright orange thing that just looked ugly. There was also a pink polo and while that normally would have been added to the junk, it wasn't the annoying bright pink and it did look kind of snazzy. After a few moments considering, he shrugged and added it to the keep pile. Other than dress suits which weren't in this particular store, Rachel had gotten everything and she picked some pretty good ones. As she was waiting outside, he put on one of the outfits as the button-up earlier wasn't going to work and went out. Rachel's eyes lit up as she saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Brody asked smirking. He was dressed in a black tank-top and better fitting blue-jeans that showed off his muscular arms and clung nicely to his butt. One could also see the indentation where his gut was beginning to form but it definitely fit more and wasn't pushing up, yet. Rachel thought he looked like a Rock n Roll god or something and immediately said as much which caused Brody to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, but also a little applause for you for finding these clothes,\" Brody said to her. <br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" Rachel said and all of a sudden, Puck seemed to come out of nowhere with his usual bounce of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice Brody, very nice. I got some things for me as well though as you can imagine, not much clothing can be for a man of my size which is why I didn't get any clothes. I did get some books and materials for later sessions. What took you guys so long though?\" The brief fire red blush on Rachel's face did not go unnoticed and Puck smirked. \"Why you dirty dogs, I'm especially surprised about you Rachel. I can only imagine the show that would have been seen if someone walked in. Hell, I bet they could have heard you.\" Rachel's face turned even redder in embarrassment and Brody shifted too. He wasn't so much embarrassed, because just about nothing could anymore considering his job, but he did feel for Rachel who wasn't normally so kinky. Well, not until recently. Rachel liking this gaining thing was a bit of a surprise, but she didn't normally do things in public places, even if the door was locked and there was no one around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what time is it....?\" Rachel asked herself and pulled out her phone but then was surprised. \"Wow, I can't believe it's almost 7! We've been here for almost six hours.\" Rachel wondered where the time went by because surely it wasn't that late. However it was and so she remained silent until she saw the text message from Santanna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like Santanna got off early tonight and is demanding to have dinner with us to see the \"new\" Brody.\" She turned to him. \"If she says anything negative, just ignore her. She can't help herself and that's who she is.\" Brody nodded because while he didn't really interact with her, he and Santanna had met a couple of times and she sure was a firecracker that can shoot off words that cut deeper than knives. There were times he wondered how Santanna and Rachel were even friends. Rachel had told the story about how they were in High School and Santanna was one of her biggest bullies and somehow later became the best of friends but there were other times it was just like hmm, really? Santanna also had a habit of calling him donkey face for some reason and he wasn't sure if that was an insult or a pet name because she actually approved of him. He always got both feelings with her. He just called her Satan back because it really was a good nickname and while he had heard of Santanna having the capability to step up and be an actual nice person, there were other times that he cringed as she could really lay it into someone. Brody had to wonder if that was what she was planning on doing tonight. Maybe try to convince Rachel of what a fat dirty loser he was. He subconsciously cringed and wrapped his hands around his growing gut. Puck noticed and gently bumped him, though it almost knocked Brody over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Santanna, she's not going to hurt you. If she says anything bad, just ignore her. Besides, she actually does like you. She's just curious because she knows what I'm like, especially after I discovered my talent for helping other people grow.\" Brody nodded, feeling better. Someone who did not know Santanna would have wondered why he had freaked out over embarrassing himself with Santanna but she was one tough chick. He could tell even from the very brief interactions he had with her. She was the first one who got suspicious and forced his revenue job into the light. She was looking out for Rachel which he had to admire, but she had certainly been an instigating manipulative troll that might have almost cost him his relationship with Rachel. Fortunately it didn't, but it might have had if things were different. She still wasn't on his list of favorite people and did they really have to eat with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out they did and Puck stopped at some Italian place called Mario's. Santanna was sitting there waiting for them, looking hot in a slinky black dress. If she hadn't been such a bitch and if he wasn't in love with Rachel, Brody would have been into that. Okay, he was. Santanna was sex on fire and that would have been fun. She got up and glided over to them. \"Hey donkey face,\" Santanna smirked at him which caused Brody to grit his teeth. His face didn't look that much like a donkey's did it? Or at the very least it could be a sexy donkey face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get behind me Satan,\" Brody retorted, causing Santanna to laugh. <br>\r\n\"I'm starting to like you donkey face. I heard you were now on Puck's school of witchcraft and wizardry?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Brody admitted, waiting for the rude comment.<br>\r\n\"Interesting. I never would have thought. You didn't seem the type at first when I first heard but now I can see it.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't plan on getting that big.\" Brody explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Rachel doesn't need some obese immobile person. Still, you might be pretty sexy for a donkey face with a little bit extra oomph. While I don't always agree with Puck's style, he certainly is right that it is hot. I've never been fond of skinny twinks anyway. Even chubbyroll Finn as much as I like to make fun of him at times was pretty good...even if he did have a quick trigger.\" Rachel turned embarrassed again as she covered Santanna's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's enough, we're in a public restaurant. Please no lewd comments while at dinner okay?\" Santanna removed Rachel's hand from her mouth and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be on my best behavior, unless I can't help myself. By the way, how was it riding the donkey or did the donkey ride you?\"<br>\r\n\"Santanna!\" Rachel shouted, scandalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm just curious.\"<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business,\" Rachel glared.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry I just wanted details. I'll just shut up, for now. Tell me everything later okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Santanna!!!!\" Rachel screamed right as the server came by to lead them to their table. There was awkward silence for a moment with everyone and the server staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, right,\" Rachel said as she deflated and turned her head away. The scene over for now, they were lead to their seats in a back corner. This was going to be an...interesting dinner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody could recall only half of what happened at their dinner.  This was partly because not 5 minutes in, while they were waiting for their order, Rachel and Santana got into a heated argument.  A discussion about what is and isn't proper for someone committed to a job like stage acting.  The conversation seemed the typical back and forth between the two girls.  Throwing out examples of each others behavior.  Santana still liked to hold that as a former understudy who quit she had swooped in and commanded an applause-worthy performance while Rachel scuttled off to  LA. for an audition.  Truth be told, Brody suspected Rachel enjoyed sparring with Santana even if she always acted as if each word out of the other girl's mouth was an affront to her integrity.  She certainly wasn't going to get a dialogue-match like that with Kurt.  Santana's tongue was a well honed word weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the conversation was so rapid and blurred with Brody's disinterest, there was another major reason Brody could not remember specific events.  Apparently, while Brody had been off using the restroom, Puck had flagged down the waiter and ordered several more, large dishes of high calorie meals to be delivered at staggered intervals.  Brody had thought he'd ordered a fairly hefty platter at the start.  But when the food just kept coming, Puck commanded that Brody would eat everything that was brought in front of him, even if Puck had to help guide it down.  And so it was, the evening blurred between Rachel and Santana's distracted sparring and Puck stuffing forkful after forkful into Brody's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he and Puck had gotten home without incident.  Brody knew this only because, when he finally came out of his food-drunk haze, he was lying on his familiar bed, stripped down to his underwear, engorged stomach only just beginning to soften in the dark of the night.  The second thing Brody quickly became aware of, however, was the feeling of soft skin spilling into his back, nuzzling up against his spine providing warmth.  Apparently, Puck had decided to join him tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brody allowed Puck to stay the night. Puck was apparently a sleep cuddler and he was very warm and soft to be up against. Also, Brody didn't think he'd have been able to push Puck's heavy arms away that were encircling him. A few brief moments of struggle confirmed that for sure and Brody laid there exhausted before giving in and pushing his head up against Puck's massive chest which were very nice pillows. After a few moments of settling, he quickly fell back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody woke up in bed alone though. There was a beautiful male voice singing over a delicious smell and it could only be Puck making breakfast again. Brody was torn between excitement and some remaining horror because Puck certainly pushed the boundaries and always left him utterly stuffed full and hapless. The restaurant was a dirty trick ordering that much food and continuing to push it down his throat. It was obviously the most he had ever eaten in a single setting or even the total combination of a week or two. Brody cautiously got up and went to a mirror to check the damage. There wasn't even a trace of his former six-pack glory and instead was a rounded gut that protruded even bigger and farther out than ever before. There was a hint of a jiggle and bounce to it but only slightly. He must still be somewhat full from dinner the night before. Brody patted and rubbed it, feeling the heft and feel of it. It wasn't so bad. Actually, it felt pretty good and confirmed that this really was the way to go. Brody walked, or rather swaggered due to his new gravity center over to the drawer and looked for clothes to wear but unfortunately couldn't find some that would actually fit his new bigger self. Where were all the clothes that he had bought with Rachel yesterday? She must still have them. Dang, okay then, just underwear it is. It's not like he had ever been particularly worried about showing off before and Puck was definitely going to love this. Brody walked into the kitchen to where Puck was again making another massive breakfast and sat himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brodster, what up?\" Puck asked grinning. \"How was last night?\"<br>\r\n\"Very filling,\" Brody deadpanned causing Puck to laugh. <br>\r\n\"Hah, you're just too funny. I like that. I can't believe you got all that food down without exploding or much puking.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't either but please don't do that again okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Scout's honor,\" Puck said holding two fingers up.<br>\r\n\"Hey no crossing behind your back,\" Brody said, knowing that he was with the other hand.<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. I won't do it very often. But still, I was honestly very impressed.<br>\r\n\"I didn't have much of a choice,\" Brody muttered.<br>\r\n\"Even so, that was amazing how you handled that food with my help. You have an inner fattie at heart.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's just stop talking about this,\" Brody eyed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, moving on,\" Puck started. \"I made you a big gut-burster breakfast of everything: sausage, eggs, bacon, ham, the works. You're going to eat every bite.\" Puck scooped a bit of everything onto a plate and put it in front of Brody. \"Cheers!\" Brody rolled his eyes and lifted up his fork and started eating. Puck really knew how to cook and it wasn't long before Brody finished the massive plate. He leaned back and stretched, thrusting his gut out for more room and burped a couple of times as he massaged his stomach. Brody was unsurprised when Puck came back with another equally full equally rich platter of everything and put it in front of him. He sighed, mentally preparing himself for this. He was beginning to feel sated but nonetheless shoved another forkful into his mouth and carried on, bite after bite of meat and egg making its way and stretching his stomach out even further. It rested on his lap and he leaned forward with each bite. Soon Brody was panting and struggling a bit as he squirmed, one hand resting and shaking his belly while the other ever so slowly brought pieces of food to his mouth. Puck seeing Brody begin to slow, also moved to behind him as he massaged Brody's gut with one hand and used the other to scoop up more food with the fork Brody was using. Brody just laid back exhausted as Puck took over feeding for him and opening his mouth when Puck told him to. It was easier to do that than it was to struggle and with some difficulty, Puck managed to put in a second massive platter of food into Brody's bloated huge gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kendall Knight, leader of the world famous band BTR/Big Time Rush, lord prankerton and president of awesomeness, and lead dog of his pack, was depressed. Not about Jo leaving (anymore, he had been a mess over that for a while) but for a reason even more horrifying: his leg was broken. He had leg and other injuries before of course, but not ever one like this. One can't dance or play hockey or any of the other million fun things that are possible on broken legs. He did not like to admit it but it hurt worse than any other injury he had before and even attempting to move with it sent daggers of pain through him. In fact, the doctor (not the crazy one that normal patients saw that served the Palmwoods and surrounding county but an actual doctor) was worried about him walking on that leg ever again and so was Logan after seeing the x-rays. Something about torn ligaments. He got stuck on the never walking on that leg ever again bit. That had sent him into a panic that took James, Carlos, and Logan to restrain him from hurting someone (and certainly himself). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod\" Kendall had chanted from the couch while Logan paced anxiously, biting his nails while Carlos was eating cup after cup of pudding (stress eater) and James was combing his hair. He had started on Kendall's but after Kendall chewed him out, James was sulking and doing his own hair. The doctor called back and said it might be possible but Kendall was not to use that leg under any circumstances for the next period of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that means any Kendall,\" Logan was explaining. \"Not even crawling.\" <br>\r\n\"How long will it take?\" Kendall asked. <br>\r\n\"Months, at the least. It's too dangerous to risk surgery now, not unless you want a prosthetic limb?\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good with the one I have right now. Besides, I'd never be allowed to play hockey then.\"<br>\r\n\"There is always alternative sports...\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you talking about me losing my leg already? I certainly don't intend to if I can help it,\" Kendall said, glaring at Logan. <br>\r\n\"It's just...\" Logan started. <br>\r\n\"Enough, I don't want to hear it.\" They all looked at Kendall shocked. He rarely ever got snappy with them, especially with Logan. <br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Logan said back out. \"See you later then. Carlos put down the pudding, you should have stopped at 6 cups.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall was left alone with just James. \"Are you ever going to stop that?\" Kendall snapped, feeling sorry as he did so. He didn't mean to be snappish with his friends, but everything was out of whack and he was scared. The thought of being a cripple the rest of his life...well, some live quite successful lives but the side-ways looks and glances, the pitying gazes and words, and secret laughter behind your back...he would be taken as a fool and laughingstock. People would forget that he was still there and his friends...he'd never play hockey with them again. Play in the snow, swim, move as fast as them. Would they forget him? Would they leave him behind? And his mom and sister...after dad died, someone had to look out for them. He had to keep Katie out of trouble and if he ever lost the music gig what would happen then? He groaned and buried his face in his hands as he cried. James looked away from the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it'll be okay...\" James said hesitantly not sure what to do. Especially with Kendall, and Kendall never cried, not like this. <br>\r\n\"Can you please leave for a while?\" Kendall whimpered. James flinched. <br>\r\n\"Okay...but if you need anything...\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Just want to be alone.\" James left, hesitating as he looked back, not sure if leaving was a good idea right now. But as the sobbing cries got louder, he winced and ran out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kendall was lost to them for the next few days, like Jo although this time they couldn't do much of anything about it because Kendall was bedridden and watching hockey would only remind him and cause him to burst into tears all over again. It was a heartwrenching sight and Logan, Carlos, and James tried on the first two days only to get shouted at and stuff thrown at them. Mrs. Knight and Katie did as well but Kendall even flipped out on them. So the next couple were terse as Kendall morosely sat in bed, staring at the ceiling or tormenting himself looking at all the hockey trophies and listening to sad music. Food was barely eaten and only picked at and much of it returned. One day however, it changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan?\" he heard a raspy voice call and it almost startled him. Logan rushed into the room where Kendall was. Kendall hadn't spoken to them in four days (except to cry or yell or blame them or berate himself and such) and Logan was nervous. Kendall was leaning up on the bed, his arms pushing him up. Dull green eyes looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a smoothie.\" Kendall said. Logan blinked. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Logan asked, not quite sure if he was hearing things correctly. <br>\r\n\"I want a smoothie,\" Kendall said. \"A really big smoothie.\"<br>\r\n\"Um...what type?\" Kendall looked at him angrily for a moment before the passive expression came down over his face again. Logan wasn't sure which was worse, Kendall when he was throwing a tantrum or this unrecognizable Kendall who seemed out of it and uncaring. In the past, he would have said angry Kendall but now he wasn't quite so sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what type,\" Kendall said and Logan did. Kendall always bought Jo and himself smoothies when they were dating, blue and pink. Most people thought that the pink smoothie was for Jo, being a girl and all and she seemed the type who would have liked pink smoothies. However, most people did not know that those were actually for Kendall and that the pink strawberry was his favorite flavor. On the other hand, Jo much preferred blue blueberry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I do,\" Logan said. He left the Palmwoods and walked the block down the road to the smoothie store and waited in what felt like an exceptionally long line. Actually, it wasn't but one chatty customer kept talking to the person at the counter for half an hour while people behind were angrily waiting to be served. Finally however, he got in line and a smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" the guy at the counter said. \"Here everyone have a two for one smoothie day.\" While people still weren't happy, they did take their free smoothies and Logan ended up with two extra-large pink smoothies. When he got back to the apartment, Kendall had a tray of cookies next to the bed and was munching on one. Kendall tilted his head at Logan questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took so long?\" Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n\"An annoying guy in the line spent a long time talking to the cashier and making everyone impatient. It was unbelievable. However in order to make it up, everyone was given a two for one deal so I ended up with two smoothies.\" Kendall smiled a bit and Logan almost wept for joy. It didn't last long but for one of the very few times Kendall had smiled since the accident, it was wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, now hand them over,\"Kendall said. Logan carefully put them on the bedside table and sat next to Kendall on the bed as Kendall ate another cookie. <br>\r\n\"Where did you get those?\" Logan asked curious. They didn't have cookies as far as he knew. <br>\r\n\"Carlos made them.\" Kendall said. <br>\r\n\"Carlos?\" Logan said confused. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, apparently when not under immediate pressure he actually can bake amazing cookies.\" Logan hmmed. They could have been the worst cookies in the world but as long as Kendall was talking, who cared? Taking a bite out of one, Logan gasped at the burst of chocolately flavor. They were fantastic. 'Why didn't Carlos tell about his talent before?' Logan wondered. Kendall was eating yet another one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of those have you had so far?\" Logan asked curious. Kendall stopped for a moment scrunching up his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...um...er....I don't know. They are just so good and it isn't like I have much else to do right now,\" Kendall's voice cracked as the depression started coming back. \"Not with a lame leg...\" Logan cursed himself for asking and he thrust a smoothie into Kendall's hand who tilted his head back as he chugged about half before spluttering, one hand clutching his head in brain freeze, but at least smart enough to keep one hand from spilling the drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Logan asked. Kendall sat and thought for a moment. <br>\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"But I might be eventually.\" Kendall tipped the rest of the smoothie back and swallowed. He swished for a moment before reaching for the next one. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kendall seemed to be developing an addiction to smoothies and kept having Logan going out and getting him some. Over the last three days alone he had some 15 of them. 15 smoothies that came out of Logan's pocket, or would have if they didn't have their own band bank account set aside for them. Logan was talking with Gustavo on having a smoothie machine put in their appartment because it didn't look like Kendall was going to get sick of them anytime soon. At least Kendall's mood was improving. He no longer angrily threw things or yelled at them (which he was scarily almost did better than Gustavo, almost). He also didn't always burst into tears at the mention of hockey, just most of the time when James or Carlos accidentally slipped up. Kendall was getting better and if all went well, would be able to walk again. At least, Logan let him think that. He'd be able to walk alright, but barring an extreme miracle, it would be with a limp and not fast. Kendall's dreams of being a famous hockey player were pretty much toast. At least Kendall could still sing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was Gustavo?\" Kendall asked after sipping from yet another smoothie. Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n\"You know how he is. Angry, pissed off, called you an idiot and worse names ranting about you for a few hours, the usual. However, he did convince Griffin not to replace you like he wanted to.\" <br>\r\n\"I let you guys down,\" Kendall said looking ashamed. <br>\r\n\"In what way?\" Logan asked. <br>\r\n\"That stupid accident, breaking my leg, you know. I was playing around and did something I wasn't supposed to and am paying for it. You guys as well since I can no longer dance with you. I'm never going to walk again on it, am I? Tell me the truth.\" Logan looked at Kendall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truthfully, probably not. It'll be a lame one and twisted. I'm so sorry, you'll never play professional hockey.\" Kenall looked thoughtful. <br>\r\n\"Oh...thank you for telling me. I figured but I needed to hear it out loud to accept it. At least I can still sing right?\" He quirked a Kendall grin and Logan felt relieved. He missed that expression. It didn't seem like Kendall without it. Kendall drank some more smoothie and belched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrp, yeah, that's good stuff. But I wish I could get up and go somewhere, you know? It's getting so that I even wish that Mr. X would come in and have me dance to exhaustion and then have me dance more and cause me to pass out, barely able to move the next day because my body has no more energy. Although, I guess I won't have to anymore, huh?\" Logan smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlos is tempted to see if he could break his own leg to get out of dancing like you but I talked him out of it. We don't want any more people injured.\"  <br>\r\n\"That's good. Goofball would probably wreck himself more than me if he tried.\"<br>\r\n\"Probably so.\" Kendall pushed himself up on the bed.<br>\r\n\"How long until I can get up of my own accord? I might kill myself if I have to stay in bed any longer.\" Kendall spoke lightly but Logan noticed a dark humor underneath and he shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny. You shouldn't say things like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. But when can I? Yesterday you said that maybe if I was careful and supported myself on crutches I could eventually be able to at least shuffle around the apartment without being carried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly tomorrow but just to be safe maybe you could wait just a little bit longer...\" Kendall stopped Logan right there. <br>\r\n\"No, I'm not waiting any longer. If it is safe for me to at least move around in this damn room, I am going to move around tomorrow. I get enough bedrest as it is.\" Kendall finished the rest of the smoothie and threw the cup aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for doing this,\" Kendall softly said as Logan picked the cup up. \"You're the best.\" Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I'm just doing what I can to make you feel comfortable. We all are.\" <br>\r\n\"I've been a royal prick recently, haven't I?\" Kendall said matter of factly. <br>\r\n\"No...\" Logan said wanting to be polite. But yeah, they all thought he had. <br>\r\n\"Don't lie, I know you guys were all thinking it. But I am sorry. It's just been really rough for me lately.\" <br>\r\n\"That's understandable.\" <br>\r\n\"Still doesn't give me the right. Anyways, just wanted to say thank you to all of you but especially you Logan.\" Logan's heart fluttered a little as he looked at Kendall's expressive eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Logan said breathily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll help me?\" Kendall asked uncertainly and Logan knew how much it hurt for Kendall to ask for help. Although Kendall loved helping others, he hated having to ask others for help and was never comfortable with it. Kendall tried to put off asking others for help as much as possible and if Kendall was asking for Logan to help him, it had to be even more painful than Logan thought it might be. Kendall had a good poker face, Katie certainly didn't learn her Poker technique from Mrs. Knight, exceedingly good but wow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Logan said. Kendall smiled a real smile at him and Logan nearly melted from the beauty of it and what he heard next. <br>\r\n\"That's why I like you best and you're my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Today was the first day in a while that it was safe for him to at least move around on his own and not stand the humiliation of having James and Carlos picking him up and moving him. He couldn't wait to be able to move on his own but Logan would probably kill him if he tried to move without him just in case something bad happened. Logan always thought bad things were going to happen but in this case, Logan was probably right to worry. Kendall was a bit worried himself and he knew the likelyhood of falling and doing a faceplant, the only thing more embarassing than having to be carried, would be extremely high since he hadn't walked in a while. He just had to hope all his leg muscles didn't atrophy or something in the meanwhile. Atrophy, Logan taught him that word. Oh god, he was turning into Carlos, with all these random thoughts. At least he wasn't saying these things out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying what out loud Kendall?\" Logan said, coming into the room. Kendall cursed internally. Apparently at least part of it had been out loud. That was embarassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. So, let's do this.\" Kendall pushed, scrabbling at the bed and winced as a pain shot down his bad leg and he would have collapsed if Logan hadn't caught him. With Logan's help, Kendall struggled up and got onto his feet and swayed a little, but remain upright. Moving gradually, Logan backed off, ready in case Kendall started to sway dangerously again. Kendall stood, one foot normal and the other twisted and scarred where they fixed the tissue that had been torn. Taking a small step, Kendall inched his left foot forward and then his right. There was a brief bit of pain but nothing that Kendall couldn't handle. Grinning hugely, Kendall took another step and another, lengthening the distance. It was slow moving, very slow, but he was remaining upright and able to walk which was infinitely better than nothing. Laughing, Kendall did a tiny spin and almost fell over had Logan not been hovering, ready to catch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm walking!\" James and Carlos poked their heads in when they heard the shout.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that?\" James said, shirtless and his hair wet having just come from the shower.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it's a miracle!\" screamed Carlos as he rushed into the room. \"Look James look! Kendall is walking!\" <br>\r\n\"He is?\" James came in to see. \"Oh, you are! Congratulations!\" <br>\r\n\"Uh James...\" Kendall started. <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" James asked. <br>\r\n\"Your towel just slipped.\" James looked down. <br>\r\n\"Well bugger that,\" and he quickly yanked it back up and tied it securely around his waist.<br>\r\n\"Is it safe to open my eyes yet?\" Logan asked after having that image burned into his mind.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's safe,\" Kendall said. Logan opened his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness. Thanks for burning that image into my mind James.\" James shrugged. <br>\r\n\"It isn't something you haven't seen before. I assume you have one as well and we did change in the Locker Room. Besides, you're going to be a doctor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it still isn't necessary to show the world. Go put clothes on or something.\" James shrugged and as he passed Kendall, he gave a friendly slap on the back which almost knocked Kendall over. <br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, you can walk!\" James left and it was just him, Carlos, and Logan. Carlos was smiling and Logan was still hovering anxiously. <br>\r\n\"See you later Kendall!\" Carlos said and walked out behind James. Kendall blinked a moment. <br>\r\n\"Okay, that was weird. Hey, want to go somewhere?\" Logan looked sternly at him and Kendall flinched. <br>\r\n\"You're not strong enough to leave the apartment yet.\" <br>\r\n\"I know that, but...fine. Hey, want to have breakfast?\" Kendall asked. Logan grinned a bit. <br>\r\n\"Already one step ahead of you, and have already made breakfast. I figured you would be hungry.\" Kendall nodded sheepishly. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am a tiny bit hungry.\" Logan just smirked. <br>\r\n'I bet. I made all your favorites because I wasn't sure what you wanted.\" Lending a supporting arm, Logan helped Kendall hobble out to the table where Carlos and James were wide-eyed staring at the covered kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, that's a lot of food.\" they all said. </span></div></div>",

The table was covered with plates of croissants, beignets, pound cake, pancakes, eggs, etc. <br>\r\n\"Logan?\" James asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Logan said curiously.<br>\r\n\"What's up with all the food? We're not expecting a platoon or something coming in are we?\" <br>\r\n\"No, just us.\" <br>\r\n\"Then why? Just...why?\" <br>\r\n\"I got excited and anxious and I discovered cooking helps with stress.\" Logan said. <br>\r\n\"You made all that?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but most of it. I bought the croissants, beignets, and cake from the french bakery.\" <br>\r\n\"The fancy one?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that one. But it was totally worth it. I got a bargain.\"<br>\r\n\"Their stuff tastes awesome!\" Carlos said excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Indeed it does. Uh, just help yourselves I guess.\" Logan backed away and James looked at him suspiciously. <br>\r\n\"You're not eating?\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone James,\" Kendall interrupted. \"Logan, this is awesome. Thank you.\" Carlos was already loading his plate with as much as he could grab and Kendall seated himself with a plop. James shrugged and sat down as well although he still looked at Logan funny. 'I'm not doing anything!' Logan wanted to shout but that would be weird and would make it seem like he was up to something so he stayed quiet. Logan took a croissant and a couple of beignets to appease him and James finally turned away and started loading his own plate. Kendall and Carlos already filled their plates and Carlos was really going through it as he inhaled beignet after beignet and alternated with eggs and cake. Kendall ate slower and neater but still pretty quickly as he focused in on the pancakes while James spread nuttella chocolate on his croissants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued eating while Logan finished his small breakfast and watched. James ate a couple of croissants and two pancakes before mumbling he was done. Getting up, James moved to the sink and dumped his plates there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the gym if anyone wants to come,\" he announced. Kendall and Carlos both nodded at him but continued eating and James shrugged. \"Suit yourselves,\" he said and left. \"See you later!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later!\" they called back. Kendall and Carlos returned to eating. Carlos finished with the beignets and started in on tearing through the pancakes. Kendall continued on with his stack with dogged determination as he also ate pound cake. The two continued eating for a while until with a loud burp, Carlos pushed away and staggered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full,\" he moaned as he staggered up and over to the couch where he plopped down again groaning. Kendall gave a groan of relief. <br>\r\n\"Oh finally,\" he said as he struggled to get up as well. Logan saw and rushed over to help him up. \"I win this time,\" Kendall said before giving a loud burp of his own. <br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrpppp, oh huh. Maybe not so much a good idea. I'm not feeling so good.\" Logan head's snapped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, sit on the couch next to Carlos,\" he said helping Kendall hobble over. \"I've got medicine, pepto and such for stomach aches. Let me go get it.\" With that, Logan was off in a flash and then was back before they knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...?\" Kendall started before groaning. Logan poured two dosages, one for Kendall and one for Carlos and all but forced it down their throats. <br>\r\n\"There, that's better. And until it starts working sit up.\" <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Both Carlos and Kendall said confused. <br>\r\n\"Sit up please.\" They did and Logan nodded. \"Thank you. I'm going to help you by doing this.\" <br>\r\n\"What do you-oh my god,\" Carlos moaned as Logan started rubbing his bloated belly. \"That feels so good like you wouldn't believe.\" <br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me?\" asked Kendall offended. <br>\r\n\"I've got some for you too,\" Logan said smiling as he proceeded to do the same for him. Kendall moaned in pleasure. <br>\r\n\"Oh god, that does feel nice.\" Kendall leaned his head back with a smile and Carlos bounced a little. <br>\r\n\"Hey, no hogging, I want some!\" Logan laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no fighting. I will do it for both of you.\" Logan proceeded to alternate between one hand and two hands as he did both Carlos and Kendall at the same time and Carlos and Kendall alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is the life,\" Carlos said.<br>\r\n\"You said it.\" Kendall nodded in agreement as Logan kept grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was on the couch playing Mario Kart on wii with Carlos and had paused to take a sip of water when the thought had struck him. Carlos who was impatient to continue on with the game shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he? He seems normal. Can we continue playing now? I was just about to kick your butt on this last lap.\"<br>\r\n\"In a moment. Logan's just seems different lately is all. James as well.\" With a sigh Carlos sat back. <br>\r\n\"We were all just so worried about you, after the...you know, thing.\" Carlos bit his tongue to keep from blurting but Kendall knew what he meant. <br>\r\n\"You mean the accident? I don't mind if you say it, it is what it is. I really am sorry I wasn't the bestest friend during it.\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay Kendall, we all forgive you. We were just worried...but you're getting better right?\" Apparently Carlos didn't know and Kendall wasn't going to be the one to break it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything will get better soon, I know it.\" Carlos smiled brightly and Kendall smiled faintly back because he wasn't certain it really was, despite his show of optimism earlier. But Carlos needed to hear what needed to be heard to keep him unaware for just a little bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Hey, do you want anything Kendall?\" Carlos asked. Kendall shrugged.<br>\r\n\"You guys and mom mother me too much, I'm fine...but actually, do you think you could make those cookies again that you made earlier?\" Carlos breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever you want buddy. Anything you want, just ask.\" <br>\r\n\"Speaking of those cookies, remember that time with Griffin's daughter Mercedes and we almost had to leave the Palm Woods if our demo cd hadn't been chosen?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was awful. How can one not remember that?\" <br>\r\n\"She wasn't...okay, she was horrible. Anyhow, why were the cookies so bad? They really do taste like little bits of heaven.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All due to Grandma's secret recipe. Well, that day I was under a bit of stress as you recall and you guys know I don't do so well under pressure. Also, there was no way I would want to date that she-beast. I admit I might have put the cookies in the oven for too long but there was all that yelling and screaming...it was scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Carlos.\" Carlos paused the game and turned it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Mario Bros. Carlos just has to bake some cookies and then we can return back to kicking Kendall's butt okay?\" Kendall rolled his eyes and snorted because as if that would happen. Carlos got out the white chef hat which he had gotten somewhere and apron and set about gathering ingredients. \"Kendall, out\" he commanded to Kendall who was watching curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kendall asked confused. <br>\r\n\"It's a secret recipe. It won't be a secret anymore if you know how they're made. So out out out.\" Carlos steered Kendall into the hall before slamming the door shut. Then they reopened briefly while his crutches were thrown out as well. Kendall stared for a few moments before shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I guess I could see how everyone else is doing until Carlos finishes his secret cookies. I can't imagine what is so secret that I had to be kicked out though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly bending over to pick the crutches up, Kendall wandered aimlessly down the Palmswood halls searching for people. There were not many people around because there was some big audtion thing for something. The only people still around were Big Time Rush, Katie, Budhha Bob, Mr. Bitters, and a handful of other people somewhere. Suddenly he saw the new girl...Lucy Stone or something. She had just moved right in but that was around the time of his little incident and he was too busy recovering that he didn't know her that well. This was as good as any a time to get to know her as any, especially since he was recovering. Hobbling a little, Kendall moved over to where the rocker looking chick (thank goodness she didn't have a mohawk, Kendall was a bit freaked out by girls with mohawks) was sitting and sat down next to her. Coughing a little to get her attention, he waited until she looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" he said. \"My name's Kendall Knight.\" <br>\r\n\"Lucy Stone. You're from Big Time Rush right?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kendall said proudly. <br>\r\n\"Eh,\" she shrugs for a moment before looking at him more closely. \"Woah, what happened to your foot?\"<br>\r\n\"Tragic accident, really. Kind of silly.\"<br>\r\n\"Well are you going to tell me?\" Lucy asked, even more curious now. Kendall gave a laugh and shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Nah, that will have to remain a mystery. Hey, do you still need any help moving in?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh sure, I've got most of my stuff unpacked already but there are still bits and pieces if you want to help.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh I do. I need to get out and do something,\" Kendall said.<br>\r\n\"I understand. Well, if you want to meet me at my room, I can show you some stuff that needs to be done if that would make you happy. You want to come with me?\" <br>\r\nLucy held out her hand and helped Kendall back to the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's too much, I'll understand if you want to take a breather.\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good. I just really need to do something if you don't mind.\" Kendall repeated stubbornly and Lucy shrugged deciding if he wanted to help so much, he could help. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James couldn't take it anymore. He was clearly upset with the fact that Kendall was dating Jo. He tried to seem ok with it and always wear a smiile whenever they were together close to him. But inside he couldn't feel more depressed. All this time he was secretly trying to call the blonde's attention by having the perfect body. He even flirted with random girls to see if Kendall would feel jealous about it, but nothing happened. So now he had no reason to keep going to the gym. And feeling like this there is nothing better than eating to forget about the problems. So when he was alone at the 2J, he decided to order three boxes of peperoni pizzas and two 3-litter bottles of soda to eat into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\" James said to himself before opening the first box of pizza and eating the first slice. It tasted so good. So good that after a while the whole pizza was gone and he was moving to the next box. His belly was starting to show due to the amount of food he was shoving down his throat. Nothing else mattered now. Soon he was stuffing himself like a pig, placing a whole slice of pizza into his mouth before chewing and washing it down with a gulp of soda. By the time the second pizza was down, James was feeling full. His stomach was sticking out a bit, making his tank top rise higher and the skinny jeans to feel tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he felt just like when he was younger. When everybody made fun of him for being fat and how it only made him eat more. At that moment it wasn't so different. He wanted to forget the blond that he had a crush on ever since they met. So even after reaching his limit, James opened the third box and kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf...\" James sighed when there was nothing left for him to devour. His mouth was covered in grease and all that was left was three empty boxes of pizza and the two bottles which were now dry. Everything was inside James' overinflated belly. Now he realized how much it hurt. So he moved his hands towards the stretched skin before him and gave it a massage, trying to sooth the pain away. \"Ugh! I ate too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard the door being opened and revealing...</span></div></div>",

Then he saw the boxes of pizza and bottles of soda empty like nothing had been inside them before. James' white tank top had damps all over the fabric, while the once defined abs turned into bloated belly which skin was tight as a drum. \"You ate all this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" James started but a belch interrupted his speech. \"Yeah, I did. Got a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just asked. You're always the healthy one.\" Kendall pointed ou, but the way the pretty boy could barely move. He never thought of seeing James like that. He seemes devasted by a reason and the blond wanted to find out. Sighing, he moved to the orange couch and sat down beside James. The over stuffed singer was begining to feel nervous again. The one he had a crush on was right beside him and he couldn't run because he was too big to do so. \"What's happening James? I'm your friend. You can tell me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see. Ever since we met I knew we would get along right away. But then I realized I liked you more than a friend. Sorry Kendall, but I-I've got a crush on you.\" James finally opened his heart for the blond singer and everything around him seemed to paralyze.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carlos Garcia loved a lot of things. He loved his friends, his dad, Mrs. Knight, Katie, the Jennifers, his helmet, Dinosaurs, Hide and Seek, Kelly, Singing, Hockey, Girls, Rides, Magazines, TV, Video Games, Cars, Palmwoods, the pool, music, and even Gustavo most of the time. He also loved food, corndogs and pudding in particular. You could get Carlos to do anything for a corndog or pudding cup (except hurt his friends, he wouldn't do that for all the corndogs in the world...well, if it was all of them, maybe. But otherwise, it aint happening!). With his trusty helmet and a corndog, he could do anything he put his mind to, like dig a tunnel to China or become a superhero. Well, maybe not that far, yet. He still had to work on that. But he wasn't stupid like everyone (Logan) says he is, he had good ideas just as much as the others. Logan was just a downer who said no to everything like him jumping out the window to land on a trampoline and do a perfect flip and cannonball into the pool with the most epic splash ever. Apparently it was too \"dangerous\". Logan needed to learn to live a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that day, Carlos was bored and didn't want to do anything. Completely devoid of ideas, he loafed in the apartment wondering what to do. The others were all busy. Kendall was on a date with Jo, James was on a date with some random chick, Logan was building a science project, and he was left all alone with nothing to do. Even Mrs. Knight and Katie were busy, Mrs. K with errands and Katie busy cleaning suckers of their money at poker since Mrs. K wasn't their to make sure she didn't. And Carlos couldn't bother Katie if he wanted to keep his corndogs. Katie threatened the corndogs if Carlos bothered her for stupid reasons which pretty much was everything but an emergency and even then, someone better be dying. So they were all out. The Jennifers were too busy doing girly stuff right now and they still did not forgive him for what happened at prom. So absolutely bored, he sat there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lasted for 3 minutes before twitching. Carlos was not made for patience and the absolute silence in the appartment was driving him insane. He had to do something, he just didn't know what. Absent-mindedly he wandered over to the refrigerator and looked for some eats and was quite pleased to find a large stash of pudding. Looking around guiltily, he takes most of it and hurries to the couch, pushing most of it under the table so no one who came in would see. Kendall, James, Logan, Mrs. Knight, and Katie were going to be gone for a little while but it was better to be safe and sorry. James and Kendall did not like anyone stealing their pudding cups, even though James always tried to steal his, and usually succeeded or guilt-tripped Carlos into handing it over. \"Hah,\" he thought. \"I've got your pudding now James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos turned on the tv looking for something to watch. He ended up watching a show about 4 teenage boys who want to be famous forming a boyband and were flown off to New York where they stay at this crazy hotel and pull a lot of pranks and sing and do awesome stuff. They even had a grumpy music director named Brock Hustovo who called the boys urchins. Carlos was amused by it because they were hilarious and reminded him a lot of them. Before he knew it, all the pudding cups, even the ones he had stashed under the seats was gone after watching a few episodes. Carlos had also leftover apple pie, the last few remaining slices of a pizza, three corndogs, and a scoop of icecream. Letting out a big burp, Carlos relaxed on the couch, belly comfortably stuffed. Running his hands over it lazily, he stops and looked down to see his stomach sticking out a little. Poking it, he burped again and shifted position. It was a weird experience and one that almost never happened to him before, at least that he could remember. Giggling as if he found a new trick, he started playing with his belly. This was actually very fun and it felt so good. He wondered why other people didn't do it. He would have to do this again sometime because it was so much fun. </span></div></div>",

A few moments passed before Logan coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not moving does not mean I can't see you Carlos,\" Logan says.<br>\r\n\"Darn it!\" Carlos whined unfreezing. \"I totally thought that was going to work.\" He resumed rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n\"But really, what are you doing?\" Logan asked, looking at the mess Carlos created. There was a pile of pudding cups, a pizza box, the pie container, and Carlos had his shirt off for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a snack, it was delicious,\" Carlos announced. Logan looked at the trash again and was mentally tabulating. <br>\r\n\"You ate all the pudding cups that was for all of us for the next week? Darn it Carlos, not cool man.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just so bored and then I got hungry and watched Little Infinite Stop and next thing I knew all this happened.\" <br>\r\n\"But all the pudding cups...and there was still half a cherry pie in there. You seriously ate all that food?\" Carlos grinned cheekily as Logan shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Yep, and it was delicious. I actually ate even more than that.\" Carlos burped agin. \"Though maybe I might have overdone it, it doesn't feel so good anymore. It did earlier but now not so much. Logie, would you help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By doing what?\" <br>\r\n\"Rubbing my tummy, you won't believe how nice it feels.\" Carlos put on a puppy dog look and Logan sighed. Nobody can ever resist the puppy dog look. Carlos patted the seat next to him and scooted over for Logan to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have to do?\" Logan asked in a monotone voice, hoping he heard wrong. <br>\r\n\"Rub my tummy silly,\" Carlos said. He leaned back and stretched his legs out, thrusting his tummy in Logan's direction. <br>\r\n\"Alright fine, but only for a little bit. I need to get this project done.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, just do it already.\" Muttering to himself, Logan put his hands on Carlos's belly as Carlos closed his eyes. He kept them there for a few moments, not sure what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Carlos whined.<br>\r\n\"I...this is weird. Sure I can't do something else? Like get you ginger ale or something? Ginger ale is good for a full belly.\" <br>\r\n\"No, just do it, please Logan? Pleeeeeeaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeee?\" Carlos whined, extending the please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all right, just stop that. I'll do it.\" Logan tentatively rubbed his fingers around which caused a mewling sound from Carlos as he squirmed a little. The skin of Carlos's belly felt taut and warm, full from its feasting. Poking it, there was a slight resistance but a resistance nonethelsess. Carlos moaned again in pleasure and Logan flushed. The sound that Carlos made sent tingles down Logan's body and he stiffened when Carlos reflexively brushed his hand low near his jean line. Carlos didn't even know as his eyes were screwed shut as he made happy noises and dug into Logan whenever Logan rubbed a seemingly particular spot. Logan however was both sweating nervously and flushing as Carlos almost ground against him, making those noises. Logan was just beginning to fall apart when Carlos opened his eyes and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Logie, that was nice. I feel so much bertter now.\" Logan made some sort of sound as Carlos turned around. \"I can finally sleep now and I feel tired. See ya later.\" Logan was still speechless as Carlos did some sort of shake dance as he still shirtless went to his bedroom. But the sight of that perfect ass, hugged tightly by those jeans was too much for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit Carlos, I need new underwear and pants as well. Lay to leave crunbs on me.\" Logan walked into his room in a near daze. \"Kay, I needed something...what was it again? Oh crud I can't remember...I should probably replace those pudding cups. Kendall, James, and Mrs. Knight aren't going to be happy to find all the pudding cups missing.\" Logan put on a clean pair, still unable to believe what just happened. He had just...and Carlos...food, those noises he made...oh god. And when Carlos was shirtless and that little stuffed belly peaking out and hanging over those pants...well, he was never going to be able to forget that image. He actually hoped for quite the opposite because when he rubbed Carlos's belly for him, it felt amazing and Logan wanted to do it again. So rounded and stuffed...he wondered what it would be like for Carlos to do it again, maybe just once or twice. Sure that would be over the limit of a healthy diet but what was a few times? It wasn't like Carlos was going to get fat or something after a few times. In fact, Carlos would look good like that more often. Logan licked his lips again. Mmmh Carlos...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When dinner preparation rolled around at 7, James, Kendall, Mrs. Knight, and Katie came in. All three Knights had their arms full with grocery bags while James had a small one as he rambled on in some story of how amazing his current girlfriend of the week was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, can you help me with unloading?\" Mrs. Knight said and Logan agreed. James was useless at it and Kendall and Katie already fled the scene so it was just him and Mrs. K as they packaged the food away. It only took a few minutes before everything was done and they put the water on to boil for pasta. \"So what did you do today?\" She asked, as she nodded in satisfaction of a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Logan asked, jumping a bit when she asked. \"Well I...uh was working on my science fair project and I needed a glue gun and so I came back here and...\" Logan trailed off, and shifted his legs a bit, hoping Mrs. K didn't see as he remembered what happened then. \"Well, that was it really. I got a glue gun and continued my project which I'm almost done with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. When do you think it'll be done?\" <br>\r\n\"Very soon hopefully.\" Logan said, biting the inside of his mouth. It was almost done and he had expected to get it done today but then that whole...thing with Carlos distracted him and he had to go to the store to buy pudding replacement. By the time he got back it was too late to finish and he had only 5 minutes to prepare before the group had gotten back. Logan had gotten the last pudding in the nick of time when he heard the door click open and Mrs. Knight's voice and Logan jumped away and moved to greet them. Carlos came in rubbing sleep from his eyes as he yawned tiredly, still shirtless. Logan was relieved (and disappointed) to see the results of Carlos's bloat pretty much all gone although there was still a tiny bit if one looked really closely and knew what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Carlos said tiredly as he put his arms down and scratched his stomach lazily. <br>\r\n\"Hey Carlos, just making pasta for dinner,\" Mrs. Knight said. <br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Carlos said and strode to the couch and dropped himself heavily on it. <br>\r\n\"Woah, he must be really tired. What did he do?\" Mrs. Knight asked shocked. <br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" Logan said, confused himself. While he knew what Carlos did, he had no idea why Carlos was so tired, especially after a long nap like that one. He went up to Carlos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm good.\" Carlos must have been because by the time the water was boiling and the pasta cooking, he no longer seemed so exhausted and was his bouncy self again, even humming as he played Super Smash Brother's. Kendall and James had come out and they were all playing as Mrs. Knight told him to and that she could finish the pasta herself. Kendall was Wolf, James was Kirby, Logan was R.O.B., and Carlos was Toon Link. Toon Link was Carlos's favorite because Carlos always did like cartoons and he liked the speedy demon. Although Logan wasn't the biggest fan of video games, he did enjoy doing them and he liked the robot with laser beams and in his opinion one of the most dangerous Smash powers barring the StarFox cannon blasters for continual punishment. And it made sense for Kendall to be Wolf who was both a loner and a pack animal and Gustavo always did call them dogs. James had no real preference or specific reasons other than that they were cool but he loved playing Kirby, Meta knight, and Bowser because they were just \"cool\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwoooooooooooohhhh!\" Kendall howled jumping up dancing. \"Take that suckers!\" James and Carlos groaned simultaneously as Wolf summoned his airship and blasted first James and swung around smashing Carlos for victory. Logan had already lost all his lives since the other three had decided on a temporary truce apparently to take him out. James pouted, lip sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair, that was my smash ball.\" Carlos looked disappointed for a second as well before sniffing the air. <br>\r\n\"Macaroni and cheese!\" he shouted happily. Carlos loved Macaroni and cheese, but on the other hand, Carlos seemed to love anything that weren't vegetables with the exception of broccoli. Broccoli was probably the only vegetable he liked and when Logan asked why, Carlos laughed and said \"they're like mini-trees! How awesome is that?\" After Corndogs, pudding, and dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese was Carlos's favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall was still doing the happy 'in your face' dance as James muttered and sulked. Logan couldn't hear what James had said but it caused Kendall to laugh and put his arm around James as he nuzzled him. If Logan didn't know better, he would have long ago assumed that James and Kendall were together. Just the way they acted around each other...but Kendall was with Jo and James had a thing for trying to claim every hot girl. Oh well. Jo was a very nice girl and James was...James. Logan did not agree with James to hit on every single chick but at least James respected his relationships (as long as they lasted, be it a day or a week). Logan knew other guys wouldn't even do that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was a noisy affair as always. James and Kendall bickered over something, Katie texted at the table while M.K. scolded her, Carlos still chewed with his mouth half-open and was dropping as much food as went in even though he wolved it up really fast. Logan just picked at his food not very hungry and Carlos noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can I have that?\" Carlos asked pointed at Logan's plate and Logan shrugged as he handed it over and Carlos dug into that as well. Logan watched him dig in with gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does he do it?\" Logan wondered watching. Despite the fact that watching Carlos eat was almost gut-wrenching when he at times sprayed his food, there was still something fascinating about it. Maybe because he enjoyed it so much. Logan felt hyper-aware today and it felt like the others were receeding into the background with just Carlos sticking out. He noticed Carlos reach under the table to every now and then to play with his belly and that made Logan think of earlier when Carlos had been lying there shirtless, playing with his gut. Honestly, he was amazed Carlos could even eat anything right now, especially with the amount he had earlier. His stomach was all in knots and he didn't even eat much. Where did the boy put it all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was time for dessert and Kendall asked for some of the rest of the pie. Mrs. Knight checked the fridge. <br>\r\n\"There's none left,\" she said and Kendall was confused. <br>\r\n\"What? But we had half a pie left.\" <br>\r\n\"Come and see for yourself.\" Kendall checked and sure enough, no pie. <br>\r\n\"What the f-\" he started until Mama glared at him and he changed track. \"-lip happened to the pie? Logan, you didn't use for your experiment did you?\" <br>\r\n\"No Kendall, I didn't.\" <br>\r\n\"Then who...\" he started. <br>\r\n\"I did, \" Carlos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man, did you eat all of it? That's not fair,\" James whined. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just felt hungry and it was just sitting there looking all delicious and it called out to me.\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Mrs. Knight said. \"We've still got icecream.\" Carlos grinned and Mrs. Knight looked at him. <br>\r\n\"Not for you, you had your dessert earlier.\" <br>\r\n\"Least he didn't eat the pudding cups,\" Kendall said. Logan laughed mentally at that. Oh if they only knew...Carlos pouted but he knew the rules as everyone got dessert except him. The look on Carlos's face was so pouty though Logan slid his bowl of icecream over to him and was rewarded with a big smile of grattitude that lit up all of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't really hungry anyways,\" Logan said, blushing. He wasn't, but Carlos apparently was a near black hole of food. It did much more for Carlos than for Logan. \"Much, much more,' piped his mind and Logan felt a tingling of excitement again as Carlos dug in. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carlos was a pretty heavy sleeper who woke up long after Kendall and Logan and even sometimes James who often claimed the need for beauty sleep. Carlos wasn't sure how sleeping in longer made you prettier because James always looked pretty and Carlos never got prettier during his sleep. People still preferred James to him and he slept in longer. Oh well. So when Carlos woke up around noon he wasn't surprised to see them all gone. Kendall actually woke up at 6:30 on the dot every day to do his daily routine. He wasn't sure why Kendall even needed to be up at 6:30 since that was a holdover from when they went to school in Minnesota and had to get up to catch the bus. Now that they didn't have to and their school and singing schedules varied, there really wasn't a reason to. And even Gustavo Rocque did not like working at 6:30 in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the shower, he sighed in pleasure as the warm water cascaded down on him. Humming and dancing to \"Love Me, Love Me,\" one of their new songs, he scrubbed himself clean and noticed something different. His stomach area was a bit more curvy and bulgy than normal, felt softer as well. While he never had six pack abs or even a hard stomach, Carlos didn't think he had this before. Bending down he watched a roll form and he shook it a little. Yep, definitely new. How very strange, but not althogether unpleasant. Carlos wasn't as obsessed with musculature as James was, probably because he had always been a bit husky and carried the slightest bit of pudge preventing him from ever hoping to have a six pack. Carlos loved his food too much and couldn't stand the restricted regimen of dieting that James once decided to help Carlos with. He quit after a few days hungry and angry as hell and none of them tried to make Carlos do that again. Also, it was pretty fun to play with. Carlos was of the opinion that as long as he could still play hockey and do all the amazing fun things, he shouldn't care. Besides, no one can talk smack of this little bit when you look at Gustavo or Mr. Bitters. Running the shampoo through his hair he washed it and got out, wrapping a towel around himself and cleared the mirror which always fogged afterwards. Looking at his reflection, he saw there was a slight bulging out of his stomach but nothing out of the normal. He actually looked pretty good as far as he could tell, perhaps even better than normal. Pulling on his underwear he started on his jeans before running into a slight problem. They were a bit too tight. Grunting, Carlos tried jumping and wriggling in them and with a bit of effort and words that normally one would never expect to hear from his mouth, he managed to get the pants on and zipped up, even though though it did feel as if it was cutting off his air supply or circulation. His stomach overhung it a bit and Carlos shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid pants,\" he muttered as he pulled on a shirt. \"Need to remind Mrs. Knight to get new ones.\" He walks out of the room into the kitchen where Logan was putting the finishing touches on his project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyah,\" Carlos said and Logan looked up briefly and said 'hi' and continued to work. Carlos sat a few moments knowing Logan was only going to answer when he was done and that it was near impossible to drag his attention away from something he was working on when he was working on it. Finally Logan put the last piece on and cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! Finally! A+ here I come!\" <br>\r\n\"That's awesome,\" Carlos says and Logan grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Just le me put it away, make sure it won't get damaged.\" Logan left the unstated part unsaid that if he left it out, Carlos might accidentally destroy it which happened once and he never let Carlos forget it. Looking around, Logan reached up and put whatever it was on the top part of the closet out of Carlos's normal reach. Carlos was short compared to his friends and there was occasional mocking over it. Carlos hated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Logan said. \"I guess you're hungry?\" <br>\r\n\"Starved,\" Carlos said and Logan smiled. <br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Carlos was confused with that but before he opened his mouth, Logan pulled on a \"kiss the cook apron\" and was already getting stuff out so Carlos kept quiet. <br>\r\n\"Pancakes?\" Logan asked and Carlos nodded. <br>\r\n\"Did you make pancakes for the others?\" Carlos asked. <br>\r\n\"No, just you today.\" Logan said, looking lower than normal away from Carlos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Carlos said, not sure what to make of that. Carlos spent the time waiting looking at Logan cook, the way he flipped those pancakes and how that apron looked so comely on him. Carlos was so entranced he was surprised when a plate was put in front of him with 4 steaming hot pancakes covered in maple syrup, exactly how he wanted it. He gave a wide grin to Logan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome, thank you,\" and with that, Carlos dug in with abandon. He could feel Logan's eyes watching him as he ate and it would have been creepy if it hadn't tased so good. Shortly the pancakes were finished and Carlos groaned from the feeling of the tight pressure around his middle and he couldn't seem to reach it. Logan came over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to help?\" Logan asked, a tone in his voice that was unfamiliar to Carlos and he never heard Logan speak in before. <br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, that would be much appreciated.\" Logan liked when he used big words like that. After fumbling for a few moments as Logan grabbed at things that were not the zipper or the button and caused Carlos to intake a massive breath, Logan managed to reach the button and undo it. The zipper came down of its own accord and Carlos's bloated belly spilled out and he blushed again. 'He must think I look like a fat-ass' Carlos thought as the strange emotion flittered in Logan's eye again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry about that,\" Carlos said. \"I've gained a bit of weight recently, just a few pounds and I expect it to to be gone soon,,,\" Carlos rambled, hoping Logan bought it. He had no intention of losing them but Logan didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" Logan said. \"I like it.\" Carlos blinked, speechless and his mind on stop and hit the rewind. <br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" <br>\r\n\"I like your cute belly,\" Logan said. This made Carlos feel excited but also confused. <br>\r\n\"But what about healthy dieting?\" Logan shrugged making motions. <br>\r\n\"Healthy eating-smelthy eating, It doesn't work for you and I shouldn't force you to as long as you remain at an acceptable limit. <br>\r\n\"So...you don't mind? And you actually like it?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...that's good.\" Carlos said as he patted his belly. Logan's eyes seemed to watch the movement. <br>\r\n\"Why do you keep looking at me like that?\" Carlos asked. <br>\r\n\"Because I think it looks hot,\" Logan said simply and Carlos was thrown for a loop. </span></div></div>",

I thought you liked Camille or something.\" <br>\r\n\"Nah, Camille is a good girl but we're better off friends. Lately I've been having feelings for someone else.\" Carlos felt a rush of dislike for whoever this person was.<br>\r\n\"Who?\" he growled out and Logan looked at him inquisitively. <br>\r\n\"Is your throat sore? You just sounded like you're getting a cold.\" Carlos rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Who?\" he repeated in as an even tone as possible. <br>\r\n\"You know him very well.\" Logan said and Carlos felt something in his heart break. <br>\r\n\"It's James, isn't it?\" Carlos turned and was about to run away before Logan burst out laughing. <br>\r\n\"You..I...James...relationship? That's ridiculous! It's not James.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then who is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I should think it should be obvious.\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, you're being stupid.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not stupid.\" <br>\r\n\"You must be if you haven't figured it out I mean you.\" Logan said shouting and Carlos stopped. <br>\r\n\"You like me?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think you're great. But maybe it's a mistake if you're going to get all huffy about it.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not huffy and Logan, I like you too. Wouldyouliketogoonadatewithme?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n\"I said would you like to go on a date with me?\" Carlos repeated, slowing down.Logan looked shocked. <br>\r\n\"You...you would? You're not kidding or playing with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know, because you've never shown interest before and you like to play with toys?\" <br>\r\n\"No, I mean it.\" Carlos and Logan were looking at each other and leaning in before Kendall came barging in the door. <br>\r\n\"Hey I need to get...what's going on here?\" he asked looking startled as Carlos and Logan jumped apart quickly. <br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Logan replied at the same time as Carlos said \"we're dating.\" Kendall and Logan both turned their heads towards Carlos. <br>\r\n\"You're what?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n\"Dating as in me and Logie are now boyfriends which is more than boys who are friends.\" Kendall shook his head. <br>\r\n\"What...how...when?\" <br>\r\n\"It was over breakfast this morning. Logan made me breakfast and he said some things and I said some things and we almost started fighting but then I asked him out and it is all good now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when did you start liking Carlos, Logan?\" <br>\r\n\"I suppose for a while now but especially recently.\" Kendall narrowed his eyes as he looked Carlos up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never noticed this before but you're getting fat Carlos. Logan, how can you like that? What happened to healthy eating and exercise?\" Logan and Carlos looked at Kendall in shock and even he looked a bit surprised the way he had said that so viciously, especially about his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kendall, I can't believe you just said that!\" Logan said. Kendall shuffled a bit before his green eyes steeled up again, <br>\r\n\"Yeah but it is true. He can't even fit into those pants and look at the zipper. Carlos is getting fat and I won't stand for it.\" <br>\r\n\"You don't get to decide that, Carlos does,\" Logan said peeved dealing with Kendall who seemed extremely out of sorts today. <br>\r\n\"But you were always the one who...\" Kendall started.<br>\r\n\"I like him this way,\" Logan said and Kendall stared, his eyes bugging out. <br>\r\n\"What? That is attractive to you?\" He stomps over and squeezes Carlos's exposed belly. Suddenly, Kendall was pushed into a wall and was in shock as the shorter male pinned him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave Logan alone!\" Carlos yelled. \"I like you Kenny but right now you're being mean so please go away.\" Kendall struggled a bit and was surprised to realize he couldn't get out. Carlos was glaring at him and Kendall stared. What the hell was going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me Carlos.\" Kendall said.<br>\r\n\"Not until you apologize to Logan and me.\" <br>\r\n\"For what?\" <br>\r\n\"Insulting me and scaring Logan.\" They both looked over to where Logan was worriedly watching, chewing on his nails which he always did under stress as he rocked back and forth. Kendall's eyes flashed a moment before he sighed and lowered his head in surrender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, I'm sorry for scaring you. Carlos I'm sorry for calling you fat. You aren't that fat yet.\" Carlos rolled his eyes but took it because Kendall had a point. \"I'll just go to the pool now, I forgot my swim trunks.\" Carlos let go and Kendall awkwardly goes into his room and puts them on. He comes out, giving a quick look at Carlos and Logan. His eyes flicker down towards Carlos's belly and then to Logan and back before he shakes his head. \"See you later,\" he muttered and walks out. When they were alone, Logan looks at Carlos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what all that was about?\" he wondered and Carlos shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall walked down the hallway, stunned. Logan and Carlos...together. That wasn't fair. He liked Logan for far longer than Carlos and Logan was his first friend. It was always him and Logan. Logan was the jelly to his peanut butter, the moon to his sun, the rudder to his boat and other weird metaphors that represented their relationship. What did Carlos think he was doing? And Carlos was gaining weight, and not the good kind. And Logan liked it. What the hell was going on? Logan always had been big on healthy eating...he stopped and had a flash of inspiration like he always does whenever he came up with a plan. If Logan liked heavier people, Kendall was going to oblige him. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kendall continued making his way to the pool. A swim would help clear his mind and he needed it. All he could think about was Carlos and Logan kissing. Well he hadn't seen them but when he came in it was clear they had been about to and now they were dating. Dating! How could they do that? They were his friends but they couldn't do that. Not with each other anyways. He didn't care if Carlos and Logan were gay, especially Logan because he always did have suspicions, but with each other...whatever happened to girl loving Carlos anyways? The one who wanted the Jennifers or that delivery girl or the other girl who pretend dated him and then tried to do all she could to dump him but actually really did like him? And if Kendall was being honest with himself, which he was because his mom never allowed denial, the truth was that he liked Logan. He always liked him and now that he and Jo were just friends, she was totally cool with him going after the guy he wanted and they were still very good friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he was jealous. Whoop-de-freaking-doo. Who wouldn't be? Logan was quite the catch and an all round awesome guy. He just couldn't believe that of all people Carlos got there first. The only thing worse would beJames swooping in to try to win Logan as well but thankfully is totally straight (boy kissing games when they were younger and kissing each other aside). He couldn't compete with James when it came to wooing. As it was, he was up against a friend already. Although, he would have thought that it would be James into Carlos, what with them both being the Super Party Kings. But they weren't spending as much time together since Carlos was apparently spending time with Logan apparently. Logan had been awfully busy lately with that school project, was it all just a cover? Hmm...okay, now he was being paranoid. And Logan and Carlos were not kissing in the apartment, they weren't. Maybe this was all just a dream and he would wake up and tell them and they would all laugh over it. Giving a hard pinch, he yelped. Okay, not a dream. Damn, this really was happening. Logan and Carlos were together. Gritting his teeth, he jumped into the pool with a big splash and swam hard going back and forth. Those who had been in quickly got out as if they could sense his mood although they probably also saw the 'I am about to murder someone if you touch me' expression on his face. Soon he was alone as he paddled back and forth doing laps, trying to clear his mind. It took a while but after about 20 or so back and forth, he finally managed to clear his mind and just feel his body working. Doing 10 more, he gasped as he got out but totally pleased. He was too tired to want to bash Carlos's face at least if he saw it and he could focus. Sitting down, he dried himself off as he thought more about his flash of inspiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it had seemed stupid, something illogical and not well thought out at all. It wasn't, at least it wasn't illogical. He was going to have to work on the thinking it out part. Logan was usually better at thinking this longterm stuff. He just came up with the ideas and lead them through them. See, he needed Logan. They had such good synergy together while Carlos was a goofball. Sad, but true. He didn't want to demean his friend but that didn't hide the truth although clearly the motivation was because he just couldn't stand the fact of Carlos and Logan together. Shaking his head, he refocused. Back to the issue at hand, something important. Logan had always talked about health and fitness, which made sense because he wants to be a doctor. But Carlos was breaking the rules, and Logan liked it. The way that Logan was looking at Carlos...he didn't like it but it was clear Logan liked it. And there was a line between extra weight and fat out of shape useless slugs. Carlos wasn't the second one and the weight gain seemed fairly recent, not to mention Carlos had always been slightly huskier but when provoked, he had surprising strength. The fact that Carlos pinned him against the wall and he couldn't move, that was impressive. Annoying, but impressive. And he actually worked out at the gym, swam, skate boarded, etc in addition to hockey while Carlos was all over the place and if anything was less active than he used to be if that recent belly was any indication. Not to mention...Logan liked it. Kendall bit out a cry as he punched the ground. Damn damn damn damnity damn it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was a newly discovered thing of Logan's. Because he had never shown interest in that before. And it wasn't just Carlos because this...this infatuation only happened recently. Maybe Logan was one of those secret belly enthusiasts. Kendall had found out about them before online when he was researching something, what it was he couldn't remember, but somehow he ended up on a (rather disturbing) website where people were complimenting fat. It horrified and shocked him at first but having read further, the comments made for entertaining material, even if what they were directed to didn't attract him at all. But it was his first awareness that people could even have an interest in heavy people and not just for making fun of, but being attracted to them. Kendall thought that was creepy but you can't control what you like and if they like that, there isn't much of a problem (unless you're talking about corpses, underaged children, or animals, which is just sick). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Logan liked it with Carlos. It would certainly explain this sudden interest. Nodding, Kendall stood up. It was settled. He liked his body as it was. But that idea earlier was good. If it was what it would take to win Logan, he could stand to put on a few pounds, perhaps more. Whatever it would take to win Logan's interest again. Kendall very much doubted that Logan liked obese people. If he knew Logan, he wouldn't risk his or Carlos's health that way and probably knew ways to still be healthy and being bigger than normal size. And being big and strong, emphasis on big, would be something different and interesting. He could do this. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that Kendall made up his mind, it was much easier. The rest would be just a matter of details to worry about later. Putting on his spare shirt, Kendall smiled as he went back in and was even smiling as he passed by Carlos and Logan on his way to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Kendall said pleasantly and Logan raised his eyebrow. Kendall continued onward still smiling and Logan and Carlos exchanged looks. <br>\r\n\"That was weird,\" Logan said. <br>\r\n\"Do you think Kendall's been replaced by a clone from the planet X?\" Carlos asked. Logan sighed and rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. Let's just go.\" Carlos nodded excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's fine. I'm hungry.\" <br>\r\n\"You're always hungry.\" Logan said fondly and Carlos blushed as Logan's hand brushed against his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got in, Kendall paused for a moment. He honestly wasn't sure how to go about this. It pretty much went against everything he knew but he had to do it, for Logan. He was wondering what to do when Katie walked in playing the gameboy and Kendall immediately grabbed her before she could wander off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, I need advice on something!\" She sighed and put her gameboy down after closing it. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it?\" Kendall was unnerved how a nine year old girl could already master \"the look\". Maybe it was a girl thing but it was terrifying. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to gain weight and I wonder if you have any ideas because I don't.\" Katie raised her eyebrows, stunned. <br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" <br>\r\n\"I've decided to bulk up, put on a bit of muscle, you know stuff like that. Any ideas?\" Katie relaxed a bit. <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Yeah, you are a bit scrawny. I might come up with something.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks Katie-wait what?\" Kendall asked with an edge. Katie backed up slowly. <br>\r\n\"I mean, let's get started! Uh, well, I guess go and do the Carlos method.\" <br>\r\n\"The what?\" <br>\r\n\"Eat everything, simple enough really. I'm just going to go now,\" Katie said running out. Kendall stood for a moment and thought. That idea was just crazy enough that it might work. It was so freaking obvious he was amazed he hadn't thought of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to be stupid Kendall,\" he muttered to himself. \"Let's just do it before somebody else gets back. He was a bit hungry after that exhausting swim which was excellent. Opening the cupboards looking for something to eat turned up almost nothing of value. There wasn't much left and they were going to need to restock supplies from the supermarket soon anyways but he did turn up some cups of pudding, bread, some meat, and cheese. At the least he could make himself a sandwich. Putting a big pile of meat onto the bread he lathered it in liberal amounts of mayonnaise before closing it. Raising it to his mouth, he took a big bite and grinned. It had been a while since he ate mayonnaise, in fact he couldn't remember the last time. But he did remember the taste and this was even better. It was so freaking good, it was incredible. Taking another big bite, he nearly moaned. Why didn't his mom use this stuff again and why didn't he try this before? It tasted amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished the sandwich in a few huge bites but not without casualty as some mayonnaise dripped onto his shirt and swim trunks. After he was done, Kendall so liked the taste that he had to lick the mayonnaise on his shirt (it was that good and why waste it?). He was still hungry so he opened up some pudding and all but devoured it. One thing all four loved with a passion besides singing and being friends was pudding. The pudding wars they had were epic and they learn to eat their pudding fast and enjoy it while you can before somebody else stole it. Licking the last of the pudding from his fingertips, Kendall looked around. He couldn't believe how much he ate already. Usually he was much more conservative with eating. Even more incredible was that he was still hungry, even after a big sandwich and pudding cups. Working out must have took a lot more energy or he could eat more than he thought. Picking up the trash, he threw it away as he wondered what else there was. Nothing really in their apartment and mom was getting new stuff that evening. Kendall was about to give up when he saw a card lying on the desk counter for pizza delivery. Since he was still hungry, Kendall decided to order pizza. It was going to take his mom a while to get back anyways and he could always save the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gigi's pizzeria, how may we help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hi. Um, I guess I would like a...medium? Yeah, a medium cheese pizza delivered to the Palm Woods? No, make that two please. Two medium pizzas to the Palm Wood,\" Kendall said, grinning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pizza finally came twenty minutes later. When he opened the door, the cute delivery girl was obviously checking him out but he ignored it, for the most part. She did have nice eyes though. Hurrying though, Kendall took the pizzas and paid, making sure to add a nice tip though because she deserved it. Smiling brightly, she thanked him and left and Kendall felt good for helping out, especially after earlier with his uncharacteristic behavior. He had not meant to be mean to Carlos but on the other hand, if it meant getting Logan, Carlos was going down. He was also going to pretend that he didn't feel the pleasure of saying exactly what was on his mind either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall sat down and opened the first box, inhaling the delicious scent of cheese. There was nothing quite like the smell of delicious pizza and although pudding was still king, pizza came in close second, just like Carlos's corn dogs or the dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. Breathing it in a few seconds longer, he took out a slice and started eating. Gigi's pizza was amazing as always and Kendall was glad he ordered it since it had been a while since he had it. The last time he probably had it was when Jo had left to do the movie in New Zealand. Gobbling it down fast, Kendall paused to get a drink from the refrigerator. Drinks always had to go with pizza so he got out a couple of cans of Dr. Pepper. Carlos had already finished off the cream soda, 'lucky bastard', Kendall thought, but Dr. Pepper was a very close second in the soda category. Normally Kendall was a smoothie person but he honestly couldn't be bothered to go and get one right then and it had been a while since he had Dr. Pepper. Snapping one open, he took a long couple couple gulps, choking a bit and burping loudly. Making sure to slow down, Kendall took another sip, sighing at the taste. So. Freaking. Good. Letting out another burp, Kendall took another slice of pizza, tearing into that one as well. Kendall soon got the rythm down of sipping every few bites and he went on auto-pilot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kendall next took a break, he was surprised to find he already ate half the first pizza. That still left one and a half to go but he was becoming a bit full after glutting himself on half a pizza and that massive sandwich and a number of pudding cups earlier. After all, there wasn't some sort of magic that expanded his stomach to unlimited capacity and he was reaching his limit. Although not near what Carlos eats on a regular basis, it was a start and farther than anything Kendall had expected himself capable, and man was he exhausted. Groaning Kendall stood up and took the pizza boxes to his room to hide them in since Carlos would never think to look there for food. Then he crawled onto his bed and collapsed there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does Carlos do this?\" he wondered and grudging respect was awarded. Kendall was stuffed and it hurt to move or even breathe a bit. Suddenly feeling the urge, he let out a quite impressively long and loud belch and afterwards, Kendall sighed in relief. That felt so much better and that had been incredibly manly. He was going to have to figure out how to do it again and beat Carlos in the next burping competition. Running his fingers over his bloated stomach, a pleasure Kendall never knew was coming over him. It felt so...so...well, he didn't know but it was good. It was solidly packed and playing with it was fun. He couldn't believe he had never done this before. This feeling was incredible and he had to do it again. Kendall lay their in a daze, fingers tracing over his stomach when he heard the front door open. </span></div></div>",

James wasn't quite sure since Kendall had been acting really strange lately, as was Carlos but Carlos always was a bit of a strange person. It wasn't a surprise with Carlos to do random things but Kendall wasn't himself lately. He just seemed...on edge or something. And he kept sending dark looks at Carlos and muttering. Actually, all three of his friends seemed to be acting weird because Logan was really buddy-buddy with Carlos and Logan wasn't as complaining of Carlos as he usually was. It was all very strange and sometimes James wondered if he hadn't fallen into another universe like that girl Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since apparently Carlos and Logan were dating. That was just weird. James had no problems with his friends liking other guys but it was weird because it was Carlos and Logan who were like extreme opposites. Carlos was all spontaneous, random, and energetic while Logan was carefully planning and attempting to control, think things through in advance, and was always a rather reluctant member in doing anything until he actually did it. He couldn't figure out how they took the leap from friends to more than. Or that they remained together because he bet money with Kendall and other Palmswood's people that they wouldn't last for long and they already broke Jame's guess of less than a day, which was how long many of Jame's relationships unfortunately were. Girls either got to clingy, got mad at him for stupid reasons, apparently using him to make someone else jealous because they thought he was gay (he had no idea where the girl got that impression), or they were super rich famous popstars that he couldn't remain with, etc. But that was okay since James' liked variety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a loud noise that pierced the air like a gunshot in the empty apartment and James rushed to investigate. It came from Kendall's room and he barged in, and stopped awkwardly. Kendall was rubbing his enlarged stomach that looked extremely uncomfortable in those tight hip-hugging jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...is everything all right?\" James asked, feeling stupid. Kendall yelped as he frantically looked around for a pillow to cover himself before he realized James had already seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I was just...aiding my digestion. I ate a big lunch.\" At that moment, another massive burp came out and it lasted for quite a few awkward seconds. \"Uuuuurrrrrrppppppppppp...excuse me,\" Kendall said, grinning awkwardly and hopeful. James stood there for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay, yeah whatever. I thought you were in trouble and uh...I guess you're not, at least in trouble with anything serious...er, I can help with that.\" Kendall raised his eyebrows when James walked over and placed his hands near the top of his jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" Kendall asked, blushing furiously at the images racing through his mind. James raised an eyebrow back (he was much better with the expression than Kendall was). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping, what did you think I was doing?\" Before Kendall could say anything about how that didn't explain anything, James already had his fingers looped through and Kendall's pants unbuttoned as he yanked them down. \"There you go,\" he said to the stunned Kendall. \"Your pants were far too tight on you then, if you're going on an eating binge, you should unbutton them before they get too tight and you can't undo them yourself.\" Smirking at the surprised look on Kendall's face, James stepped back. \"Hey, I used to be a fat kid too, before puberty.\" Kendall flushed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh, yeah, sorry about that.\" James shrugged. \"Yeah, I was too. Is there a particular reason why you ate so much? You almost never do that.\" Kendall flushed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....uhhh...\" James leaned forward eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this sounds good. I have to know now.\" Just as soon as Kendall opened his mouth to speak, there was another banging noise as Carlos and Logan walked in, laughing and making noise. kendall breathed a sigh of relief as James' attention diverted from him as he got up. Before he left, James paused at the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think that I have forgotten. I'll just have to ask you at some other time, when you least expect it. Be prepared Kendall Knight, be prepared.\" Giving an evil laugh that sounded odd coming from his mouth, James walked out and left Kendall there sweating. He couldn't have Logan and Carlos see this. Not yet anyhow. Kendall would have to be even larger before he could comfortably show off to Logan. Right now it was just a small compared to Carlos but that would soon change. </span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure what was changed since they were now in a dating relationship. Logan didn't have much experience in that area considering that the only person he ever dated was Camille and she was not the best example of a normal relationship. He liked her a lot but their on-again off-again thing was really confusing and they decided they were better off just as friends. She would not be the best person to ask for advice. Logan also had considered asking James and Mrs. Knight but those two wouldn't be much help either because although James was a total flirt, his relationships did not last that long either because he moved on to someone else or he flirted with someone else, did something stupid, etc. Mrs. Knight was an awesome mom in many things but she was just as hopeless if not more so than Logan was. An attractive single mom in her 40s with two kids who would scare anybody who was interested would not be the most help in dating advice, especially since it was probable she was going to end up a cat lady in the future. So he decided that the only way was the direct one and ask Carlos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanna scuba-dive, rock-climb, be on the inside of a volcano, throw water ballloons on people's head, see the world's biggest rubberband ball, ride a llama, sky-dive, cannonball in the pool, eat, watch movies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you just want to go see a movie and then eat?\" Logan asked and Carlos nodded excitedly. \"We can do that. And Carlos...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" asked Carlos confused. <br>\r\n\"Some of those...no, just no. And the world's biggest rubberband ball?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, its a ball of rubberbands and its big!' <br>\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Logan said dryly. Carlos just grinned as he grabbed Logan's hand. <br>\r\n\"What are we going to see?\" Logan thought about what Carlos was interested in before it struck him. <br>\r\n\"You want to go see that new Avengers movie?\" The look on Carlos's face was priceless as he jumped up and down excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean it's out? We need to see it NOW! I can't believe its out and nobody told me!\" Logan soon found himself being half-dragged, half-running behind an excited Carlos towards the nearby movie theatre who was woophing and yelling in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so good! It has Thor and Iron Man and the Hulk and that guy Loki who's like a cool evil version of you and this is going to be so good cause they're going to be looking for some cube thing and I want a hammer like Thor, do you think I could get one? That would be so cool to be able to summon lightning with a Hammer and smack bad guys with it because Thor is freaking awesome. Iron Man is cool too and Captain America! It's like a dream come true! Well, without the pudding, in my dream they all sat around eating giant buckets of pudding in a candy-cane forest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan stopped listening right there for his own sanity because it only got weirder from then on peppered with flying unicorns, rainbows, giant ant creatures from space, it must be one hell of a dream Carlos had. At least Carlos was excited and Logan admitted that Carlos's enthusiasm was rubbing off on him as well and Logan had also really wanted to see this movie as well. Unfortunately, Carlos decided to insist on snacks since it wasn't a proper movie without a giant bucket of butter popcorn and large drink. Logan couldn't understand how Carlos, or the others for that matter because they enjoyed it as well, could enjoy that buttered popcorn stuff. It was nasty and disgusting and was super greasy and they loved it. Logan was just fine with plain popcorn but they always put butter on their's. But Carlos wanted buttered popcorn and it made him happy and Carlos did look cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the line was long and was moving obnoxiously slow for some reason and they were only standing there for a few minutes before Carlos got bored. <br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" he asked and Logan looked at him. <br>\r\n\"No.\" They stood there in silence for a few moments longer before Carlos coughed and asked again. <br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" Logan actually face-palmed. <br>\r\n\"No, we haven't even moved yet. Do you think you could stand still?\" Carlos was bouncing on his feet back and forth and he stopped for a moment. <br>\r\n\"Huh what? Oh um sure.\" And Carlos did try. He managed to stand still for three minutes before he started humming under his breath and dancing. <br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" he started singing and Logan really wanted to facepalm himself. He loved Carlos but he was attracting too much attention right now. <br>\r\n\"Is it necessary-?\" Logan started to ask before Carlos gasped and shushed him. <br>\r\n\"You know it is Logie! Movies need popcorn, especially buttered popcorn. And corn dogs and pudding but I don't think they have those here so I brought some of my own.\" Logan turned and stared at Carlos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought corndogs to the movie theatre? Where?\" <br>\r\n\"Shush,\" Carlos said looking around suspiciously. \"Someone might be watching. They're here in this bag.\" <br>\r\n\"Then why are we waiting in line for popcorn if you already have a snack?\" <br>\r\n\"Because movies need popcorn, duh Logie! Sometimes you're a little slow.\" Carlos started dancing and singing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I love you like a love song, baby<br>\r\n I, I love you like a love song, baby<br>\r\n I, I love you like a love song, baby<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Selena Gomez?\" Logan asked and Carlos nodded excitedly in beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.\" It was admittedly cute even if a bit off-tempo and tone but they were beginning to draw a little too much unwanted attention so Logan did the only thing he knew that would shut Carlos up. He kissed him. </span></div></div>",

By the way, what is Swarma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Shawarma and I honestly don't know. Its a total mystery.\" The movie was good but Logan hadn't nearly been as into it as Carlos was. Although it probably didn't help that he missed a great chunk of the dialogue either because Carlos was laughing too hard, spitting, eating and drinking rather noisily (which did not make the people around them too happy and they were almost kicked out for causing a disturbance) and that he was too busy watching Carlos to pay very much attention. When he did manage to look over, Logan had no idea what was going on at all other than Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Hawkeye were trying to stop some sort of alien invasion. He was probably going to have to watch the movie again on his own to understand what Carlos was babbling about and he really did want to see it without distraction, no matter how sexy and cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the way Carlos had been so into the movie as he shoveled popcorn in his mouth. It would have taken the world ending or the building to collapse right on top of the screen to get his attention off it. If only Carlos was able to be so attentive at school, he would have aced his classes easy instead of mediocre and always needing his help, not that Logan minded giving. Carlos was still talking when something caught Logan's eye. It was a sign for an all-you-can-eat buffet restauraunt. With Carlitos's new appetite, they were going to need places like that where it wouldn't be weird for someone to eat tons of food, and was actually encouraged. Tapping Carlos to get his attention, Logan pointed at the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, want to go there for dinner? If you're still hungry of course,\" Logan said. Carlos gave him an 'are you kidding, no freaking duh' look as he nodded vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah of course I do. Those were just snacks at the movie theatre.\" Logan mentally choked at the thought of a giant tub of butter popcorn, a couple of corndogs, and pudding cups as 'just as snack' before the ramifications of that kicked in and he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you haven't ruined your appetite?\" Logan asked as he poked Carlos's belly. Carlos gave a little shuffle. <br>\r\n\"Not really but if we must go home...\" Logan shook his head. <br>\r\n\"No, it's okay Carlos. We can still get dinner. A growing boy like you all needs all the food he can get.\" Logan hit himself mentally. 'A growing boy?' Not at all creepy and diabolical sounding. Carlos nodded excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah exactly, you're so nice Logie-bear.\" Carlos gives Logan a big hug, squeezing all the air of of him while Logan struggled. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Car-Carlos, please let go. You're crushing me.\" Carlos quickly dropped him apologizing.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay, just...don't hug so tight. You might have cracked my ribs or something.\" Logan tenderly felt to see if they were. No, they seemed intact. <br>\r\n\"Are we going in?\" Carlos asked intensely. <br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" $12 each later and Carlos and Logan were in and Carlos looked around excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, there's a lot of good stuff here: mac 'n cheese, pizza, pasta, sliced ham, turkey, chicken, soups, salads, bread, etc. And oh my god the dessert, chocolate cake, icecream, jello, pie, and is that a chocolate fountain?!\" Carlos screamed excitedly at that and Logan covered his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screaming is not necessary Carlos. Use your inside voice inside remember?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Ahhh!!!!\" He screamed again quieter. Rolling his eyes, Logan put his jacket on the back of the booth. Getting a tray, he followed Carlos who was already filling his up. It was going to take a while longer for Logan to get used to this new appetite of Carlos but at the same time he couldn't help but feel a bit excited for what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan ended up getting just some spaghetti with meat sauce, bread, and a bowl of salad to start with. Carlos started with what seemed like almost everything and was already inhaling pasta as Logan sat down. Logan was finding it hard to concentrate on his own meal so he eventually gave up as he watched Carlos making good disappearance of a mountain of food. With the last few noodles being sucked down, Carlos ravenously dug into mac 'n cheese making noises of appreciation that made Logan's hair stand up. He wondered where on earth this ravenous hunger Carlos had was coming from but go on ravenous hunger! Logan even found himself egging Carlos on as he ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show those noodles that your boss, woo go Carlos! Yeah, go for the chicken!\" He was finishing the chicken when he slowed down for a moment and Logan was confused. <br>\r\n\"Huh, what is it?\" He asked worriedly. Carlos groaned in relief as he got his hands around the button of his pants and loosened them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were getting quite tight, but now I feel good,\" Carlos said, sighing in relief as his expanded belly surged forward a bit to claim space that had been denied. Letting out a massive belch, Carlos rubbed himself for a moment before launching back into the meal. </span></div></div>",

Thanks for taking me,\" Carlos said with a smile. Logan grinned back as he fiddled with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, hey, are you going to have dessert?\" He asked. Carlos shook his head. \"Nah, my tummy hurts. I don't think I could eat another bite.\" Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. I'll just bring some home then so you won't have to raid the pudding supply again and cause everyone to complain. Wait here, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\nHe waved over the waitress and put on his most ingratiating smile. \"Hey, mind if we take some dessert home? It would be much appreciated.\" The waitress who was abvout their age looked like they were about to say no before a flash of recognition appeared in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're Logan from Big Time Rush right?\" She asked excitedly. \"I love all your songs and think you guys are amazing! You're so hot!\" She batted her eyelashes at him as she surreptiously slid over a piece of paper. \"Call me,\" she whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, thank...you,\" Logan said. \"But can we?\" <br>\r\n\"Can you what?\" she asked blinking.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can we bring dessert home?\" Logan asked, wanting very much to run. <br>\r\n\"Sure. And if you want, you could even get extra,\" she whispered, touching Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Logan said pushing her away gently. \"We'll just grab our dessert and be going now.\" Rushing over to the desserts, he grabbed a box and started filling it with as much junk as he could cram in the fastest possible time. He wanted to get out of there before the waitress, Jenny according to her nametag, would try to tackle him. She certainly looked like she was considering it. Rushing back, he grabbed Carlos by the arm and pulled him up roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, let's go, let's go,\" Logan chanted as he half pulled-half pushed the befuddled Carlos in front of him out the door. Holding onto his pants, Carlos panted as he tried to keep up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..what is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Fan waitress who recognized us.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Carlos puffed. \"Okay, can we...can we slow down for a minute?\" Checking around, Logan stopped as he waited for Carlos to catch his breath. <br>\r\n\"O...okay, I think I'm ready,\" Carlos said panting. Trying to buckle his pants again, he pouted as it wouldn't stay together long enough. \"Mrs. Knight must be using a lot of detergent, my pants shrunk,\" Logan just shrugged, trying to keep from saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. Come on, let's go.\" It took a bit longer than usual to get to the Palmwoods since Carlos had to hold up his pants the whole time and had to rest a few times but they finally made it. When they got in, Carlos collapsed to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally....made it...\" he gasped. \"That...was...an eternity.\" Logan nodded in agreement before sitting down and letting Carlos have a few minutes to rest as he opened up a National Geographic and started reading. After he finished the article he started, Logan got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wanna get off the floor, the couch would be much comfier.\" A muffled sound was what Carlos made and Logan pulled him up,<br>\r\n\"Easy there, just moving you to the couch so your face doesn't have a permanent imprint of the floor. Carlos said something that sounded rude but Logan wasn't really quite sure and helped walk him over to the couch. Setting him down, Logan nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. How does that feel.\" <br>\r\n\"Better,\" Carlos said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so.\" Logan said sittting on the couch next to him and turning on the tv. \"That was fun tonight wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Carlos said, already entranced by the bright colors of the tv. Logan just smiled and looked over at the tan smooth tight-strechedness of Carlos's belly. Looking again to make sure no one else was there, Logan placed his hands on it and started rubbing. </span></div></div>",

Logan opened the container and started taking spoonfuls out and feeding them to Carlos. Carlos kept grunting manly, but that was okay. Logan loved it. Carlos wrapped his manly arms around Logan's waist and pulled him in closer to his lap. Logan grinded slightly, causing Carlos' manhood to stir in his tight jeans. Carlos grunted. After about 3/4 of the ice cream was inside of Carlos, Carlos let out a big massive manly burp. <br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUURPPPP!!!* Ugh..\" Carlos grunted and burped. Logan smiled giddily and kept feeding him. After a little bit, the button on Carlos' jeans popped off and the zipper went down by itself. Carlos' big hairy tan gut spilled out and flopped into his lap. Carlos grunted and let out a big manly fart. <br>\r\n\"*FAARRTT!* Ughh, damn baby, you're making me into such a pig aren't you?\" Carlos chuckled manly at Logan who was blushing.<br>\r\n\"Yes daddy, I want you to get so big and manly and protect me!\" Logan giggled. Carlos smirked.<br>\r\n\"Well baby, it looks like that's what's gonna happen.\" Carlos said manly and pulled Logan closer to him, pulling him into a kiss and dominating it.</span></div></div>",

Logan wasn\u2019t being serious. It just didn\u2019t make sense.<br>\r\n\tCarlos stood up. \u201cY-yeah, sure. Quit messing with me,\u201d he said, his voice a bit shaky. Logan looked into his eyes with a serious expression, as if deeply considering his next response. It lasted a moment, awkward accurately describing it.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere, maybe this will help.\u201d Logan leaned in and kissed him.<br>\r\n\tCarlos jumped back, nearly falling over his chair, and covered his mouth with his hand. He looked the most shocked and surprised Logan ever saw him in his life.<br>\r\n\t\u201cCarlos-\u201c before he could finish, the other boy had already bolted to his room and slammed the door behind him. Logan was left alone in the kitchen, silently berating himself for his obviously poor choice of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarlos paced the room frantically, trying to make sense of what happened mere moments before.\tLogan had kissed him. He replayed the moment in his head again, and again. Each time, he felt his face flush. He rubbed the sides of his head with both hands in frustration. This just wasn\u2019t right! It just didn\u2019t make sense! His band mate was attracted to him of all people. How could this be? How did everything go from normal to something so\u2026 confusing? He stopped and stared out into space. Besides the initial shock, he didn\u2019t find it unpleasant\u2026 Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. All Carlos really wanted was someone to be close to. So what if it wasn\u2019t a girl? He really did like Logan a lot. Times are different. As he thought about it, his desire for it to be true seemed to manifest and grow as images of him and Logan dating started blinking into his mind; holding hands, cuddling, kissing, and having\u2026 wait, what!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis face grew so hot that he thought his head was on fire, and his sporadic train of thought went full circle. This can\u2019t be true. There\u2019s no way for it to be\u2026 especially with his friend and band mate. Plus, Logan was into girls, or at least that\u2019s what he thought. But that small hope that they could be together remained amongst all of the doubts and chaos. He began to pace quicker as his thoughts continued swirling around to the point he had a headache. They went faster and faster until\u2026<br>\r\n\tThey just stopped\u2026 and all he thought of was pudding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He should\u2019ve been more tactful, he thought. He was usually more cautious to avoid situations such as this. That\u2019s the last time he goes out on a limb like that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door to Carlos\u2019 room swung open and he walked into the kitchen with a serious look, one that was unfamiliar on Carlos\u2019 visage. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCarlos -\u201c He didn\u2019t even glance at Logan as he passed by, grabbed a spoon, and opened the refrigerator. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan watched as he tore off the covering of a pudding cup and, in seconds, devoured its contents like he was a man on a mission: \u201cPudding genocide.\u201d Another cup\u2019s contents were demolished and its empty husk thrown aside for his next victim. Logan watched, amazed, as another two puddings met the same fate. All the while, Carlos\u2019 face had that same, serious and single-minded expression that was borderline angry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then there was a pause. This particular pudding cup\u2019s cover was especially stubborn, and Carlos couldn\u2019t seem to get up open. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan flinched as Carlos screamed, \u201cDamned pudding!\u201d before tossing it violently to the floor. Logan hadn\u2019t him seem him this angry since he tried that diet! Carlos stood there huffing while Logan bent down and picked up the slightly dented dessert. He carefully removed the covering and walked over to Carlos with the intention of handing it to him, but was caught by surprise when he saw Carlos\u2019 face. Amongst the frustration, he could see how torn and distraught Carlos really was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry if\u2026 what I did earlier upset you. We can just forget that it ever happened if you want.\u201d Logan said. He couldn\u2019t stand seeing Carlos like this. It would better just to have things as they were. He held out the pudding cup to his friend. Carlos glanced down at the dessert, then quickly back up to meet Logan\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA-Are you messing with me?\u201d Carlos choked out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWha- no, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201c<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy would anyone prefer me over somebody else?\u201d He interrupted. The question puzzled Logan. \u201cI mean I don\u2019t have much going for me. I-I\u2019m not as tall as you guys, a-and I\u2019m just not as attractive as you guys.\u201d He was talking quickly and sounded as if he was holding back sobs.  Carlos then motioned downward to the object of Logan\u2019s attention. \u201cAnd this. I\u2019m not as fit and trim as you guys and especially James.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan was the one thrown for a loop this time. Did Carlos really believe all these things? Has he always had this feeling of being inferior?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo tell me!\u201d he raised his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re just screwing around with me, right?!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two boys gazes never broke for the next few moments. Logan was left speechless by Carlos\u2019 emotional outburst, but as he stared into Carlo\u2019s eyes, glistening from held back tears, he could see something; Logan saw what looked like a small glimmer of hope in the shorter boy that Logan really wasn\u2019t playing with his emotions. Of course, he didn\u2019t see it literally, but it was more of a feeling in his gut. He had to break his mental word and go out on a limb one last time. He placed the pudding on the counter and wrapped his arms around Carlos, pulling him into an embrace. He embraced Logan back. That was a good sign. Carlos buried his face into his shoulder, and he felt him steadily calm down.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just so confused,\u201d he heard Carlos say.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you ever think you\u2019re not good enough for anyone just on those superficial things,\u201d Logan said softly. \u201cYou have much more going for you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that,\u201d Carlos mumbled into his shoulder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, what I like about you is that despite your inherent goofiness, you always have a positive air to you.\u201d Logan loosened the embrace and stepped back a bit. Carlos was wearing an expression akin to a sad puppy. Logan couldn\u2019t help but blush and chuckle a bit. He had to admit. Carlos was just too precious sometimes. \u201cYou also have this strange and irresistible innocence. Plus, you seem to forget you can sing and you are exceptionally cute!\u201d Logan felt his face blush even more after saying that last part.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carlos\u2019 expression then switched to one of skepticism.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were\u2026 that way, Logan. And if you were, why would you be attracted to me of all people, since I put on all this weight and all. What will people think!?\u201d They both could imagine all the magazines and tabloids plastering articles about the two band mates hooking up and one of them looking puffier than usual.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan smiled. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. I just like it. I like you, too. And maybe I just don\u2019t care what others would think.\u201d Though,  he still wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure about the last part of that statement. Carlos\u2019 eyes drifted off to the side. He was still skeptical. \u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d The taller boy put his hands low on Carlos\u2019 now-fleshier waist and pulled him close so their bodies touched. Then he kissed him again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Logan\u2019s hands scoured his shirtless back, his touch sending chills throughout Carlos. Kissing girls was nice, but this was just as good, if not several times better! All of Carlos\u2019 fears and doubts seemed to have vanished from existence at that moment. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carlos tasted sweet; like syrup and pudding (for obvious reasons.) It was wonderful, Logan thought. The feeling of Carlos full belly pushing against him was unbelievably hot, too. He lowered his hands to the shorter boy\u2019s waist to feel the softening area. Carlos was obviously loving this, because his hips starting a subtle motion that rubbed their fronts together. Something was coming over the both of them, and Logan wanted more of it. His hand went lower into the waist of Carlos\u2019 jeans, approaching the now fuller cheeks filling out his underwear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yep, some weight definitely took residence down there, too, Logan discovered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But as the boys were sucking face in the kitchen, the front door opened, and Ms. Knight came in.

She glanced around the room and moved towards the kitchen, but froze in her tracks at the sight of Logan and Carlos kissing, and they were really going at it!

She figured if she made her presence known, she could get them to stop without actually walking in on them. It would probably cause a bit less drama, but there was <i>going</i> to be drama one way or another. She opened it and closed it loudly before obnoxiously announcing, \u201cHey!

He was shirtless and his pants were still undone. If it was hard to do them up this morning, then it was impossible now with a belly full of pancakes and several pudding cups.

They were redder than before and looked slightly sweaty. \u201cAre\u2026 you boys okay?\u201d They both nodded and started towards Logan\u2019s room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Carlos entered, however, he stopped and turned back to Ms. Knight. \u201cOh, Can we go to the mall sometime? I need new pants.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, sure, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, thanks!\u201d Carlos said in his usual cheerful tone before entering Logan\u2019s room. The door promptly shut behind him. Jennifer blinked, a bit confused by the strange scene, but she just shook her head and got ready to leave, but noticed the empty pudding receptacles on the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoys! Make sure to clean up your mess!\u201d As far as Ms. Knight is concerned, the guys can kiss each other all they want, but what they <i>won\u2019t</i> be doing is leaving trash on the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay!\u201d they both responded from the room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan stood with his back to the door and sighed in relief. Carlos was sitting on the bed, smiling a wide grin. Then he busted out laughing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Logan asked incredulously.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was funny!\u201d Carlos said. He was obviously referring to what had just occurred. Logan didn\u2019t find it in the least funny (well, maybe a little), but he now realized he wasn\u2019t quite ready to let anyone see him kissing Carlos (at least like <i>that</i>) out in the open. Now he knew exactly how powerful teenage hormones were! Who knows what could\u2019ve transpired if Ms. Knight hadn\u2019t come home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan shook his head and sat next to him. \u201cWhatever you say, goofball.\u201d Carlos just looked at him with that same wide grin, happy, hopeful, and child-like. Typical Carlos. Logan decides\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He prodded Carlos to lay down and Carlos did so, a whoosh of exhalation pushing his zipper down again. They stared a moment and both burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you do need new pants,\" Logan said and Carlos twitched a little. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said his face blushing red. \"They were really hard to put on this morning.\" Logan chuckled as he fondled the exposed stomach. <br>\r\n\"I wonder why?\" he said, smiling to make sure Carlos knew he wasn't making fun of him. Carlos shrugged. <br>\r\n\"They shrunk a bit,\" he said simply. \"I haven't grown that much.\" Logan would beg to differ but Carlos would have to come to terms with it on his own.<br>\r\n\"So...want to continue?\" Logan asked, a smirk coming onto his face. Carlos looked confused. <br>\r\n\"Continue what?\" he asked and Logan grinned as he leaned over so he was looking down into Carlos's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he said as he place a kiss on Carlos's cheek. \"And this,\" he said as he did the other one. \"And even this,\"he said planting one on on Carlos's lips. Carlos stared up a moment before pulling Logan down on top of him, his mouth greedily seeking Logan's. Logan groaned low against him and Carlos pulled even closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of making out had passed, Logan pulled away smiling dazed as was Carlos. \"That was amazing,\" he said breathily. \"No wonder James is so obsessed. Kissing is wonderful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what do you think they're doing?\" Carlos asked. Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n\"I don't know. Hey, Mrs. Knight wants us to clean the kitchen. If we don't, she might wonder what we did while she was gone.\" Carlos pouted. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to.\" Logan rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"You have too, I'm not doing it by myself. Besides, it's easy.\" Carlos gave a sad puppy dog face which normally worked but Logan was too worried about Mrs. Knight for it to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go.\" Carlos grumbled a little but pulled on a shirt and yanked his pants up roughly, wincing as he did so as he struggled with the button. <br>\r\n\"Stupid pants, stupid mess,\" he muttered as he somehow managed to get them closed. Logan was already dressed and waiting. <br>\r\n\"Here, you clean the floor, I'll wipe up the stove.\" They worked in silence for a few minutes and when they were just about done, the door opened. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Kendall said coming in as he threw his hockey stick down. \"You should have come and played. We crushed the other team.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" James said. \"It was a lot of fun.\" Logan shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you didn't need us, besides, I was working on my project remember?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" James said. \"Did you finish?\" <br>\r\n\"Yep, it's a keeper.\" Logan replied proudly. <br>\r\n\"So, what did you do today Carlos?\" Kendall asked as he removed his hockey gear. \"You were still asleep when we left.\" Carlos looked panicked for a moment. <br>\r\n\"You know, I did...things...things that were fun...\" Carlos waved his hands in vague motions. James rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"It's probably better for us not to know Kendall. It's Carlos after all.\" Kendall chewed his lip for a moment but let it go when his phone rang. Picking it up he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jo,\" he said moving away. \"How were you today? I was playing hockey and...\" his voice got softer as he moved into another room. James shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Well I'm bored. Hey Carlos, want to play video games?\" Carlos squealed in excitement as he and James rushed to the spot and turned on the game system. Logan stood their shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, clearly I'm not invited.\" Carlos looked up having heard him.<br>\r\n\"Of course you are, Logie, come and play!\" Logan shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good. I'm going to check on my project and get the water boiling for when Mrs. K comes back,\" Carlos looked uncertain for a moment before shrugging. <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then.\" He turned his attention to the game as James loaded it up.  </span></div></div>",

Each bag had the logo of a small fast food establishment that wasn\u2019t too far from their building. Logan noticed Carlos\u2019 eyes light up at the sight and smell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cMrs. Knight, what\u2019s with all that food?\u201d Logan inquired, pointing to the bags in their hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cCourtesy of the house,\u201d she smiled triumphantly. \u201cThe owner is <i>such</i> a kind man.\u201d<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMom started a scene at the restaurant,\u201d Katie started, lugging her bags over to the table. \u201cShe and one of the employees nearly fought it out over some cold fries.\u201d Katie put a hand over her mouth to keep from laughing. There was no doubt she\u2019s had a hand in \u201cnegotiating\u201d the deal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cLong story short, we got free food,\u201d Mrs. Knight finished, joining her bags with the others on the table.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess we don\u2019t need the boiling water then,\u201d Logan said, turning off the stove.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cSorry about that, honey.\u201d <br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan shrugged and went over to the table with everyone else. Carlos was already digging through one of the bags, inspecting its contents. There were eleven bags, each with at least two burgers and an order of fries in it.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0James took a quick look into all of the bags. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of food, though.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tMrs. Knight nodded. \u201cIt is, but whatever we don\u2019t eat we can put away for later.\u201d With that, everyone sat down and started rummaging for what they wanted. When Logan took his seat next to Carlos, he wasn\u2019t surprised to see him almost done with one burger and shoveling a handful of fries into his mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThat night\u2019s dinner was a repeat of the previous ones. There was the bickering, the scolding, and all that other good stuff. Logan was just about finished with the last of his fill when he noticed Carlos plop the last piece of his third burger in his mouth and already reaching for the fourth with his other hand. Logan poked Carlos in the side, prompting him to turn with his cheeks still full.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSlow down a bit,\u201d Logan said, smiling. He gestured towards Carlos\u2019 unbuttoned pants and full-looking stomach. He simply shrugged and went back to stuffing his face. Honestly, Logan was unsure if he himself wanted him to slow down either...<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a while, everyone had eaten their fill and gone off to their own business, but Logan and Carlos remained at the table. Carlos was slowly finishing off, as far as Logan counted, his eleventh burger. Granted, they were all somewhat small, simple burgers with little on them besides basic toppings, but eleven is still a lot and that\u2019s not even mentioning the amount of fries Carlos managed to swallow in between them. God knows how many he\u2019s had. He truly was a spectacle when it came to eating. He swallowed the last bit and let out a large belch just as Katie came back in the kitchen.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow many burgers are left?\u201d she asked, peeking into the remaining bags.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwo? Maybe?\u201d Logan responded.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cTwo!? Wow, you guys just eat everything. I\u2019d think we'd have some left for tomorrow at least.\u201d She pulled one out of a bag and lamented, \u201cLooks like all the fries are gone, too.\u201d As if on cue, Carlos burped again. Katie didn\u2019t really need to know that he ate a majority of the food she and her mother brought home. Katie took her burger and left to her room.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou full now?\u201d Logan asked. Carlos just smiled at him sleepily and put his hands on his bloated stomach. He tried to stand, but stumbled back into his seat.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I need help getting up,\u201d Carlos said sheepishly. Logan offered his arm and helped pull him to his feet. They made their way to his room, and Carlos sat on his bed. Logan locked the door behind them to prevent any \u201cwalk-ins.\u201d <br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUgh, I feel like I\u2019m going to explode,\u201d Carlos groaned falling back on his bed. His engorged belly caused his shirt to ride up quite a bit past his navel, and its size made those pants look like a lost cause. \u201cCan you rub my tummy again?\u201d<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan lit up, but quickly concealed some of his excess excitement. \u201cSure, okay.\u201d This was the moment he\u2019d been waiting for since the last time Carlos went on a binge.  He sat next to him and placed a hand gently on his belly. When he started rubbing slowly, Carlos sighed and, just as Logan had hoped, started making those same irresistible sounds he made last time. It just made Logan\u2019s heart race. He switched to using both hands to survey its taught roundness and shivers went up his spine when Carlos let out a moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh, that feels so good,\u201d Carlos said groggily. Logan didn\u2019t appear to hear him as he tended to the overstuffed stomach, but when the overfed Carlos let out one final belch, Logan almost swooned. He changed his position so that he was lying on his side next to Carlos, supporting his head with one hand and continued rubbing with the other. He could so get used to this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Something felt off. Kendall didn\u2019t know what it was, but something was definitely off. Things just haven\u2019t been feeling right lately; Logan seemed to be hanging out less with him and James, and Carlos was always eating. Always. You would never see him without a corndog in hand or popping a chicken nugget or some other snack food into his mouth. Kendall also noticed that whenever some girl would approach either of them they showed very little, if any, interest. They weren\u2019t disrespectful, but their sudden disinterest was very strange and unlike them. They had secret girlfriends, perhaps?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At first, these were things that Kendall simply shrugged off, but a while ago, his suspicions rose when he had seen the duo at the mall. It seemed out of the ordinary, so Kendall hid behind a clothes rack. Carlos had come out of a dressing room and lifted up his shirt, so Logan could see, apparently. He had a small pooch of a belly and must have recently put some weight on (which was no surprise, really). Logan raised an eyebrow and stuck his index finger into the front of the waist behind the button, and it unsnaps with next to no effort on Logan\u2019s part. The open button allowed Carlos\u2019 extra girth to expand forward slightly, obviously relieved to have some room. Carlos blushed and said something, but Kendall wasn\u2019t close enough from where he was spying to hear. Logan just smiled widely as he handed Carlos another pair of pants to try on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until the second time he saw them at the mall while he was on a date with Jo that he really started wondering. He saw them both at the food court and Carlos had an amount a food someone his size probably shouldn\u2019t be eating in one sitting. They were just talking, but the way they looked at each other was\u2026 different. He couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it, but it was familiar and Kendall wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKendall, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jo asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, nothing. I just see Logan and Carlos over there.\u201d He points to them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go say \u2018hi!\u2019\u2019 Kendall grabs her arm before she runs off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cW-wait. That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll probably see them later anyway.\u201d Kendall could tell Jo was a bit suspicious. \u201cHey let\u2019s go into this store!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat store? It\u2019s full of girly pink stuff,\u201d she said with a raised eyebrow. Kendall realized that he would never go into such a store and shook his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s just go this way then,\u201d he suggested, starting in the opposite direction of Logan and Carlos.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright, whatever,\u201d Jo said, glancing in the other two boys\u2019 direction one last time. Kendall was just being weird today, she figured.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time later, Kendall stood near the counter, munching on a sandwich and trying to process his thoughts. Something was up with those two. They may act normal at home, but at the mall\u2026 As usual, it was a futile attempt that left him frustrated. His mother came into the kitchen and noticed his foul mood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKendall, is something the matter?\u201d she asked with concern.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something seems off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOff?\u201d She repeated. Mrs. Knight went into the refrigerator and poured herself a drink. \u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kendall took a moment to try to formulate his words. \u201cIt\u2019s about Logan. He\u2019s acting\u2026 different.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His mother took a sip from her glass. \u201cDifferent how?\u201d Kendall shrugged, prompting his mother to roll her eyes. It\u2019s difficult to help him if he can\u2019t formulate what the problem is. She thought he was just going through a mood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s acting a bit distant,\u201d he began, grabbing his mother\u2019s full attention once more. \u201cAnd I noticed he\u2019s been hanging out with Carlos a lot more.\u201d Mrs. Knight took another sip of her drink, her gaze drifting to the right. She knew exactly what was going on, but she wasn\u2019t going to rat the boys out. It wasn\u2019t her place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re all friends, so maybe Logan felt he was neglecting Carlos lately.\u201d Hopefully that\u2019d satisfy his curiosity. It was true to a point. Carlos sometimes seemed the odd one out of the four, even if it was usually not the boys\u2019 intent.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe.\u201d He sighed and finished off the remains of his sandwich. \u201cIt\u2019s still weird. Even at dance practice, our choreographer commented that the two had \u2018good synergy.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSynergy, hm? I see,\u201d she commented knowingly, amusement apparent in her voice. Kendall noticed and looked at her for a moment. It occurred to him that she may know something about this, but then again, it could just be her acting like she knows everything. Moms are like that sometimes. His mother looked at her watch and realized what time it is.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to be late. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much, honey.\u201d She pecked him on the cheek and leaves through the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later!\u201d Kendall was left along with his muddled thoughts, and they only intensified when he remembered how Logan and Carlos were around each other, laughing and smiling. And how Logan looked at Carlos and vice versa\u2026  They could\u2019ve been almost described as\u2026 intimate? Or maybe love struck was a better word? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that point he decided that so far, he had nothing to go on. He decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I need your help,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWith what?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI need to figure out what\u2019s going on with Logan and Carlos.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie blinked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve been acting differently,\u201d he explained. Katie had to agree, they weren\u2019t quite themselves. \u201cI\u2019m thinking they have secret girlfriends or something.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright, come with me,\u201d she commanded. They went into her room and she fished out an average looking stuffed bear. \u201cUse this.\u201d Kendall took it and turned it over in his hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d he asked. Katie groaned and pointed to a couple of holes where cords would fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt has a camera in it. Stick it somewhere you\u2019ll know they\u2019ll be and where they won\u2019t notice it, then you can watch it later for suspicious activity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Cool!\u201d Kendall exclaimed, but his amusement was short-lived. \u201cNow why, exactly, do you have one of these?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMany reasons,\u201d she responds coolly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLike?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grins mischievously. \u201cNone you need to know of.\u201d Kendall stared at her for a moment, suspicious of his sister, but decided to refocus on the main task at hand. He has Katie teach him how everything works and gets to work finding a nice spot for it when she leaves. After he figured he\u2019s done everything for now, he decides to change to go to the pool for a while. Hopefully, the bear-cam would catch something that would explain everything so he can be rid of all this suspicion and worry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now Carlos, on the other hand, felt like he was floating on air. His relationship with Logan had to be the best thing to ever happen to him since the invention of corndogs! And that\u2019s saying something. They managed to go on a few couple dates: mostly hanging out in the mall and other small things. One of their outings was to a buffet to celebrate the A+ Logan received on his project. Honestly, Carlos rather would\u2019ve stayed home and made out with Logan, but he said they might get bored of it if they did that too often. That sucked, but Carlos could understand. Of course, they also had to keep the thing they have secret (which also sucked), but things can\u2019t always be perfect.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He got dressed; pulling on a shirt and one of his new pairs of pants. The pants fit nicely and without issue, though they were a bit snug in the back. Logan said that Carlos\u2019 butt was getting big, but he dismissed it as harmless teasing. His shirt did feel a bit different, though. He looked down, and noticed that his stomach made quite an outline from under it, but he shrugged that off and grabbed his helmet (because it felt like a helmet day to him), giving it a few pats to hear that cool sound it made. Right now he wanted some pudding! And maybe a corndog or two.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he exited his room, he saw someone sitting on the couch. It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carlos noticed that Logan was on the couch, reading a book. He hadn\u2019t seen him all day, and seemed to have forgotten about his snack craving for the moment. He went over and hopped over the couch so he was beside Logan. The other boy noticed when he plopped himself down and smiled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, Carlos,\u201d he said before returning to his book. It looked like a biology book or some medical journal, but Carlos couldn\u2019t tell from where he was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHi,\u201d he returned. It went quiet. Logan was fully immersed in his reading and Carlos just stared at him. It wasn\u2019t until after the whole kissing incident that Carlos noticed how hot Logan was. His lips just looked so delectable\u2026 Carlos just wanted to attack him and immerse himself in that amazing rush of making out! <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he was at an impasse. How would one initiate something like that? So far, Logan had been the one to start all of the kissing, but he didn\u2019t seem to be thinking about that at the moment. Carlos was getting antsy. He tried to remember exactly how Logan started things, but everything before each account was a blur. The kissing was just that good. So, being Carlos, he\u2019d thought he\u2019d just ask.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLogan?\u201d he said, grabbing the other boy\u2019s attention. \u201cWhen you want to\u2026 do stuff, how do start?\u201d Logan stared at him for a moment, but figured out what he meant. He glanced to the side, in the direction of the television, for a second before scooting a bit closer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you mean-\u201c Carlos smiled and nodded excitedly before he finished.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah! I mean, it\u2019s just like with a girl, I guess, but I figured it could be different with two gu-\u201c Logan placed two fingers to Carlos\u2019 lips to cut him off. Carlos looked cross-eyed at Logan\u2019s fingers, wondering what he was doing. The other boy turned his head towards the television, as if someone was watching, and Carlos did the same, trying to see if there was something there, grabbing Logan\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Logan then leaned in close and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything about us here. I think someone has a spying device in that bear.\u201d Carlos furrowed his brow incredulously and made a noise that sounded like \u201cHuh\u201d with Logan\u2019s fingers still obstructing his mouth. Logan made a small gesture with his head towards the television, and Carlos turned his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d he whispers when Logan finally lowers his fingers from his mouth. There was a plain looking stuffed bear sitting on top of the television set. Now that his attention was brought to it, it seemed strangely out of place. Carlos got up and walked up to it. He stared at it for a bit, and then changed angles a few times to get different views of it. He couldn\u2019t tell for sure, but there could definitely be something in it. What other business would a stuffed bear have being in the living room, anyway? Carlos started making goofy faces at the bear and chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After his fun, Carlos stepped back a bit. His gaze was still locked on the toy when he felt Logan\u2019s hand (he knew exactly how Logan\u2019s hands felt now) grab his and pull him in the direction of Logan\u2019s room. Logan closed the door and threw his book to the side. He quickly took Carlos\u2019 helmet off and it, too, joined the book to the side before Logan pulled him into a deep kiss.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd just to answer your question,\u201d he began before kissing the shorter boy again, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019ll probably just happen. Like this.\u201d Carlos probably only heard every other word as he was becoming fully immersed in the feeling of Logan\u2019s lips on his, the warmth of his breath, and the sensations caused by Logan\u2019s roaming hands.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked around to see if Logan and Carlos were around. As far as he could tell, they weren\u2019t home. He took the opportunity to hook the bear up to the TV and start watching whatever it captured. He fast forwarded past the parts where Logan and Carlos weren\u2019t involved. The living room was mostly empty, so Kendall was beginning to think he shouldn\u2019t hope for much. He should place the bear elsewhere next time. James came in as Kendall was watching, but he paid him no attention.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d James asked, causing Kendall to jump.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWoah!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThought you were one of the other guys.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOther guys?\u201d he inquired. He took a seat next to his band mate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLogan and Carlos. I\u2019m investigating.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 James turned his attention to the screen. \u201cSo you noticed something strange about them, too?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYup, so Katie let me borrow her spy bear thing.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0James looked puzzled. \u201cWhy does Katie have a spy bear?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBeats me,\u201d Kendall said with a shrug. At that moment, something caught his attention on the screen, and he returned the video to normal playing speed. It was Logan! His excitement lessoned when he noticed he was just sitting there reading, but it quickly returned when he saw Carlos come in and hop on the couch. They greeted each other and sat there for a few moments.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCarlos is looking a bit, awkward,\u201d Kendall commented.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd kinda\u2026 chunky,\u201d James added.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf course. All he does is eat all day.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he doesn\u2019t care if he becomes a fat slob, that\u2019s his issue.\u201d Kendall\u2019s tone caught James a bit off guard. It sounded a bit\u2026 cold. \u201cNo one will give him a second look if this keeps up.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait, I think he\u2019s saying something.\u201d \t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both boys leaned forward when Carlos started talking. Was he asking for girl advice? Logan glanced directly at the camera, and then closed the distance between Carlos and himself. Logan said something and Carlos grew excited. He started talking again, but Logan stopped him with his hand, putting fingers to Carlos\u2019 mouth before turning back to look directly at the camera and whispering something in Carlos\u2019 ear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy does Logan keep looking at the camera?\u201d James asked, \u201cDoes he know that it\u2019s there?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201c<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d a voice very nearby called out. Both boys screamed and nearly jumped out of their skins. They turned around to see both Carlos and Logan leaning on the back of the couch behind them. \u201cWho are those handsome guys on the TV?\u201d Carlos continued. Both he and Logan were smiling, giving the other two the \u201cbusted\u201d look.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, uh, hey guys!\u201d Kendall began nervously. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back so soon.\u201d Carlos and Logan nodded slowly. Carlos then started to laugh and point at his own silly faces he made into the camera that previous day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, Carlos,\u201d Logan said, tearing him from his amusement, \u201cI\u2019m guessing there was, indeed, a camera in that bear.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt seemed so,\u201d Carlos agreed. \u201cBut why would our friends want to spy on us?\u201d Logan shrugged, and made an \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 face. Kendall and James looked at each other several times in between Logan and Carlos\u2019 amused and accusing stares. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was Kendall\u2019s idea!\u201d James yelled out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat!?\u201d Before Kendall could say anymore, James had already bolted for the door. Of course, James was right about it being Kendall\u2019s idea, but now it was just Kendall with egg on his face with the other two. He gave a nervous laugh before he, too, made a quick exit. Logan and Carlos simply watched as he literally flew out the door. They stood there, still leaning on the couch, before they started laughing. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, wow.\u201d Logan calmed himself a bit and said more seriously, \u201cthey\u2019re getting suspicious. We need to be more careful.\u201d Carlos nodded and Logan gave him an affectionate squeeze on the shoulder before heading into the kitchen. Once Logan had busied himself with something, Carlos turned back to the screen, looking a bit troubled. It was still playing. The living room in the video was empty, so that was most definitely the part where he and Logan were making out in the other room. He smiled inwardly, but his mood was still on the drop.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unbeknownst to the other two, Carlos had returned home when they were in the midst of talking about him. Logan came in a bit later, and didn\u2019t hear what they had to say about Carlos\u2019 recent gain. It was the latter of Kendall\u2019s comment that hit him. No one will give him a second look if this keeps up. That statement reminded him of what Logan told him before their secret began, \u201cas long as you remain at an acceptable limit.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carlos lifted up his shirt and seriously inspected, for the first time in a while, the damage of his unleashed appetite. He no longer had just a bit of chub around the middle; he had a real belly going on. It was definitely bigger, and even with the shirt down, it was noticeable unless he really sucked it in. He put both his hands on its sides, and felt its softness and its round, smooth shape. He liked it, and he knew Logan did, too, but how much would be an \u201cacceptable limit?\u201d Would Logan stop liking him if he went too far and got too big?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCarlos, are you hungry?\u201d Logan called from the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m putting some chicken nuggets in the oven.\u201d Carlos grew giddy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStarving, actually!\u201d He pulled his shirt down and went into the kitchen with Logan. His regular mood came back now that he was about to get some food, but in the back of his mind, Kendall\u2019s comment still ate at him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Screw it he thought, if I wear this that boy is going to like me right away. He picked 300 points from his pile and put it in the center of the board.<br>\r\nHe read:'here you get a tight shirt, when rented!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos knew the drill and asked for the same colour as the shirt in the picture: White.<br>\r\nThe shirt was immediately on his exposed body instead of in his hands this time.<br>\r\nCarlos looked in the mirror and saw that his biceps looked really big in this shirt, but they weren't even that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had waited really long, but now it was his turn.

A lot of cameraman and women shooting pictures of models! The boys saw a lot of big models sitting on a couch, but none of them were Charlie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked further until they saw that the boy who stood for the green screen getting photographed was Charlie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big legs and more than average bulge stretching his very sexy g-string, his beefy arms, his big pecs pushing out of his body, his eight pack forming under it, his big wide shoulders up to his sea blue eyes and his short blonde hair! His face was beautiful, nothing like a brute as all the other bodybuilders but really a model! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked away from the camera for a second and saw four fat boys standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked the camera crew to photograph someone else for a minute and walked to the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello I'm Charlie, what are you guys doing here!?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we're..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you guys are, but I thought that you guys were a little more... muscular?\" he flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, we had a little...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan elbowed Carlos:\"Snack problem!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie didn't know what to say, but he felt really drawn to Carlos. Everyone always told him that he was prefect, that's why he preferred guys who had a belly but muscular guys weren't bad either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie saw that Carlos's belly was really funny, he thought that his new body made him more handsome.

Sure enough, the source of which was young Naruto Shippuden training vigorously with the wooden and straw combat dummies.  Shirtless, revealing his toned, muscle bound torso, wearing his trademark headband, and intensely focused, the young man delivered an impressive combo against one of the remaining straw dummies, finishing it by sending a chakra blast its' way, blowing it clean in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, Naruto leaned back as the afternoon sun beat over his sweat glistened body, causing him to exhale exhausted as he grabbed a towel and wiped down.  \"Hehe, and that's why I'm the best,\" the blond said to himself as he finished wiping down.  As he did, he stopped and sniffed himself, reeling back.  \"Whoa, talk about rank...I should probably fix that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the young man headed over to the training grounds hot springs to bathe himself.  Wearing only a towel and his headband, the boy stepped inside the warm water and bathed in peace.  Unbeknownst to him, someone else had stepped into the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Naruto immediately stumbled, covering himself and hiding in the steam.

As if answering for him, Naruto's muscular bare stomach let out a vicious growl, causing Naruto to smirk with embarrassment as he rubbed the back of his head.  Sasuke shrugged, then said, \"Well, I'll be outside.  Hurry up,\" then took his leave so Naruto could clean himself in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Naruto got dressed and headed out to Ramen Ichiraku with Sasuke.  \"So what's the occasion?  Why are you being nice to me all of the sudden?\" asked Naruto suspiciously.  Sasuke simply smiled innocently and said, \"No reason, I just figure it's easier if we all get along, rather than always going at each others throats.  And what better way for us to get along than by me watching you eat twice your body weight in ramen?\" he said, half jokingly as Naruto did tend to overdo it every time he had ramen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two sat down and ordered, Naruto's stomach once again groaned impatiently.  He rubbed it assuring and thought, \"Don't worry, you'll get your fill soon enough.\"  With that, ramen was served.  Naruto sniffed the broth for a moment, and moaned in pleasure before taking his chopsticks and scarfing down his noodles at an inhuman pace.  Sasuke simply watched in amazement.  \"I never realized before today just how fascinating it really is watching you eat,\" Sasuke said as he ate his ramen at a much slower rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing his first bowl, Naruto was immediately greeted with a second, which he immediately began chowing down rapidly.  After a little while, bowls upon bowls of ramen began to pile up.  Sasuke was long since finished, but still watching Naruto continue to stuff his face with almost admiration, particularly just how much his stomach began to expand with each bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time...</span></div></div>",

Thanks a bunch, Sasuke!\" said Naruto.  Sasuke simply nodded with a smile on his face, fixated on Naruto's ballooned belly.  From simply sitting next to him, Sasuke could hear Naruto's extended stomach churning and working on his hearty meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most impressive, I have to say,\" said Sasuke, catching Naruto's attention. <br>\r\n\"What is?\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n\"You.  I don't think I've ever really appreciated just how much you can actually make yourself put away, but seeing it today, really is quite remarkable.\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm....thanks?\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously, not many people can push their body to these kinds of limits.  If you think about it, it really is quite a talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced back, considering what Sasuke just said, then glanced back at his bloated middle, rubbing it contently before nodding, almost agreeing with him.  \"Yeah, I guess I can see that.  That would explain why I can always beat Sai or Kiba at ramen eating contests, right?\"  Sasuke nodded and said, \"Exactly, because they can't push themselves as far as you can.\"  Shocked at hearing an actual complement from Sasuke, Naruto did a double take, and almost dropped his jaw.  \"I'm sorry, if I didn't know better, I'd say you just complemented me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*GGGGUUUUUUUURRRRRRGGGGGLLLLLE!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped, then clutched his stomach, catching Sasuke's attention.  \"Something wrong?\" he asked.  Naruto was about to reply, but a rush of air worked its' way up his throat and out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped in his traditionally loud fashion, extending a few seconds before coming to a close.  Blushing, Naruto rubbed the back of his head and grinned innocently before muttering \"Eheheh, excuse me\" quite sheepishly.  Sasuke smirked then said, \"Also quite impressive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Naruto had to do a double take at the boy before asking, \"Don't you usually get pissed whenever I burp like that?\" asked a confused Naruto.  Once again, Sasuke simply smirked and shrugged.  \"Like I said, I didn't have an appreciation for it at the time.\"<br>\r\nNaruto simply stared for a moment, then asked \"...For my burping?\"<br>\r\n\"For you.  It's taken me a little while to realize, but you're a rather impressive specimen, Naruto.  You work hard, you fight hard, you eat hard.  Everything you do, is to the max.  Not many people ever bother to put 110% in every little thing they do, that's what I can't help but admire from you.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's...actually one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me,\" responded Naruto, smiling cautiously at Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Sasuke asked, \"So, ready for round two?\"</span></div></div>",

Damn near salivating at the sheer smell of the broth, Naruto dug right in as Sasuke once again, simply watched.  Hungrily, the boy scarfed down the noodles and promptly grabbed the edge of the bowl and slurped down the remainder of broth left behind and immediately moved onto the next bowl.  Sasuke simply watched, still admiring Naruto's vastly expanding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the second bowl in this second batch, Naruto leaned back in his seat, rubbing his quickly filling up stomach.  Sasuke smirked and raised an eyebrow to the boy.  \"You're not quitting on me <i>now</i>, are you?\"  Naruto simply glanced back at Sasuke and scoffed.  \"Pfffft, dream on, it's just getting a little cramped inside,\" responded Naruto as he clutched his belly firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke leaned in and patted Naruto's belly as he said, \"Then perhaps you outta make some room.\"  Unaware to Sasuke however, his patting has loosened some of the excess pressure cramping space in Naruto's tummy, forcing out a low but lengthy <i><b>*uuuUUuuUuUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPppppp!*</b></i> right in his face.  Smiling with relief, Naruto thumped his gut and said, \"Ahhh, goooood idea,\" then got back to work, as Sasuke was still almost dumbstruck from direct impact.  \"That was wonderful,\" Sasuke thought to himself as he maintained composure and resumed watching Naruto stuff himself further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Naruto's belly had expanded a considerable amount, pushing his jacket and shirt to their limits.  All that remained was one last bowl, which Naruto was on the verge of consuming, when out of nowhere, Sasuke placed his hand atop Naruto's bloated midsection, catching his attention.  \"Hey, what the hell are you doing?\"  asked Naruto.  Sasuke smiled back and said, \"Forgive me, but, I just want to feel it grow as it works on your next mouthful.\"  Naruto pondered for a moment, then with a shrug, unzipped his orange jacket, and pulled his shirt up, exposing his bare bloated belly to Sasuke, whose eyes widened as soon as he saw his pale flesh.  \"Well, then you may as well feel the real deal, but if your hands are cold or dirty, I'm kicking your ass.\"  Sasuke simply bit his lip and smiled as Naruto downed the last bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke could feel the contents of Naruto's vastly bloated stomach slosh around as more of the noodles entered and expanded on it.  Naruto's flesh was taut and soft, felt absolutely wonderful to the touch.  Finally, Naruto had finished consuming what remained of his 24th bowl of ramen.  He then leaned back, letting his gut protrude outward over his pants, as he sighed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....So how do you feel, champ?\"  asked Sasuke.  Naruto simply moaned as Sasuke could feel a violent churning emanate from Naruto's stomach as several gas bubbles worked their way up his throat and, of course; Naruto, being Naruto, opened his mouth wide and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*bbbBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP!*-*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRR RRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bassy two part belch immediately blasted from his lips and out to the surface, reeking of chicken broth.

Finishing up, Naruto licked his lips then placed the bowl aside before getting to work on another.  Sasuke watched in utter awe.  The boy's volleyball-sized stomach was already at its' maximum capacity, but somehow, it continued to expand ever so slightly with each bowl Naruto slurped down.

Turning curiously, Naruto raised an eyebrow.  \"Huh?  Yeah, well, not quite, but that's fine, I don't want to bankrupt you,\" responded Naruto as he chuckled sheepishly.  Smiling, Sasuke patted Naruto's bloated gut in an assuring manner, causing it to jiggle just slightly, and said, \"Nonsense.  It's worth it to see what your real limits are.  So don't worry.  Eat until you can eat no more.\"  Naruto's eyes widened at the notion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining his swollen belly, he knew he was already pretty full, but how full did he REALLY want to be...?</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to disappoint Sasuke, as he finally got Sasuke to be nice to him somehow, and he didn't want it to stop. With this new drive, Naruto then took the next bowl, and he began to stuff even more ramen into his face, eating as if he wasn't this full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's eyebrows were raised, as he was genuinely impressed. Naruto was concentrating on the ramen, though, so he was completely ignorant to everything around him. Seeing that Naruto was trying so hard, and seeing that Naruto would probably not care anyway, Sasuke began to slowly rub Naruto's belly again, making sure to make as much room as possible. Sasuke was enjoying the feel of the hard, fleshy orb with a smooth surface, and he practically felt every inch of Naruto's abdomen, feeling gas escape occasionally, corresponding to a small belch between bites for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted in thanks as he continued to eat the ramen more and more tentatively. With each passing bowl, Naruto's overfilled belly continued to stretch out slightly farther. Soon enough, Naruto stopped, and was close to giving up, the stretching of his belly beginning to become painful. Luckily, he had the Kyuubi's chakra, which expedited any healing, which included an overly stretched stomach. For most people, their stomachs probably would have burst, or at least they would have been close, but Naruto's stomach was able to stretch and heal much faster thanks to the Kyuubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto said, \"Thanks for that.\" to Sasuke, who was still gingerly massaging Naruto's massive stomach, which was now as tight as a drum. Naruto took about five minutes to recover, and he was actually having a normal conversation with Sasuke.

His hand then reached the middle of Naruto's belly and patted it gently, then asked \"Think you got any more room left?\"  A look of uncertainty grew across Naruto's face.<br>\r\n\"I'm actually starting to feel pretty full...\"<br>\r\n\"I imagine you would.  Still, it's just a little more, right?

This should help a little bit.\"  With those last words, Sasuke pressed down atop Naruto's sore stomach with just the right amount of pressure, resulting in Naruto letting out a loud, drawn out belch for a good few seconds straight.

His determination was truly something to be admired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was very thankful for Sasuke's help, as he was sure he would have given up long ago without Sasuke's relaxing massages.

Suddenly, a sizzling aroma caught his nose, slowly waking him from his food induced slumber.  Naruto's eyes flickered open as he sat up and turned towards the kitchen.  Much to his surprise, Sasuke was already wide awake, and cooking what appeared to be a breakfast for a family of twelve.  \"Sasuke...?\" said Naruto as he groggily rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sunshine,\" responded Sasuke as he poured more batter into a frying pan.  Looking down, Naruto placed his hand atop his no longer swollen middle.  Thanks his fast metabolism, his massive ramen meal from last night had been all but digested and worked down, leaving onto a tiny layer of pudge atop the young man's stomach, otherwise completely unnoticeable.  \"Wow, can't believe I actually managed to digest all of that..\" he said with astonishment.  Turning his attention back to Sasuke, he rose from the couch and approached his teammate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a little breakfast to kick off the day.\" responded Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"....A little....?\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, well, to someone who can stomach it, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Naruto got the message, then went wide eyed as he examined the various stack of plates piled onto the dining table.  Scrambled eggs, a mountain of bacon, pancakes covered in syrup, rice balls, and buttered toast, as far as the eye could see.  The mere sight of such a vast feast made Naruto's mouth water with anticipation.  Noticing this, Sasuke smirked and said, \"Hope you're not TOO full from last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to refute his point, Naruto's stomach growled hungrily, causing Naruto to grin sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his head with slight embarrassment.  \"Ohhh, I think we'll be fine on that front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto washed up, and the two sat to breakfast.  Sasuke poured Naruto a cup of milk and served himself a modest plate of bacon and eggs, while Naruto; overwhelmed by the surplus of choices, stacked whatever he could on his plate, immediately going for his fork and knife as he eyed his breakfast hungrily.  \"Bon appetite,\" said Sasuke as he slowly bit into his breakfast, eyes completely fixated on Naruto, who immediately began to inhale is breakfast at a record pace, as though he hadn't eaten in months...</span></div></div>",

Imagine how effective it could be if we combined it with a little cola in the mix.

The more he ate, the further out his stomach distended.  Gradually, it began to push outward, lifting up the bottom of his t-shirt, exposing his bare stomach, just below his bellybutton.  Simply staring at his exposed flesh, Sasuke could already picture how taut and soft his flesh would likely begin to feel around this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed, and more of Sasuke's massive pile of breakfast was deposited straight into Naruto's gullet, which had now pushed out so far, that his t-shirt rose completely up, exposing his bloated belly now pushing outward like a basketball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Naruto's pace began to slow down.  Sasuke took a glance at his face, and knew that he was starting to feel a little stuffed.  \"Oh man, don't think I've ever had that many flapjacks before...\" Naruto started, before glancing back at Sasuke and smirking back at him.  \"Would you do the honors?\"  Rubbing his palms together, Sasuke smiled back and said, \"I thought you'd never ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he placed both hands atop Naruto's distended stomach and began working his magic.

The final pocket of gas that Sasuke freed and the gas from the soda both escaped simultaneously, causing such a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was quite impressed, and Naruto felt so much better now that his stomach was relaxed. In fact, now that he saw all of the delicious food in front of him, his stomach even growled a bit, causing Sasuke to smile widely. Naruto then grinned at Sasuke before he stopped using his plate, opting instead for the platters that Sasuke had served his breakfast on, as he began pulling the platter of eggs towards himself, and Sasuke helped, pushing the other platters in front of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruto had a smorgasbord in front of him, and he was more than ready to begin stuffing again. Soon enough, he was stuffing food in his face just as quickly as before, astounding Sasuke with his speed and heft. As he ate, his t-shirt began to slowly rise up, exposing more and more of his flesh. Also as he ate, he occasionally took a swig of cola, then a massive \"UUUURRRPP\" was released, shaking his stomach, and shrinking it ever so slightly, only making more room in his stomach, causing him to gain a small burst in speed afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke merely watched, amazed as Naruto continued to stuff his face, the piles of food shrinking, and his stomach growing. Within ten more minutes, Naruto's stomach was large enough to lift his shirt to the point where his naval was exposed to the world. Naruto was again beginning to slow down at this point, and he began to focus more on the cola, leading to more belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Sasuke began intervening by...</span></div></div>",

You can work on that while I get to cooking up some more bacon and sausage,\" explained Sasuke as he got up and prepared to cook up more waves of food for Naruto to conquer.  \"Sounds like a plan.  If you don't mind though, I'm just gonna spend a few minutes relieving as much pressure in my belly as I can before then,\" responded Naruto.  <br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind at all.  Go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Naruto grabbed his cola and immediately began downing it straight from the bottle as Sasuke began to fry up some sausage over his oven.  Pulling the bottle from his lips, Naruto took a deep breath, and pushed out a loud, drawn out belch which shook his belly, making it jiggle a bit and echoed throughout Sasuke's small apartment, causing Naruto to laugh at his gassy eruption, and Sasuke to smirk with amusement as he continued to prepare the next course of breakfast.  \"Whew, that was LOUD!\" laughed Naruto as he patted his bloated belly with apparent pride as he continued to drink more cola.  Sasuke had finished with the sausage, and began to stack up a sizable pile atop a plate, and got to work on sizzling up as much bacon as he could fit on his pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spent a little while taking big drinks, and letting out pretty quick and decent belches almost immediately afterward.  It amazed Sasuke how Naruto could just push one out after another like that and not make himself dizzy or sick.  It was quite a display to behold, in truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naruto wasn't making anywhere near enough room for the next onslaught of food, so he decided to take it up a notch and began chugging his cola profusely from the bottle.  After a little while, Naruto stopped chugging, and greatly from drinking so much at once, which also caused his eyes to water slightly from the intense carbonation.  He then let out a quick but wet burp, then a sudden look of slight discomfort and immense focus grew over his face as he held his hand forward to get Sasuke's attention.  \"Oh, wait wait!  I feel a big one coming up,\" warned Naruto, just seconds before he pounded his open palm into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous and lengthy belch exploded from Naruto's mouth and carried on for several seconds straight, carrying with it, the scent of the immense first wave of breakfast Naruto had consumed.  When it finally drew to an end, Naruto sighed with immense relief and rubbed his bloated gut affectionately, then said, \"Y'know, *URP* these are some pretty good ones.  But it's still way more of a relief when you help.\"<br>\r\n\"It is?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah it is!  I get WAY more gas out when you're pushing it out as carefully as you do.  And the way it feels when you rub my belly...I can't even describe it, man...\"<br>\r\nSasuke couldn't help but blush at the complement, but he quickly regained composure before Naruto could catch it, and proceeded to finish prepping the bacon.  \"Well, thanks.  I'm just happy it helps.  I'd help now, but these hands are a bit occupied at the moment.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's cool.  I think I'm all burped out for the time being anyway.  That last one made tons of room,\" he said as he gave his slightly less bloated belly an assuring thump, still causing it to ripple from the motion.<br>\r\n\"Well, whenever you need further assistance, just say the word,\" said Sasuke, still masking his eagerness as he stacked up the bacon on a separate plate.  He then carried both plates and placed them down atop the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it, man.  Speaking of which, y'know what's odd?\"<br>\r\nSasuke shook his head as Naruto smirked to himself, and continued, \"You know that I've always kinda been a burping maniac.  But in all our time working, fighting or just hanging out together, I don't think I've ever seen YOU burp before.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?  Well, it's not THAT strange, is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, man.  I mean, everyone else does it.  Kiba's a belching maniac, Sai can let out some pretty good ones, even Sakura if you can believe it!\" said Naruto with a laugh, legitimately surprising Sasuke as he could never imagine such a girly girl like Sakura doing something so 'unladylike.'  Finally, he said with some embarrassment, \"Well, the honest truth is...I don't really know how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide eyed, Naruto shook his head and grabbed a glass, his big, bloated belly sloshing and jiggling all the way.  \"Okay, now THAT can't stand,\" he said as he filled the cup with cola and handed it to Sasuke.  \"Drink up.\"<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I really don't think-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't think, just drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the glass, Sasuke glanced for a moment, a bit uneasily, then sipped at the fizzy liquid.  \"ALL the way,\" said Naruto, making Sasuke grimace slightly before eventually gulping down the rest of it in one hearty go.  Sasuke wasn't used to chugging too much of anything, let alone soda, and the surplus of so much carbonation at once wasn't sitting right in his stomach.  \"Ugh, Naruto, I feel a little weird...\" said Sasuke as he grasped his thin stomach in discomfort.  Naruto nodded, then explained, \"That's just the gas building up.  If you wanna let it out, all you gotta do is gulp down a bunch of air and push it out of your stomach.  Like so!\"  To demonstrate, Naruto gulped down a considerable amount of air, and after a moment, he bopped his head forward and pushed out a quick, but audible belch.  \"Now, you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's times like this where Sasuke really wished Naruto used his words a bit more coherently.  He swallowed air, but all it did was make him feel even sicker.  \"Naruto, I don't think this is working...\" he said with more discomfort in his voice.  Suddenly, it clicked for Naruto.  \"Hold the phone, that's it!  We were just talking about how great you were at helping me to burp the gas out of my belly.  Just do the same thing you do with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke thought about it for a moment, and figured it was worth a try.  So applying a similar method that he would do with Naruto, Sasuke began to rub his own stomach tenderly, easing the pain a bit and feeling around for the gas pocket that was causing so much discomfort.  Granted, his stomach was still its' normal, perfectly toned size, but it felt just slightly bloated from the pressure building, which made it easier to eventually find the gas pocket that was causing his abdomen so much discomfort.  \"Here goes nothing...\" he thought to himself nervously, and then, he pressed against his abs firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's eyes widened as a massive, lengthy belch, unheard of from the young man, bursted out of his mouth like a fireball for several, loud seconds.  Naruto burst into a fit of controllable laughter as he held his distended sides and laughed himself to tears.  When it finally ended, Sasuke's face was flushed with embarrassment as he covered his mouth, still shocked that he could produce such noises.  Finally, Naruto wiped the tears from his face, still giggling and said, \"Damn, man!  I didn't know you had it in you!\"<br>\r\n\"Get in line...\" Sasuke said, still in a bit of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke sat there, processing, Naruto sat back at the table and began getting to work on the massive piles of food laid before him.  After a while, a small smirk grew over Sasuke's face.  That actually felt kind of good to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glanced back at the table, and...</span></div></div>",

Putting his cup back down on the table, Naruto sighed, then after a moment, clutched his gut with one hand as his mouth flung open.  A fairly audible but lackluster burp emitted from Naruto's mouth.  Sasuke stared curiously, \"Something wrong?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of discomfort grew over Naruto's face as he thumped his surprisingly still toned chest with his fist a few times, forcing out an even smaller and weaker belch.  Naruto groaned in frustration and mild discomfort.  \"Ah crap,\" Naruto started as he caressed his stomach slightly, \"I got a burp brewing, but it's stuck or something!  Would you mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you even need to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke carefully planted his hands atop Naruto's bare belly and began to rub away once again.  The feel of Sasuke's hand running slow circular motions up and down his bare stomach caused Naruto immense comfort as a wide smile grew over his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke rubbed away, he felt around, trying to find the gas pocket in question that was causing his friend such discomfort.  After a moment, he found a spot where Naruto's stomach felt as though it was rumbling slightly. \"Aha, there it is.\"  Said Sasuke as he began to massage this section of Naruto's stomach slightly then clutched it firmly.  \"Sometimes, you just need to apply a little more pressure to get the job done.  Like so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke pressed down on Naruto's upper belly firmly, and began to knead at it slightly, causing Naruto's gut to churn and rumble loudly, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive and lengthy belch rushed up Naruto's throat and out his mouth, carrying on several, audible seconds straight, once again causing his belly to deflate slightly from the expulsion of so much gas exiting Naruto's stomach at once.  This one lasted even longer than his previous eruptions, and was considerably louder.  Neither Sasuke nor Naruto himself realized such noises could erupt from a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after his burp drew to a close, Naruto sighed with immense relief and leaned back in his chair, letting out a smaller burp afterward.  \"Goodness, that was a big one, Naruto!\" said Sasuke, as he patted Naruto's belly proudly.  Naruto smiled weakly as a smaller burp escaped his lips.  \"Whew, remind me to-*URP*-ugh, give you a call next time Kiba challenges me to a burping contest!\" responded Naruto, causing both boys to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we continue?\" asked Sasuke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasuke got his answer, as Naruto didn't need to be told twice before he began digging in to his food again. He wasn't quite as vivacious as when he began, as he had eaten quite a lot already, but he still ate with much more vigor than anyone would at that point. Sasuke smiled in approval as Naruto stuffed himself, excited that he had such an eager subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was beginning to fall into a trance as he watched Naruto's belly. It very gradually grew with each bite or gulp of cola, and with every movement Naruto made, it jiggled a bit, wobbling around in response to the motion. The motions were very mesmerizing to Sasuke, and he couldn't help but stare. Naruto didn't really mind. In fact, he barely noticed that Sasuke was staring at his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto ate more of the breakfast, he began to feel pains in his stomach again, causing him to slow down. Sasuke's trance was broken by the sudden motion of Naruto's arm, which was pointing at his belly. Sasuke got the message, and he gladly began to massage the fleshy orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, it was taut again, and it wobbled at the slightest touch. Sasuke was careful and gently, scanning for gas pockets as usual. He would work out the gas pockets, causing Naruto to belch, then sigh, before he went right back into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis system worked for quite a while, as Naruto was able to finish a considerable amount of the meal that he was presented with. By this time, his stomach was nearly as large as it was with yesterday's binge. Naruto was now feeling a different discomfort, and it was clear that he was, as he slowed down considerably. Sasuke thought that he was doing a good job with the belly rub, so he thought Naruto was getting full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, to Sasuke's surprise, Naruto stopped. He then began trying to push his belly in so that he could unbutton his pants. At that point, Sasuke realized that Naruto  wasn't getting full. His belly was merely being restricted by his pants button. Sasuke went to help him, pushing his belly in so he could unbutton his pants. Once the button was undone, Naruto's belly surged outward a good inch, loosening a bit, and even freeing up a decent belch, which quickly and loudly escaped Naruto's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sasuke! That feels soooo much better!\" Naruto practically blurted out, with Sasuke responding with a mere \"No problem.\" before he smiled, saying, \"There's only a bit left. Do you think you can finish it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took that as a challenge, asserting \"Of course I can! I ate all that ramen last night!\" before he went back to the food, determined to prove to Sasuke that he could handle all the breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was amazed with Naruto's determination, and he was taken aback by the speed of Naruto's eating, especially given the fact that he had eaten so much already. He then went back to rubbing Naruto's belly, still astounded by Naruto's endurance. In less than ten minutes, Naruto was finally finished, ending with a final loud belch, grinning widely at his accomplishment, patting his overstuffed stomach, which was the nearly the size of a small beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke began to clear the table, and Naruto said, \"Hey Sasuke...\"</span></div></div>",

Smiling back, Sasuke nodded and said, \"Anytime.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, funny you bring that up, because I was wondering...do you have anything else to eat?\"  Sasuke almost did a double take upon hearing that.  Eyebrows raised, he responded with, \"You actually have room?\"  Smirking, Naruto slapped his bare rounded belly, causing it to jiggle slightly as a result and said, \"To the absolute limit, right?\"  Sasuke was quite surprised to hear him say that, as his stomach had already neared its' size from yesterday night.  He was unsure where this new found vigor was coming from, but if it meant watching Naruto continue to push himself and his gut to the limit, far be it for him to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you put it that way, Kiba actually dropped something off the other day,\" said Sasuke as he headed towards his fridge and hauled out a surprisingly large platter of bbq ribs, which he promptly warmed up in his oven for a moment.  \"Whoa...Kiba actually gave away food?!\" said Naruto, stunned at his often gluttonous friends display of generosity.  \"Indeed.  Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of ribs, but couldn't tell him that because I didn't want to seem ungrateful or insult him.  Luckily, there's someone here who DOES have an appreciation for ribs,\" hinted Sasuke as he took the ribs out and gently placed the platter before Naruto, causing him to smile toothily at his next edible conquest.  Then, much to Sasuke's surprise, the young blond's protruding stomach let out a hungry growl, apparently as eager as Naruto to resume their seemingly endless morning feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Naruto immediately grabbed a slab of ribs and tore into the meat with his teeth and bare hands.  Sasuke couldn't help but chuckle slightly as Naruto tore chunks of meat from the bones and chewed heartily on it like an animal.  Normally, he found such piggish behavior revolting, but for some reason, that wasn't the case with Naruto, who continued to gulp down more and more meat, stacking up the bones in a pile on the side of his platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with each hefty chunk of meat consumed, Sasuke watched as Naruto's belly would expand outward more and more.  His t-shirt had risen just below his pecks, exposing his bloated belly to all the world as it continued to grow and grow with all he was consuming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing a few rib racks, Naruto licked the sauce from his lips and fingers, and placed the bones aside as he leaned back and rested one hand atop his bloated gut.  \"Mmmm.  Been a while since I've eaten ribs this good!\" said Naruto.  Sasuke, still utterly fixated on how far Naruto's stomach had distended, was just waiting for Naruto to call for his assistance to finish eating.  Really anything to able to feel Naruto's taut gut in his hands, but Naruto seemed to get along just fine as he immediately began to tear into more of the rib meat shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until...</span></div></div>",

He therefore walked up to Naruto, then he placed his hands on the latter's belly, feeling just how taut it was. Soon enough, as Naruto belched, he worked out gas bubbles and helped relax the massive orb of food-filled flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto practically purred as Sasuke did this, his mouth hanging open as he stopped eating, enjoying the sudden relief of pressure that came with the relaxing massage. Sasuke then stopped rubbing, as Naruto's belly was now more loose and flexible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis broke Naruto from his trance, and he soon realized that he was supposed to be eating. Not wanting to disappoint Sasuke, Naruto went straight back to the food, ripping off chunks of meat with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was becoming more and more covered by sauce as the plate of ribs became closer and closer to empty, Naruto's giant belly getting just a bit larger with every single bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the final stretch was in sight, only causing Naruto to want to go faster to finish. There was only a half of a rack of ribs left. Now, instead of tearing off individual ribs, Naruto opted to take the entire half rack, eating each rib horizontally by eating the meat to the bone, then taking out the bone, eating the next area of meat between bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis method made his eating even faster, and in less than five minutes, he had finished the last of the racks, leaving behind a pile of bones and a massive belch that shook his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Kiba can sure make a good rack of ribs!\" Naruto exclaimed, as he genuinely enjoyed the delicious, barbecue-laden meat, surprised that Kiba of all people could cook so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Sasuke asked, \"So Naruto, do you think that satisfied you yet?\" Naruto then responded by saying...</span></div></div>",

Glancing down, Sasuke had noticed that Naruto's sizable stomach had increased considerably after consuming Kiba's BBQ ribs.  From a small beachball, it seemed to continue to expand outward, to the point where it began to rest slightly atop Naruto's thighs.  His flesh appeared stretched and strained from the tightness that came from consuming so much food.  Sasuke was almost entranced as his belly almost glistened in all its' perfect, smooth and round form.  That is, until it emitted an audible groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled cheesily as Sasuke laughed and patted Naruto's stomach in an effort to calm it down slightly.  \"Okay, okay.  Let's see what else we've got to sate your ravenous hunger,\" responded Sasuke as he did a little looking around in the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something kind of liberating about all this, isn't there?\"  Sasuke stopped as he heard Naruto's remark and turned curiously to the boy, then asked \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it...\" Naruto started, \"we spend so much time fighting, training, and fighting some more.  It's not often that we just get to kick back and say 'damn the rules and damn limitations.'  It's just...nice to know that we can have that kinda freedom.\"<br>\r\n\"Not to mention how far one's endurance allows them to go.  It's, unlike anything I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks.  That means a lot.  So does all the encouragement....and of course, the cooking,\" responded Naruto as he chuckled and brushed the back of his head.  Sasuke smiled and nodded, \"Anytime.  And speaking of cooking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke pulled out a tray from his fridge and unwrapped the foil, revealing seasoned salmon, which he promptly warmed up.  \"I just remembered that I was cooking this yesterday morning.  Smoked salmon with lemon and garlic peppered seasoning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the mere description was making Naruto's mouth water.  \"Usually, I cook dishes like this to last me a few days.  But I usually find myself hungering for something else after a little while and so I end up never really finishing the whole thing.  Somehow, I don't think you'll have that problem.\"  The fish was nearly done waring up, as the zesty aroma filled Naruto's nostrils as he began rubbing his extended stomach eagerly, and licking his lips.  \"Oh man, I don't think I'll have that problem either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll warmed up and ready to go.  Sasuke grabbed a spatula and placed the tray down on the table before Naruto, and handed him a plate and fork.  \"It's all yours,\" Sasuke said with a hint of eagerness.  Even if Naruto had eaten his fair share, the wonderfully seasoned fish was enough to spark hunger in his belly all over again.  And so he immediately took the spatula and helped himself to a large slice of salmon which he dug his fork into and immediately began to wolf down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first bite was a wonderful tag team of light, flaky fish, and a diverse combination of fine seasonings, all bursting with overwhelming flavor.  \"Mmmm!  This tastes amazing, Sasuke!\" called out Naruto between bites.  Sasuke smiled, appreciative for Naruto's complement, then resumed to observe him as he consumed the meal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like a trooper, Naruto continued to plow through the salmon, despite the fact that his stomach was already so full of food. The deliciousness of the food was a big help, and the lightness of the fish was a godsend compared to the heavy, rich ribs that he just ate. As he ate, his stomach continued its slow march outwards, like a beach ball inflating very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his stomach grew, more and more of its weight shifted onto his legs, and the sheer heaviness of his stomach caused it to droop considerably. Naruto took notice of this, so he spread his legs, causing his massive belly to droop even more, falling nearly to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this happened, Sasuke merely watched, intrigued. He didn't see Naruto in particular discomfort, and he was essentially mesmerized, so he didn't go up to rub the mass of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's skin and flesh around his stomach were still quite stretched and strained, but they were slowly becoming less and less strained, thanks to Naruto's healing abilities. It still took quite a while to adjust, but the speed at which Naruto's stomach adjusted to the new mass was astounding. Sasuke also hypothesized that Naruto's healing abilities are what is causing him to have the ability to eat even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, Naruto's stomach must have adjusted quickly to the massive amount of food, meaning that it was quickly able to increase its size so that it didn't strain too much to contain all of the food. Now that Naruto was eating right after he was done digesting, his stomach probably stayed the same size, meaning that Naruto would be able to push it even more today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat though made Sasuke particularly excited, and while he was thinking it, Naruto continued chugging through the salmon, humming and gently kicking his legs like a child, which amused Sasuke quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Naruto was nearly done with the salmon already. He had slowed down again by this point, but that was probably some residual gas, and Sasuke thought about his next move before he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He looked around, and saw Sasuke returning to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I saw we were running low on food here, so I ordered a little take-out, if you don't mind,\" said Sasuke.  Naruto shrugged as he grasped his gut firmly.  Naruto's perfectly rounded gut had expanded to the point where it began to just barely hang from his body.  While the rest of his body still maintained a relatively fit physique, his stomach had grown so vastly large that his shirt couldn't even cover it.  \"Ooof, sounds awesome, man.  And umm, while you're in a generous mood, would you mind?\" asked Naruto as he hoisted his distended gut up slightly for emphasis.  Sasuke smirked then nodded as he approached his friend and rested his palms firmly atop his incredibly taut belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was amazed at how soft and distended it felt.  Naruto was going all out this time around, and Sasuke couldn't let anything hinder his friend.  So he appeased him by rubbing and kneading at Naruto's belly as best he could.  Naruto shut his eyes and enjoyed the remarkable sensation.  Occasionally, Sasuke would begin to knead at Naruto's stomach, causing gas pockets to loosen up in the form of impressive belches from Naruto, who would sigh with immense relief after a particularly big one exploded out of his mouth and caused his bloated belly to deflate just ever so slightly with each one.  Sasuke continued to massage the boy's gut as Naruto resumed eating what remained of the peppered salmon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, the salmon disappeared into Naruto's hungry mouth, and down into his ever expanding belly, still being coaxed by Sasuke's rubbing wonders.  When he was finally finished, Naruto belched loudly and smiled as he leaned back in his chair, causing his belly to almost push into the table.  It was amazing how much this young man could consume in so little a time, and more so how he still had the strength to want more.  \"Ohhh man, I swear, you should be a cook, Sasuke!  That was easily the best fish I'd ever eaten!\" said Naruto happily and gratefully, causing Sasuke to smile in appreciation of the complement.  \"It's more of a hobby than a profession for me, really.  Besides, I much prefer serving someone who truly appreciates the meal, and won't let an ounce of it go to waste,\" responded Sasuke, which earned a hearty laugh from Naruto.  \"I truly doubt you'll have anything to worry about on that front,\" he said, giving his belly a hearty slap, causing it to jiggle for a moment, which entranced Sasuke immensely as he continued to rub away at Naruto's bloated abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs great a cook as Sasuke was, the only thing Naruto enjoyed more was the feeling of Sasuke's fingertips atop his vast belly, rubbing away and easing the pain of fullness like magic.  For the next few minutes, Sasuke continued to rub Naruto's belly firmly yet carefully, which coaxed Naruto into occasionally belching out the remaining gas pockets festering within his rounded, fleshy gut until the doorbell finally rang.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man had finally arrived, and with him, was the meal Sasuke had ordered for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sasuke knew that Naruto couldn't resist ramen, and as soon as he found out that Ichiraku's recently began to deliver, he had to jump on that opportunity, as Ichiraku's was even more irresistible to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presented the container, which was about the size of a mixing bowl, to Naruto, smiling. Naruto looked back with a bit of suspicion, but when he opened it, and the smell hit him like a brick wall. \"Is this Ichiraku's?!?!?\" Naruto exclaimed, excited by the mere thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke nodded with a smile, and Naruto nearly jumped up and hugged him. The only reason he didn't was because his massive stuffed belly was weighing him down. Either way, despite the sheer amount of food that Naruto had eaten, a deep rumble was heard from Naruto's massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke nearly screamed in excitement, anticipating how much bigger the massive orb would still get. He carefully watched Naruto, eager to see him begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto broke his chopsticks, then dove in like an animal, shoveling noodles into his mouth as if he hadn't eaten in days. It was a sheer feat of endurance, and it was amazing to see his already huge belly continue to spread outwards as he fit more and more noodles into his gigantic belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the amount of food inside of it, Naruto's belly was still fairly soft and malleable. It rested on the portion of the chair between Naruto's legs, and it sat heavily in his lap, and surprisingly that was the part that was causing him the most discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely ignored it, and he continued to eat, his belly inching outwards as it spread across the chair. Naruto occasionally felt his belly actually touch the table, and at that point, he would scoot backwards to make more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally finished the noodles, and his belly was resting on about half of the char between Naruto's legs. Now it was time to finish the massive amount of broth. \"Hey Sasuke, can you give me a hand?\" Naruto asked in as polite a manner as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke said, \"Of course\" before he walked up to Naruto saying, \"Need a belly rub?\" Naruto said, \"Actually, no. What I need is help lifting the bowl.\" Naruto's need of help was quite justified, as the bowl was massive and heavy, and Naruto would surely risk spillage if he tried it solo. That was because the massive bowl was meant for serving, not meant to be used as an eating bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy cared, however, and Sasuke held up the bowl as Naruto held it near the edge, directing it so that it was aimed to pour into his mouth at a manageable pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, a torrent of broth began to pour down Naruto's greedy gullet, and it was even more amazing to watch his belly at this point. Each gulp caused his belly to inflate slightly. It was like watching a water balloon reach its maximum capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly expanded outwards and became firmer as it filled with the broth. It was astounding to see how quickly it grew, and it took up more and more of the area of chair between Naruto's spread legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto finished, and his belly had gotten to the point where it hung off the chair, and he would probably need assistance with it in order to walk. Either way, after he finished, Naruto belched loudly, expelling gas that happened to make it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned a bit, wincing, and Sasuke immediately understood what Naruto needed. He went to his usual routine of finding gas pockets, and pushing them out. He was sure to be extremely careful this time, as Naruto had pushed it much farther than he did last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply said, \"I think that's my absolute limit\", then he groaned, looking slightly green in the face. \"I have no regrets.\" he assured to Sasuke, who said, \"That's something else that is simply amazing about you, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" Naruto inquired. Sasuke then said, \"Your adaptability. You were able to handle almost twice as much today, because your stomach's capacity was increased by last night's meal, and you had the endurance to keep going far past that! With that, you can do anything you put your mind to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sasuke\" Naruto said, before he said, \"I think I need to lie down.\" He then got up, but nearly fell down due to the sheer size of his belly. Sasuke was quick to respond, holding Naruto up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Naruto was standing, his gargantuan belly hung more than halfway down his thighs, close to reaching his knees, even. Sasuke then decided that the best course of action was to hold Naruto's belly, so he did, allowing Naruto to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke even lent Naruto his bed, as he was afraid that the couch wouldn't be enough. Either way, Naruto needed to lay on his side, as his belly would cause him severe discomfort if he laid on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke then said, \"I'm gonna make a run to the grocery store. Make yourself at home!\" Naruto said, \"OK. Thank's Sasuke.\" with Sasuke saying, \"Anything for a teammate.\" Soon enough, he was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto laid down, he thought about these massive meals that he has been having lately. He was a bit concerned that if he continues to eat like this, he won't have the same fit physique he once had. Right before he fell asleep, even despite the mid-morning sun shining softly into the room, he decided that...</span></div></div>",

I've always been a fit, active warrior with enough stamina to work off whatever weight I ever put on, so why not enjoy the feeling for a little while before working it off?\" Naruto thought to himself, with certainty.  He then thought back to Sasuke, who was even going out of his way to get Naruto more food and helping him to push himself.  He owed it to his friend and teammate to see just how far he could take it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, the honest truth, was that he found himself enjoying Sasuke's company much more lately.  There seemed to be less of a rivalry between them, and more of a genuine friendship, and it was nice to have.  \"So it's settled then.  Long as Sasuke's providing and supporting me, I'll keep feasting and seeing how far I can push this behemoth,\" he said as he clutched his massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still amazed Naruto that he'd pushed himself this far.  His stomach was larger than it had ever been in his life.  Perfectly smooth, round, and a pure testament to his ability to push his limits.  Going beyond this seemed almost impossible, but Naruto wouldn't be Naruto if he wouldn't be determined to at least try.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would come later, for the time being, his eyes were growing heavier and heavier.  Regardless of the time, his immense meal had drained him of a lot of his usually spritely energy for the time being.  He needed a moment for his belly to digest before he could move on.  Luckily, he'd have no problem digesting at a much quicker rate than normal people.  It would just require a bit of resting for the time being.  And so, with a hearty yawn, Naruto slowly massaged his immense belly for a moment, then drifted into a deep slumber...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a gaseous gurgling emanated from his vast belly, causing it to visibly rumble slightly.  Wincing in his sleep, the gurgling eventually grew so violent that it managed to wake Naruto from his sleep.  \"Rgh, what the hell?\" mumbled Naruto, but an abrupt rumbling caused him to wince and clutch his gut firmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, Sasuke had returned with an immense amount of various groceries which he placed on the counter, yawning, as all the running around and cooking in so quick an interval had tired him as well.  He'd just finished putting away all the groceries when he heard a moaning from his bedroom.  Curious, he investigated, to find Naruto attempting to calm his bloated belly down.  \"Naruto?  Are you alright?\" asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I dunno, I think something isn't sitting right, cause my stomach's killing me right now,\" responded Naruto as an audible, acidic gurgling sounded off from his large belly, causing him to wince even more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking by his friends side, he pressed his ear against the vast, bare orb of flesh stretching past Naruto and listened to his stomach sloshing and groaning from within.  \"Just sounds like a little indigestion,\" noted Sasuke.  \"Err, maybe in this case, big indigestion.  Your stomach still isn't used to working off such a massive meal, so it's working double time to work off as much as it can.  Here, one second.\"  Sasuke rose to his feet and headed to his fridge.  He poured a glass of ginger ale and brought it to Naruto.  \"Here, drink up.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I REALLY don't think soda's gonna help right now...\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me.  Ginger ale is great for helping to sooth indigestion, especially ginger ale made with real ginger like the brand I buy.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?  Well, if you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hesitantly took the cup, then began to sip it a bit.  Tasting the carbonated ginger on his tongue for a moment, he then proceeded to chug the rest of the cup in one go.  Smacking his lips, Naruto placed the glass aside on Sasuke's night stand and belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!* \"S'cuse me,\" mumbled Naruto, causing both boys to smirk slightly.  \"How do you feel now?\" asked Sasuke.  The rumbling had grown less violent since consuming the ginger ale.  <br>\r\n\"A little better actually!  But my belly still feels kinda tense.\"<br>\r\n\"That's because you only drank a little bit in respect to the size of your stomach.  You can drink more, since that should help a bit more.  Or I can massage your stomach and help ease the rest of the process for you.  Whichever you'd prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

He also felt a gurgling on the inside, which was no doubt Naruto's stomach working hard to digest the massive amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just kneaded Naruto's belly firmly and mechanically, which was surprisingly soothing to Naruto, who moaned in satisfaction. It didn't take long for Naruto to fall asleep, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto was out cold, Sasuke gently left Naruto to digest his meal. As he left, he thought, \"Now I just have to keep Naruto full and eating more\", then he went out to the kitchen to plan Naruto's next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few more hours, Naruto woke up, his stomach having finally digesting the massive amount of food. Now, instead of a massive, bloated belly, Naruto found that his originally flat stomach was not quite as flat, as it bulged out ever so slightly. It wasn't quite enough to jiggle when he moved, but it was still soft instead of firm like before his meals with Sasuke. That's where most of the new weight was focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rear end was also slightly rounder and larger, making his boxers less loose. His chest was also a bit flabbier, but he hadn't quite developed moobs yet. His chin was slightly fuller, and his arms and legs were just a bit thicker. In short, he was now chubby, but certainly not fat yet. Either way, his belly growled, much to his surprise.</span></div></div>",

That's some of the best damn Mongolian beef I've ever eaten!\"  Sasuke smiled and thanked his friend as he continued to inhale the decent sized chunks of beef a few at a time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched as Naruto's chubbier midsection began to bloat up a tad more after several mouthfuls of beef.  Due to Naruto's slight increase in girth, his stomach would no longer round out quite as quickly as it used to, which meant it was going to tak eeven more to fill his awaiting stomach up, and for that, Sasuke couldn't be happier.  After several minutes, Naruto finished the last of his beef and began to lick his plate clean of all the sauce.

Taking a big whiff, Naruto's mouth watered at the steamy aroma wafting from the plate.  \"Oh man, I bet this is gonna taste epic...\" exclaimed Naruto.  Smirking, Sasuke stepped back and let Naruto be the judge for himself.  Grabbing a wing, Naruto took a huge chunk out and gulped it down.  The explosion of spicy flavor was enough to set the blond over the edge as he immediately began gnawing on the wing and picking it completely clean of any meat and sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the bone, he grabbed another and began to greedily tear into it, wasting no time in tearing the wing bone dry and moving onto yet another like clockwork.  As he continued, he began to get some sauce on his face, which he'd occasionally wipe or lick off whenever in range, and proceed to scarf down even more wings.  As more and more wings began to enter his distended belly, Naruto began to wince from the surplus of burning spiciness resonating in his gut and on his lips.  Licking his lips, he attempted to cool off by pouring himself a glass of milk and chugging it down in one huge, speedy gulp, which ended with Naruto slamming his cup on the table, gripping his gut firmly, and letting free a deep belch, before smacking his lips and getting back to the wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched in joy as the boy continued to put away wing after wing like a big, bloated machine.  His attention shifted to his friends stomach.  Sasuke smiled as he noticed that Naruto's flabbier than usual stomach, had begun to press firmly against his shirt, barely contained as it stretched outward more and more with each wing consumed.  \"Boy, you're really coming along, aren't you...\" noted Sasuke as he was continuously enthralled by his friends continuously expanding belly.  Smiling, Naruto slapped his belly proudly, causing it to jiggle a bit and said, \"Sure am!  That's because my belly can take anything anyone throws at it!\"<br>\r\n<i>Sure hope so...</i> thought Sasuke as he smirked and continued to joyously watch his friend stuff his face raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto managed to reduce his plate of wings into nothing more than a massive pile of broken and meatless bones.  Leaning back in his chair, he rested one hand atop his gut proudly, then glanced back at Sasuke with a look that could only mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling aloud, Sasuke propped himself next to Naruto, and lifted his shirt up, exposing his greatly distended bare belly to the world as Sasuke firmly grasped it with both hands.  Much to his surprise, Naruto's stomach felt infinitely softer yet doughier than usual.  The impact of all their meals had really affected the boy, much to both their enjoyment.  Due to it's thicker resilience, Sasuke began to firmly knead and press against Naruto's belly, massaging it in a bit of a rougher than usual manner, though due to the added girth, Naruto felt no discomfort in the more forceful belly massage, instead smiled with delight as a look of bliss grew over his afce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirm but gently, Sasuke rubbed all over it, pushing into Naruto's belly deeply to work up any of the still pent-up gas bubbles, the result of which was a very loud belch, earning a sigh of relief from Naruto.  \"Ohhh man, that felt good....\" said Naruto with relief as he turned to Sasuke and thanked him as he lowered his shirt, which just barely managed to conceal his stomach as he began to absently rub it all over.

But then, a lightbulb had gone off inside of his head as he saw Naruto holding the stack steady.  \"You seem to have a steady grasp on the stack, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.  Why?\" asked Naruto curiously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Sasuke very carefully reached from the top of the stack and grabbed a syrup laden waffle, which he proceeded to hold next to Naruto's mouth.  After processing what was going on for a moment, Naruto eventually caught on and opened wide as Sasuke folded the waffle and gently inserted the whole thing right into his mouth like nothing.  Chewing on it heartily as he held the stack, Naruto smirked, enjoying the flavor then smiled with approval.  \"Mmmm, these things taste great!\" he said as he eagerly pointed up like a kid waiting for more.  Needing no more less than subtle hints, Sasuke grabbed another waffle, folded it up and slipped it into the blond's eager mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took no time at all chewing his next waffle up and promptly gulping it down.  Feeling the sweet, syrup soaked treat slip down his throat and into his midsection, Naruto moaned happily, enjoying every second of flavor resonating from each waffle consumed.  Before little time at all, Sasuke was stuffing more and more folded whole waffles into the ninja's mouth, with every few causing his belly to push out a little more each time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed, the two picked up the pace a bit more.  Now instead of one folded up waffle, Sasuke would fold up two or three and stuff them all into the young blond's mouth, watching with great joy as Naruto would gulp down even more comically large proportions at once, and sigh with immense relief when the chewed up waffle bits found their way into Naruto's expanding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, that stack pf waffles was beginning to shrink down a manageable pace, but both Naruto and Sasuke had been enjoying this process so much, that they just kept going.  Only now, instead of continuing to hold the now manageable stack steady, Naruto simply leaned against a chair with his mouth wide as Sasuke would continue to stuff his friends face with more syrup drenched waffles.  Lifting his shirt up, Naruto proceeded to rest one hand atop his now bare stomach, feeling just how vastly his belly had expanded since breakfast had begun.  \"Coming along nicely, isn't it?\" asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"Suuuuuure is...\" gloated Naruto as he patted his belly proudly, causing it to jiggle beneath his fingertips, earning a chuckle out of the boy as he focused his attention back on Sasuke and the waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued at this pace for a while, stuffing more waffles into Naruto's mouth than he'd ever eaten before in his life.  It was truly a feat worth noting for both of them.  All the while, as Naruto's belly grew larger and larger with each passing waffle folded up and stuffed into his maw, the subsequent stack only continued to rapidly deplete, shrinking lower and lower, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Because Naruto's adaptability was also high, his appetite had nearly quintupled since he first began with Sasuke.

Errrr, I mean, yes, of course, I can!\" rambled Sasuke happily.  Seeing Sasuke try to contain his excitement, Naruto couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he dug right into his breakfast sausage, taking big hearty bites as each chunk of juicy meat burst into flavor in the boy's mouth with every bite.  As he did, Sasuke lifted up Naruto's shirt from the portion of his upper stomach it was still constraining, and brought his palm flat against Naruto's spherical, smooth gut, rubbing up and down and all around as Naruto gulped down a big heaping mouthful of sausage.  A big smile of bliss grew over the boy's face as Sasuke continued to firmly yet gently massage his hefty gut as he promptly proceeded to stuff more and more sausage into his all-so-eager maw.  Sasuke's touch managed to sensitize Naruto's stomach, causing the acids within to react in such a way that it almost began to speed up in breaking down the food within.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he would continue to ingest more and more sausage, Sasuke's massage seemed to make Naruto's belly digest it all at an even quicker rate, which would also cause gas to begin to build up and form gas pockets at quicker rates.  Luckily, because of how thorough Sasuke was as his hand gently pressed kneaded all across Naruto's domed over belly, it didn't take long for him to feel them building tension, and for him to quickly press and knead onto wherever they resided within Naruto's stomach, resulting in Naruto belching long and loud shortly after, before typically smacking his lips in satisfaction and continuing to stuff his face.  Due to Naruto's increased girth, he found himself consuming more, feeling less full, and letting out some monumentally more beastly belches than he used to, and Sasuke rubbing all over his belly only helped to speed the entire process.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to which, the actual massage itself eased much of the tension within Naruto's stomach that came from consuming so much in so quick a duration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to stuff his face with more juicy, fattening sausage while Sasuke continued to rub all over the blond's quickly expanding midsection and said, \"Wow, I don't think I've seen you eat anything this fast in a while!\"  After gulping down a big gaping mouthful of sausage, and wiping his mouth of some sausage and grease residue shortly, Naruto sighed with relief and said, \"Well, that because my stomach's never felt this relax while I ate before!  Honestly, I feel like I could keep going for hours at this rate!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm game if you are,\" Sasuke noted with that familiar sleek grin on his face as his hand circled the upper portion above Naruto's belly button, causing Naruto to lean back and hum with delight whilst continuing to scarf down more and more sausage.  With each gaping mouthful gulped down, Sasuke could feel Naruto's belly push outward further a bit, before receding just slightly due to him rubbing his belly so thoroughly and speeding up the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Naruto had successfully cleaned his plate entirely of all sausage.  Sasuke couldn't but chuckle as Naruto licked his lips in an almost cartoonish fashion and leaned back against his chair, seemingly satisfied as he patted his slightly more distended belly heartily, causing it to jiggle quite visibly as he turned to Sasuke and said...</span></div></div>",

Chuckling weakly, Naruto wanted to lean back and just rest his back against the cool feel of the bed, but his gut protested too loudly.

Sasuke still couldn't believe how immensely Naruto's stomach had stretched out to accommodate for so much food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" was all Sasuke could mutter, still in awe at the sight.  As he rubbed against Naruto's vastly bloated gut, he could feel his stomach working overtime to try and digest so much at once, resulting in a massive surplus of excess air occupying the all-too-bloated gut which Sasuke was trying to ease.  </span></div></div>",

Until finally, the boy just blurted out, \"Can I move in with you?\"  Sasuke was surprised.  He wasn't sure how to respond, but before he could, Naruto continued and said, \"Thing is, I've grown kinda fond of you over these last few days.  I mean, at first, I thought you hated me and thought I was an idiot!\"  Sasuke rubbed the back of his head at the second part of that sentence, Naruto caught that and sighed, then followed up with, \"Okay...forget that last part, but you know what I mean.  I've enjoyed being able to spend this time with you, and frankly, I feel like, living with someone you like spending time with is better than living alone.  Isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly stunned, Sasuke simply sat for a moment.  Initially, this started because he wanted to see Naruto get as big as he could, and obviously still wanted that more than anything.  But, whether he'd admit it or not, Naruto raised a good point.  More importantly, he too; had grown a bit fond of the blond idiot since this stuffing endeavor had begun.  He was willing to put his body on the line and stuff as much as he could fit into his maw on a whim.  And it had been nice having the company, after spending so much time alone over the years.  Something about Naruto seemed to brighten the dark days of his life.  The young man was always just so joyous, so full of life, a bit beef headed and downright stupid perhaps, but kind hearted and a genuinely good person who'd been through many similar rough patches as himself.  Maybe this was just what the two of them needed.  Finally, Sasuke smiled warmly and said, \"I'd love it if you moved in with me.\"  Giving a wide mouthed grin, Naruto smiled at his new roommate to be and said, \"Thanks, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was interrupted by a acidic gurgling emanating from Naruto's distended gut.  Chuckling, Naruto rubbed it hungrily and said, \"So, do we got anything to eat for dinner?

Upon answering, Sasuke was surprised to see it was none other than Kiba at the other end of the door.  \"Kiba?\" Sasuke asked confused by his presence, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Oiy, Sasuke,\" responded Kiba, \"You seen the knucklehead 'round lately?  We were supposed to hit up this all-you-can-eat place tonight and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's question was promptly answered as immediately looking past Sasuke, he found a beyond bloated Naruto stuffing his face with dango in the kitchen.  Kiba's jaw gaped at the sight of his air headed friend's massive gut.  \"Holy...N-Naruto...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly approached the hefty young blond, still practically gaping at the sight of his new thicker form.  Glancing back at Kiba, Naruto's eyes widened as he slapped his forehead and apologetically said, \"Oh crap, the eating contest!  I'm sorry, Kiba, it completely slipped my mind!\"  But Kiba was too dumbstruck to respond.  Instead, he asked, \"W-when the hell did this happen...?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" responded Naruto, before gulping down a hearty mouthful of dango and sighing with relief, \"Sasuke's been treating me to all kinds'uh awesome food as of late, and, well, guess we're seeing how far we can take it.\"<br>\r\n\"How far you can take what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slapped his grossly distended belly, answering Kiba's question immediately.  Shortly after, Kiba's giant dog, Akamaru, pranced in, much to Sasuke's surprise and thought, <i>Hey, Kiba, you find Naruto ye-holy crap!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Kiba, Akamaru was stunned to see Naruto's new form.  <i>Did Naruto get locked inside Ichiraku's or something...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto waved his hand forward and said, \"Honestly, it's been a blast, man.  Ask Sasuke!\"  Both Kiba and Akamaru immediately turned to Sasuke, flabbergasted.  \"So what the hell is this?\" asked Kiba.  Shrugging, Sasuke smirked and said, \"Naruto's always been a big eater and someone with a high level of endurance.  We're trying to see just how much he can really put his body through.\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't this...unhealthy?\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't put Naruto in danger.  Everything I cook, I make myself from all organic supplies.  Besides, as soon as Naruto's ready to call it quits, he'll have no problem working off whatever he puts on.  Not to mention how much he's enjoyed himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Kiba turned to Naruto and said, \"You like this?\"  Nodding eagerly, Naruto smacked his lips and said, \"You betcha!  Think about it, we stuff ourselves almost annually!  How often do we ever just toss back the rules and go all out?

Trust me, I haven't had this much fun in years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering this, Kiba rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Well, that DOES sound pretty awesome...\" as if to further Naruto's point, Kiba's own thin and muscle bound stomach let out a madly hungry growl, causing him to blush as he clutched it and attempted to hush it beneath his voice.  Seeing this, both Sasuke and Naruto shared a glanced and smirked, before Sasuke turned to him asked, \"Why don't you give it a shot for a little bit?  Just kick back and see what it's like to disregard the rules and just enjoy getting a bite out of life!  Trust me, we've got MORE than enough food to go around.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how 'bout it, Kiba?  You game to stuff your maw to its' limits?  Or are you scared that you'll never be able to catch up with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Akamaru immediately glanced at Kiba, who he knew was seriously considering joining Sasuke and Naruto on their little gaining adventure, and whimpered to himself as he shook his head.  <i>Great...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba decided to...</span></div></div>",

My mom never lets me stuff myself at home, so I'm really gonna let loose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Sasuke said, \"Help yourself!\" with a grin.

J-Just until I don't feel this tightness in my gut?\"  Kiba was hesitant to ask, but the more Naruto talked about it, the more it sounded like exactly what his noticeably distended gut could use right about now.  Smiling warmly, Sasuke nodded and said, \"I'd be happy to!\" then sat himself properly next to Kiba while Naruto continued to stuff his own face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, can you unzip your jacket?  It'll be a lot easier to rub your stomach if I can actually feel it.\" said Sasuke.  Kiba paused for a moment, a bit reluctant, until turning to Naruto who nodded assuredly at the dog-nin.  Nodding back, he shrugged, then unzipped his jacket, exposing his netting undergarments which, after a bit of a struggle, he managed to pull up, exposing his slightly rounded but still firm bare belly to Sasuke who smirked then immediately placed his open palm against the bloated appendage.  Kiba winced slightly at Sasuke's cold hand embracing his flesh, but was immediately subdued as the raven haired boy began immediately stroking his belly in just the right places, causing a bit of a goofy smile to grow across Kiba's face while Sasuke continued to gently rub his belly in slow, firm, circular motions.  Akamaru watched and couldn't help but chuckle mentally, watching his dog-nin companion so readily subdued by a belly rub.  <i>And I thought only dogs could make that kind of face...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh man...\" muttered Kiba, in utter bliss, \"you weren't kidding, Naruto...this...feels...amazing...\"  Naruto grinned wide in agreement and after gulping down a huge chunk of chicken, said, \"Damn straight it does!  Ain't nobody got the magic touch the way Sasuke does!\"  Sasuke smirked at the remark, and continued on massaging the dog-nin's bloated gut.  Admittedly, Kiba's flesh felt considerably rougher than Naruto's did, still retaining quite a bit of muscle definition despite it's slight but noticeably rounded shape, but felt no less pleasant to Sasuke, feeling his taut yet firm skin gently beneath his fingertips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, much like with Naruto, Sasuke felt around for tension caused by excess gas pockets, which sure enough, after literally slurping down sausage, Kiba had a considerable amount of.  Finding these points across Kiba's belly, Sasuke began to gently knead and press against these points, working up a few of the gas pockets in the process.  Suddenly the goofy looking smile dropped from Kiba's face as he felt a rush of air rising up his throat.  Almost immediately after, Kiba's mouth flung open as he released an incredibly loud belch, which carried on for a few short but more than audible seconds, earning a hearty laugh from Naruto while Kiba merely sighed with great relief.  \"Phew, that one felt good!\" he said proudly, patting his belly in the process, before turning to Naruto, and with a mischievous grin, followed up with, \"Let's hear you try and top that, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's no fair!  Sasuke worked that one out of your belly, not you!\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft, you're actually gonna try and give Sasuke credit for MY burp?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Sasuke grinned and pushed hard on Kiba's bloated belly, forcing out yet another gargantuan belch from Kiba's mouth in the process, surprising even Kiba.  Blushing slightly, Kiba rolled his eyes while Naruto smirked back at him smugly.  \"Fair enough...\" turning to Sasuke, Kiba smiled gratefully and said, \"Thanks for that, bud.  That felt absolutely amazing!\"  Sasuke smiled and said, \"My pleasure,\" then stepped back, to allow Kiba to once again resume scarfing down the remaining sausage he had on his plate, causing his still bare gut to push outward more and more with each sausage gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, both boys stopped for a breather, massaging their painfully distended bellies in the process.  Naruto's belly obviously much larger than Kiba's, but still, in so short a time, Kiba managed to put away enough food for his belly to look distended to point where it looked like he had swallowed a whole melon.  Caressing his belly as he leaned back against his chair, Kiba smirked back to Naruto.  \"You weren't kidding, man...\"  Hearing that, Naruto smiled.  \"See?  Told you it was awesome to just stuff your face, especially with cooking as good as Sasuke's,\"  he said, patting his belly happily for emphasis.  Sasuke smiled gratefully for the complement while Kiba nodded in agreement, still licking his lips.  \"You can say THAT again...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, finally, Kiba asked...</span></div></div>",

Kiba, still smiling with delight, said, \"Well, it's a hell of a lot easier when you got someone rubbing the pain away.  Hell, my stomach barely hurts anymore!\"  Smiling, Sasuke nodded and said, \"Of course.  Your stomach just needs a bit of coaxing to be able to handle this much food.

It's just being occupied by some excess pressure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those last words, Sasuke pressed firmly against the bloatedarea of Kiba's stomach just below his chest, forcing up a rather forceful belch, followed promptly by a softer burp immediately afterward.

Taking advantage, Kiba pulled out every singe bone from the rack of ribs, leaving a slab of meat with holes in it. \"That was some quick thinking!\" Sasuke remarked as he continued his soothing massage. \"If there's anything I'm good at, it's finding a way to eat faster!\" Kiba responded as he pulled out the bones of the other rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto normally would've responded, causing the two to bicker, but he was too focused on picking the meat off of the wings, slowing him down considerably.

Gritting in annoyance, Naruto tried to stuff more chicken meat into his mouth, but his immensely bloated gut gurgled violently in protest.  Wincing in pain, he clutched his gut and attempted to push the gas ailing his midsection out himself, but to no avail.  <i>Dammit, my stomach's killing me!  Ugh, if only Sasuke weren't busy with that damn Kiba...he knows how to work out the gas that gets stuck better than anyone!</i> thought Naruto, still trying to ease his aching belly.  Looking up, he saw Kiba's ham beginning to grow more and more bare.  <i>Oh, there's no way am I letting him beat me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hoisted himself from his seat and went towards the counter to grab a pitcher of cola Sasuke had laying around, and poured himself a cup to the brim, which he proceeded to chug rapidly.

Unfortunately for him, Sasuke was well on top of it, and already kneading Kiba's bloated belly for pent up air pockets.  As if on cue, Kiba let free a loud belch, followed immediately by a softer burp and sigh.  \"Ahhh, much better.  Thanks, Sasuke!\" he said before getting back to his ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down the rest of his cup, Naruto slammed it back on the counter and pressed firmly against his immensely distended abdomen, trying to force up an even greater pent up gas bubble.

His eyes fluttered for a moment, until he finally gave in and sat up groggily.  Yawning, Naruto stretched then scratched his stomach from under his shirt.  Much to his surprise, his stomach had worked off almost all of the massive meal he'd enjoyed the previous night, and had shrunken down considerably to a barely noticeable bulge of pudge layered atop his lower abdomen, giving him the slightest of a pot belly.  \"Wow, that didn't take long at all!\" chuckled Naruto as he forced himself up from Sasuke's couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he didn't spot any Sasuke in sight.  At that moment, he realized that Sasuke was still asleep.  This, Naruto needed to see.  Stealthily, Naruto snuck his way into Sasuke's bedroom to get a first hand glimpse at his teammate sleeping to see if he was as well composed as he was when he was awake.  Secretly, he was hoping he'd see him sprawled ridiculously like some kind of ragdoll nightmare, snoring up a storm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise however, Sasuke was still just as tranquil and quiet as he was when awake.  Although it didn't give Naruto the laugh he was hoping for, it was a strangely cute sight for some reason, just seeing Sasuke in such a peaceful state.  It was almost a shame to have to wake him.  Nevertheless, Naruto being Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, Sleepy Uchiha!\" shouted Naruto, causing Sasuke to wince at the sudden loudness.  Slowly opening his eyes, he glanced slightly irate at Naruto and mumbled, \"Rgh...n a good morning to you too....\"  Rising from his bed, Sasuke rubbed his eyes and glanced back at Naruto, equally surprised by his gut's almost regular size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, you really DO have a fast metabolism...\" Sasuke said, with a subtle hint of disappointment in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Guess so,\" responded Naruto as he scratched the back of his head, also with a faint hint of disappointment.  \"Still, it definitely left a mark,\" he continued with a chuckle as he grabbed the small chunk of pudge still left over on his stomach.  \"Can't let that hang around, right?\"<br>\r\n\"I suppose not.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you wanna hit up the dojo's with me so I can work this sucker off?  I mean, you never know...\" Naruto continued, \"...nothing works up an appetite quite like working up a sweat, right...?\"<br>\r\nAlmost immediately catching what Naruto was hinting, Sasuke smiled back and nodded.  \"I think I know exactly what you mean,\" Sasuke stated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting changed, both headed to the dojo together, accompanied by a few familiar faces here and there, all already occupied with their own training.  So both young warriors trained vigorously.  From running the tracks to practicing hand to hand combat tactics.  The hours passed, the others had long since called it a day, and though Sasuke was all but bushed, Naruto just kept pushing onward and onward and onward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energetic young man's will and stamina were unlike anything Sasuke had ever seen.  Despite what seemed like infinite hours, he just kept going.  And so, like before, Sasuke encouraged and cheered Naruto on, which only strengthened his vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing a set of push ups, Naruto finally called it quits, breathing heavily as he sat up, sweating profusely.  \"Whew, think that'll cover it for the day,\" chuckled Naruto as he took off his shirt and was ready to hit the showers.<br>\r\n\"I'll say...and look at that, no paunch either,\" responded Sasuke.  Looking down, Naruto glanced at his stomach, which was; once again, fat free, and exposed quite an impressive muscle definition glistening from the sweat inducing workout.  Suddenly, an incredibly audible RUMBLE emanated from the young blond's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, he gave his bare stomach a good pat and and said, \"Well, take a long hard look while you can.  These bad boys are going bye-bye once we get eating, cause I'm STARVED...\"  Neither Sasuke nor Naruto could wait for the ensuing stuffing to come.  And with a clean slate from the workout, Naruto was going to have plenty of room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two showered and changed, they headed to eat.

And with Sasuke's help, and the hunger Naruto worked up during the day, he was probably going to need virtually limitless food. Soon enough, the two were in the buffet, and they went up to the counter to pay and get their plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got out his frog wallet to pay, patting it on the head as if it were a real animal, but as he was about to get his money, Sasuke said, \"Don't worry about it. I'll cover it!\" Naruto looked at Sasuke as if to question him, but before he could ask, Sasuke said, \"Don't worry about it! After...\" He hesitated a moment, causing Naruto to raise his eyebrows. \"After... the incident, I inherited much of my clan's fortune. Even though I really don't need much money, I have more than I could possibly spend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Sasuke was in a more somber mood, but he felt Naruto's arm around his shoulder. He looked to see Naruto grinning his characteristic grin, saying, \"Don't worry, I know how it feels.\" He looked down for a minute before saying, \"It's alright. It feels better once you have friends.\" Sasuke was reassured by Naruto's talk, and Naruto's positive mood was always quite contagious, and soon Sasuke remembered that he was about to see Naruto stuff himself silly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two proceeded into the buffet, and there were surprisingly few customers in today. The few that were there were surprised to see how much food Naruto was able to cram on one plate. He crammed a whole variety of foods onto his plate, mostly meat and rice, and he grinned as he was about to eat nearly all of his favorite non-Ramen foods. Sasuke was excited to see how much Naruto would be able to stuff himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke seated themselves at a booth by the the window, then as Sasuke ate at a normal, even reserved pace, Naruto viciously attacked his food as if he hadn't eaten in years. Sasuke smiled as he watched Naruto eagerly cram the food into his mouth. Soon enough, Sasuke had eaten his fill, but Naruto was still eating with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had quite a bit on his plate, but as expected, that food didn't last long, and soon enough, he was ready for another serving. As he was about to get up, he felt a slight pang in his stomach. He hadn't eaten nearly as much as he would soon eat yet, but the walk up the buffet table was more than enough to make his stomach churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely didn't want to keep getting food, as it would only be harder and harder with every plate. He thought about it briefly, then...</span></div></div>",

I don't know, I guess between working out so hard, and now, it's a little too tense to be moving around too much if I'm gonna be eating my fill.\"<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.  Well, I'm done eating, so I don't mind getting your plates for you if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it feels kind of weird asking you to get my food for me.  I mean between you paying for all this, and getting the food?  I-I don't want you to feel like I'm taking advantage of you or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke could sense that Naruto was really hesitant about this.  Smiling kindly, he gently patted his friend on the shoulder and said in an assuring manner, \"I know you'd never do that to a friend.  Don't worry.\"  Naruto glanced back up and saw the sincerity in Sasuke's eyes, then smiled thankfully.  \"Thanks, man.\"  Nodding, Sasuke headed towards the buffet lines, but not before adding, \"Besides, if you're eating everything I put on the plate, this means we both get to go a little all-out.\"  Naruto thought about that, and smirked, imagining how far Sasuke was going to test his limits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back for a moment, Naruto looked around, once again confirming how empty the buffet was, then lifted up his shirt to examine his abdomen.  His six pack was still visibly defined, only his stomach pushed out just ever so slightly from consuming so much of his first plate at one moment.  Clutching his abs, he almost absent mindedly began to massage his own stomach to ease the pain slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain began to lessen over time, and as he continued, his stomach let out a surprisingly audible RUMBLE of hunger.  Chuckling, he gave his bare stomach a good slap then let his shirt drop back down to normal.  \"Hehe, hope you're ready,\" he said, almost pep talking his own stomach as Sasuke returned with a tray containing what appeared to be a mini-mountain of food.  Naruto's jaw practically dropped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Wow, you really went all out, didn't ya...?\" was all Naruto could say as he simply stared wide eyed at the tray.  Smiling, Sasuke nodded and gently placed the plastic tray besides his friend.  Layered upon the many plates were several ribs, a pile of beef jerky, a massive pile of chicken and shrimp dumplings, and finally, a pile of chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So how's your stomach feeling now, Naruto?\" asked Sasuke with a hint of eagerness in his voice.  Sure enough, Naruto's stomach rumbled loudly in response to the mini-buffet before him, causing him to chuckle sheepishly before licking his lips and grabbing his fork and knife and responding, \"Hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he dove right into his meal and tore into it without mercy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Naruto start tearing into first?</span></div></div>",

It was a delight watching Naruto consume more and more while his stomach continued to expand more and more, all over again.  Finally, after several dumplings had been gulped down, Naruto paused for a moment and began to rub his stomach tenderly, as it was now pushing outward slightly more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke appeared surprised however.  While the day's workout and training had worked up quite an appetite from Naruto, his shrunken stomach may have also lost some of its' previous extra space.  Which would make him fuller quicker and give him a smaller capacity for this little stuffing escapade of theirs.  \"You okay there, Naruto?\" asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"Rgh, oh yeah, I'm just fine.  My stomach's just feeling a little tight right now...\" responded Naruto as he continued to rub his stomach firmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sasuke's concerns were laid to rest, as Naruto stopped rubbing, pressed his hand firmly atop his upper abdomen, and let out a large, bassy belch.  After letting it fly for a few seconds straight, Naruto sighed with immense relief.  \"Ahhhh, there we go!\" he said as he patted his stomach, pleased and relieved, earning a chuckle from Sasuke.  \"Good thing there aren't too many people here,\" commented Sasuke who shook his head with amusement.  To which, Naruto scoffed and responded with, \"What can I say?  I needed the extra room.\"<br>\r\n\"And do you have it now?\"<br>\r\n\"Ohhh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Naruto do next?</span></div></div>",

The ribs were already pre-cut into individual ribs for the convenience of the customer. They were smothered in tangy barbecue sauce, and their glistening brilliance practically screamed for Naruto to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the motivation he needed, as he quickly grabbed a couple, finding that the meat practically fell off the bone. Smiling, he said to Sasuke, \"Hey Sasuke! Watch this!\" He then proceeded to stick the entire rib in his mouth, holding it on one end. He pulled the rib out clean, having used his teeth to strip it of its succulent meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, that's pretty impressive!\" Sasuke commented as Naruto pulled two clean ribs at a time out of his mouth, depositing them on a pile he had started on an unfolded napkin. He grinned his characteristic, bright grin, content in his self-stuffing. Sasuke merely observed, interested, ready for the next time Naruto needed a belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued this method, taking in two meaty ribs at a time, his stomach gradually pushing outwards to make more room. He continued to devour the ribs undeterred, as he was practically in a trance, forgetting how full he was. Sasuke's eyes widened as he watched the pile of ribs shrink and shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Naruto had finished the entirety of the plate of ribs, and he belched proudly, patting his belly in satisfaction. Since he had started, his bloated midsection had grown to the point of lifting his t-shirt, leaving a sliver of exposed flesh on the underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto regained his senses, the feeling of fullness hit him like a pile of bricks, and the pressure in his stomach was building as the gas was, as he went the entire time without belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Sasuke began rubbing Naruto's belly, feeling a multitude of gas pockets, and he proceeded to free them, with Naruto belching, a goofy smile appearing on his face as the feelings of relief and comfort washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was satisfied with Sasuke's work, Naruto reached for the nearest plate, and he began yet again. This all happened silently, and Naruto's smile was all Sasuke needed, as he could tell that Naruto was grateful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Naruto got back in the zone, working on the remaining dumplings, and he continued to mindlessly consume the food. Sasuke stayed on stand by, massaging Naruto's belly whenever he began to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued like a team, concentrating in silence until...</span></div></div>",

The more he continued to ingest, the further his muscular abdomen would continue to push outward.  Little by little, that small trace of visible flesh beneath his t-shirt continued to grow just slightly more visible with each mouthful of shrimp dumplings gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more undisturbed minutes, Naruto began to slow down a bit, before stopping altogether as he leaned back and rested one hand upon his visibly bloated stomach.  \"Ugh, man, those things add up after a while,\" chuckled Naruto as he gave his stomach a few light pats.  Prodding gently at Naruto's stomach, and feeling how hard and tense it felt from ingesting so much in so short a time, Sasuke raised an eyebrow and said, \"Tell me about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced back at Naruto, who looked a bit tense himself then asked, \"Need a little help?\"<br>\r\n\"More than a little, man...\" Naruto responded, half-joking, half-serious.  Nodding, Sasuke got to work and began to gently rub across Naruto's muscle-bound but slightly distended belly in their continued effort to keep the momentum going.  Naruto smiled with delight as the massaging feel of Sasuke's fingers working around Naruto's gut was easing a lot of the immediate pain he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was also marveling how soundly Naruto's stomach maintained the muscle definition from his previous superhuman workout, while still pushing outward.  His muscle seemed to outweigh the fat, and thus, left him with less room to consume at a given notice.  His stomach would have to adjust like before; expand to intake.  Thanks to Naruto's elevated metabolism and endurance, he could push himself to eat more and more with each passing wave of food.  However, he'd first need some help from Sasuke to make sure he had as much room as he could stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke continued to rub Naruto's belly, he could see that Naruto himself was no longer in pain, but his appetite still hadn't quite returned to him the way it usually did when Sasuke assisted.  \"I dunno, I still feel pretty full...\" commented Naruto.  Then it dawned on Sasuke that Naruto hadn't belched yet, and however unsavory to anyone onlooking, it was essential if Naruto was to continue his feast.  So Sasuke continued to rub, almost scanning around Naruto's bloated muscle-gut for a sign of extra tension, but it was proving difficult.  So Sasuke lifted Naruto's shirt up, exposing his whole belly while he felt around, rubbing and trying to find the evasive pocket of gas preventing Naruto's meal from continuing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he felt it festering towards his upper abdomen, brewing and causing a considerable amount of tension.  \"There you are...\" muttered Sasuke almost victoriously as he pressed firmly against this portion of Naruto's stomach, expecting Naruto to belch his characteristically loud belch, but nothing happened.  Curious, Sasuke pressed harder and harder, trying to force the gas out of Naruto's belly while not all out assaulting the poor blond in the process.  Nothing worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I don't suppose you can just burp it out yourself?\" asked Sasuke.  Raising his eyebrow, Naruto smirked and said, \"Of course I can!  Check this out...\" then sucked in as much air as he could, causing his belly to bloat out even more with the excess air being deposited from his esophagus.  He then opened wide expecting a thunderous eruption, but nothing.  \"Oh man, that's really stuck in there...\" commented Naruto, a bit discomforted and regretful for his failed attempt at expelling the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke needed to find a way to get it out.  Then it hit him...</span></div></div>",

If you drink cola, then obviously there's going to be more gas building up.\" At that though, Naruto cringed a little, \"But that gas will build enough to force itself, along with that pesky gas pocket, out of your system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was still a bit hesitant, but then he soon got over it, and cheerfully exclaimed, \"I guess it's worth a shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sasuke went back to the drink machine, then he asked for a couple of pitchers, and because the buffet was practically empty, a polite employee politely provided him with a couple. He then proceeded to fill them with cola, then he grabbed a glass, just in case Naruto wanted to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to see Naruto with is back draped over the back of the chair. He stared at the ceiling while his belly was emphasized, being completely exposed, as his shirt was lifted all the way. Upon seeing Sasuke, Naruto went back to a sitting position, his shirt falling back down to cover as much belly as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke then offered a pitcher, and Naruto snatched it, thanking Sasuke with a relieved smile, then he put the spout to his mouth, tipping the soda over and guzzling down as much as he could, confident that Sasuke's idea was a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the pain, he guzzled down the soda, his belly visibly expanding with the quick introduction of all that liquid and gas at the same time. He finally stopped when he had finished about half of the pitcher, amazing given his recent past of stuffing his face to its fullest. His belly had become large enough to lift his shirt up nearly all the way, and his stomach quivered slightly due to all the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime practically froze for Naruto before finally, \"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP&amp; #34; <br>\r\nHe unleashed a gargantuan burp that lasted over ten seconds, and it practically knocked Sasuke back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few customers that were there stopped what they were doing, and they stared, almost afraid to continue to do what they were doing. Even the employees ran over to check to see if everything was OK. Sasuke merely brushed them off, assuring that everything was fine, and then he said, \"Now that was impressive!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled confidently, and Sasuke was even more excited when he thought about how that stretched Naruto's stomach, and it gave him more room to eat. Now Naruto would be able to eat even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke then watched, intrigued, as Naruto proceeded to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Man, that was awesome!\" said Naruto with immense relief in his voice as he patted his belly proudly.  The expulsion of so much gas at once had deflated his stomach back down considerably to its' earlier significantly less bloated form.  However, his stomach had contained so much excess pressure for such an extended period of time, that it had actually expanded and stretched out, thinning his muscles slightly, but giving him ample room for consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to grab the second pitcher of soda.  \"Didn't you get it all out already?\" asked a curious Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"Pfft, and THEN some!\" said Naruto with emphasis, \"Still, that felt REALLY good getting all that gas outta my belly at once.  Besides, did you hear how loud and long that burp was?  I don't think I've EVER burped that good before!\"<br>\r\n\"I should doubt it.\"<br>\r\n\"Which is exactly why I gotta see if I can top it!  Like yesterday, I ate to my absolute limit, and now I'm trying to go beyond it.  Same thing here.  Burped my best burp ever, and now I gotta get a better one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke couldn't help but admire the sentiment.  Afterall, it was that very sentiment that caused him to grow to admire Naruto and this little venture of theirs from the get go.  And so, Naruto chugged away.  Little streams of cola leaked from the side of the pitcher and down his mouth.  Like before, Sasuke glanced to see Naruto's stomach expanding with every bountiful gulp of cola being sloshed into his gut.  He could already feel the gas building up within him, causing some sharp pain in his upper abdomen, but he just kept on chugging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach, still nowhere near as bloated as before, had distended from so much soda, to the point where a fair amount of his stomach's began to expose itself more and more, reaching just below his belly button.  Sasuke could see that Naruto's abs were still visible, but thinned out and softened from the nights festivities.  Finally, around half way into the pitcher, Naruto placed his pitcher down with a hearty sigh and wiped his mouth, before using his right hand to clutch his distended stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, ohh man, I can already tell this one's gonna hurt a little bit,\" said Naruto, half-jokingly and half-nervously as he slowly massaged his own stomach to ease the pain.  Then, stopping for a moment, Naruto's clutch became firm, as he then proceeded to press down on his own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting belch exploded out of Naruto's mouth like thunder, lasting several audible seconds, but not quite as loud or long as his previous masterpiece.  When it came to an end, Naruto raised an eyebrow with an almost disappointed look on his face, as a smaller, wetter burp forced its' way out of his mouth.  \"What the hell?  That one sucked!\" said Naruto with disappointment.<br>\r\n\"Well, remember, your stomach was trying to deal with a lot of gas at once before you forced it all out,\" reminded Sasuke.  And in that moment, a dim light bulb went off in Naruto's head as he began chugging away at the second half of the pitcher, earning yet another curious look from Sauske.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still giving it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finished the cola at a surprisingly quick pace, then breathed with exhaustion as he reached for the third pitcher.  \"Yeah, but here's the thing.  The only reason my last burp was so big was a lot brewing in my stomach at once.  So the plan is simple...\"</span></div></div>",

The rapidity of his drinking was awe-inspiring, and Sasuke could see Naruto's throat visibly expand to accommodate for such large gulps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more astounding was the rate at which Naruto's stomach expanded. With all the liquid and gas entering his belly at the same time, it soon surpassed the size it was for the first burp, but Naruto kept going, his shirt no longer covering his belly, as it rested on the top now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb of flesh was now perfectly smooth and stretched considerably, and the skin was taut.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, Naruto's ridiculously distended belly began to quiver from what would arguably be considered the perfect storm brewing.  Smirking as best he could, he turned to Sasuke and with strain in his voice, said, \"Would you do the honors?\"  Sasuke's eyes widened.  Normally, he'd be more than happy to help, but this time around, he was a tad nervous at how inescapably loud this was going to be.  Nevertheless, this was bound to be; as Naruto would put it, epic.  So, Sasuke begrudgingly rose from his seat and sat beside Naruto, placing one hand slowly over the bloated mass of once muscle-bound flesh, feeling an overwhelming amount of gas flurrying about from within, and after a nod, Sasuke pressed firmly against Naruto's belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRP PPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasting mightily from Naruto's lips, came one of the loudest, lengthiest burps Sasuke and anyone likely within a quarter mile radius had ever heard in their lives, and only seemingly getting louder and louder as it progressed.  Sasuke kept his hand flat against Naruto's belly all the while during, feeling the immense amount of gas rushing out of his stomach, causing it to deflate gradually with the massive belch, until Naruto's stomach had deflated back down to a mere noticeable bulge in his torso.  After 18 seconds straight, Naruto's burp finally came to an end.  Naruto almost went limp from exhaustion at the sheer amount of gas exiting his body all at once.  He simply groaned with vast relief, and rested his hand atop his still bare stomach and smiled before letting out a smaller, wet burp.  \"Whew....talk about one for the ages, right, Sasuke?\"  said a pleased Naruto as he smacked his lips and patted his belly one more time before letting his t-shirt once again fall back over it again.  But Sasuke, along with half the people still in the buffet, were still a bit dazed from the volume of Naruto's eruption.  Glancing around, Naruto smiled sheepishly whilst rubbing the back of his head nervously, then said, \"Ehheheh, sorry if that was too loud, I'll try and keep it-*URP*-down...\"  Covering his mouth, Naruto uttered another apology and began to massage his strained stomach, burping yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally regaining his composure, Sasuke glanced back at Naruto and saw him clutching his gut whilst unsuccessfully attempting to stifle the gas exiting his mouth.  \"Naruto, you okay?\" asked Sasuke.  Naruto nodded, burping again.  \"Ugh, yeah, I'm *URP* fine...but my stomach's *BURP* killing me!  It feels like I can't stop *URRRP* burping!\" responded Naruto as he seemed to be burping a bit uncontrollably right now.  <br>\r\n\"Hmm, could be you tried to nurse too much gas at once, and now that you let out that deafening behemoth, your stomach is trying to rid itself of all the leftover gas that was being clogged up by it.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, so then what should I d-*buuuuRRRAP*-ugh...do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke thought about their options for a moment.</span></div></div>",

With each spoonful ingested, Naruto's gullet continued to protrude outward more and more.  By the time he'd finished his cup, his stomach was the size of a watermelon, visibly distended outward and bare.  His abs were still visible due to the sheer intensity of his earlier workout, but just vaguely due to being covered by a moderate layer of fat from the night's gorging.  By the time he was done with his chili, his pace had slowed down to a near crawl, until he eventually winced and clutched his gut with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Sasuke immediately came to his friends aid, and gently rested his palm against Naruto's belly, soothing the pain of gluttony as he began to massage at his aching midsection.  Naruto cooed with delight as Sasuke continued to massage slowly all over his bloated stomach.  It was unreal for Sasuke, how hard and hollow Naruto's belly felt.  It truly felt almost like a fleshy watermelon stuffed within Naruto as he continued to rub and knead away.  The hard yet smooth feel of Naruto's bare flesh was oddly soothing for Sasuke as much as his massage was for Naruto.  Something about it just felt relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke continued to massage his friends distended gut, he reached towards Naruto's upper abdomen, feeling a bit of tension just below the surface.  Acting swiftly, Sasuke kneaded his thumb's knuckle right into this part of Naruto's belly and pushed down.  Almost immediately after, Naruto burped loudly twice in a row, causing him to laugh.  \"Haha, wait hold on...\" said Naruto as he sat up with a focused look on his face, one hand held forward in a 'wait a second' fashion.  A few seconds passed, until Naruto's head bobbed forward, letting out a bassy, drawn-out two-part belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Buuuurrr-RRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, Naruto slapped his belly firmly and smiled.  \"Damn, that felt good!\" said Naruto as a tiny after-burp escaped his lips.  Laughing a bit, he turned to Sasuke and said, \"Sorry bout that, Sasuke.  Chili always makes me kinda gassier than usual.\"<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, long as it gives you the room you need to keep going\" chuckled Sasuke as he too, patted Naruto's belly then rose up to get him more food.</span></div></div>",

Licking his lips, Naruto got to work on eating from an ample bowl of ice cream smothered in fudge, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry on top.  Wasting no time, he would take ample spoonfuls and quickly stuff them into his mouth, enjoying the wonderfully sweet cluster of taste that resulted.  Smacking his lips, he proceeded to greedily stuff more and more bites of ice cream into his mouth, completely disregarding the threat of a brain freeze, too enthralled by the wonderful taste of his frosty treat to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke watched as the ice cream began to quickly deplete from the bowl, only causing the muscular blond's bloated belly to push outward little by little.  As he completed the hearty bowl of ice cream, Naruto turned his attention towards a plate loaded with dozens of chocolate chip cookies.  As if he were a kid again, the teen proceeded to cram as many cookies into his mouth as he could, and greedily chomped them down, messily spraying cookie crumbs all over the table in the process; much to Sasuke's amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, and by the time it was over, and all the cookies were reduced to a pile of itty bitty crumbs across the boy's face, and all over the table, Naruto looked all but dazed.  He groaned happily as he leaned back in his chair, both hands rested atop his vastly bloated belly.  It had grown so much that had actually begun to push against the table.  Rubbing it gently in an effort to soothe it, Naruto decided to wash down the remnants of his massive dessert with his drink.  Grabbing his cola and bringing it to his lips, Naruto proceeded to gulp down his carbonated beverage in one lengthy go, which ended with the young man slamming his cup onto the table, clutching his distended abdomen, and letting free a mighty belch strong enough to shake the table, and cause his own belly to visibly vibrate in the process.  Licking his lips, Naruto patted his belly proudly and weakly turned to Sasuke, who smirked back at him.  \"Great job, Naruto.  Didn't think you'd manage to put away so much, but I guess all that extensive training earlier must've REALLY paid off!\" complemented Sasuke, earning a weary smile from the bloated teen as be massaged his aching gut and said, \"Tell me about it...just....not right now, cause if I eat another bite of anything....or THINK about eating another bite of anything...I'm gonna hurl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from his seat, Sasuke assisted the bloated blond up from his seat, and the two headed back to Sasuke's apartment.

There, Naruto immediately plopped onto the couch, resting one hand firmly atop his domed out belly.  Wincing by his shirt riding against the upper portion of his stomach, Naruto opted to just save face, and shortly after, much to Sasuke's surprise, just pulled his shirt off entirely before leaning back once again, now bare chested.  \"Hope you don't mind, but I mean, it's not like my shirt was covering all that much anyway at the moment.  Besides, it felt kinda uncomfortable always having to adjust it...\" noted a now-shirtless Naruto as he massaged his achingly bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke regained composure and said, \"Ummm, sure, it's fine,\" as he headed into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of water.  Observing Naruto's body, he couldn't believe how much his training this morning had impacted him, and perfectly everything seemed to go hand-in-hand.  His chest, his arms, forearms and even though he was still wearing pants, his thighs were all perfectly firm and visibly muscular.  Not thick and beefy, but moderately thin as Naruto usually was and respectably ripped; almost chiseled, while his abdomen seem to completely complement his muscular chest as this large, round appendix, appearing almost strained beneath so much muscle above and below it, yet perfectly contained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drinking his glass. Sasuke noticed a hint of discomfort across Naruto's face as he massaged his stomach, then sat next to him.  \"Something wrong, Naruto?\" asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n\"Nothing too bad, just kind of a bellyache...\" responded Naruto as his face visibly winced to a sudden gurgling emanating from his gullet.  Smirking to himself, Sasuke said, \"Well, I could certainly help with that, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n\"Oof...ugh, yeah, by all means, man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto leaned back against the couch, letting his belly hang just slightly more over his lap while Sasuke gently placed his hand atop it, and at first, simply kept his hand in one place right above Naruto's belly button while his fingers soothingly massaged the firm yet hollow flesh in its stead.  Naruto closed his eyes and cooed with delight as a notable smile of bliss grew over his face.  \"Mmmm, dude, that feels sooooo good...\"<br>\r\n<i>You can say that again</i>, thought Sasuke with a grin of his own, before moving his hand circularly all around Naruto's perfectly ballooned gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some moments, Sasuke could feel a great amount of pressure and tension building in certain portions of Naruto's belly, and as per usual, began to knead and press on these tense regions of his gut, until successfully working up some of the gas pockets that had been stuck.  Feeling a rush of air rising in his throat, Naruto slammed his fist into his chest and let free a beastly loud belch which carried on for a few seconds before he leaned back and sighed with relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he glanced back at Sasuke, he couldn't help but notice an almost giddy grin on his face, before he smirked and teasingly said, \"Hehe, you like those, don'tcha?\"<br>\r\n\"I just think it's impressive.  It's almost a direct representation of the results of how much you've eaten.  And, given how much you've eaten...\" Sasuke noted as he patted Naruto's distended gut for emphasis, \"...I'd say the results are accurately loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the back of his head for a moment trying to wrap his head around all the science-y talk, Naruto chuckled sheepishly and said, \"Well, I dunno about all that.  All I know is that my stomach feels a whole lot better after I do.  Like at the buffet?  Hooooly crap, did it feel good getting those titans outta my system.  Guess that comes with the territory of being like the best burper in all of Konoha, huh?\" he noted proudly.  To which, Sasuke smirked in a sly manner and said, \"Well...I dunno if that's a fair statement to make.\"  As expected, Naruto immediately glared back at Sasuke as he continued, \"Afterall, a lot of the ones you've been letting out today have been with some help...\" he rubbed around Naruto's gut for emphasis, earning a heated glare from the blond as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Well, try this one on for size!\" Naruto said intently as he sat up as much as he could with his gut sticking out almost on top of his thighs.  He then proceeded to slap his belly as hard as he could a few times in an effort to force out as much gas as he could in one fell swoop.  The result led to an ear-splitting loud belch which carried on for several bassy seconds straight, followed immediately by a lighter but lengthy after-burp.  By the time it was over, Sasuke couldn't help but laugh and applaud his friend, \"That was pretty awesome!\" he noted.<br>\r\n\"NEVER doubt the master!\" shouted Naruto as he patted his belly proudly, but immediately winced.  \"Oof, that actually kinda hurt, heh.  Crap, think I might've jostled some of those gas bubbles outta whack\"  Sasuke chuckled upon hearing this, then immediately planted his palm firmly against Naruto's gut.  \"Eh, I guess even the master needs help sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke spent the next few moments rubbing Naruto's belly and easing the tension as best he could...</span></div></div>",

I've always admired your ability to take the heaviness out of life, and to be honest, I've always been jealous of your ability to laugh anything off and put on a tough face, even despite the pain inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that remark, Naruto was silent, as he was taking in everything that was said, and he said, \"Thanks, Sasuke.

You're pretty much ready to sleep now.\" Either way, Naruto said, \"Goodnight, then!\" and Sasuke replied with another \"Goodnight\" as he patted Naruto's bloated belly softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Naruto was the first to wake up bright and early. When Sasuke woke up, and walked out to the living room, he was greeted with a loud, \"Hey Sasuke!\" and Sasuke recoiled a bit from the sheer loudness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sasuke asked, a bit groggily at that.

He grinned playfully and said, \"What took you so long to wake up?\" asked Naruto energetically as he hopped around with a bit of bounce to his feet, earning a confused \"Huh?\" from Sasuke.  To which, Naruto replied with, \"Let's train!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke glanced back down at Naruto's stomach, which no longer bared the bloat of yonder, but neither did it maintain the same physical firmness and perfection that came of yesterday's training session.  It had gone from a concave firm to a flat and soft surface with only a hint of muscle buried beneath a thin layer of fat that currently flattened and softened Naruto's stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his eyes, he looked back at the clock and said, \"It's a little early to be training, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's only early if you look at it vaguely.  If the day were spent training, sure, it'd be early.  But as you can guess...\" Naruto started, earning a curious glance from a still dazed and groggy Sasuke, \"I'm planning on working up QUITE an appetite...\" as those words left his mouth, Naruto slapped his stomach firmly for emphasis, earning a smirk from Sasuke as he finally said, \"Well, since you put it THAT way...\" before getting ready and heading to the dojo with Naruto once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed as Sasuke helped Naruto train physically and tirelessly for hours on end.  He held down the young man's feet while he did one set of sit ups after another.  He helped spot him while he did some old fashion weight lifting, pulling up some pretty impressive weights by himself.  His biceps and shoulders growing more firm and muscular with each set.  As he lifted his last set, Sasuke couldn't help but notice the veins in his muscles practically popping out of his arms.  It was quite an impressive sight to see how much he could work himself out in so short a period of time.  Placing the bar back up, Naruto breathed heavily as he leaned up against the bench press, wiping his face with a towel from all the sweat gathering all around him.  Feeling how moist his shirt had gotten from working out so extensively, Naruto opted to pull it off from his body.  His bare torso; a beacon of physical perfection, glistened with sweat as he continued to catch his breath.  Sasuke was amazed at how quickly Naruto's body had transformed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin mere hours, his stomach was once again complemented with rock hard abs, and without an once of fat to be found anywhere.  \"I can't believe you've already worked off last night's binge.  You look like an entirely different person!\" Sasuke noted in awe, earning a chuckle from Naruto as he rubbed the back of his sweaty head a bit.  \"Haha, yep!  What can I say?  I train hard if I know I'm gonna eat hard!\"  Sasuke laughed a bit, still kind of exhausted from his own lesser workout, but was still completely fixated on how vastly defined Naruto's stomach had become since the start of this morning.  \"T-this is gonna sound weird, but...can I touch them?  It was so round and bloated yesterday!  Now, I just...I gotta feel the difference...\"  Chuckling a bit sheepishly, Naruto stretched his arms back a bit to make room and said, \"Knock yourself out.\"  Sasuke immediately rested his hand atop Naruto's sweaty bare stomach.  He couldn't believe how rock hard it felt.  His abs felt as if they were in fact made of stone, even with the hint of softness that comes from human flesh, it was almost unreal.  Slowly, he raised his hand towards Naruto's upper belly, and the results were the exact same; pure muscle without a single visible ounce of fat to felt anywhere.  Blushing a bit, Naruto smirked as Sasuke's hand kind of tickled in this current state as Sasuke removed his palm and still in awe, said, \"Wow...I can't think of a single person who could work themselves so extensively so fast.  Your will is unmatched, Naruto.\"  Smiling proudly, Naruto said, \"Thanks!  But I wouldn't get too used to these bad boys, cause I'm feeling MIIIIIIGHTY peckish right now.\"  He gave his firm bare belly a hearty slap as it growled viciously, much to Sasuke's surprise.  Shortly after, Naruto showered, got changed into more casual attire, and with Sasuke, headed out to reward themselves for such a remarkable training and workout session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Naruto, where do you feel like eating?\" asked Sasuke.  Thinking for a moment, Naruto eventually decided on....</span></div></div>",

I've hardly ever been able to eat all that much to begin with, how am I gonna stuff away the amount of food you can?\"<br>\r\n\"It won't be easy the first time, I can say that much.  You're gonna wanna quit at every turn, but you won't.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Naruto took a deep breath, and explained, \"Because miso pork ramen is the best ramen anyone can make.  Just imagine that lush flavorful ramen soaking in your mouth while your tongue savors every ounce of flavor it can absorb.  Then imagine that warm, steamy ramen warming your belly and filling you up.  After a while, no matter how full you feel, it starts to feel less uncomfortable, and more relaxing, just eating til your hearts content, feeling heavier and heavier, til you've reached your limits.  It's tough, but man is it worth it...\" finished Naruto, rubbing his stomach eagerly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he added, \"And don't worry.  Yeah, it'll leave an impact and you may add a few pounds here or there, but we'll train the next day.  Before you know it, you'll be turning that fat into muscle, and you'll be hungrier than you've ever been in your life.  Why do you think I always manage to stay in shape even after stuffing my gut with enough food to feed a mammoth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke considered this.  Naruto always seemed to enjoy stuffing his face and working himself tirelessly, before rinsing and repeating again and again.  It worked for him, and paid off immensely.  Maybe it could work for him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, an audible, notably hungry rumbling emitted from Sasuke's flat stomach, causing him to blush while Naruto laughed.  \"Sounds like you could use this,\" Naruto noted, poking Sasuke's stomach playfully.  As he did, Teuchi returned with an equally ample bowl of miso pork ramen for Sasuke, and said, \"Enjoy, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at Sasuke, Naruto grinned and said, \"Let's do this!\"</span></div></div>",

Instead, he kept a close eye on Sasuke's progress, as he was curious to see how far Sasuke would be able to go, and he wanted to see what face stuffing looked like from a different perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Sasuke tasted his ramen a bit tentatively, but as soon as he got a good taste, his eyes widened, and he began digging in faster, already loving the Ichiraku's flavor. \"I see you like it!\" Naruto said with a chuckle, and Sasuke nodded, his mouth full of noodles. As the two ate cheerily, Naruto was surprised at how much Sasuke was getting into it. He was gaining momentum, and soon he was eating fast enough to give Naruto a run for his money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, both boys' bellies were now large enough to make a considerable impact on their respective shirts, and they were threatening to lift up, exposing the flesh. Sasuke had eaten a great deal more than he ever had before, and now he was feeling the feeling of fullness that Naruto was talking about.

Sasuke smirked and said, \"I was thinking maybe I could see how I stack up when it comes to ramen against the champ.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what do you say we see who can eat the most bowls of ramen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said with an eyebrow raised, \"You sure, man?\"  Sasuke merely nodded, earning a playful shrug from Naruto while he turned his attention back to the stand and said, \"Alright.  That's as good a way to bust a gut as any.  You're on!\"  Without even needing to be told anything, Teuchi returned with several dozen bowls of ramen for both young ninjas and let them be.  Glancing back at each other, they turned their attention back to the ramen and began to slurp it down without haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto confidently slurped down an ample amount of ramen noodles with Sasuke not trailing far behind in the slightest.  Much to Naruto's surprise, he found Sasuke to be inhaling his noodles as a rather quick pace for someone who wasn't usually inclined to stuff himself the way Naruto was so accustomed to doing.  Nevertheless, he wasn't one to be showed up, least of all by a novice eater.  Slurping down the remaining noodles and broth, the two immediately turned their attention to their next bowls and wasted no time bringing them to their lips, slurping it down greedily, each one gulping it down as fast as they could to top the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, with each passing gulp of noodles and broth gulped down into their gullets, both Sasuke's shirt and Naruto's jacket continued to ride up at a rather even keel.  Sasuke's shirt had risen up to expose a good amount of flesh below his navel while Naruto's jacket and undershirt began riding upward near the same position; his abs still visible despite his gradually growing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, the ramen bowls began to stack up considerably for both youths, but neither one, despite how full they felt, was willing to give in to the other.  After about ten additional bowls each, both stopped and took a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth their bellies now exposed both their belly buttons and a bit of flesh above, having now grown to the size of small beach balls each.  The two gingerly massaged their aching guts respectively, groaning in satisfaction and a bit of discomfort.  \"Ahhh, I tell ya, Sasuke, there's no better feeling in the world than having this much ramen in your belly at once...\" gloated Naruto as he patted his distended belly proudly.  Sasuke simply groaned in discomfort as he continued to massage his pale stomach.  \"What's wrong?  You're not full ALREADY, are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Rgh, n-no, it's nothing.  It's just that my stomach just feels really tight right now...I've never eaten this much before in my life...\" groaned Sasuke, rubbing his aching belly all over, trying to coax the pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at his friend, Naruto thought for a moment, thinking back to whenever his own gut felt that way.  Finally, he concluded, \"Sounds like you got a little extra gas in your gut that you need to burp out.\"<br>\r\n\"I would, except I don't really know how,\" confessed Sasuke a bit embarrassed, earning a chuckle from Naruto.  \"You kiddin'?  It's easy!\"  As if to demonstrate his point, Naruto gulped down some air, pounded his chest with his fist, and let out a rather loud belch on the spot, before smacking his lips and slapping his belly proudly.  \"See?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it doesn't come that easily for me...\" responded an annoyed Sasuke, still strained from the pressure brewing in his gut.<br>\r\n\"Look, if you're gonna stuff yourself, you need to learn how to relieve pressure whenever it builds up.  Otherwise, you'll never properly finish a meal.  Think back to when you helped me last night...in fact, ah, I know JUST what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to Naruto's surprise, he found himself bewildered by the taut feeling of Sasuke's bloated bare midsection.  He was amazed at how the normally very thin and light eater was able to pack away so much for his stomach to have distended so vastly in so short a time.  So much so that he was more fixated on helping Sasuke push it to its' absolute limits than he was stuffing his own bloated gut with his favorite dish.  Glancing back at Naruto, slurping up a noodle, Sasuke raised an eyebrow curiously and said, \"Aren't we going to resume our little competition?\"<br>\r\n\"Y'know?  Maybe we can have ourselves a REAL contest tomorrow!  But for a first timer, you've got one hell of a momentum going and I kinda wanna help you capitalize on it.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup!  In fact, I think you can push yourself as far as I did that first time, with some help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying that, Naruto rested his palm flat against Sasuke's rounded gut, causing the raven haired boy to blush slightly.  \"So whadduya say, Sasuke?  Wanna see how far ya can go?\"<br>\r\nSasuke nodded and proceeded to resume slurping down bowl after bowl of ramen while Naruto continued to massage his gradually growing tummy, surprised by how much fun he was having trying to massage the bloated flesh in just the right way, earning an uncharacteristically goofy smile from Sasuke each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing bowl slurped down, his stomach would inch out further and further, lifting up his shirt just slightly more while his belly began to push against his blue shorts waistband.  As it did, Naruto gaped in amazement before laughing a bit and saying, \"Holy cow, I can actually FEEL it getting bigger with each bowl you slurp down!  That's so cool!\"  Sasuke chuckled a bit and said in a slightly strained voice, \"Yeah, I always enjoyed the feel of it too.  It's like feeling a water balloon fill up and get bigger and bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"You said it, man!  Let's see how big we can get this balloon going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Sasuke nodded once again and poured an entire bowl of ramen down into his maw; noodles, broth and all.  After spending a few brief moments chewing and savoring the wonderful taste, Sasuke gulped it down his throat, while Naruto felt his stomach expand as the ramen reached its' destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to rub Sasuke's belly, easing the tension away after he began to feel cramped from so much ramen.  At one point, Naruto could even feel the tension of gas building up within Sasuke's belly, and; as if to make a game of it again, Naruto promptly began feeling around for the tension building gas pockets, and would immediately knead them out, earning some rather loud belches from Sasuke in the process before he would sigh with relief and resume eating his ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Sasuke's belly had bloated outward beyond the point of small beach ball, and to the point where it was beginning to look like a medicine ball.  Only the bottom portion was constrained by Sasuke's shorts.  As Sasuke ate onward, he stopped and winced in discomfort.  Naruto initially rubbed to try and coax what he thought was gas, but instead, he noticed the strain came from Sasuke trying to undo his button over his immensely sized stomach.  Being all too familiar with the feeling, Naruto helped by lifting the lower portion of Sasuke's belly just enough for Sasuke to reach and undo his shorts button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after doing so, Naruto released Sasuke's gut, which immediately flopped down, pushing down the teeth of the zipper and expanding outward a good inch a half promptly after.  Sighing with immense relief, Sasuke smiled and loudly exclaimed, \"MUCH better!\" before blushing at his sudden outburst, earning a hearty laugh from Naruto.  \"Welcome to the club, man,\" noted Naruto, patting Sasuke's belly playfully while he continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few more moment, Sasuke's belly had ballooned outward to the point where he looked to be pregnant with triplets, almost resting on his upper thighs.  He proceeded to slurp down his final bowl of ramen, before stacking it with the many other bowls he'd already consumed, then leaning back and patting his belly proudly.  \"Ohhh...I've never been so full in all my life...\" groaned Sasuke, before pausing for a brief moment, and letting out a loud, almost six second belch immediately after.  \"Whoa, nice one, man!\" said Naruto.  Sasuke smacked his lips, and with a grin, proudly said, \"Wow, I did that one by myself, too!\"  Naruto laughed, patting Sasuke's belly proudly.  \"Well, yeah, look at how much you've packed away!  You're a natural, pal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smiled appreciatively and said, \"Thanks, Naruto.  And you know something?  This was actually quite fun, too!  Not to mention satisfying,\" he noted, rubbing his bloated gut gingerly.  \"Still, I hope tomorrow, we can actually have that contest.  I'd really like to put my skills to the test against a REAL champ.\"  Naruto smiled widely and said, \"You know it!  But first, we should rest up and digest our guts off.  After that, we can train and turn all the added girth into muscle...but more importantly, work up an appetite like no other, cause you're gonna NEED it if you're gonna go up against me.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" responded Sasuke, both eager and still immensely full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two head back to Sasuke's apartment, whereon...</span></div></div>",

Holy crap, man!  How am I JUST finding out about your skills behind the kitchen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, glad you like it!\" said Sasuke with a smirk as he rubbed the back of his head, a bit proud while Naruto was already nearly done with the entire plate.  Finishing, Naruto licked his lips happily and patted his bloated belly happily, before microwaving up a few dozen bowls of instant ramen.  In no time at all, he was scarfing noodles and broth down like he would any ramen binge he'd ever partaken on.  With each passing bowl gulped down, Naruto's stomach continued to protrude outward a little bit more and more, until about eight bowls later, when his stomach had distended so much that his tank-top had risen high enough to expose an ample amount of flesh just before his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in his chair, Naruto groaned and rested one hand atop his belly.  \"Ohh man, for instant-stuff, that ramen wasn't half bad...\" said a stuffed Naruto.  \"Feeling full yet?\" asked Sasuke.  Naruto shook his head, but groaned a bit more.  \"No, but my gut could use a breather...\"  Sasuke smirked and rested one hand atop Naruto's belly, before turning to him and asking, \"Would you like me to help with that process along the way?\"  Naruto chuckled and said, \"Do ya even need to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Sasuke's palm began to rub all over Naruto's almost beach-ball sized stomach, earning a rather blissful smile from the teen.  The rubbing sensation began to circulate the pent up air trapped in Naruto's belly, causing Naruto to let out a few ample belches while Sasuke continued to rub away.  \"Ohhh man, that's never anything short of amazing, Sasuke.  You're like a wiz or something, man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Sasuke patted Naruto's belly and said, \"Hey, considering how great it felt when you helped me out, the least I can do is try to make it feel as relaxing as possible when I return the favor, right?\"  Sasuke continued to gingerly rub Naruto's belly until he felt sated enough to continue with his next meal...</span></div></div>",

There's still a few places open that we can chow down at.\"  Kiba smirked and said, \"That's the smartest thing I've heard you suggest all week, bonehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha...\" Naruto uttered in a deadpanned tone before adding, \"Well, if ya don't want me smellin' like a foot first, I suggest you guys give me some freakin' privacy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, smelly...just don't take too long,\" replied Kiba as both his and Naruto's stomach's groaned again for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later. Naruto emerged, dressed in a casual black T-Shirt with a red Konoha Leaf symbol in the middle, his trademark orange pants, and headband.  \"Oi!  Dog breath!  Ya ready?\" remarked the young Uzumaki as he approached the dog-nin and his canine companion.  \"You know it, bonehead!\"  Kiba replied right back before the trio exited the training grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where ya feel like eatin', Uzumaki?  And DON'T say Ramen, cause I had MORE than enough last time...\" said Kiba as the two wandered down the village under the moonlight sky.

Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto grinned impishly and slugged Kiba playfully in the arm.  \"Don'tchu worry, dog-breath, you'll see...\"  Still grinning, he folded his arms behind his head and added, \"...aaaaaaaaand somethin' tells me y'er gonna like this place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked, Akamaru; overhearing this, whined to himself.  <i>Yeah, something tells me he probably will...and I am NOT looking forward to seeing him walk around like he's carrying octuplets...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kiba chuckled and playfully ruffled Akamaru's furry white head as he said, \"H-heh, hey, I can't help it if pint-sized servings don't cut it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked dully again.  <i>A full steak is HARDLY pint-sized...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned toothily and added, \"Neither is a 72 oz steak...\"  He then turned to Naruto as his stomach rumbled again and said, \"How much further til we're at this mystery place anyway...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and said, \"About two more steps...\"  And immediately, Kiba looked up, saw where Naruto had led them, and grinned eagerly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Now that's what I'm talkin' about...\" remarked Kiba, upon the trio reaching the building in question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was...</span></div></div>",

The large canine was kicking himself internally for pleading with his owner and dear pal to go for a walk.  It all started so great too.  The two had been venturing all around Konoha, seeing its' many sights and having the time of their lives.  That is, until Akamaru's owner stumbled upon that damned flier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Konoha's \"Bottomless Pit\"' it was called; an eating contest where the contestant to withstand every single wave of food thrown their way would receive an ample cash prize.  Akamaru understood the two were strapped for cash at the moment, but nonetheless, he cursed himself immensely for letting his owner spot such a flier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And the reason why had just returned to the booth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, damn fine lookin' eats, ey, boy?\" said the dogs' owner.  Kiba; the brown haired, teenaged dog-nin, currently wearing his headband, black pants, sandals, and a gray T-Shirt instead of his trademark leather jacket, had just plopped down on the opposite end of the booth before Akamaru, licking his lips hungrily as he set his tray down on the table.  It was literally jam packed with every possible delight Konoha's buffet had to offer.  Piles of fried tempura, steaks galore, tons of beef jerkey, fried chicken, BBQ wings and drumsticks, a MASSIVE burger, and even several slices of pizza.  The aroma was undeniably intoxicating, but not enough for Kiba's eyes to widen as he snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!  Right!  Almost forgot the drink!\"  he said with a chuckle as he turned the large dog and ruffled his fuzzy, white head.  \"Back in a sec!\"  And eagerly, the young man hopped from his booth and back towards the buffet line.  Akamaru simply sat there, whimpering some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto may have bickered often, but they'd grown to be very good friends...who bickered often...but nonetheless, had an ample amount of things in common.  They were both stubborn, ill tempered at points, never backed down from a fight or challenge, always watched out for their friends, and in this case...loved, LOVED food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there in lied the problem.  They never ever knew when to quit.  So often, the two would stuff themselves silly and be left damn near incapacitated from fullness.  Even after each ordeal, Kiba would occasionally find himself a bit on the heavier side than usual, which; if his mom ever found out, would result in a scene or two the dog could only describe as 'terror incarnate...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, being a ninja and dog-nin, meant Kiba lived a very active and athletic life; hence why he'd always manage to work the weight off.  As it stood, the teens stomach was currently flat, trim and packing some muscle to boot.  But knowing Kiba had a week to prepare for this contest, meant it'd only be a matter of time until the boy overdid it yet again.  And with no missions currently lined up for the next few weeks, it remained uncertain how long it might take Kiba to work his inevitable gut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" exclaimed Kiba as he returned, carrying a few ample pitchers of cola with one hand, and another plate stacked with steaks in the other.  Akamaru's eyes immediately bugged out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-you're gonna eat ALL that?!  B-but you already have tons of steak!</i> exclaimed the dog in his dog-language, a language Kiba; being a dog-nin, spoke perfectly, as suggested by the playful smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfffft, I wish,\" replied the brunette teen before; to Akamaru's surprise, he set the plate down before the dog.  \"What?  Ya thought I wasn't gonna share the wealth with my best bud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, despite himself, wagged his tail and barked appreciatively.  Even if Kiba was about to gorge himself on more food than any teenager...or creature alike, should ever eat, he was still always considerate to his canine buddy.  And despite the situation, one whiff of those tender, juicy steaks, and Akamaru couldn't help but salivate with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting his soda pitchers aside, Kiba's empty stomach roared hungrily, as the teen licked his lips, turned to his pal and said, \"Whelp, let's get this show on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without missing a beat, the boy immediately began tearing into his meal.  Akamaru whined low enough for the currently feasting dog-nin to catch it, but nonetheless, as his own stomach rumbled with anticipation, Akamaru; too, tore into his first steak...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Try as he might to ignore it, Akamaru was unable to glance away as; sure enough, Kiba was already on what could only be described as an 'eating rampage'.  Damn near ravenous, Kiba stuffed several shrimp tempura in his mouth at once, chomping greedily before gulping them down and stuffing another handful of tempura right back in his all-too-eager maw, voraciously chomping away, gulping the almost comically ample mouthful down his throat, and immediately digging right back in for more.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And so it begins...</i>  Akamaru sighed to himself as he tore off another chunk of steak and chomped down on it himself.  Though, despite the none-too-promising situation, the large dog couldn't help but appreciate how deliciously juicy his steaks were.  And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, that said something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually wolfing down a good deal of tempura, Kiba smacked his lips and reached for a slice of pizza.  \"Mmmm, this is the stuff, ain't it, boy!\" exclaimed Kiba before stuffing half the pizza slice into his maw and chomping it clean in half.  Akamaru chuckled uneasily and nodded, not wanting to comment on his lamenting, knowing it would fall on deaf ears.  However, watching Kiba stuff the second half of the slice right into his mouth and chewing viciously, Akamaru couldn't help but chime in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>D-do you maybe wanna pace yourself a bit there, Kiba?  You don't wanna choke afterall...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching this, Kiba winced a bit as he gulped down the massive mouthful of pizza, causing a noticeable bulge of food to slide from his mouth down his throat, then sighed with relief.  \"I am pacing myself, buddy.  But I gotta be quick if I'm gonna be the first to win this thing, right?\"  Akamaru whined softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess so...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And on THAT note...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes bugged out for a moment when he saw Kiba stuff an ENTIRE slice right into his maw, seeing it open wider than he'd ever seen Kiba open his mouth before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is...is he really going to try and-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Akamaru could finish, Kiba had successfully shut his mouth over the slice, and chewed amply, looking strained, but with an undeniably amused smirk on his face as he did so.  Finally, after several moments of strained chewing, Kiba clenched his eyes shut as he took a hearty swallow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I think you and I have veeeeery different definitions of pacing, buddy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba rubbed the back of his head and said, \"H-heh, sorry, think I might actually be a lil hungrier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...You don't say...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to grab another slice, but winced as a look of discomfort grew over his face, much to Akamaru's concern.  Whining, he leaned towards the teen and asked, <i>Kiba?  You okay?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kiba didn't respond.  Rather, he held a finger up for a moment, before balling his palm into a fist, thumping his chest, and burping loudly immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, much better!\"  Kiba exclaimed with a smile before taking yet another ample bite of pizza.  Akamaru's ears flopped over his head.  <i>Thank goodness this place is practically empty...cause this is gonna be a loooooong day...</i></span></div></div>",

Despite the massive quantities of food still left to be conquered, the young man had put a considerable dent on said pile, and still with no end in remote sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing under the table, Akamaru whimpered softly as he saw that Kiba's stomach was no longer concave, but flat with an ever so slightly rounded angle to it, hardly noticeable beneath his shirt.  Yet, at the rate the dog-nin was chomping away, that was bound to change fairly soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-mmm!\" hummed Kiba, after gulping down a hearty mouthful of jerky and smacking his lips happily.  \"Damn!  Y'know, for a buffet, this stuff ain't too shabby, wouldn't ya say, bud?\"  Akamaru barked softly in agreement.  Even if he was notably distracted, he couldn't deny that the steaks were, indeed quite delectable.  \"Heh, too bad the bonehead ain't here.  He'd probably get a kick outta this place too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Actually, I'm pretty sure Naruto would start whining that this place isn't Ichiraku's...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kiba immediately rolled his eyes and scoffed.  \"Ohhh man, TELL me about it!  I swear, that dope never shuts the hell UP about that stuff!\"  Then, Kiba stopped for a moment and smirked.  \"Though, I guess to be perfectly fair, their ramen ain't half bad...\"  Then, his grin turned impish as he grabbed a piece of jerky and held it towards Akamaru's muzzle.  \"Still ain't got NOTHIN' on the good stuff though, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru; despite himself, wagged his tail and eagerly bit the piece of jerky out from Kiba's hands and wolfed it down in a matter of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No question...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba poured himself a cup of soda and took a hearty swig to wash down the contents in his mouth, before licking his lips, setting the cup aside, and grabbing a few drumsticks at a time. The teen immediately sank his teeth into the chicken and tore off sizable chunks of zesty seasoned meat, chewing voraciously, quickly gulping it down and chomping right back in for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he put away, the more and more rounded that angle in Kiba's stomach became.  It remained well concealed behind his shirt, but with every few hearty mouthfuls gulped down, that slight bump got juuuuuuust a bit bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, Akamaru remained every bit as stunned that his friend just kept going and going damn near seamlessly from one bit of food to the other.  If he didn't absolutely lament the idea of his dear pal getting  heavier, he'd have to be rather impressed with the pace he was keeping up.  If anything, he'd definitely be giving the other contestants at this contest a run for their money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after gulping down a sizable amount of tempura, Kiba leaned back in his chair and rested a hand against his stomach as he sighed to himself.  Gulping down the last piece of his second steak, Akamaru glanced back at Kiba and reluctantly asked, <i>Well, how you feeling so far?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped loudly then patted his belly as he glanced back at Akamaru and smirked confidently.  \"Oh man, heh, I feel like I could eat this stuff for freakin' days!  I mean, every last bit of it just tastes so damn great!\"  Letting out a much lighter burp, Kiba licked his lips then reached over for his burger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer size of this behemoth required Kiba to carry it firmly with both hands, and; after a light struggle, he managed to bring the beast up to his mouth, which he opened as wide as he had when he was stuffing it with whole pizzas...then; like a famous shark, took a massive CHOMP into the burger, chewing firmly as his face began to light up from the sheer burst of juicy flavors.  Little as the canine wanted to admit it, that burger DID look rather savory.  Nonetheless, he turned his attention to his third piece of steak, admittedly, feeling a tad full, but; Akamaru being Akamaru, was utterly too enticed by delicious and juicy beef to call it a day just yet.  That, plus he'd need a distraction to keep from watching his buddy inevitably eat himself into a stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Akamaru got to work on his steak while Kiba chomped and chomped and chomped some more...</span></div></div>",

In spite of how ridiculously oversized the burger was, Kiba kept at it, spurred oward by just how zesty and flavorful it was. Akamaru, even as he watched Kiba tear into the burger with a mix of concern and envy, ripped off bite after bite of his steak, tail wagging at the juicy flavor. <i>Oh man, this steak is awesome!</i> His eyes went over to his plate, and his enthusiasm dimmed a bit when he saw just how much was left. <i>Even if that means I'll end up looking like I'm carrying puppies...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to his buddy's inner musings, Kiba continued ripping into his burger, privatey marveling at just how tasty it was...and how much he still had to go. <i>Can't let that stop me,</i> he thought, taking a particularly huge chomp of the sandwich. <i>If I'm gonna take the gold in that contest, I can't let something like THIS keep me down!</i> With that thought galvanizing him into action, he continued devouring the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every several hearty bites he took, the bump under Kiba's shirt bulged ever-so-slightly, pushing out further and further. Kiba felt his tummy getting heavier, but he merely grinned and pressed on. Likewise, Akamaru, gulping down a mouthful of his steak, glanced at his own stomach, and winced as he saw a very noticeable furry bump where his midsection was. <i>Yep, thought so...</i> Then, shrugging, he went back to his steak; while he was starting to feel a little more full, the steak was just too damn good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba set his behemoth burger back on the table, leaning back in his seat and contentedly patting his belly. \"Ah, man,\" he muttered, licking his lips. \"This burger's a hell of a contender...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was; despite the delicious flavor of the sandwich and his own determination, the sheer size of the burger had forced him to take a break partway; as such, half of the beefy behemoth now sat upon the table, the other half resting inside Kiba's bulging tummy. At this point, his midsection had swollen up rather noticeably, pushing forward noticeably and, despite the fact that it remained underneath his shirt, a few more hearty mouthfuls of food would likely change that. His waistline was also beginning to feel a bit snug, but he didn't pay that much mind at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" he exclaimed, grinning and licking his lips as he patted his belly, slouching back in his seat, \"that's some good beef...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really?</i> Akamaru woofed flatly, licking his own chops and staring at Kiba's engorged tummy. <i>Never woulda guessed...</i> Suddenly, he yawned, and leaned back into his own part of the booth, shutting his eyes. Though he had no intention of sleeping (and the fact he didn't want to leave those oh-so-delicious steaks sitting a moment longer than they needed to), he felt like he needed some kind of rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the sight, Kiba did the same, leaning back, shutting his eyes, and gently rubbing his belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh, hey, that burger looks mighty tasty. You gonna eat the rest of that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled. \"Yeah, I actually kinda wa---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flew open as he recognized the canine voice, as did Akamaru's. Slowly,  their heads turned toward the side of the booth from where the voice had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the table were three rather large dogs, each roughly Akamaru's size. The three were absolutely identical: somewhat wolf-like in apperance, ash-colored fur on the tops of their bodies and tail, white fur on the rest of them, and brown/gray eyes. One-the one who had spoken-was sitting, his tail wagging. The other two-his brothers- stood up, staring up at Kiba and Akamaru as their own tails wagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked and stared, making sure he hadn't nodded off and this wasn't some sort of dream. <i>The Haimaru Brothers?</i> the dog wondered privately. Out loud, he asked, <i>What're you guys doing here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the others-the dog standing to the first sibling's right-barked happily, panting. <i>What, we need an excuse to visit our two favorite squirts? Besides, Hana's booked full-time for today; she said we could take the day off.</i> This one's voice had a slightly higher register than the first's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"Squirt?\" He repeated, a playful tone to his voice. \"In case ya forgot, I'm a Chunin now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...and I'm the same size as all of you,</i> Akamaru retorted, even knowing it would do no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third sibling-the one to the first's left-winked at the two. <i>We told ya before, didn't we? No matter how big or successful either of ya get, you'll always be squirts to us.</i> In contrast to the second sibling, this one's voice had a slightly deeper register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first brother-the one who was sitting-finally got to his paws, trotting up to Kiba. <i>Come on now, enough gawking. Say hi to your pal, willya?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba reached a hand out and ruffled the dog's head. \"Heh, good to see you too, Shomaru.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Though the brothers, upon being born, had simply been christened 'The Haimaru Brothers' , they'd each settled upon a name for themselves to allow others to differentiate between them: Shomaru, Nimaru, and Sanmaru.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reply, Shomaru playfully licked Kiba's hand. <i>Same here, kiddo.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this, Nimaru and Sanmaru rolled their eyes. <i>Pffft...suck-up.</i> Nonetheless, they both trotted over to Akamaru's seat, tails wagging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, in spite of himself, wagged his tail. <i>Hey, guys; what's goin' on?</i> Despite his annoyance at repeatedly being called 'squirt', he was actually rather fond of the triplets; ever since he'd been a pup, they'd played with him whenever they got the chance, had gone with him and Kiba on play-missions....in short, they'd almost been like uncles to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru-the one with a higher register-shrugged. <i>Eh, nothin' much; walking around the village, seeing the sights, peeing on that snooty visiting noble's robes...</i> Akamaru's eyes widened at that, but before he could protest, Sanmaru-the one with the lower register-cut in. <i>Oh, and we also came across Naruto stuffing himself at that ramen place he loves so much.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba started at this, looking up even as he continued petting Shomaru. \"Wait, you saw Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru nodded. <i>Yep. I thought I overheard him saying he was getting ready for some sort of contest; the \"Konoha Bottomless Pit\", or something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, laughing. \"Yep, that's the one.\" He indicated the bounty of food still on the table, as well as the half-eaten burger. \"I'm actually gettin' ready for that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru glanced over. <i>Not that I don't have faith in ya, kid, but...are ya really gonna keep that from your mom?</i> At this, everyone present shuddered. <i>I mean, whenever ya stuff yourself...she ain't too happy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Understatement of the century,</i> Kiba thought, shuddering. <i>And if KUROMARU finds out...</i> He clamped down on that thought, not wanting to take it to its logical conclusion. Out loud, he replied, \"Eh...I'm still workin' on that.\" He gave the brothers an imploring glance. \"Uh, you guys won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru winked at him. <i>Our muzzles are sealed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru rolled his eyes and looked at his brother. <i>That'd be a first.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru glared at his sibling. <i>Oh cram it, ya jerk! You're not exactly an impenetrable fortress yourself! What about when Kuromaru caught us returning home covered in pink polka dots, and you BLABBED to him that it was a botched prank on the Hokage?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru, catching this, trotted over to the two. <i>Oh, don't act like you're completely innocent; YOU were the one who tripped that exploding feather bag!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru growled. <i>Yeah, but at least I didn't knock over that stack of papers and get the whole damn ANBU sent after us!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru snarled. <i>What did you say?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru glared at him. <i>You heard me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru barked at both of them. <i>You're both jerks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAT?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the three started barking at each other, arguing, bickering, and making frankly immature facial expressions at one another. Kiba and Akamaru stared at the sight, torn between embarrassment and amusement. It was the strangest thing, really; while they were on missions, the three were the epitome of professionalism: always devoted to the mission, all business. Off mission, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well, there was a reason several older members of the clan, human and canine alike, swore up and down that the three had been dropped on their heads at least once during their puphood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched this go on for a bit, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio of large identical dogs continue to bark and bicker back and forth; their words lost in a sea of obscenities and barks.  Both Kiba and Akamaru continue to watch in an embarrassed yet undeniably amused fashion as the two can't help but snicker at the sheer ridiculousness being loudly exclaimed by the Haimaru Brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GGGGGGUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRGGGGGGGLLLLEEEE!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of rather audible gurgles emit from both Kiba and Akamaru's stomachs in unison.  The hungry rumbles were so loud, in fact, that they could actually be heard over the dogs bickering, which; oddly enough, silenced the Haimaru as they all stopped, and shared curious glances at both Kiba and Akamaru alike, and noting the red flush on Kiba's face and the blush of embarrassment seeping from under Akamaru's white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you squirts really ARE hungry, ain'tcha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling sheepishly, Kiba rubbed the back of his head and said, \"H-heh, guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off his embarrassment, Kiba glanced down at his burger and licked his chops.  Akamaru does the same with his steaks, but then stops as he realizes something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, hey, since you guys are here, do ya want anything to eat?  I mean, it IS a buffet,</i> piped Akamaru.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nah, we're good,</i> replied Nimaru.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru, on the other hand, glanced at Akamaru's steak and licked his chops.  <i>Although...those steaks DO look quite tasty...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru simply rolled his eyes.  <i>Oh, will you stop being such a damn pig?  We LITERALLY just ate half an hour ago!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru growled back at the other dog.  <i>Hey!  I didn't say I wanted to EAT it!  I said it looked tasty!  That a crime?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru then snickered and added, <i>Plus, you ain't exactly one to talk, Shomaru...or should I say...'Blimpmaru?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru immediately snapped his head back at the other twin and growled.  <i>What'd you call me...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru flashed a grin.  <i>Oh, I'm sorry, is that NOT what I should call someone who stuffed his face to the gills with all those pork chops when Kuromaru was on mission?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And like YOU didn't stuff y'er damn face with all those drumsticks?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey!  At least I didn't roll around like an ass like a certain SOMEONE did after he got into the jerky!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sanmaru's ears perk up as he barks angrily.  <i>Hey, don't drag ME into this, you horse's ass!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaaaand like clockwork, the trio were bickering again in full force.  Akamaru and Kiba glance at each other for a bit, then chuckle amongst themselves before digging in.  Akamaru wasted little time chomping into his next steak with vigor as he took hearty bites and savored the juicy, tender meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like before, Kiba assaulted his burger like a shark to a sailboat, with one massive shark bite after another.  His cheeks were immediately bulging with burger meat and other ingredients as he chewed and chewed and chewed some more, before taking an ample gulp that sent a large, noticeable bulge down his throat, only to disappear into his chest, and eventually add to the increasing mass in his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every few bites, Kiba's stomach expanded more and more, with him occasionally stopping to rub his belly soothingly or burp to make a little more room for the incoming burger.  Not as though he'd be done after this burger...not if he wanted to be ready for this competition, but even still, the burger's sheer size required some accommodation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's tummy; like Kiba's, had also begun to swell up ever more noticeably.  He whined to himself, realizing it would be hard to chastise Kiba for eating so much, when he was doing the exact same thing.  But, for the life of him, he couldn't help himself when it came to steaks so utterly delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ate and ate, while the Haimaru bickered and bickered, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bickering once again came to a halt as a pair of utterly titanic belches emitted from both Kiba and Akamaru.  As the burps subsided, both Kiba and Akamaru sighed in unison and leaned back in their seats.  Akamaru had put a considerable dent in his stack of steaks, while Kiba had successfully demolished his massive burger, the result of which left his belly so swollen, the slightest sliver of flesh could now be seen from the bottom of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man oh man, now THAT'S a damn good burger!\"  Exclaimed Kiba merrily as he smacked his bloated gut proudly.  Akamaru simply smacked his chops and added, <i>these steaks aren't too bad either!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Shomaru chuckled.  <i>Well, least we ain't as bad as THESE two squirts, right?</i>  And both his other siblings simply snickered at the sight of the two engorged pals and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No question.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, shortly after taking the brief moment to catch their breath...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, it didn't take long for Kiba and Akamaru to get their second wind and jump right back into their meals. For Kiba, he simply didn't want to lose steam now, especially if he was gonna win that contest. Akamaru? Well, the steaks were just too damn tasty to let sit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, licking their chops, they immediately began digging right back into their treats; Kiba alternating between shoving handfuls of tempura and jerky into his mouth, with Akamaru taking large bites out of his steaks. Every now and then, the dog-nin would pick up a few drumsticks and rip massive hunks of meat off of them, or take massive bites of pizza, wash it down with a hearty gulp of cola, and dive right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the Haimaru's watched, marveling both at the speed at which they were going and the fact that, as Kiba continued shoveling goodies into his mouth, his tummy slowly but surely bulged bigger and bigger as more and more food plopped into it. It swelled and pushed out noticeably, his t-shirt slowly sliding up and the small sliver of exposed flesh widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn,</i> Shomaru woofed to his brothers, <i>lookit the kid go!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru's eyes widened. <i>Geez, he must really be hungry, huh?</i> He shrugged. <i>'Course, there's the fact he's gettin' ready for that contest, too...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru was too fixated on Kiba's slowly growing belly to join in the conversation. Instead, he barked, <i>How big ya think the squirt's gut is gonna be by the time he's done here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching this, Sanmaru glanced at the bouty of food still on the table, then at the rest of the buffet. <i>Depends on whether or not he's going back for seconds after he's done all this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Kiba caught this; swallowing a mouthful of chicken, he glanced over at the brothers and grinned. \"You're damn right I'm going back up! And I ain't leavin' till I feel like I'm gonna explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened, even he gulped down the last bite of his current piece of steak and pulled the next one close to him. <i>That's what I was afraid of...</i> the dog whined to himself, taking rather large bite of the new steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling a bit at the younger dog's reaction, Shomaru wagged his tail and looked between his brothers. <i>Bettin' ya five dog treats Kiba's belly button pops out before he's done here.</i> Akamaru yelped, but quickly got himself under control before Kiba noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru smirked. <i>Make it ten, and you're good to go.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru, tail wagging, eagerly added his two cents. <i>And I'm bettin' ya Akamaru's gonna be batting at it too once it goes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru flushed a deep red under his fur at this, and Kiba reddened slightly too. In spite of this, he managed a smirk. \"Y-ya know, boy,\" Kiba began, picking up a wing and tearing into it, \"There's no shame in admitting ya like playing with my belly-button when it pops...\" He grimaced as he chewed. \"Even if it feels really, really weird when you do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru snickered. <i>You didn't seem to mind last time it happened...or was it some other squirt who was grinnin' like a goof and sticking his tongue out as that little nub'a flesh went back and forth like a punching bag?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Kiba's face DID burn red in embarrassment, and he quickly dove back into his food, cramming a slice of pizza into his mouth; it was times like that we was exceptionally grateful that his clan's dogs, with the exception of Kuromaru, only spoke 'dog'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wasn't much better. <i>Y-yeah, keep laughing, you three,</i> Aamaru stammered, trying to sound reproving. <i>Wh-what about when he...WE eat so much we get wedged into the damn booth?</i> He gave a worried look to his tummy, which had ballooned up a bit more from the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Nimaru gave a matter-of-fact answer. <i>Whaddaya think? We help pry ya out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head, growling in annoyance. <i>I was being serious.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru smirked a bit. <i>So was I.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru picked up from from where his brother had left off. <i>OK, we'll admit, it's fun watching you two eat so much you look like you're having puppies...but you really think we'd just leave ya hanging?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling a bit at Kiba and Akamaru's surprised expressions, Sanmaru continued. <i>In case ya forgot, we're a pack...</i> he winked at the two. <i>...and pack members look out for one another.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened. <i>Guys...</i> he whined, more than a bit touched. As goofy, silly, and downright crazy the Haimaru's could be off-mission, it was easy to forget that they were also among the most loyal, devoted clan-mates---and friends--- one could ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, equally taken off guard, nonetheless managed a smile. \"...thanks, guys,\" he finally said, his tone full of gratitude. His smile quickly turned mischievous, though, and he added, \"Hope you guys are ready for a workout, 'cause me 'n Akamaru are gonna be goin' all the way today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru trotted up to Kiba, licking his hand. <i>Wouldn't expect anything less.</i> Then, smirking, he glanced back at the other two. <i>Dunno about me, but these two layabouts are definitely gonna need a workout...</i> Ignoring Shomaru and Nimaru's indignant growls, he winked at Kiba in a mock-conspiratorial manner. <i>They've been doin' a lot of laying around lately, if ya catch my drift...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba patted Sanmaru on the head. \"Ah, don't worry; I'll give 'em a good workout.\" Then, flashing one last smirk at the dog, he immediately resumed digging into his meal, this time targeting several large pieces of fried chicken. Wagging his tail, Sanmaru trotted back to his siblings, who both glared at him. <i>What?</i> he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, in spite of the looming realization that, yes, he and Kiba likely WOULD get wedged into the booth, couldn't help but wag his tail as he looked at the brothers. <i>Ahhh....never change, you three,</i> he thought fondly, before hopping back to his own steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went by, and Kiba and Akamaru continued digging into their meals. Their bellies slowly continued to swell, with Kiba's ballooning up, pushing forward, and forcing his shirt higher and higher, exposing more skin. All the while, the Haimaru's watched, in a mix of fascination and anticipation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiba; holding two drumsticks in each hand, dug his face into one drum, tore off an ample chunk, and as he was chewing voraciously, turned to the other drum, and tore off a huge chunk of THAT piece as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru's eyes widened at the sight.  <i>Maaaaaan, lookit the kid go!  He's like some damn eating machine'er something!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other brothers were equally fascinated with the pace in which an otherwise reluctant Akamaru was chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large white furred nin-dog was holding an entire piece of steak up by his muzzle.  He was chewing on the part of it inside his mouth vigorously, gulping down a good bit of it as he tilted his head back a bit and allowed more of the steak to slide into his surprisingly eager maw, only for him to repeat the same process over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>H-heh, think that's something?  Check out Squirt number two over here!  Pup's like a freakin' Seagull wolfing down a guppy!</i> remarked Nimaru, much to Akamaru's embarrassment.  However, despite hearing that, he still soldiered on, right alongside his buddy, gulping down more and more of their ample bounty, while the dogs watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh-huh, yeah, I WISH guppies looked even half as good as those steaks do...</i> remarked Sanmaru, licking his lips eagerly as he watched the dog wolf down those savory chunks of beef.  But nonetheless, shook it off and maintained composure...for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving picked the drumsticks of all meat, Kiba took another hearty swig of cola, sighed with relief, and promptly stuffed another slice of pizza right into his maw, nearly in one bite like before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru, having turned to Kiba in time to bare witness to this occurrence, bugged out for a moment.  <i>Holiest of craps...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two dogs turned, and promptly gaped as they saw Kiba stuff an entire spice of pizza; right down to the crust, right into his mouth.  His cheeks bulged comically as he chewed witha  notably strained look on his face, before; with a MIGHTY gulp, sent that humungous mouthful down his throat and into his gullet.  Gasping with relief, Kiba licked his lips and grabbed more chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do yourself a HUGE favor, kid...don't ever...ever...<i>ever</i>...and I mean EVER...do that around your mom...or Kuromaru...</i> muttered Somaru, flabbergasted, but with a slight smirk across his muzzle to signify him being notably impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gulping down a chunk of chicken meat, Kiba chuckled nervously and rubbed the back of his head.  \"H-heh, yeah, that's...that's a given...\" replied the boy before stuffing his craw with more and more food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Akamaru; even as he ate his own steaks, found himself glancing over at his dera friend, seeing him still stuffing his face with whatever could fit inside of it, and wincing nervously as he saw how rounded out Kiba's belly had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving packed away such a positively stupendous amount of food in so little a duration, Kiba's stomach had swollen to the point where it looked like he had swallowed a medicine ball.  On top of that, his shirt had hiked just atop his belly button, making Akamaru even more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, great...won't be long now til Kiba's belly button's showing...then it won't be long til he eventually pops it outward...and THEN it won't be long til I accidentally try pawing at it when it's wobbling...aaaaaaaaaaand then, I'll never ever hear the freaking end of it from these guys...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was in a bind, indeed.  Kiba was only going to stuff himself further and further, and even after the days' escapades had passed, it'd only encourage him to rinse and repeat for his next \"training session\".  But, nonetheless, it did no use worrying now since it was going to happen regardless.  Plus, it was hard to say no to such delicious steaks...steaks which got Akamaru wondering about some of the other treats this place had to offer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, for the time being, the two ate and ate.  Akamaru's plate of steaks was starting to thin out considerably.  And Kiba's tray was beginning to get lighter and lighter as the sheer mountain of food laid upon it grew smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after swallowing one last piece of fried shrimp tempura, Kiba had successfully picked his tray dry.  Like his pal, Akamaru's plate had been demolished and literally licked clean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So...much...meat...</i> whimpered Akamaru as he glanced down and saw his bloated tummy sticking outward considerably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And'ja look like y'er about to give birth to a few pups, pup!</i> added Nimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked dully and glanced at the Haimaru in question.  <i>Yes, thank you for that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at that, Kiba slouched back in his chair, let out a massive belch, then sighed with relief as he patted his own rounded stomach proudly.  \"Ohhh man, you weren't kiddin', boy...this stuff is FILLING, but MAN does it taste awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, despite himself, wagged his tail.  <i>No question...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced slightly at his owner, seeing Kiba's belly had swollen to the point where his shirt now rode a little bit above his belly button, and oddly enough, seemed surprised.  <i>Huh, thought his stomach might have been bigger by now...</i> the canine thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to his alarm, Kiba winced a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba?  You okay?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh, h-heh, yeah, I'm cool,\" replied the teen as he reached over his massive belly, trying to get to his pants button.  \"...Rgh, think I forgot to unbutton my pants again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy struggled and struggled some more, much to the amusement of the Haimaru's.  Until eventually, he stopped and shrugged...then grinned mischievously.  \"Whelp, guess I gotta unbutton the only other way I know how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Kiba rose from his seat, ample belly sloshing just slightly, but constricted due to the button containment, and approached the buffet line while Akamaru's ears flopped over his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Greaaaaaat...so, on top of EVERYTHING else, NOW I gotta worry about flying buttons...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the Haimaru laughed amongst themselves, just as Kiba returned with yet another frightful amount of food on his tray, and a second tray, loaded with a hearty stack of steaks, and loads upon LOADS of jerky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes had never been wider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I know the steaks were awesome, but...you don't REALLY expect me to eat all THAT, do you...?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing heartily, Kiba ruffled his dogs head playfully and shook his head.  \"Haha, ohhh admit it, you'd LOVE it if I did!\"  The dog blushed a bit beneath his fur, but sensed something else.  \"Buuuuuut I couldn't help but overhear how totally badly these guys wanted some of that steak you were eatin', soooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he surprised the Haimaru by setting the plate down besides the table for the three of them.  \"Go nuts, guys!\"  He then turned to Akamaru and set the plate of jerky for the big white dog. \"And this is for you, boy!  Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Akamaru barked in appreciation, and proceeded to chomp away, as Kiba got to work himself, notably slower however, due to his constriction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Haimaru, on the other hand, just stared in silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...I know we already ate...so...I'm...not THAT hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-yeah...yeah, me neither...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then again...I s'pose...m-maybe...maybe ONE wouldn' hurt, right, guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeeeeeell, I s'pose not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-yeah!  Like, m-maybe a bite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or two...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Aaaaaand in perfect unison, all three leaped at the plate hungrily, much to the amusement of Kiba and Akamaru...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kiba continued shoving food into his mouth at a slower, albeit steady pace and Akamaru wolfed down mouthful after mouthful of jerky, the Haimaru's dug into their plate of steaks. They jostled, growled, and barked at one another as they ate, though they all stayed where they were, their tails wagging all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man,</i> Shomaru gasped as he came up for air, only to duck his head right back down, <i>for a buffet, these things are AMAZING!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru woofed his agreement, even as he tore chunks of meat from one of the steaks. <i>You're tellin' me...I could eat these things for DAYS!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru wagged his tail so hard, his rump appeared to be shaking right along with it. <i>Man, I don't care if I end up lookin' like a blimp; these steaks are just too good!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled as he gulped down a particularly large bite of pizza, even as he winced at the tightness in his waistline. \"Heh, they're good, aren't they?\" The Haimaru's gave emphatic barks of agreement at this, even as they dug into their meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail as he gulped down more jerky. <i>Heh, I coulda told them that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they continued; the Haimaru's continuing to tear into their steaks, Akamaru gulping down increasingly large mouthfuls of jerky, and Kiba shoving whatever he could get into his mouth and gulping them down, occasionally taking a hearty swig of cola for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time ticked on, Kiba and Akamaru's bellies steadily swelled; Akamaru's continued to bulge out, inching closer and closer to the table. Kiba's tummy's growth wasn't as noticeable, due to his pants still constricting his belly, but it still bulged noticeably with every few mouthfuls. All the while, his button continued to strain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and as Kiba chowed down, his button got tighter and tighter. The dog-nin winced, but soldiered on; after all, that wouldn't be the first time he'd snapped his button off, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. To that end, he renewed his efforts, going as fast as his button would allow him. Chicken, pizza, tempura, wings, soda, steak, burgers...all of it went down his gullet, straining his button further and further. At the rate he was going, it wasn't long before one of the threads holding the disc to his pants frayed, causing it to loosen. Feeling this, Kiba grinned and pressed on even harder. As he did, his button continued to fray...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, hearing the sound of tearing fabric, glanced up and whined. <i>Oh great...not much longer till he pops that sucker off...</i> As he thought this, he lowered his head, hoping that it would help him avoid the imminent projectile even as he continued wolfing his jerky down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious to any of this, the Haimaru's continued tearing into their steaks, having lost none of their vigor or speed. Their stomachs hadn't quite started bulging yet, though their furry bellies did appear a bit more concave than they had been. They felt as much, but soldiered on; after all, it wasn't often they got to eat steaks this tasty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more Kiba ate, and the looser and looser his button became. Akamaru, hearing the tearing of fabric, whined. <i>Oh geez...not long now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Kiba felt as though his button were on its last legs. <i>Heh,</i> HE thought to himself, smirking. <i>almost there!</i> He glanced at the goodies still on the table. <i>One more big mouthful oughta do it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes falling upon a particularly huge slice of pizza, he grabbed it, opened his mouth wide, and crammed the whole thing in. HE chewed slowly, wincing as the pain in his waistline became almost unbearable. <i>Just...a little...more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when he felt he'd chewed the slice of pizza enough, he took a deep breath through his nostrils, gulped the whole thing down (wincing as he did so), and, as it traveled downwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing a slightly louder tearing of fabric, Akamaru ducked his head down so far it was practically on the table. <i>Here it comes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba waited with bated breath as the pizza traveled down his gullet to his stomach. And, as it plopped into his belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>POP</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an audible SNAP and tearing of fabric, Kiba's button burst off his pants, making a beeline for the opposite side of the booth. Thankfully, it whizzed right above Akamaru's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew,</i> the dog thought, wagging his tail. <i>That was a close one...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd promptly ricocheting off the back of Akamaru's seat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GAH!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n....and Sanmaru promptly yelped and fell back. His brothers, noticing this, immediately went to his side. <i>Uh, bro? You OK?</i> Shomaru whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kiba's belly, freed from the constraints of his button, seemed to spill forth, surging forward until it was dangerously close to touching the table of the booth and bulging out to the sides. His shirt hiked up several more inches, and his fly pulled itself down about halfway. \"Ohhhhh man,\" Kiba moaned, slouching back in his seat. \"That feels SO much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, glancing up (and privately surprised at just how much bigger Kiba's stomach seemed to have gotten simply from busting his button), was about to reply, when he heard the whines of the Haimaru brothers. Confused, he glanced to the side of the table. His eyes widened as he saw them. <i>Uhhh, Kiba...</i> the dog whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up a bit, Kiba glanced at his pal. \"Yeah, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru motioned toward the triplets with his head. <i>I think your button took an, ah, unexpected trajectory...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Kiba looked over to where Akamaru was indicating. \"Unexpected? What do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own eyes widened as he saw Shomaru and Nimaru standing over Sanmaru, the dog protrate on his back and paws up in the air. On his forehead, there was a very noticeable red mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blushed. <i>Whoops...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with some more concern, he asked, \"Oi! You OK, Sanmaru?\" The dog's only reply to this was a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>C'mon, bro!</i> Nimaru urged, panic seeping into his tone. <i>Say something! ANYTHING!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs and dog-nin watched with bated breath as Sanmaru twitched a bit, whining...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his eyes flew open, his muzzle opened wide, he took a deep breath, and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>FINLAND!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru and Nimaru glanced at each other, utterly confused. Akamaru simply rolled his eyes. <i>Yep; he's OK.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow, utterly lost even as Sanmaru staggered back to his paws. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru, wobbling a bit on his paws, nonetheless flashed Kiba a doggie grin. <i>Eh, don't worry, squirt, I'm OK. And trust me, I don't know what the hell Finland...is...either...</i> The dog trailed off, his eyes widening as he stared at Kiba. His siblings, following his gaze, soon mirrored his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"Uh, guys? What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, Shomaru raised a paw and pointed toward Kiba's stomach. \"My gut? Whaddaya...\" He glanced down, and his eyes widened as he saw just how much bigger his stomach had become upon breaking his button. It had gone past medicine ball size, becoming more like a small beach ball in both size and appearance, hiking his shirt up several inches above his navel and, if the slight draft playing about his lower body were any indication, opening his zipper partway. In addtion, Kiba could have sworn he felt his belly beginning to brush the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba rubbed the back of his head. \"H-heh, guess the button was a lot tighter than I thought, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Haimaru's did not reply, only continuing to gape. Then, they glanced at each other, nodded, and looked back toward Kiba. <i>Uh, kid?</i> Shomaru began, looking a bit nervous. Akamaru tilted his head, not sure what they were thinking. <i>Can we ask a favor?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba frowned, puzzled. \"What sorta favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the Haimaru's glanced at each other, seemingly gathering their resolve. Then, looking back at Kiba, they opened their muzzles, and as one, they asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can we touch it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked dully. \"Touch...touch my gut?\" The Haimaru's nodded numbly. Akamaru, meanwhile, simply shook his head. <i>Yeah, not surprised at all...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, that's...kiiiiind of a weird request, isn't it...?\"  Kiba asked, as he rubbed the back of his head, admittedly, a bit taken back.  He then glanced at how surprisingly rounded and large his stomach had distended since this feasting had begun.  Even he was more than surprised by the ample progress and how much further his stomach had distended from losing that blasted button.  Drumming his fingers atop his belly for a moment, Kiba was about to reach back for another slice of pizza, but stopped and winced a bit, gripping his bloated gut firmly, much to Akamaru's alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you okay, buddy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, yeah, I'm cool, just...oof...my gut's kinda feelin' loaded right now.  Eh, guess a break wouldn't hurt for a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba leaned back in his seat, drumming his fingers atop his belly, when Akamaru subtly tilted his head towards the side to get Kiba's attention.  Catching on, Kiba turned, seeing the Haimaru's still looking up at him a bit pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, c'mon, squirt...pleeeeeease?</i>  whined Nimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, pretty pleeeeeaaaaase?</i>  added Sanmaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell,\" Kiba began, thinking for a second then eventually shrugging, \"Ah, what the hell, guess it ain't often you see me packin' THIS much food in my gut at once, right?\"  He slapped his belly proudly for emphasis, causing his rounded appendage to jostle about slightly.  \"Besides,\" Kiba added, reaching down and ruffling Sanmaru's head, \"I guess I DO kinda owe ya f'er the button, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru barked happily and licked Kiba's hand before he rose up to his hind legs, and placed his front paws slightly against Kiba's big, bloated abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, woooow...</i> Sanmaru mused, feeling Kiba's belly all over with his paws, much to Akamaru's and even Kiba's amusement.  <i>Hehe, it's all soft'n bouncy!</i>  Sanmaru added, rather childishly as he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really?  Lemme see too!</i>  remarked Shomaru as he rose up to Kiba's seat and also started pressing and feeling Kiba's bare stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey!  Make room, ya jerks!</i>  added Nimaru as he squeezed between the two other siblings and also rested his paws against Kiba's ample gut.  Once again, Kiba found himself a bit taken back by how fascinated the dog sibling trio had currently become with his stomach, but couldn't help but chuckle a bit at their remarks and banter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, man!  It's like kneading a buncha silly putty....minus Kuromaru gettin' mad at us f'er accidentally eatin' it...</i> remarked Nimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Accidentally?  Ya freakin' said 'bottoms up,' ya dunce!</i> noted Shomaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, watching from across the table, snickered to himself, catching Kiba's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's so funny, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, with your stomach looking the way it does now, and the way the guys are feeling it, I swear it's almost like you're pregnant.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sputtered, face immediately reddening, much to Akamaru's amusement, as he glanced back and said.  \"W-wha?!  No I don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as he made his case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man, listen to how loud it is in there!</i> remarked Shomaru as he pressed his canine ear against Kiba's belly and listened to it.  Shortly after, both Sanmaru and Nimaru joined him, equally perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maaaaaaaaaan, I didn't know the stomach even MADE noises like that!</i> remarked Sanmaru, also listening with one ear pressed against Kiba's ample tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, kid, your gut's noisy...</i> added Nimaru, listening like the others as his paw adjusted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, simply blinked dully, turning back to Akamaru who was grinning a doggie grin.  \"...Oh, shut up, I don't look pregnant...\"  Kiba replied bluntly and disgruntled.  But just then, his tummy began to gurgle quite audibly, much to the notice of the Haimaru's as they pulled their respective heads off of Kiba's stomach for a moment as they glanced at the gurgling appendage in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The hell's goin' on in there?</i>  muttered Nimaru curiously as he poked and prodded Kiba's belly curiously.  Unfortunately, the prodding  at the midsection had worked up a sudden pressure pocket built up from the sudden churning, which worked its way up Kiba's throat and out the young dog-nin's mouth in the form of a positively HUGE belch, which reverberated throughout the entire buffet, causing Kiba's face to go redder than a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...s-s'cuse me...\"  Kiba muttered apologetically, thankfully no one was really in the buffet to be too disgusted by the massive eruption.  The Haimaru's, on the other hand, seemed less than disgusted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hahaholy crap!  Ya got some pretty damn good pipes on ya, squirt!</i> remarked Nimaru as he snickered with amusement, tail wagging rapidly/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heeeeey, no fair!  I wanna try too!</i>  Complained Sanmaru before he lifted his paw up.  Eyes widening, Kiba was about to protest, but as soon as the large dogs' paw pressed firmly against Kiba's rounded middle, the only thing that came out of Kiba's mouth was another, particularly lengthy belch, much to Akamaru's amusement, who watched, snickering to himself the whole audible time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ha!  The one I got outta the kid was longer than yours!</i>  Bragged Sanmaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pfft, big deal!  The one I pushed outta him was way louder!</i>  Barked Nimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the two argue who got a better burp outta Kiba, got the dog-nin and nin-dog glancing blankly at one another as the two shook their heads in unison at the ridiculousness of the conversation.  That is, until Shomaru lifted his paws up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My turn!</i>  the third Haimaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah crap...\" muttered Kiba dreadfully, before the large dog pressed BOTH paws against the boys' belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BBBBBBBRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!!!! !!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third belch forced out of the young dog-nin was easily the loudest and longest, which actually caused his belly to jostle a bit with the sudden movement.  Shomaru just glanced at his two siblings and stuck his tongue out as he said, <i>I win.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other Haimaru's grumbled in annoyance amongst themselves, while Akamaru; unable to contain his snickering, glanced at his friend as he caught his breath.  <i>Hehe, you okay there, Kiba?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, however, Kiba's eyes widened as he felt his stomach a bit and, finally noted, \"...Actually...yeah...I think all that kinda took a bit 'uh the pressure sittin' in my gut away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words left Kiba's mouth, the trio glanced at one another and; in perfect, frightful unison, grinned a fiendishly mischievous grin...</span></div></div>",

The last time they had worn it, Kiba's kitchen had been flooded with whipped cream, the walls had been splotched with an incredibly garish yellow paint, and Kuromaru had been absolutely livid (it had taken WEEKS to wash the pink polka dots out of his fur). Kiba could only guess what they were planning now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, squirt?</i> Shomaru's barking voice brought Kiba out of his thoughts, the dog-nin looking up to see the Haimaru's all focused on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...yeah...?\" Kiba replied, almost a little fearful as to what the answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru smirked a doggie smirk. <i>You said that last one that Sir Numbnuts here forced outta you took away a bit of the pressure in your gut, right?</i> Shomaru glared at his sibling, while Sanmaru snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"Uh, yeah, but there's still a lot of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off, the Haimaru's intentions becoming crystal clear in his mind. <i>Are they actually gonna...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whimpered. <i>Guys...</i> he implored, evidently having come to the same conclusion as his pal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanmaru gave Akamaru a friendly wink. <i>Ah, c'mon, squirt,</i> he assured, tail wagging. <i>Kiba's made it pretty damn clear he intends to eat as much as he possibly can...but he can't do that with all that pressure in his gut, can he?</i> And, before either Kiba or Akamaru could reply to that, all three Haimaru's surged toward the table, got up on their hind legs, and, as one, rested their front paws on Kiba's swollen belly. Then, they all glanced at one another, flashing those fiendish grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ready?</i> Shomaru began, tail wagging. <i>One...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced. \"Uh, guys, maybe just one at a time...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two...</i> Nimaru continued, not heeding what Kiba said at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru gulped. <i>Um, fellas, are you really sure you wanna...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Akamaru could even finish his sentence, Sanmaru's eyes shone with a fiendish glint....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>THREE!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as one, the Haimaru's pressed down hard on Kiba's belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!*&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n...and the dog-nin subsequently let loose with an incredibly loud, incredibly long belch, his mouth flying wide open and his belly vibrating. Even Akamaru gaped at the sheer magnitude of the burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hoo-WHEE!</i> Shomaru whooped as Kiba's belch wound down, a noticeable blush coming to the dog-nin's face. <i>Now THAT was a good one!</i> He tilted his head. <i>How ya feelin', squirt?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's blush intensified a bit before he got the nerve to reply. \"Well...a lot more pressure just went out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All of it?</i> Nimaru asked,hisrump practically shaking in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, no, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK then!</i> Nimaru replied cheerfully, pressing down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the subsequent belch lacked the sheer magnitude of the first,owing to the fact that only Nimaru had pressed down on his belly, Akamaru still sat dumbstruck by it...even as he rolled his eyes. <i>Real smooth, Kiba; real smooth...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the belch wound down, Kiba's blush intensified a bit more. However, he had barely any time to recuperate when Sanmaru pressed down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....then Shomaru....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRR RRRRP!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then Nimaru....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP PPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then Sanmaru again.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAA AAAAAAAAAAARRRRPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continued, the brothers forcing gargantuan belches out of Kiba, one after the other, tails and rumps wagging and huge, doggie smiles upon their muzzles. All the while, Kiba's face steadily grew redder and redder, the markings on his face becoming harder to pick out, and Akamaru simply watched, awestruck at both the magnitude of Kiba's burps and just how many the Haimaru's kept on wringing out of him. <i>Must be a loooootta pressure in there....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, as Kiba's latest burp wound down, the Haimaru's all looked at one another, tails wagging. <i>Well then, gentlemen,</i> Nimaru began, a mischievous glint in his eyes. <i>...big finale?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Big finale,</i> Shomaru and Sanmaru replied in unison, eyes lighting up. At the same time, Kiba's own widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait guys,\" he stammered, face redder than ever. \"I-I think I've freed up enough roo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd scarcely said this when the Haimaru's reared up, lifting their front paws off Kiba's belly....and as they SLAMMED them back down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Kiba let loose with what was probably the longest, LOUDEST belch any of them had ever heard. Again, Kiba's face reddened, and again his belly vibrated....but now, Akamaru could have sworn he'd felt the booth itself vibrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burp finally began to wind down, the Haimaru's finally got off of Kiba's belly, returning to standing on the floor as they looked up at him. <i>Well, squirt?</i> Nimaru asked as the belch began losing volume and intensity. <i>How ya feeling...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave a small afterburp, appearing a bit dazed. \"Oh man...\" he muttered. \"Don't think I've ever belched so much in my life....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Take it from me; you haven't,</i> Akamaru chimed, wagging his tail in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling weakly, Kiba sluggishly raised a hand to his belly, gently massaging it...before his eyes widened. \"Holy crap...\" he muttered, suddenly more alert. Putting both hands on his belly, he tentatively kneaded it. \"Wow...there's no pressure anymore!\" he exclaimed. \"I feel like I could eat way,WAY more!\" He flashed the triplets a grin. \"Thanks, guys!\" And, with that, he went right back to chowing down on the bounty of food he had on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomaru smirked. <i>We aim to please.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru nudged his sibling. <i>Well, I can tell you ONE squirt we ain't pleasing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Shomaru and Sanmaru glanced over at Akamaru, who was giving all three of them the stinkeye and growling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed, Shomaru shrugged. <i>Eh, ya can't win 'em all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Akamaru promptly dove back into his own food....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Akamaru scarfed down another huge chunk of steak and gulped it right down, he watched Kiba greedily stuffing as much meat into his maw as he could possibly cram into it.  Seems; despite that utterly humiliating situation the Haimaru brothers just put Kiba through, that release of so much pressure seemed to really be helping the young dog-nin pick up his second wind, as he was chowing down almost as fast as he was when he and Akamaru had first arrived at the buffet to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, guess all that nonstop burping really DID free up some much needed room in his gut, huh...</i> Akamaru mused, watching Kiba chow down relentlessly.  <i>Still, he's got pretty good pipes on 'em...hope he doesn't make a habit of using 'em too much...caaaause I'm pretty sure that's how Earthquakes start...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering at the thought, the big white dog went back to chowing down across from his dog-nin buddy; both their bellies continuing to expand with every few ample mouthfuls gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Haimaru's were joyously scarfing down one steak after another, tails and rumps wagging and shaking merrily as they did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, sweet mother of mercy...how the hell does buffet steak taste like steakhouse steak?!</i>  mused Shomaru between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Beats the hell outta me.  Usually, it's s'posed to the cheap crap, right?</i>  woofed Nimaru in agreement, also between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>URRRP!  Who cares?  Just shaddup'n eat, ya nitwits!</i> responded Sanmaru, after gulping down an ample mouthful, and digging right back in for more.  The other two would have growled angrily at him, but were just too enticed by the flavor to do so.  Instead, they did just what Sanmaru suggested...they shut their traps, and chowed down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time had passed as the gang continued relentlessly wolfing down the contents of their respective plates and trays.  Both Kiba's and Akamaru's bellies continued to swell and swell, getting a little closer to the booth than either one would like...not that they had noticed yet.  Meanwhile, the Haimaru's midsections continued to swell and round out beneath them, beginning to hang from their torsos and jostle a bit as they continued merrily wagging their tails and rumps and chowing down like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, after a particularly large mouthful had been gulped down, Kiba stopped, and winced as he rested one hand firmly against the middle of his bloated belly.  Catching this, Akamaru stopped mid-bite, glanced up at Kiba and whined with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba?  What's wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the Haimaru's all stopped and jolted their heads up at the sight of Kiba gripping his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohhh!  Do ya gotta burp again, squirt?</i>  Barked Nimaru...almost eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no no!  I'm cool!\"  Kiba said, in a nervous effort to assure the big dogs that their \"help\" wouldn't be necessary.  \"Nah, my gut just feels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kiba could finish, Akamaru's concern died down as he sighed to himself and woofed.  <i>...Kiiinda 'tight'?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Kiba smirked and nodded back at the big white canine.  \"Y-yeah, just a lil bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well,</i> Akamaru began, <i>we COULD always use that as an indicator to call it a day.  I mean, it's a pretty safe bet that we've all MORE than eaten our fill by now, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OR...</i>  Shomaru interjected, <i>...ya could power through that uncomfortable tight feelin'er whatever ya call it...and then POP goes the belly button!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Kiba turned to Akamaru and grinned somewhat mischievously.  \"Ehehe, sorry, boy...buuuuuuut I'm not quite ready to call it a day just yet...\"  And no sooner did he finish that sentence, Kiba promptly grabbed a rack of BBQ ribs, and proceeded to greedily tear the meat right off the bones, and chow down, smearing his mouth with a great deal of BBQ sauce in the process.  Akamaru just blinked dully as he watched Kiba ravage the meal before him without hesitation or mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How many stomachaches does he have to endure before he learns the value of moderation....?</i>  Thought Akamaru, before promptly looking down at his own blimped out belly and whining to himself.  <i>Probably around the same time I do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Kiba chow down, the Haimaru's stopped and watched Kiba eat eagerly.  But more specifically, their attention had fallen down to Kiba's already ridiculously swollen belly.  They watched as it surged outwards just more and more, slowly beginning to press just a tiny bit against the booth...but still nothing Kiba couldn't manage.  All the while, they waited and waited...watching Kiba's belly groan and gurgle as it began to exceed capacity, making Kiba wince in pain and discomfort as that tightness in the middle of his abdomen only became more and more severe.  Akamaru whined, wishing Kiba wouldn't push himself so far...but knowing full well he was equally as stubborn as a certain blond bonehead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba's eyes widened with one last, ample mouthful gulped down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru and the Haimaru's turned their attention to Kiba's belly as it jostled and vibrated ominously, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*POP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as predicted, Kiba's navel popped outward from his usual innie, to an outie stub.  And with that infamous pop, came a tremendous sigh of relief as Kiba leaned back in his seat, with a blissfully goofy look on his face and smiled.  \"Ohhhhhhh man...THERE it is...\" Kiba said, voice notably relieved as he gave his belly a hearty pat, causing that fleshy stub to wobble about.  \"Hehe, that'll never stop feelin' funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru once again cursed himself as he felt himself almost mesmerized by the stub, wanting to plop down from his seat and bat at it like a dazed pup.  But a sudden bark broke him from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>HA!</i> barked Shomaru as he pointed his paw at Kiba's belly button then turned his attention to Nimaru.  <i>See that?  You owe me five-no, I'm sorry, TEN doggie treats!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimaru woofed in annoyance.  <i>Ah shaddup...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sanmaru was sighing with relief.  <i>Phew, good thing he didn't hear my bet about Akamaru battin' at the thing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Actually, I did...</i> replied Shomaru, causing Sanmaru's ears to drop.  <i>And usually, when ya wanna say things to yourself...you THINK 'em, ya don't say 'em out loud...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I thought inner monologues were when ya say things no one else can hear...</i>  whined Sanmaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The only way no one can hear 'em is if y'er by yourself...or THINKING it, ya walking' dunce cap!</i> barked Shomaru, tail wagging at his victory, much to Akamaru's and Kiba's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So,</i> Akamaru began, almost indifferently, <i>I guess, now that the tightness is gone, y'er gonna be on your third-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Akamaru could finish, Kiba had already begun chowing down relentlessly, causing the dogs' ears to drop again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...wind...</i> he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, stop bein' such a wet blanket, pup,</i> barked Nimaru.  <i>The kid's stuffin' his face regardless.  Ya may as well enjoy it...ESPECIALLY when ya got the best tastin' steaks in all'uh Konoha sittin' right in front of ya!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the steaks, then down at his own rounded belly, noting how much bigger it had gotten, and not quite catching how it was slightly pressing against their table, Akamaru shook his head.  <i>Ah, what the hell...when it Rome, right...?</i>  And immediately, the big dog started chowing down, causing Nimaru's tail to wag before he got to work on his own plate along with his two brothers.  All five continued powering through their respective meals for a good long while; Kiba powering on without a trace of discomfort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until...</span></div></div>",

And, as he'd leaned back in his chair, rubbing his majorly  swollen and distended belly, the contest officiant had walked up to him and, after the typical series of congratulations, had handed him his prize; specifically, a voucher for all the free food he could eat for a whole month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kiba had always had a healthy appetite, even if it wasn't anywhere near Choji's level, but in the course of his preparing for the competition, that healthy appetite had increased exponentially. And, of course, he was never one to turn down free food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as the month had begun, Kiba had taken full advantage of the voucher; stuffing his craw with steaks one day, devouring an entire turkey another day, gulping down giant sundae after giant sundae...his midsection had, predictably, grown considerably after each one (he'd lost count of how many buttons had needed to be sewn back on,) but his metabolism and active lifestyle had ensured it had shrunken down quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an active metabolism and an active lifestyle could only do so much, something Akamaru lamented as he looked at Kiba now. Though he was still mostly slim, his stomach had begun taking on something of a rounded appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not lost on Kiba, as he turned towards the dog with a concerned look on his face. \"Eh? What's up, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do you think?</i> Akamaru asked, whining. <i>Your gut's starting to be affected by all the food you've been eating.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked down at his belly, placing a hand on top of it. \"Huh, looks like you're right, boy.\" He grinned, ruffling the dog's furry head. \"Still, the vouchers only good for the rest of this month; I promise that once it runs out, I'll work it all off. Don't worry,\" he added, winking. \"I'm not gonna end up like Choji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru raised an eyebrow. <i>Heh, better hope not, buddy; your mom would go ballistic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face paled at this; if ever he'd needed an incentive to not let the voucher affect him in the long run, that had been it. Akamaru, seeing this reaction, whined. <i>Sorry, Kiba; didn't mean to freak you out.</i> He licked Kiba's hand reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, for his part, quickly regained his composure and smirked. \"Nah, I'm good, boy.\" He ruffled the dog's head affectionately. \"Actually, I think that's exactly what I needed.\" Akamaru wagged his tail, both at the gesture and the reassurance Kiba would get himself sorted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kiba's stomach let out a rather noisy growl. Blushing, Kiba put his hand on his belly and got to his feet. \"Heh, looks like it's that time again, Akamaru.\" He chuckled as Akamaru whined, even as he got to his paws. \"I'm kinda feelin' some meat, right now.\" He smirked. \"Don't worry, I'll get something for you, too.\" Laughing, Kiba turned around and rushed off. Akamaru stayed where he was for a moment, sighing. <i>That makes me feel SO much better...</i> Shaking his head, he rushed off after his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Kiba and Akamaru's noses were greeted with the intoxicating aroma of meat cooking on a grill. The two had been to this place quite often now that all of Kiba's food was free, and most of the servers recognized Kiba because of it. As Kiba sat down at a table, with Akamaru laying down by his feet, one of the servers walked up to him and asked, \"The usual, sir?\" As if to answer, Kiba's stomach growled persistently. Kiba confirmed by saying, \"Of course, I'm starving!\" Akamaru winced a little upon hearing that, as he knew exactly what the usual was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some idle conversation between Kiba and Akamaru, the server finally arrived with the food. She struggled to carry a platter used to carry multiple plates, and she placed it on a fold out stand, just like with any other restaurant, she then placed plate after plate onto the table in front of Kiba. A whole assortment of types of steak was laid out in front of him. Finally, the server grabbed one final plate with a singular steak on it, depositing it in front of Akamaru. \"Let me know if you need anything else!\" The waitress politely said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took a hearty whiff of the steaks in front of him. He took a mental inventory of everything, and time and time again he was proud of the order that he had devised, one that became \"the usual\". In front of Kiba were two stacks of five 16 ounce porterhouse steaks each, a platter with fifteen pork chops on it, a plate with ten kielbasa sausages on it, a plate with a dozen sliders, and finally, as a little indulgence, a plate with five lobster tails and extra butter sauce. Finally, there was a pitcher of cola to wash it all down. Kiba rubbed his hands together, and he began to dig into the feast in front of him, starting with one of the steaks, which he merely grabbed with his hands, chewing through it easily with his Inuzuka teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chewed through the steak almost mechanically, quickly and efficiently removing all of the meat from the bone and licking the bone clean. \"Man, that's delicious!\" He blurted out to no one in particular, patting his stomach before deciding to move onto the sliders, stuffing a whole one in his mouth, and chewing it down with his cheeks full. He continued this process, going through the sliders in no time. At this point, his stomach, which was a bit softer and rounded as it is, began to push outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was nothing though, and after a hearty swig of cola with a burp, he moved onto the other steaks, taking four more down like he did with the first. After the first of these four, his stomach now visibly pressed against his shirt. Another one, and some strain was now showing on Kiba's shirt. The next one brought it to the point where Kiba's shirt began to lift ever so slightly, revealing a sliver of his bloated midsection, and finally, the last steak made that sliver into a more visible strip,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the eating contest, Kiba's stomach would probably be rock hard by now, and he would just power on through, but since he had eaten so much in the past couple of weeks, his stomach capacity was much larger, so his stomach was still soft and pliable, jiggling whenever he shifted his weight. Either way, he took another large swig of soda, burping afterwards, then proceeded to the kielbasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru had finished his steak and was chewing on the bone at this point, as he had gone at a much more leisurely pace. At this point, he watched Kiba stuff his face, slightly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grabbed two sausages at a time and he took hearty bites out of them. The sausages were fat and juicy, so that was more than enough to fill up his mouth again, his cheeks bulging to accommodate. He proceeded like this, his stomach proceeding on a relentless march outwards in order to make room. One he was done with all of the sausages, his stomach had lifted his shirt to just under his bellybutton, and he rubbed his belly aimlessly as he took another swig of cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up were the pork chops. They weren't that large as far as Kiba was concerned, so that's why he ordered fifteen. He grabbed two at a time, cramming them into his greedy maw. If anything, Akamaru was impressed by how much Kiba could fit in his mouth, and he was also amazed that Kiba could still chew quickly with all of that in his mouth. As the pork chops were deposited into Kiba's stomach, his shirt traveled upwards, and by the time he had finished all of the pork chops, his navel was completely exposed for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Kiba, his shorts had an elastic waistband, as the shorts were now being pressured by Kiba's gargantuan stomach, which was still not at its limits yet. Kiba then proceeded with the last stack of five steaks, proceeding just like he had before, and each steak had a considerable impact on his midsection, his shirt rising about an inch for every steak until his stomach was finally freed fully. It was now only a little bit flexible, and it wobbled only slightly, as there wasn't too much room left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba saved the lobster tails for last, and he ate each half of the tail meat in one massive bite, being sure to drench it in butter sauce first. All of that lead to the final state of Kiba's stomach, which was now free from his grey shirt. Because his shorts had an elastic waistband, they merely stretched to make room, but at this point, this was the extent of how far they could stretch. This was the limit of Kiba's stomach capacity now. This was what he considered to be a good meal now. His stomach was now just a bit taut, but if he wanted to stuff himself more, he certainly could. Either way, he belched, satisfied, and he patted his massive stomach proudly. Akamaru would have face palmed if he could, but he merely said to Kiba <i>You can really pack it away. If it weren't for your metabolism, Choji would be a shrimp to you.</i> \"If I can get lots of free food, it's worth a few extra pounds!\" was Kiba's simple response. <i>Speak for yourself, Kiba</i> Akamaru replied. He was concerned that a few extra pounds would turn into something much more, but at least this would be over with at the end of the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba left a tip for the waitress, as she was always polite to him, and he got up and stretched, then walked out with Akamaru in tow. He would typically have had trouble with the additional weight in his midsection, but thanks to his constant feasting like this, he could walk around as he normally did, with ease. People would sometimes stare if they didn't already know him, but he was used to it. Either way...</span></div></div>",

As he and Akamaru trotted on, they got occasional glances from the townsfolk.  While Kiba paid them no heed, Akamaru couldn't help but whine a bit as he knew exactly what was surprising them so much.  Hearing this, Kiba looked down at the giant dog and asked, \"Something wrong, boy?\"  <i>People are still giving you weird looks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to confirm, Kiba scoffed.  \"Ah, whatever. They're all just jealous cause THEY don't get to enjoy a free all you can eat pass to any restaurant in Konoha.\"  Kiba bragged, smirking cockily as they continued on.  Akamaru's ears dropped over his eyes in embarrassment at the sight.  <i>Yes...that MUST be the reason...</i>  \"Oh come on, lighten up, buddy.  We're just having fun is all.  Besides, these people'll be giving us those same looks when they see how fast I can work this off next month!\"  Kiba responded, patting his distended gut for emphasis, causing it to bounce slightly with each pat.  <i>So I hope...</i>  As the two carried on, a familiar voice called out to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!  Kiba!  Akamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped and immediately turned around, greeted by none other than Kiba's boneheaded pal, Naruto Uzumaki, who approached the two.  Upon reaching them, his eyebrows raised as his attention shifted right towards Kiba's rounded gut.  \"Jeez, what've you been doing these past few days?\"  Naruto asked.  Kiba grinned and said, \"Oh, y'know...just hitting up every single restaurant I can and enjoying as much free food as I can possibly eat.  Which, last I checked...\" Kiba stopped as a slightly impish grin grew over his face.  \"...was more than you and Choji.\"  Akamaru's paw immediately rose over to his face as he shook his head.  <i>Here we go, heeeere we go...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto's face steamed bright red as he angrily shouted, \"YOU GOT LUCKY AT THAT STINKIN' EATING CONTEST!!\"  Kiba laughed and said, \"Funny, didn't seem like luck when you started groaning on about having a bellyache while I was trailblazing on and on to victory, Uzumaki.\"  Stammering angrily to respond, Naruto pointed in Kiba's face furiously and finally added, \"Oh yeah?!  Well, JUST YOU WAIT, DOG-BREATH!!!  CAUSE NEXT TIME-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden audible rumbling caught both Kiba's and Akamaru's ears.  Naruto had stopped mid-sentence and mid-point as his face flushed red once more, with embarrassment, as his own thin stomach began to rumble quite audibly.  Kiba burst into laughter, causing his stomach to jiggle a bit as Naruto's face grew redder.  Wiping a tear of laughter from his face, Kiba shook his head and patted Naruto on the shoulder playfully.  \"Look, bonehead, instead of griping about how badly you're gonna lose again if we ever go head to head in another eating contest, how about we go get ourselves something to eat?\"  He then pulled out his voucher and added, \"My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry and embarrassed expression on Naruto's face lightened a bit as he glanced curiously at Kiba and said, \"Really?\"  Akamaru immediately glanced back at Kiba and added in a much less amused tone.  <i>\u2026Really?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave Naruto a wide smile and said, \"Why not?  They said all the free food I want, and if I order more than even I can handle, well, there's no harm in sharing, right?  Besides, no use being able to enjoy a free voucher if I can't enjoy it with my buds.\"  After a moment, Naruto's face lit up as he smiled back and said, \"Heh, thanks, man!\"  Kiba playfully nudged Naruto in the arm, but Akamaru was still less than enthusiastic.  Seeing this, Kiba ruffled the big dog's head and said, \"Hey, after all those steaks, pork chops, and what have you, I was feelin' like some dessert anyway.\"  <i>Kiba, I REALLY think you're overdoing it this time\u2026</i>  But before Akamaru could continue, his own furry, white stomach let out a hungry growl, causing the dog to blush beneath his fur as Kiba laughed and said, \"Guess I ain't the only one hankerin' for some after-steak dessert.  Don't worry, boy.  I already told you, even if I add a few pounds, I'll still work it off in no time!  Plus, how can I NOT use a free food for a month voucher to its' fullest use?\"  Kiba gave the dog a sly grin and said, \"Wouldn't wanna be wasteful, now would we?\"  And with that, he and Naruto headed off.  Akamaru shook his head.  <i>Why couldn't they go to an all-you-can-eat salad place\u2026?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru eventually rejoined Kiba and Naruto as they headed towards...</span></div></div>",

Grinning, he sniffed. \"Ah man...do ya smell that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgment, Akamaru sniffed the air. Immediately his tail started wagging. <i>Yeah, I smell that. Mmm, smells great...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, curious, sniffed the air. \"I don't smell anything,\" he replied, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at him oddly, then smirked. \"Ah yeah, that's right; sometimes I forget not everyone has our sense of smell.\" He shrugged. \"You'll start smelling it soon enough, though.\" Naruto grumbled something about \"stuck-up Inuzukas\" under his breath, but otherwise said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba continued leading the other two, maintaining a brisk pace in spite of his massive midsection, apparently not caring that his shirt was resting on top of it and completely exposing the orb of flesh that was his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, and Naruto was just about to start complaining when something caught his notice; curious, he sniffed the air. \"Hey, that smells really good!\" In spite of himself, he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned back. \"Heh, told ya.\" He began strolling as quickly as his gut would allow him. \"C'mon, we're almost there!\" Naruto and Akamaru, the latter groaning to himself, followed close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the three came to a large, brick building; though it looked fairly unassuming, the sheer volume of delicious scents coming out of it overwhelmed them, and their mouths began watering. In spite of this, Naruto managed to speak. \"A...a bakery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, smiling. \"Yep! I've been here a few times already; they've got really great stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, in spite of himself, chipped in. <i>Yeah, and their jelly donuts? Oh man...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog nin grinned. \"Heh, my thoughts exactly, boy.\" He walked to the door and pushed it open, gesturing for the other two to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were inside, Kiba strolled up to the counter, grinning. \"Hey, it's me again!\" The man at the desk gaped at Kiba's fully exposed, engorged stomach, but seeing as how he'd been in here several times already, wasn't all that surprised. \"Erm...yes.\" He cleared his throat. \"What would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't waste a second. \"Six dozen donuts, ten apple pies, three dozen cinnamon rolls, and five quadruple-decker marble cakes. Biggest ya got, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened, even as he scribbled all this down. \"Al-alright; anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Kiba looked towards Naruto. The blonde, who had been distracted looking at all the treats available, snapped to attention. \"H-huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes.\" Whaddaya want, dummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flushed a bit at the insult, but he quickly cheered up, remembering he could get as much as he wanted. \"I'd like five dozen sticky buns, eight dozen cupcakes, ten dozen muffins, eight blueberry pies, and four triple-decker chocolate cakes. Also, the biggest you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened even further as he scribbled it all down. \"Anything...else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned down at Akamaru. The dog whined, but figured that as long as he was here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, fine,</i> Akamaru growled. <i>Tell him I want four dozen jelly donuts, five dozen blueberry muffins, eight dozen of whatever cookies they have that don't have chocolate, and three vanilla cakes with buttercream icing.</i> Grinning, Kiba relayed this all to the man. By now, the man's mouth was opening and closing like a fish out of water, but he nonetheless continued to scribble everything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al-alright,\" the man stuttered once everything was written down. \"I-I'll have everything out as soon as possible.\" He motioned to one of the nearby tables. \"Just, uh, take a seat there.\" With that, the man went into the back to retrieve what they'd asked for, mumbling to himself. Shrugging, Kiba led Naruto and Akamaru over to the indicated table, where they promptly sat down in the rather comfortable seats (though Kiba had to sit a little further away from the table).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two humans exchanged idle chatter and banter, while Akamaru occasionally chimed in. He still wasn't sure about this, but there was no denying the stuff here was really good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, several attendants brought out their individual orders, setting the overloaded platters down on the table, which creaked but held. In the meantime, a couple more attendants set Akamaru's order down in front of the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at the sheer size of the baked goods, but Kiba and Akamaru, used to this by now, simply licked their lips and muzzle, respectively. \"Wow...that...that's a lot,\" Naruto managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Well, what didja expect?\" He picked up a donut with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. \"Well, don't just sit there; dig in!\" With that, Kiba took a massive bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, raising an eyebrow, picked up a chocolate chip muffin and took a bite. His eyes widened. \"Oh man...Kiba, these are awesome! They're warm, and moist, and...\" unable to keep going on, Naruto swallowed and took another bite. Akamaru rolled his eyes, even as he took a bite of his jelly donuts, the powdered sugar and jelly practically exploding onto his tongue. <i>Ooohhh, that's good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba continued tearing into their muffins and donuts, respectively, savoring the taste of each. <i>Mmmm,</i> Naruto thought as he gleefully polished off the muffin and grabbed a sticky bun and a handful of cookies, cramming them both into his mouth. <i>This stuff is awesome! Can't wait to see what the rest tastes like...</i> </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was interesting to watch the two eat together. Kiba stuffed his maw greedily, his belly already distended from a previous meal, while Naruto, much to Kiba's surprise, took more time while he ate (at least compared to how he usually eats). He basically took an experimental bite out of each new confection, and every time he tasted a new treat, his eyes would widen, and he would finish it a bit more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he still ate at a rather leisurely pace. The nice thing about bakeries was the fact that the food didn't have to be eaten immediately. It could be taken home later. Naruto particularly liked the sticky buns, and he had his fun with them, working his way down the spiral as he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Kiba was stuffing his greedy maw as much as he could. He was pretty full already, but he wanted to see how much more he could fit in the tank. He was able to eat quite a bit at the eating contest, and now he truly wanted to push his limits. With that in mind, and without particularly caring about being polite, he grabbed chunks of one of his cakes with his hands, frosting and all, stuffing them in his face with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Akamaru, who laid down in between them. From there, he had a perfect view of both of their stomachs. Either way, that wasn't really his main focus, as he was currently chowing down on a pile of jelly doughnuts in front of him. They were one of his weaknesses for sure. He did keep an eye on the two, however, as he was interested to see how this played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach made a relentless assault outwards, placing quite a bit of strain on his elastic shorts. In addition, his massive belly was making its way to the table, nearly touching it once he finished his cake. At this point, his stomach was taut, but he was still determined to push himself farther. Naruto, on the other hand, was starting to get full, but he was enjoying the flavors so much that he didn't want to stop. Kiba's doughnuts looked particularly tempting, and luckily, Kiba was taking a little break, belching a bit and patting his taxed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try one of your doughnuts, Kiba?\" Naruto asked, trying to be as polite as he could. \"Sure, just let me have one of your sticky buns!\" Kiba replied. Before he even finished, Naruto was trying a doughnut, loving the flavors that he was experiencing. Kiba took one of Naruto's sticky buns, eating nearly half of it in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens proceeded to eat many of the baked goods in front of them. Kiba was beginning to work on his apple pies. He removed the tin, and he grabbed the pie with both hands, holding it gingerly so it didn't fall apart. One of the specialties of this bakery was their pies, as they prided themselves on their ability to make pies that were not only delicious, but also stable. One of their selling points was that people could easily remove the pies from the tin and cut it from there, making it easier to serve and easier to clean. It also made it easier for Kiba to eat, and he took a bite out of the side of the pie. The filling was still pleasantly warm, and he moaned with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched Kiba do this before he tried the same with a blueberry pie. He grabbed the pie, took a bite. \"Owwwww!!! That's hot!\" Naruto screamed, startling everyone in the room, causing Kiba to nearly drop his pie, and causing Akamaru to stand up in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! You were supposed to make sure the pie was cooled first!\" Kiba snapped. \"How was I supposed to know! You were doing it!\" Naruto retorted defensively, fanning his tongue with his hands. \"There was steam still coming from yours, but mine didn't have any steam!\" Kiba replied. Naruto dropped it at that, and he placed his pie back in the tin, waiting for it to cool. Meanwhile, Kiba was already close to finishing his, and his stomach reached the table when he did so. Seeing that, he patted it proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru resumed eating, and much to his own surprise, he had finished all the jelly doughnuts. His stomach was now slightly distended at this point, but he couldn't resist digging into some of the snickerdoodles in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, was working on one of the chocolate cakes, while Kiba worked on some of his cinnamon rolls. Kiba was slowing down quite a bit at this point, as he had never quite eaten this much before, and his huge stomach showed. Now his waistband was slowly beginning to quiver, and so was his navel. Naruto loved the flavor of the cake, though, and he powered through it surprisingly quickly compared to how he ate before. His stomach was now beginning to distend, and with each bite, it was becoming more and more visible under his jacket. Finally, after Kiba had to stop for a little while, Naruto finished the last of the cake. At this point, his jacket was now stretching quite a bit to fit around his stomach. He was now quite full too, but not overstuffed like Kiba seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru had made a considerable dent in the snickerdoodles, and because of this, his stomach was now much more noticeably distended, and it appeared as if he was going to have puppies soon. All three sat there for a bit, belching occasionally, somewhat tired after the sugar high.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both teens leaned back in their chairs, massaging their achingly bloated bellies to coax the cramped pain away, while Akamaru merely laid on his side, allowing his own distended furry gut to hang out on the floor besides the two teens.  \"Holy cow...\" Naruto exclaimed, rubbing his bloated belly; just barely contained beneath his jacket, \"...I can't even remember the last time I ate that many sweets before...\"  Kiba burped queasily and nodded, thumping his vastly distended belly heartily as he did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I can...\"  Kiba said proudly, earning a roll of the eyes from Akamaru as he recalled Kiba's previous feeding frenzy at this bakery.  Naruto glanced at Kiba's immensely swollen stomach pressed into the table, and noticed the elastic waistband to his pants quivering noticeably, and a strange quivering from near Kiba's belly button.  \"Man, I don't think I've EVER seen you eat that much before, Kiba...\" Naruto noted.  \"Hell, I don't think your gut was even that big after winning that stinkin' contest!\"  Kiba grinned toothily and said, \"What can I say?  Today?  I felt like REALLY cuttin' loose, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged, still resting his hands atop his own stomach and added, \"Well, I'm just glad we can take this stuff with us.  It'd suck if we had to waste all these goodies.\"  Kiba nodded, and said, \"It sure would, bonehead...\" he then glanced down at all the tasty baked goods before them and added, \"Still, it'd be a shame not to at least TRY To eat as much of these as we could while they're still fresh...\"  Both Naruto and Akamaru glanced at Kiba and his massive gut, still pressing into the table.  Akamaru noticed Kiba already eying another batch of cinnamon rolls, and immediately knew what Kiba was suggesting.  <i>You can't be serious...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering this for a moment, Naruto glanced down at his distended midsection, wincing a bit.  \"I dunno, I'm feeling pretty full right now...\" he then glanced back up at the still steamy and sweet smelling goods and licked his lips.  \"Buuuuuut like you said...might as well get what we can while they're fresh, right?\"  Kiba smiled and said, \"That's more like it!\"  The two two then grabbed some more cinnamon buns and proceeded to take a big honking bite from each respectively, both taking a little longer to chew.  Akamaru sighed to himself.  <i>Eh, we're gonna be here anyway...no use just sitting around doing nothing but waiting for them to stuff their faces...</i>  And so, despite his own fullness, Akamaru started chomping down on some more jelly doughnuts at a slower pace than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more and more goods consumed, Naruto's belly had begun to grow to the point where a sliver of flesh had begun to peak from beneath his jacket as he staggered to consume more buns, still smirking to himself as he proceeded to eat one in a spiral for his own amusement, albeit a bit sluggishly as he did so.  Finally gulping down the bun, Naruto winced a bit, massaging his belly before getting to work on the next bun.  \"Ugh, so full...\"  Naruto had barely finished speaking before belching loudly and groaning in a mix of relief and discomfort.  Akamaru also whined in discomfort as he had just finished gulping down several jelly doughnuts, despite his better judgement, causing his own belly to swell out even further, to the point where the giant dog looked as if he'd swallowed a massive beach ball.  <i>Damn jelly doughnuts...how am I going to be able to talk sense into Kiba if I'm too busy stuffing as many of you into my mouth as I possible can?  Ugh...hypocrisy...thy name is Akamaru...</i>  Before Akamaru could rant on however, a sudden creaking from the table caught both his and Naruto's ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up and saw Kiba's belly was had distended to greatly that its pushing into the table had begun to cause the table to strain upward just slightly due to the sheer size of Kiba's taut gut, causing the young dog-nin to wince and groan in discomfort.  \"Oi, Kiba, you feeling okay?\" asked Naruto, still uncomfortably full himself.  The band to Kiba's shorts was quivering now more than ever, but all Naruto could see was Kiba's face as he struggled to eat another doughnut.  Seeing his friend seemingly green around the gills alarmed Akamaru as he glanced up at his pal with concern.  <i>K-Kiba?  Are you alright?!</i>  Kiba nodded weakly and said, \"Y-yeah...m-my stomach just...feels kinda...tight right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain in Kiba's voice didn't provide any comfort to Akamaru; whose fears worsened as a loud rumbling emanated from Kiba's globular gut, causing him to immediately cover his mouth with one hand as he rested the other atop his belly.  The rumbling worsened as both Naruto and Akamaru glanced at their friend with concern, expecting the worst.  But instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA APPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba let out a massive belch, which startled several around them for several disgustingly loud seconds straight, causing Kiba's gargantuan belly to shiver almost uncontrollably.  However, as it carried on, Kiba's belly button and the band to his shorts began to quiver irregularly from the sudden motion, until finally...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru yelped as the band shot toward him, and was just barely able to move his head to avoid getting it to the face. <i>Damn it! Kiba wore those shorts because they didn't have a button!</i> He whined pitifully, leaning his head back down on the floor. <i>No matter what he wears, it's not safe for anybody...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't stop there, though; his belly, freed from the restraint of his waistband, surged forward as much as it was able, putting even more pressure against the table and causing it to strain upwards more. And, no sooner had it surged forward than...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...his navel violently inverted with a loud, fleshy pop, wobbling about above the table. Seconds after that, Kiba sighed, leaning back in his chair and letting his arms hang limply at his sides. He let his head lean back, his tongue sticking out the side of his mouth. <i>Ohhhhh man...that feels sooooo much better...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, having paused in his own gorging to gape at the sight, finally spoke. \"Uh, Kiba? What the hell just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his head up, Kiba smirked, sluggishly bringing one of his arms up to massage his engorged tummy. \"What's it look like, dummy? My shorts couldn't keep up. And this?\" He took a finger and wobbled his navel. \"Well, that just means my gut's really packin' a lot in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru rolled his eyes from the floor. <i>Like it wasn't before?</i> He whined as he thought of the other effect of Kiba's gorging: specifically, his busted shorts. He sure hoped Kiba would be able to hold them up and keep his balance when he was done here, considering he was wearing <i>those</i> undies today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at Kiba's midsection, somewhere between shocked and genuinely awed. \"I'll say you are...\" He looked again at the massive size of his gut, then the vast amount of goodies still before him. \"You, uh, takin' the rest home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Kiba smirked. \"Heh, about that...\" he smacked his midsection heartily, forcing a burp free. Shaking it off, he continued. \"After that, I actually feel like I have some more room now.\" He grinned. \"Besides, I said I'd try to eat as much of this stuff as possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened. <i>Oh, come on, Kiba! You've busted your shorts, your gut's pressing against the table...don't you think it's time to call it a day?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled, reaching a hand down and ruffling Akamaru's head. \"C'mon, boy, you know I don't give up easy. Besides,\" he added, grabbing a rather large hunk of cake, \"this stuff's way too tasty to let go to waste!\" He took a massive bite, sighing with pure bliss as he swallowed and went in for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru groaned. <i>Shoulda known...</i> He craned his head to look at his jelly doughnuts. <i>Well, if he's going all out, no reason I can't either....</i> With that thought he resumed gulping down doughnut after doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched Kiba and Akamaru continue to stuff themselves. He smirked. <i>Heh...if they're still going after everything they've already eaten...</i> Licking his lips, he grabbed a few muffins and crammed them in his mouth. <i>There's no way I'm losing to you again, Inuzuka!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that in mind, he began picking up a second wind as he stuffed muffin after delicious muffin into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was also eating quite quickly, as he was picking up on the excitement of the other two, and he decided that he might as well stuff himself as much as possible, as the others were doing it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba on the other hand, despite the cocky words, wasn't quite as fast as the other two.

It wasn't going to come undone that easily. The jumpsuit was specially made for him after all. As he continued, the zipper groaned more and more loudly in protest. Naruto's belly was now beginning to squish up against him, and instead of rounding out, it was pressed up against the rest of his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's belly had all the room it needed to expand, and it definitely used it. As he ate doughnut after doughnut, his belly got closer and closer to touching the ground, a feat that he hadn't accomplished in a very long time. Either way, this didn't really matter to him at the moment, as he was too focused on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's belly, which was pressing against the table, now began to push the table slightly. The table wasn't fastened to the ground, and it only had a central base, no legs, so it was fairly easy to move. It also began to lean ever-so-slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's zipper was becoming a major concern, however, and it was starting to make him feel very uncomfortable. He could eat more, but he was a little skeptical about breaking his jacket. It was his favorite, after all.</span></div></div>",

He glanced at his ample baked goods, still calling to him, then back at his stomach.  Never one to up and take the easy way out, Naruto forced himself to shrug it off and attempted to take a big honking bite off the top of another muffin, certain that his favorite jacket was strong enough to hold, despite a creaking in the zipper to the contrary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing heartily and still enjoying the flavor, he gulped it down.  Upon doing so, he gritted his teeth in pain as his midsection's containment forced it against the rest of up his upper torso, causing an incredibly sharp pain in his stomach.  Almost immediately, he dropped the muffin and gripped his gut.  Catching the commotion, Kiba glanced curiously at the blond and, after gulping down a mouthful of muffin, asked, \"Oi, bonehead.  You okay?\"  Naruto shook his head, face visibly wincing in pain and said, \"Ngh...I got cocky, is all...shouldn't 'uh tried to push my jacket to the limit like that.\"  Kiba raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Don't you normally just bust your clothes anyway?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his sharp pain, Naruto scowled at Kiba and responded with, \"It's not like I ALWAYS try to bust everything I wear when we eat!\"  Both Akamaru and Kiba glanced at Naruto, blatantly skeptical of his remark.  Immediately, Naruto looked away sheepishly and said, \"Okaaaay...maybe I do sometimes...but ONLY sometimes!  Besides, this is my favorite jacket, I don't wanna ruin it...\"  With that, Naruto reached, trying to muster the strength to move his painfully contained torso just enough to reach for his front zipper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Naruto sucked in his gut as much as he could, and pulled the zipper to his jacket down.  Immediately, his belly pushed outward from the jacket like a dam that had just burst from pressure.  His gut had expanded so much that it was almost resting against his thighs, now showing a good amount of flesh just a little below his belly button, from the bottom of his now exposed black t-shirt.  Letting out a tremendous sigh of relief, Naruto leaned back in his chair and smiled with immense bliss on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh, MUCH better...\" he mused, patting his freer, much larger belly with relief.  Kiba smirked and said, \"Feeling better?\"  Naruto nodded and glanced back down at his muffins.  Licking his lips with a newfound hunger, he said, \"MUCH better...\" and proceeded to viciously chomp away at his muffins.  Not one to be bested, Kiba grinned and returned to his treats as well, causing his even larger belly to expand little by little while his inverted navel wobbled comically with each bounce of his moving gut.  Naturally, as it expanded, it pushed further and further into the table, causing more of it to tilt forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru had already continued to feast away on his treats, but the sudden creaking of the table caught his sensitive ears...</span></div></div>",

The table was creaking more than ever, now, and if Kiba put any more pressure on it...well, Akamaru was fairly sure the voucher didn't cover broken furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to stop Kiba from making an even bigger fool of himself, Akamaru lifted his head and barked. <i>Oi, Kiba!</i> Kiba, midway through biting into a jelly donut, looked toward the dog. \"Something wrong, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog nodded. <i>Unless ya wanna bust the table and send everything crashing to the floor, ya might wanna adjust your gut.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"Huh? What do...\" He looked down at his belly, and blushed when he noticed is was pushing the table forward. \"...whoops. Lemme do something about that.\" He scooted back a good bit, allowing the table to return to its position on the ground. His belly still contacted it, but only just. Kiba smirked. \"Heh; that oughtta do it...\" Licking his lips, Kiba looked out over his treats. \"Now let's see, where was I...\" Grabbing what was left of his doughnut, he crammed it into his mouth, then reached his arms out, grabbing whatever was in reach and bringing it up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru breathed a sigh of relief. <i>Phew, glad I nipped that in the bud...</i> He groaned suddenly; his engorged belly, now beginning to touch the floor, was beginning to hurt. <i>Ow, my tummy aches...</i> He growled, looking at his remaining confections. <i>Damn you, jelly doughnuts! Why must you be so  delicious?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba frowned sympathetically at the dog, but Naruto was heedless, cramming treat after treat into his maw, slowly causing his belly to swell and his shirt to hike up higher and higher. When Kiba caught notice of this, he growled, cramming treats into his mouth despite his aching belly. Naruto, seeing Kiba pick up the pace, did the same, shoveling as much as he could into his mouth at time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually....</span></div></div>",

It was also tight as a drum, and it was almost painful for Kiba just to touch his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I made a good dent in the food!\" Kiba said sarcastically, as he had eaten nearly two-thirds of his entire order. At this point, Akamaru had run out of the delicious jelly doughnuts, and he had also called the quits. His belly now began to press against the floor, and it was starting to spread his hind legs apart. Either way, Naruto wasn't finished eating yet, and he was focused on stuffing his face, completely oblivious to the fact that the other two had called the quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, noting this, said, \"Naruto's still going. He's such a slow eater.\" <i>To be fair, you sorta got a head start, Kiba.</i> Akamaru pointed out to Kiba. \"That's true.\" Kiba replied. Naruto was still oblivious to all this, as his shirt was lifted to the point where it didn't cover any of his bloated belly anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! He's really focused.\" Kiba mused. \"Is that what I look like when I eat a lot?\" Akamaru merely nodded in response, as he was watching Naruto, amused.

Is it just me, or did Naruto swallow an inflated medicine ball...?</i>  Kiba glanced down at his pal curiously, then to Naruto.  \"Huh?  Whadduya mean by th-?\"  Despite his fullness, Kiba glared with a hint of astonishment at the sight of Naruto's massive belly.  Despite it appearing to be infinitely tighter than Kiba's due to not softening the way his had, it appeared to be nearly the same size as Kiba's own immense stomach.  It had grown so massive in the time Naruto spent wolfing down his pastries and baked goods that he also had to push his seat back to prevent his belly from pressing against the table the way Kiba's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, guess Uzumaki was serious about not wanting to lose another eating contest ever again,\" Kiba said to Akamaru, chuckling to himself as he continued to massage his large gut gingerly.  <i>I'm surprised his belly button didn't pop out the way yours did, especially considering how much tighter a fit it looks to be still...</i>  Kiba laughed, still wiggling his own inverted navel a big before shrugging and adding, \"Eh, then again, he DID take it a lot slower than I did for a good while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Naruto leaned back against his chair, and rested both hands atop his massive belly, his face still green from fullness as Kiba laughed weakly and said, \"Damn, bonehead...didn't think you'd be able to pack away so much so fast.  Hate to admit it, but I'm actually kinda impressed!\"  Naruto worked up a weak smirk of appreciation, but as soon as he opened his mouth to thank Kiba, a massive belch blasted from the bloated teens mouth.  He grinned sheepishly and blushed with embarrassment as Kiba chuckled with amusement, then let out a burp of his own, causing both teens in all their fullness to stop for a moment, then burst into a little fit of laughter, which ended shortly with both young men groaning and tending once more to their inflated midsections.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...y'know?  It's strange though.  You haven't been practicing since you lost, yet you managed to eat more now than you did when I whooped your ass in that contest.  Why is that?\"  Kiba asked, causing Akamaru to roll his eyes.  Naruto; too full to scowl, merely shrugged and said, \"I dunno.  I was havin' more fun here just kicking back and chomping down than I was competing, and I guess when you're actually enjoying yourself, you got a lil more drive pushing you.\"  Kiba glanced at Naruto curiously then said, \"You don't enjoy yourself at the eating contests?\"  Naruto shook his head and added, \"No, I do, but I enjoy kicking back and stuffing my face with my buddies more.\"  Kiba smirks then rubs the back of his head.  \"Heh, yeah, guess I enjoy eating with a bud more too.\"  Akamaru smirked to himself.  <i>Oiy...leave it to these two to let eating enough food to feed two whole families to turn 'em all sappy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, a sharp discomfort from Akamaru's own globular belly reminded him of something else.  <i>Oof...say, Kiba?

Normally, he would use Akamaru for help, but because Akamaru had eaten so much, even he wasn't able to maintain balance, as he was barely able to stand on all four paws. \"Let's just hang out here for a while. It'll be hard to get home like this!\" Kiba said, patting his belly for emphasis. \"Good point.\" Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two proceeded with idle conversation. Akamaru would occasionally chime in, but Naruto couldn't understand him, so it was a bit awkward, and it always ended with Naruto getting flustered, and Kiba and Akamaru sharing a laugh. It wasn't long, however, before Naruto's eyelids were getting heavy. He yawned, with Kiba and Akamaru following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, all three were passed out, with Naruto and Kiba sprawled haphazardly over their seats. Akamaru, without much choice, stayed in somewhat of a standing position, and he rested on his belly. The owner of the store saw them there, shrugged, and got containers for their extra food while he cleaned up empty pie tins and other food wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, Akamaru was the first to wake up. <i>They look so peaceful when they're sleeping.</i> Akamaru mused to himself as he realized that he had shifted in his sleep, and now he was laying on his side, his somewhat smaller belly flopped out to the side. Naruto was next, with Kiba soon afterwards. Both of the teens bellies had reduced in size, with Kiba's navel having returned to its normal concave position. Their bellies were now small enough to allow their shirts to rest just above their respective belly buttons. \"What do ya wanna do now Kiba?\" Naruto asked.

The dog-nin couldn't help it; he burst out laughing. Even Akamaru wagged his tail a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it actually took you that long to get it?\" Kiba managed between snickers. At Naruto's continued scowl, Kiba rolled his eyes. \"Ah, c'mon, don't be like that.\" Still snickering, he scooted back from the table. \"C'mon, let's get outta here.\" He stood up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for his shorts, the waistband of which had completely busted, to fall down to his ankles. Kiba's face did its best overripe tomato impression, Akamaru gaped and whined, and Naruto....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAHAHAHA!\" Naruto laughed, clutching his middle. \"W-who's the idiot now, huh?\" Even as Kiba glowered at him, the blonde took a closer look at him. \"Heh; nice undies, Inuzuka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face, impossibly, reddened even further as he looked down at said garment: specifically, a pair of green boxer-briefs with a fire hydrant pattern on full display. \"Sh-shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, mortified, whined, covering his eyes with his ears. <i>Oh great...and to think Kiba wore those shorts to PREVENT embarrassing crap like this form happening...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba continued to scowl and redden as Naruto continued to laugh at him. \"Yeah, haha,\" Kiba muttered, too embarrassed to do anything more. Grumbling, he bent down and pulled his shorts up, making sure to hold onto them tightly. \"C'mon, let's get outta here.\" Still grumbling, he quickly walked towards the exit, Akamaru following close behind. Naruto, watching them, rolled his eyes. \"Man...guy cna't take a joke.\" Snickering a bit, he sucked in his gut as much as he could and re-buttoned his pants; it was a rather tight fit, but he managed. With that taken care of, he got out of his seat and followed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the three go, the shop's owner called, \"Hey, wait! What about your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just deliver it to my place,\" Kiba muttered, his face not quite as red as it had been. Before the shopkeep could answer, the three were out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked in silence for a bit, Kiba's face gradually losing its red color as Akamaru walked beside him. Unsurprisingly, it was Naruto who broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys?\" Naruto spoke up, wincing as his pants cut into his middle. \"I, uh, gotta stop by my place to change. I'll be over as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Kiba muttered, still a little mad at Naruto for his outburst. Naruto raised an eyebrow, but nonetheless grinned and gave a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll see you guys in a little bit!\" Waving, Naruto quickly left their side, making a beeline for his apartment. Kiba, watching him go, rolled his eyes. \"Idiot...\" he muttered. Akamaru whimpered, and Kiba managed to smile and pat him on the head (making sure his unoccupied hand was holding his shorts up, of course). \"Ah, it's OK, buddy; it's just a mood, it'll pass.\" Akamaru whined again, but he licked Kiba's hand, more or less placated for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kiba and Akamaru reached their house. Getting out his keys and unlocking the door, the dog-nin made his way inside, heading straight for his bedroom to change, Akamaru following dutifully behind. Kiba peeled his gray t-shirt off and shucked his broken shorts, rooting through his things until he found a couple of garments that were to his liking: specifically, a red tank top with a paw print on it and a pair of tan khaki shorts. Grinning, he slipped the clothes on; owing to his still slightly-stuffed belly, his tank top still rode slightly above his navel, and his khakis had to be unbuttoned and unzipped, but otherwise, they fit well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Alright, all set!\" He smiled, plopping down onto his bed. Akamaru, already sensing what Kiba was planning, hopped up behind him, curling his body and allowing Kiba to recline against him. \"Now, while the dummy does whatever he has to do and what's left digests...\" he smacked his belly for emphasis. \"...I think a nap's in order.\" He yawned. \"Oi, Akamaru; if someone comes by, wake me, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the order, Akamaru wasn't offended; he was well used to getting up before Kiba, anyway. With an affirmative nod, he laid his head on the bed, shutting his eyes. Smiling, Kiba yawned again and closed his eyes as well. Soon, both boy and dog, were sound asleep, sleeping off what was left of their massive meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tired, Kiba nonetheless smiled at the big dog's greeting and ruffled his fuzzy head.  \"Hehe, good morning to you too, boy...err...good whatever time it is...\"  Stretching his arms up, Kiba yawned heartily and smacked his lips, resting his hands atop his stomach, which had digested an amble amount of his massive meals, and shrunken down immensely to where his shirt once again covered all of his stomach, which was now only bulging a bit more than it had when the days escapades had begun beneath his red tank top. \"Ahhh, that was JUST what I needed,\" Kiba exclaimed, patting his stomach happily as he jumped out of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the living room with Akamaru, his smile dropped as he scratched his head curiously.  \"Wait, Dummy isn't here yet?\"  Akamaru whined and shook his head.  Kiba rolled his eyes and scoffed, \"Jeez, what the hell's takin' that idiot so long?  Hmph, knowin' him, he probably forgot his keys again and now he's trying to find another way that doesn't involve breaking and entering in his own place...\"  Akamaru glanced up at the dog-nin and whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're not still mad at Naruto, are you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shook his head.  \"Nah, I'm over it, boy,\" he then rubbed the back of his head and smirked sheepishly, \"aaaaaaand, I guess I DID kinda have it coming, after that crack I made about his bone-headedness.  Only makes sense that he'd jump at whatever opportunity he could to laugh right back at me, right?\"  Akamaru barked happily and licked Kiba's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To be fair, he DOES make it pretty easy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and ruffled Akamaru's head playfully.  \"Haha, he sure does, he suuuure does.  Still, brain dead moron or not, he's a good guy, I guess, so-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than he said that, had an obnoxious knocking at the door caught the boy and dogs' attention.  Kiba opened the door and in stepped Naruto, dressed in different, less snug and constricting attire, and; like Kiba and Akamaru, his stomach seemed to have digested nearly all of his massive meal, but unlike Kiba's, had shrunken down to his near completely flat and normal state.  \"About time.  Man, what the hell took ya so long?\" asked Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Well...\"  Kiba facepalmed.  \"You lost your keys again, didn't you...\"  Naruto scowled and said, \"N-no!  W-well, yeah, but I forgot to lock the front door, so-nevermind!  Look, I know I was being kind of obnoxious back at the restaurant...\" he started snickering slightly to himself, \"...I still can't believe you actually wear those things-errr, but anyway, I thought you might still be pissed, soooo, yeah, sorry, I guess.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and nudged the young blond in the arm, \"Ahhh, whatever, bone-head.  Come on, make yourself at home.\"  Smiling, Naruto opened his mouth to thank Kiba, when suddenly, a loud growl emanated from the teens stomach.  Kiba was about to comment when an even louder rumbling emanated from his own stomach.  Akamaru glanced at Kiba and nearly gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Oh, you've gotta be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning sheepishly, Kiba gave the dog a wide smiled grin and said, \"What can I say?  All that reconcilin' makes a guy hungry.\"  And before Akamaru could protest, his own fuzzy tummy began to rumble as well, causing him to blush beneath his white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're not helping...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba ruffled the dogs head and turned to Naruto.  \"So, what do you guys feel like eating?\"</span></div></div>",

We can totally do ramen.\" He rubbed his stomach. \"Besides, after a few weeks of meat, ice cream, and baked goods, I could go for something a little different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Naruto exclaimed, his eyes gleaming. \"Thanks, Kiba! You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled. \"Heh; you're just realizing that now?\" Akamaru barked and wagged his tail while Naruto sputtered and glared a bit at the dog-nin. Ignoring this, Kiba made his way over to the phone, spinning its wheel and dialing Ichiraku's number (he'd actually ordered from them a couple of times with the voucher, contrary to what he'd said). Holding the phone up to his ear, he waited as it rang a couple times, grinning when someone picked up. \"Hey, it's me again.\" He looked over at Naruto. \"Yeah, we'll take eighty extra-large bowls of ramen, as many toppings as you can cram in...\" he chuckled as he heard the speaker-probably Teuchi-sputter over the phone, and Naruto going slack-jawed and eyes widening in a mixture of shock and pure joy. \"Yeah, I'm gettin' 'em for me and a buddy...\" The speaker asked something, and Kiba smirked. \"Yeah, it's Naruto; I figure we'll each do forty bowls each...\" He thought for a moment. \"...actually, tack on an extra forty bowls for Akamaru, extra meat.\" The dog's eyes bugged out. <i>Kiba...</i> he whined pleadingly. Kiba only looked guilty for about a second or two before he winked and continued speaking. \"It'll take a while? That's OK, we ain't going anywhere. And yeah, I'm using the voucher.\" The voice on the other end of the line said a few more words, and Kiba grinned. \"Great! See ya in a bit!\" Slamming down the phone, he turned to Naruto and Akamaru, the former of whom had a huge grin on his face. \"Well, Uzumaki, I hope you're hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer, Naruto's nearly-flat stomach-hidden beneath an orange tank top with Konoha's symbol on the front-growled. The blonde only grinned, rubbing it a bit. \"Heh, you bet I am!\" He yanked the waistband of his camo-patterned trousers. \"Not to mention, I didn't get a chance to bust my pants at the bakery; figure this is as good a place as any to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"Feels great, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, sinking to the floor and covering his eyes with his paws. <i>The only bad part about them getting along? They're so much alike, they make each other worse...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ramen was still a good while away, Naruto and Kiba plopped down on the couch next to each other and decided to pass the time by making idle conversation, discussing past missions, their friends, their past eating escapades... honestly, they were just trying to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, the doorbell rang. Grinning, Kiba leapt out of his seat, Naruto following closely behind. \"Awesome, they're here!\" As they rushed to the door, Kiba took a deep sniff. \"Aaah....

A comically large box was strapped to his back. It looked like it could hold a refrigerator. Either way, Kiba helped him get the box off, with Naruto following suit. The box was insulated, and it wasn't even warm to the touch. Either way, Kiba and Naruto lugged the box into the house, gently placing it on the floor in front of the couch. Since he had quite a bit of money because he hadn't been spending it on food, Kiba gave the delivery boy a hefty tip, with the latter grinning from ear to ear at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box in question had a large seam on top. Kiba, knowing what to do, unlocked two flaps on the top of the box, then opened up all four flaps, revealing the broth-laden  goodness inside. The bowls of ramen were about the size of Kiba's head. They were made of Styrofoam, and the flavor of the ramen inside was displayed on the side. Each bowl had a seal on top, much like pre-made ramen, except it was sealed fresh instead of dried. On top of the seal was logo for Ichiraku's on top, and Teuchi's signature on the bottom. Since Kiba didn't specify a flavor, Teuchi just made plenty of each flavor for the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kiba and Naruto immediately picked their flavors, Naruto picking miso pork, and Kiba picking beef, Akamaru laid down in front of them, waiting for Kiba to put down a bowl. Afterwards they plopped down on the couch, and they ate at a moderate pace (for them, at least), moaning a bit from the Ichiraku's flavor. Akamaru then said to Kiba <i>I'm not really that hungry, Kiba. You didn't have to get me so many bowls. Once I'm finished, you and Naruto can have the rest of mine.</i> \"Are you sure buddy?\" Kiba asked. <i>I just wanna watch what I eat.</i> Akamaru replied, trying to get a subtle hint across. Kiba was oblivious, however, and he merely said, \"Suit yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two reached their second bowls, Akamaru lagging behind somewhat, Naruto said, \"It's pretty awesome that Ichiraku's delivers now! How'd you find out, Kiba?\" \"Ayame told me when I passed by her in the village.\" Kiba wasn't really lying. That was how he found out. He just found out much sooner than Naruto thinks. Either way, the two stuffed themselves while continuing their idle conversation.</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, having just finished his fourth bowl, sighed with some relief and stopped eating for a moment as he glanced at the several other bowls left for him by Kiba.  <i>Okay, I think that should do it for m-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping mid-sentence, a thought had occurred to Akamaru.  <i>Wait a minute...if I stop this early on, then that means Kiba'll have nearly another forty bowls to stuff down his throat...</i>  He then glanced at Kiba's slightly bloated stomach then whined to himself, still concerned that this little venture was going to leave his dog-nin pal a bit rounder than he'd like to be.  <i>No matter what, those two are gonna keep eating their ramen til they look like they're pregnant with boulder babies...but if I leave Kiba all this ramen...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping down the last noodle to his latest bowl, Kiba smacked his lips and smiled, before looking down and noticing Akamaru looked to be in deep thought.  Placing his empty bowl down next to the few others he'd slurped down thus far, Kiba turned to Akamaru and asked, \"Oi, Akamaru.  You okay, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping him out of his train of thought, Akamaru turned to the dog-nin and nodded.  Kiba then glanced at Akamaru's bowls.  \"Just noticed you weren't eatin' is all, and kinda figured maybe you were full already,\" Kiba noted, licking his lips slightly at the sight of all the bowls left to gulp down.  Catching on, Akamaru gulped to himself.  <i>Well, a-actually, now that you mention it, I, errr, think I'm starting to get a little hungrier.  So I'm thinking I might tackle a few more bowls.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba ruffled the big dog's fuzzy head and said, \"That's the spirit, boy!\" then proceeded to turn to his next bowl and stuff more noodles and toppings into his mouth.  Akamaru simply glanced down at his next bowl and sighed to himself, unbeknownst to Kiba who was still too busy working on his noodles with Naruto and occasionally talking idly with the blond.  <i>Great, now I'M gonna end up looking like I'm pregnant with the boulder pups...but it's better I stuff my gut with as much of my ramen as I can, then let Kiba try and eat all of his bowls AND mine...cause knowing him, he'll actually pull it off, and probably make himself really sick...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to slurp away at his next bowl of noodles at a bit of a faster rate, eventually gulping it down with gusto as he moved onto his next bowl.  <i>Mmmm, well, if I'm gonna force myself to stuff my face, at least I'm stuffing it with this stuff...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Akamaru had caught up with Naruto and Kiba, causing a slightly bump in the big dog's tummy.

Scowling at the insult, Naruto nonetheless did the same with his broth, picking up another bowl once he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's tail wagged as he continued gulping down the noodles, meat, veggies, and broth, in spite of himself. <i>Can't argue with that; this stuff tastes like its been fresh-made!</i> He continued gulping away, all the while conscious of the small bump in his tummy, which he could feel getting heavier, bit by bit, as he tucked into the bowls. <i>Gah, I can't stop eating this stuff; by the time we're done, I'm gonna need a hell of a tummy rub...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, each of their bowls began to stack up as they went through each one, savoring the tastes. Slowly, the bumps that had formed in their tummies began growing heavier and bigger as the noodles were slurped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, each of them had polished off about ten of the large bowls each, and they all had to take a breather. Setting their empty bowls aside, Naruto and Kiba reclined on the couch, the former with one arm laid across the top of the couch, and the latter with both arms up on the back of the couch. Akamaru, taking the cue, laid on his side on the floor. <i>Oh man...those bowls are so big; they really start to add up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed they did; Naruto's stomach, which he was rubbing with his other hand, had bulged rather noticeably, rounding out and pushing against his shirt, though it still remained underneath the orange fabric. Kiba's stomach was in much the same state, though considering it had been slightly rounded even before they'd ordered, it was a tad bit bigger, the red tank top rising up a bit to expose a tiny sliver of flesh. And as for Akamaru, the bump in his tummy had grown into a small sphere; nothing that would impede movement, but still far more noticeable than the ninken would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, they all relaxed for a few minutes, letting the already-considerable amount of food they'd downed to settle in preparation for the other bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they had all rested to their satisfaction, and decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And so, he whimpered to himself.  <i>...S-silly me...on second thought, I think I WILL enjoy myself some delicious muffins and a cookie or two...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kiba placed Akamaru's leftovers from the bakery down before the big dog and ruffled his head playfully.  \"Bon appetit, buddy!\" he exclaimed before sinking his teeth into one of his doughnuts.  Naruto glanced up curiously and said, \"Bone apple-what...?\"  Both Kiba and Akamaru stopped for a moment and glanced at each other for a moment, before shaking their heads and resuming their meal.  <i>Jeez, he gives a whole new meaning to Bone-head sometimes...</i>  Kiba laughed and said, \"He sure does, boy...\"  Naruto scowled and pointed a half eaten cupcake at the two, and barked \"Hey!  Is he talking about me again?\"  Kiba simply laughed and said, \"Ah, just eat your damn cupcakes, Bone-head,\" before stuffing several more doughnuts into his mouth ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling a bit, Naruto nonetheless complied, taking a huge bite from a chocolate cupcake, frosting and all, and almost immediately, his face lit up.  \"Mmm!  Don't think I tried any of these kinds yet,\" Naruto exclaimed before stuffing the rest into his mouth, causing his cheeks to bulge out comically as he chomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru on the other hand, was a little less motivated than the other two to stuff his maw.  <i>You're doing this for Kiba, you're doing this for Kiba...</i> Akamaru thought to himself before he begrudgingly took a big bite from one of the muffins laid before him.  Sure enough, he took another, and another, before he knew it, he was chomping away at his pastries around the same speed as Naruto and Kiba, plowing through muffin after muffin, even stopping to occasionally relish the flavors.  Blueberry, cranberry, cinnamon, raisin; it was as if he was sampling the entire menu all at once.  All the while, his already occupied tummy continued to swell larger and larger with every few muffins consumed.  Occasionally, he would glance up and see both Naruto and Kiba's stomachs had also continued to expand alongside his.  Seemed futile to try and keep his dog-nin buddy from overeating his fill, but Akamaru nonetheless assumed that no matter how large Kiba's stomach would end up getting, it at least wouldn't be as bad as it could have been had Akamaru not eaten his share as well.  And so, for his pal's well being, no matter how full he was feeling, he trail-blazed on, and in some instances further, than the two teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed.  Several muffins later, Akamaru belched loudly and plopped on his side, tongue sticking out as he glanced forward.  What was once a stack of a few dozen muffins, had been reduced to little else than crumbs and muffin wrappers.  Akamaru then glanced down at his tummy, which had grown large enough to look as though the dog had swallowed a large watermelon whole.  <i>Ugh, I swear, if ever in the world a dog needed a tummy rub...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought process was interrupted when he heard an even louder belch coming from above him.  He looked up to see Kiba leaning back against his chair, patting his bloated belly proudly.  The young dog-nin had consumed his entire two and a half dozen doughnut leftovers, the result of which left his belly swollen by a good few inches, and caused that sliver of flesh at the bottom his shirt to rise up further, just below his navel. \"Ahhh, good thinking with the baked goodies, Uzumaki!\" Kiba exclaimed, still massaging his bloated midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped slightly and grinned back at Kiba.  His own stomach had grown to the point where his shirt had now risen up to expose just a sliver of flesh at the bottom like Kiba's once had.  \"Not such a bone-head afterall, am I?\" Naruto exclaimed.  Kiba glanced down at Akamaru and smugly said, \"Heh, nope.  Just MOST the time...\"  Despite feeling immensely full, Akamaru couldn't help but snicker at this, even more so when he saw Naruto grumbling angrily.  Kiba then looked down at Akamaru and asked, \"How you holding up, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog whimpered a bit as he glanced up at Kiba sympathetically.  Catching on, Kiba grinned and immediately began scratching the big dog's bigger tummy, causing Akamaru's tail to wag as his hind leg kicked slightly.  Seeing the sight, Naruto couldn't help but smirk himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a while of that...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, taking the cue, drew several bowls closer to him, ripped the tops open with his teeth, and began slurping them up. <i>Remember, you're doing this for Kiba,</i> Akamaru told himself, even as his tail wagged as he slurped away. <i>Ooh, that's really tasty...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, oblivious to the dog's inner musings, slurped up mouthful after mouthful of noodles and toppings, only chewing as much as they needed to before swallowing and diving right back in. Before long, they'd finished their current bowls, only to grab another one and start to work on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, to his not inconsiderable distress, was in roughly the same place, having finished his current bowl. Groaning inwardly, he drew another bowl close to him and opened it, digging into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the teens had finished their second bowls and had already started on their third bowls. Then their fourth. Then their fifth, sixth, seventh....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys and dog plowed through their bowls, the humans' stacking up beside them and the dog's becoming scattered around him, their stomachs slowly but surely continued to expand as more noodles filled their bellies. The humans' tank tops both slid upwards very slowly as their stomachs grew rounder and heavier, and Akamaru could feel the fullness in his gut increase as the watermelon-sized sphere it had become. He whined, but continued on; as big as Kiba's stomach was likely to get, it would get even bigger if Akamaru didn't eat his share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by; up and up the boys' shirts slid, and bigger and bigger their and Akamaru's tummies became. Soon, both boys had a couple stacks around them, and they had the stomachs to show for it; Kiba's shirt was now above his navel, and Naruto's  was just underneath his own belly-button; it would likely see the light of day rather soon. Akamaru whined as he looked at his own midsection and saw that it, too, was becoming bigger,  rounder and heavier. In spite of this, he pressed on, determined not to let Kiba overstuff himself any more than he usually would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed. Kiba's stomach was now pushing out even more, and his shirt was a good several inches above his navel, starting to scrunch up the paw-print design in the process. Naruto's stomach, though it was slightly less so, had caused his tank top to ride up enough to expose his belly button; in addition, the bottom of the shirt had begun to crinkle, slightly distorting the Konoha symbol on it. Akamaru's furry tummy had now grown even bigger, and he could actually feel it starting to hang down. Ears drooping, he stopped slurping up his current bowl and gave it a defeated look. <i>Oh man...I'm gonna look like I'm carrying puppies by the time we're done...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, both boys were starting to feel a rather distinct tightness in their waistlines, as their ever-growing middles continued to intrude against their pants. Naruto and Kiba both winced, but, not wanting to show the other weakness, soldiered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't very successful, however, and his attempts to undo it caught Naruto's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kiba's surprise, Naruto walked up to him and pushed on his belly. \"What are you doing? This hurts you moron!\" Kiba blurted out in surprise. Naruto was a bit annoyed by that remark, but nevertheless, he said, \"Now that your belly's pressed in, it's easier to unbutton your shorts! Didja think about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then felt bad for yelling at Naruto, and mumbled \"Thanks\" as he undid his button with relative ease. Naruto then let go, and his belly flopped out, forcing the zipper down a bit. Kiba sighed a sigh of relief, and patted his belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like you might need to unbutton, too, Naruto\" Kiba began, \"Want me to help you like you helped me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then replied, with his trademark smile, \"...\"</span></div></div>",

Catching this, Naruto glanced down at Kiba curiously and asked, \"What's up, dog-breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of his head, Kiba exhaled and said, \"Uhhh, it just dawned on me that in order for me to push your gut in for you to unbutton your pants, I gotta actually touch your stomach...\"  Naruto raised an eyebrow and added a sarcastic, \"You mean in order to push my stomach in, you gotta actually touch my stomach?

Taking his palm off the other teens stomach, Kiba glances back at his friend with a brow cautiously raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, bonehead...y-you feelin' okay?  You're not gonna puke or anything, are you...?\"  Kiba asked slightly nervously, afraid he might have pushed down the wrong way.  And doubly afraid that his friend was about to make a mess, which, needless to say, would kind of kill the momentum...as well as Kiba's appetite.  These concerns were doubly raised when Naruto lurched forward, one palm covering his mouth as his cheeks swelled up.  Wincing again, Kiba eased back and looked away, not wanting to see what came next...and moving out of the 'line of fire,' as it were...DEFINITELY not wanting to be in the way of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what <i>had</i> come out of Naruto's mouth, was not what anyone expected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!!!!!*</b></i>&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n...For out from Naruto's mouth, expelled a long, deep, MIGHTY burp, one which blasted throughout Kiba's home, and made the blonde's rounded stomach physically jostle from its' sheer force.  Kiba physically flinched from its' sheer volume and glanced back at Naruto with an expression that was a blend between surprised, annoyed, and bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, meanwhile, watched the eructation expelling from Naruto's gaping mouth with a rather deadpanned expression on his face and blinked dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Huh.  And I thought Kiba occasionally sounded like a foghorn exploding...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when it came to an end, Naruto sighed with immense relief and leaned back in his chair, letting out a much smaller burp then giving his belly a few proud pats of sweet relief.  \"Phew, man, that felt GOOD,\" cooed Naruto with a smile of utter relief and contentment plastered on his happy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, on the other hand, eventually sat up and said, \"Jeez, man, what the hell was THAT??  Ever heard'uh covering your mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply snorted and said, \"Oh, don't even gimme that.  You burp all the damn time, Inuzuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru glanced back at Kiba and smirked despite himself.  <i>It's true, Kiba.  You're hardly the model example of good table manners...especially these days...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grumbled a bit when he heard his two friends go on, but responded with, \"Yeah, maybe so, but not when I'm RIGHT NEXT TO SOMEONE, dummy!  What, you tryin' to deafen me or somethin'?  That the thanks I get for treatin' us to all the free grub or what?\" complained Kiba as he rang out his ears, earning another snicker from Naruto who shrugged and said, \"Hey, it's not I could help it or anything.  YOU'RE the one who offered to help unbutton my pants, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kiba raised a finger and opened his mouth to reply, but stopped for a moment and grumbled to himself, before adding, \"Alright, fine, ya got me there.  But a little warning wouldn't hurt.  Least that way, I don't have a freakin' heart attack tryin' to help you unbutton your damn pants of all things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Naruto just shook his head and said, \"Man, it wasn't like I felt it coming.  It just sneaked up on me, that crap happens sometimes, especially when someone's pushing down on your stomach.  What can ya do?  But fine, whatever, next time I feel a big one coming, I'll give you a lil friendly two weeks notice or whatever, sound good?  Yeah?  Awesome.  Now, can ya please help me unbutton my pants now?  I mean, Ramen ain't gonna eat itself, y'know...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite an annoyed grumble, Kiba nonetheless nodded then once again got to work trying to unbutton the blonde ninjas pants to give him the extra room needed to pack away more ramen.  However, as he fumbled around with the waistband, he found himself unable to get a solid grip on the button.  Naruto's stomach, surprisingly, was bloated enough to the point where it was pressing too far down against his waistband, keeping his button pinned by his rounded gut of all things, making unbuttoning seemingly impossible for Kiba, who gave up after an annoyed little struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rgh, dammit,\" complained Kiba, \"your stomach's still pressing against your pants button.  I can't get it loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself and the situation he found himself in against his better judgement, Akamaru snickered to himself.  <i>One of the benefits of being a dog...no clothing to get in the way of a hefty meal...even if I'm only doing this to keep Kiba from eating EVERYTHING...I'll...stop talking to myself now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto rubbed the back of his head as he thought, then chuckled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, well, eating tons of ramen DOES build up a bit'uh pressure, as you probably noticed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked dully yet again and said, \"...You don't say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Naruto nonetheless went on, \"My point is that there's probably a lotta pressure still stuck in my gut right now.  Usually, I let loose every so often so it doesn't build up, but today, we were on a roll.  And, well, you DID help work up that monster just now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing in confusion, Kiba eventually pieced together what Naruto was saying and did a double take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?  I'm not helping you do that!  You ain't a freakin' baby, Uzumaki!  If you gotta burp, do it yourself!  Ya don't need me gropin' your belly to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Naruto insisted, \"you helped work up way more pressure.  And the sooner my button's undone, the sooner we can stop talkin' and get back to chowing down.  Now, c'mon, whadduya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought for a moment to himself, annoyed by the whole situation, and confused by Akamaru seemingly mumbling quietly to himself.  Then, he turned back to Naruto, and after some thinking, decided on what to do next...</span></div></div>",

The two were closer than they'd ever been, and spent much of their time with one another, whether it was training (just because they'd been turned back into kids was no reason to neglect fitness, after all), playing, or even playing a prank or two on their unsuspecting friends (the one with Neji, the maple syrup, and pillow feathers had been particularly classic.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny time not spent with the blonde was spent with Akamaru (who usually joined the two, anyway), who was more than happy to accommodate the little dog nin. After all, they'd been best pals practically their entire lives, and since they'd been forbidden to go on missions until a cure could be developed, they spent practically every waking moment together (and quite a few sleepy moments too), whether it was Akamaru giving Kiba a ride at breakneck speed though the treetops, the little Inuzuka hollering in glee, the two playing chase throughout the streets of Konoha, or the big dog simply pinning the boy under him without warning and assailing him with a relentless series of licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, it had taken Kiba a while to really see the perks of his current situation, what with not being able to go on missions and having a more volatile emotional state (the jutsu that had transformed him and Naruto had also, to a lesser extent, regressed their minds; they still retained all their memories, but their mental states were otherwise how they had been the last time they were this age); it had taken a huge feast alongside Naruto that had left the boys (and Akamaru) utterly stuffed and fit to burst, but which they had found they had genuinely enjoyed. And, as they had laid down and slept off their massive meal, he had been struck by how...carefree he felt, and how happy he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the feast, Kiba thought as his hand wandered to his stomach, he had eaten an awful lot, but that had been in competition, if a very playful and friendly one,with Naruto at the time, increasing his determination to push himself to his limit. <i>Considering I'm this size right now, who knows how much I can pack away on my own?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his stomach rumbled. Akamaru, hearing this, looked over at him, tail wagging. <i>Someone a little hungry?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"How didja guess, buddy?\" With a \"hup!\", he hopped to his feet, stretching and smiling as he felt the sun's rays peek through the trees. Akamaru, taking his cue, got to his feet. <i>So, any idea what you wanna do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought for a moment. \"Well, I don't really feel like going home right now...\" he smiled as he patted a bulge in his back pocket. \"...but I have a lotta money saved up; let's go out to eat!\" Licking his lips, Kiba ran off, Akamaru barking happily and following close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, though, Akamaru felt a twinge of worry. <i>Why do I get the feeling he's gonna be using more than a little bit of that money?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog shook it off; it was probably nothing, and besides, Kiba was a kid right now; he needed a lot of nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued running, eventually reaching the village proper.

Either way, he saw that they had tons and tons of flavors, too many for him to bother to count anymore, and that made him really excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was a little concerned at this point, and he said <i>I don't think it's a good idea to eat too much ice cream.</i> Kiba, in his usual manner, even as a little kid, brushed it off, saying, \"Don't worry Akamaru. It's not like I stuff myslef all the time. (At that, Akamaru did the dog equivalent of a face-palm) Besides, if Tsunade finds the cure, then I won't be like this forever, stuck in the village.

Taking it in, he smiled and said, \"Mmmm, smell that, boy?  That's Ichiraku's if I ever smelt it!\"  He then turned to Akamaru, ruffled his fuzzy head and said, \"Hehe, y'know what?  I'm startin' to think all those ramen eating contests with the Bone-head are rubbin' off on me, cause I suddenly got a huge hankerin' for some ramen.  Whadduya say?\"  Akamaru barked happily, but in his mind, another thought occurred to him.  <i>As long as it's just SOME ramen\u2026and not\u2026all of it\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the young dog-nin hurried towards the source of the scent, reaching the novel Ichiraku's Ramen shack and hopped on top of a stool, only to then be promptly greeted by the smiling face of Teuchi, who looked around with slight surprise and said, \"Oh, our favorite little customer isn't with you two today?\"  Kiba shrugged and said with a smirk, \"Nope, just us today.  Buuuut we outta be able to give you some good business.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stopped for a moment, then disregarded that remark as Kiba then thought for just another moment, and said, \"But speaking of the Bone-head, could I get ten bowls of Miso Ramen with extra char siu?\"  He then looked at Akamaru and asked, \"What about you, boy?\"  Akamaru barked happily.  <i>The same's good enough for me.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and gave Teuchi another order for Kiba as well.  The old man nodded and went back to whip up Kiba and Akamaru's orders.  Internally, Akamaru was relieved.  Ten bowls may seem much, but considering just how much Kiba was capable of putting away, especially in this current state of being, this was as close a victory as Akamaru could have hoped for.  Both Kiba and Akamaru continued their idle chatter, reflecting on how things had been going for them and Naruto these past few weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy and dog reflected on some of their more humorous happenings, such as Namely how rough things may have started out, and how there had been moments where the two boys' regressed minds had caused some more heated emotional mishaps here or there, but luckily the pair were able to pull through their hardships each time.  Sure that tended to lead to the two eating more than any person has any reason to ever eat, but for Akamaru, it was worth it to see his little pal happy and watching his friendship with Naruto strengthen\u2026even if that meant more eating contests\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Teuchi returned with ten steamy bowls of ramen for Kiba, and ten for Akamaru.  Licking his lips eagerly, Kiba placed Akamaru's bowls down for the big dog to work on while he wasted no time scarfing down his first bowl.  The warm broth and noodle combo was a burst of zesty flavor as Kiba smiled and continued to scarf away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, the boy had downed his first bowl with gusto, then promptly jumped to his next bowl, munching and slurping away  like he hadn't eaten in days.  Licking his own bowl clean, Akamaru looked up to see the sight of Kiba pigging out on his bowl of ramen and chuckled to himself.  Manners were never one of Kiba's stronger traits; which Akamaru would normally remind him of in outings like this, but in this current state, it was almost adorable to watch the young dog-nin slurp away happily yet hungrily with a wide smile on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he continued, finishing his second bowl, followed shortly by his third, then fourth, and so on, until...</span></div></div>",

His stomach, having received the contents of ten bowls or ramen, was bulging rather noticeably underneath his hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, having polished off all his bowls in the meantime (hey, he was hungry!), licked his chops and looked up at Kiba. Smiling a doggie smile, he wagged his tail. <i>Aw, look at him; looks like a happy puppy after a nice meal...</i> Going up beside Kiba, he licked the side of the boy's face, causing the ticklish young dog-nin to giggle a bit (with Akamaru privately savoring the taste of some broth that had been on his cheek.). <i>You look like you enjoyed that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a small burp, Kiba grinned at Akamaru. \"Yep, sure did!\" Turning back towards the counter, he rooted around in his wallet, pulling out some cash and putting it on the counter. \"Thanks for the meal!\" Burping again, he rubbed his stomach, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi smiled back. \"Come back any time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winked. \"I'm gonna hold you to that.\" Turning around in his seat, he hopped off the seat, Akamaru following close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a bit, Akamaru sidled up beside Kiba. <i>So, whaddaya wanna do now?</i> He punctuated this by nuzzling Kiba's face as they walked.

Akamaru, watching him go, hung his head and sighed. <i>Well...at least I can try to rein him in a bit.</i> Shaking his head, he trotted after the little dog-nin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two reached a rather sizable building, the (admittedly delectable, Akamaru admitted) scent that Kiba had found wafting out of it. The boy looked up at the sign on the building, grinning. \"Steak...exactly what I felt like.\" Still grinning, he walked through the doors, pushing them open and allowing Akamaru to pass through as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kiba got the attention of a waiter and asked to be seated. The man, sparing a confused glance at Kiba's already-bulging tummy, nonetheless motioned for Kiba and Akamaru to follow. Eventually, he lead them to a rather large booth. Thanking the man, Kiba slid in; Akamaru, seeing the sheer size of the booth, decided to hop up himself, sitting beside Kiba. Eyes bulging, the man raised a finger to protest, but thought better of it. Wearily, he asked Kiba what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's cheery response? \"I'll take a 72 oz ribeye, four racks of ribs, and a jumbo plate of fries, please!\" Akamaru's eyes practically bulged out of his eyes, while the man's mouth dropped wide open. However, he managed to numbly nod and write it down. With a quiet \"I'll be right back with your order\", he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhining, Akamaru looked down at his little buddy. <i>Kiba...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba ruffled the fur on Akamaru's chest. \"Don't worry about me, pal; I can eat the entire dessert menu of the restaurant, I can take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru groaned. <i>I hope you're right, buddy...</i> He looked toward the ceiling. <i>I hope you're right...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the man returned, wheeling a cart and grunting; it was scarcely any surprise, given that it held a truly massive ribeye steak, juices running off it and pooling on the plate, four huge racks of ribs at least two feet long each, and a towering plate of fries, reaching at least a foot in the air, with melted cheese practically drenching each one. One by one, he laid them each on the table, struggling under the weight of each one. \"W-will that be all?\" The man asked, quietly hoping Kiba said no. Unfortunately, he wouldn't be so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba replied, \"Now that I think of it...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's get one more of those 70 oz steaks for my buddy Akamaru, too!\"  The waiter stopped for a moment, processing the notion of taking an order for a dog, who looked equally baffled as he turned to Kiba.  <i>K-Kiba?  I appreciate it, but I'm actually not too hungry, though...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow and grinned impishly as he ruffled the big dog's head and remarked, \"Oh really?  Because I'm pretty sure that face you were making when you saw this guy drag that cart of food wasn't an 'I'm not hungry' face.\"  Akamaru's doggy face flushed beneath his fur for a moment as his own stomach growled audibly, causing him to blush even further.  Kiba folded his arms victoriously and smirked as he added, \"I rest my case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost relieved that it was just one steak and not an entire cartload for the big dog, the waiter took down Kiba's additional order and got the steak prepped.  Despite himself, the smell emanating from the kitchen had Akamaru practically drooling.  Nevertheless, he was still concerned his little pal was going to go overboard(...again.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba, you sure you'd rather not just share?  Because that looks like an awful lot of food...</i>  Hearing that, Kiba licked his lips and grinned mischievously.  \"It suuuuure does, don't it.\"  Whining a bit, Akamaru addressed his buddy a little more seriously.  <i>I know you wanna see how much you can put away without Naruto around, but, well, you kinda have a tendency to go overboard, and I don't want you to get a tummy ache...or end up completely immobilized...</i>  Smiling, Kiba pet the big dog's head.  \"Oh c'mon, boy, don't worry about me.  If there's one thing I can handle, it's meat,\" Kiba said, practically salivating at the last part of his sentence.  \"Besides, if ever there was a time to just cut loose, now's the time to do it, when my metabolism is all mega fast and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the waiter returned with a large platter.  Atop it, a big, juicy 72 oz steak with Akamaru's name on it.  Turning to the sight, Akamaru's concerns almost completely faded as his jaw gaped.  The waiter placed the steak before the big dog, and, albeit a bit confused, rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Ehhhh...enjoy?\" and took his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba grabbed a handful of cheese laden fries and said, \"Whelp, that's enough banterin'.  Whadduya say we dig in, buddy?\"  He then shoved a handful of fries into his eager mouth, chewing vigorously.  \"Mmmm!  Holy cow, this stuff is killer!\"  He then grabbed a larger handful of fries and put it next to his rib eye as he licked his lips of some cheese residue, and started tearing into his steak.  Akamaru, despite his initial concerns, was far too captivated by the utterly flavorful aroma steaming from the huge slab of meat before him to resist any longer.  He then proceeded to lean down and take a huge, gaping bite of his steak.  As the tender chunks of beef slid down his mouth, his eyes widened as he proceeded to chomp away further.  Seeing this, Kiba grinned after gulping down another mouthful and said, \"Hehe, told'ja!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, both the boy and his dog were tearing into their plates as carefree as the pair could be.  And as more time went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pair continued on, completely lost in the flavors their meals provided. Kiba, in particular, was shoving fries into his mouth with one hand (spattering his mouth with cheese in the process) while the other, gripping a fork, ripped chunks of meat off the steak (it was extremely tender, and he practically didn't need a knife) and crammed them into his mouth. As the flavors mixed in his mouth, Kiba's face lit up in a huge grin, even as he chewed and swallowed the huge mouthful and began stuffing his face anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, placing his front paws on the sides of his steak (much to the alarm of the other patrons),  ripped off huge chunks of his own steak, tail wagging as he gulped them down. <i>Oh man...this might be the best steak I've ever had!</i> Gulping down his mouthful, he licked his chops before going back in. <i>I'm probably gonna regret this later...but I just can't stop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba and Akamaru continued stuffing their faces, they slowly began going faster and faster, unable to get to those delectable flavors fast enough. Bits of steak, juice, and melted cheese flew every which way as as boy and dog ripped into their respective courses. Akamaru's tail wagged even faster, and Kiba began kicking his legs, unable to help himself; it was just so <i>good</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two had almost worked themselves into a blur, food detritus flying everywhere, but neither of them paid it much mind. What they did notice, even if it was more of a peripheral thing, was the effect this was having on their midsections. Already holding the contents of ten ramen bowls, they felt their stomachs slowly grow heavier as more and more food made their way down their gullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two stopped for breath, leaning back against the booth. As one, they let out a deep, contented sigh of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kiba burped, and he giggled. \"H-heh, scuse me.\" He grinned, his mouth and cheeks splattered with cheese and steak juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru licked his chops, looking down fondly at Kiba. <i>You're excused. Oh, and ya got a little something on your face.</i> His tail started wagging. <i>Here, lemme take care of that for ya.</i> Leaning down, he licked Kiba's face affectionately, causing the boy to laugh uproariously. In return, he extended his arms and gave Akamaru an enthusiastic hug. Smiling a doggie smile, Akamaru nuzzled him. <i>You're welcome.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laughing, Kiba disentangled himself from Akamaru and leaned back in his seat, patting his stomach. \"Oh man, this stuff's amazing...\" As he did so, he glanced down at his belly. Sure enough, it had grown even more, and now formed a definite round shape under his hoodie. Gulping, Akmaaru looked down at his own tummy; to confirm his thoughts, his stomach was beginning to noticeably distend, sticking out from his underside like a big, furry bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed at Akamaru's embarrassed expression. \"Heh, we're really putting it away, aren't we, boy? And we still got...\" He checked his own steak. \"...about three-quarters of our steak left each!\" He rubbed his stomach in anticipation. \"Can't wait to see how big our guts'll get once we finish...\" he looked towards the as-of-yet untouched ribs and smirked. \"And we haven't even gotten to the ribs yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru burped wetly, looking down at Kiba in concern. <i>Y-yeah, but aren't you forgetting something?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kiba's smile faded somewhat, and he tilted his head curiously. \"Huh? Whaddaya mean, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his own head. <i>Do you remember what happened the last time you wore that getup and you pigged out?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought for a second, nodding. \"Yeah, I ended up busting my net shirt, Mom got really mad...\" He trailed off as Akamaru's statement sunk in, and he paled slightly. His mom wasn't gonna like it if he busted another net shirt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, noticing Kiba's discomfort, whined a bit. <i>So, uh, are you gonna lift your net shirt up so there's less chance you'll bust it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru asked this, Kiba lifted up the bottom of his hoodie to examine his stomach; sure enough, the net shirt stretched to cover his growing midsection, and if he taxed it any further, it would start fraying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly came to Kiba, and the sides of his mouth slowly lifted up into a smile. Akamaru, seeing this, raised an eyebrow (or where one would be, anyway.) <i>Kiba, I know that look. What are you planning?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up at Akamaru, a mischievous smile on his face. \"Watch.\" Scooting back as much from the table as he could, he lifted up one arm, grabbed the opposite sleeve, and pulled the arm occupying that sleeve into his hoodie. Then, taking that arm, he grabbed the inside of the other sleeve and pulled that arm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked. <i>Kiba, what're you...</i> He trailed off, his eyes bugging out. <i>Oh Kiba, please tell me you're not gonna...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba merely gave Akamaru a cheeky grin in response. Reaching down to the bottom of his net shirt, he grabbed it and pulled it upwards, pushing his hoodie up a bit as well and exposing some bare skin in the process. Disregarding this, Kiba continued pulling it up until it was above his stomach. Grinning, he reached towards one net shirt sleeve with one arm, then to the other arm, doing the same thing with the undershirt that he'd done with his hoodie. Then, once his arms were free of his net shirt, he reached up out of his hoodie's neck with them, grabbed its hem, and yanked it off...and pulling his hoodie up further, exposing more of his belly. Kiba, blushing a bit at this, nevertheless pulled it the rest of the way off, holding it above his head. Grinning, he crumpled it up and threw it to the side, the discarded garment coming to rest on the floor. That taken care of, Kiba brought his arms back down, put each one back inside each sleeve, and pulled his hoodie back down, once again concealing his belly. \"There; that oughtta take care of that.\" Akamaru, at a loss for words, merely sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not deter Kiba in the slightest. \"Oh, c'mon, buddy, don't be like that!\" He turned back to his food. \"Now that I don't have to worry about busting my net shirt, I can go all-out!\" With that, he grabbed a handful of fries, and the fork with the other one, and once again began cramming his face full of food. Akamaru watched this with no small amount of dread, but a rumbling in his stomach reminded him that he was still hungry. <i>Ah, well; the steak's delicious, and it'd be a shame to waste it...</i> His tail wagging, he placed his paws back on the steak and resumed ripping into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both the boy and dog continue to messily devour their slabs of steak, despite the occasional glances of awe and utter confusion from some of the nearby patrons and wait staff.  All the while, both their tummies continued to distend with more and more of their meals consumed.  Kiba's hoodie continued to push outward, still concealing his belly, but just barely, while Akamaru's distended tummy continued to grow outward with more and more of his steak consumed.  Stopping, he winced and examined his growing appendage and sighed to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great...now I look like I'm eating for two...ugh, well, at least I don't have to worry about busting any clothing...</i>  He glanced back at Kiba who was still chomping away at his own ribeye and cheese covered fries.  <i>I still can't believe he just took his damn under-netting off in a restaurant like that...eh, but I guess at least now, he won't bust it and get scolded by his mom...and get me scolded by proxy...</i> he gulped nervously as the image of Tsume's furious glare popped into his head.  Almost instinctively, he jumped right back to his steak, and in that instant, his thoughts were stilled, and replaced with an overwhelming sense of joy.  <i>Ah, hell, it's worth it for steak THIS good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time had passed as the two continued gleefully chomping away and putting a considerable dent in their meals.  As both reached a little past the half way point of their steak and rib-eyes, they had stopped to catch their breath.  Burping loudly, Kiba sighed and patted his distended belly happily as he turned to Akamaru and smiled.  \"Okay, NOW try and tell me that coming here after Ichiraku's was a bad idea,\" he said smugly.  The big dog rolled his eyes and playfully nudged the boy with his muzzle.  <i>Okay, so this place has the greatest steak I've ever sunk my teeth into.  Point taken.  That still doesn't mean you should go too overboard.</i>  Waving his hand dismissively, Kiba said, \"Ah, I know, I know, I won't make myself sick.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru scoffed to himself.  <i>I know I'm probably sounding like a broken record, but it's because I don't want you to be hurting.</i>  Kiba smiled at the big dog and ruffled his fuzzy head as he added, \"I know, because you're my pal.  Even if it's unnecessary, I know you can't help but worry every now and then, and I appreciate that, you big softy!\"  Akamaru smiled a doggy smile at Kiba's acknowledgement and proceeded to lick the boy's face affectionately, causing him to giggle ticklishly.  <i>Just making sure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scene carried on, the waiter once again returned, still nervously processing that the boy was having a conversation with a big white dog and interjected.  \"Erm, is everything satisfactory?\"  Kiba smiled and patted his tummy proudly.  \"Sure is!\"  The big dog barked happily in response.  The waiter, however baffled, took that as a yes.  \"But now that'cha mention it, I'm kinda parched.  Can you bring a big pitcher of soda or something to help wash this stuff down with?\"  Akamaru whined.  Catching that, Kiba nodded and said, \"Oh, sorry, boy.  And can we also get like a big...bowl of water for my buddy here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again left dumbfounded by the unusual request, the waiter simply stood there for a few seconds of awkward silence before nodding and taking his leave.  Akamaru chuckled to himself.  <i>You certainly know how to leave an impression on people at restaurants, don't you, Kiba?</i>  Laughing, Kiba rubbed the back of his head sheepishly and said, \"Heh, I guess it IS pretty weird for him to be taking orders for a guy with a huge appetite and big dog with a larger-than-he'd-like-admit appetite.\"  Akamaru's face flushed red beneath his fur as Kiba grinned mischievously at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to rest up and catch their breath after what seemed like a whirlwind of food all at once being scarfed down.  Kiba occasionally munched on another cheesy fry, then fed one to Akamaru who scarfed it down with gusto and proceeded to lick his chops happily.  \"Man, I wonder what's taking 'em so long to get our drinks.\"  Akamaru chuckled and noted, <i>They're probably still looking for a bowl in the kitchen they can give me.</i>  Kiba chuckled sheepishly and said, \"Ehhh, remind me to leave a really good tip for this poor guy when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, the waiter returned with an ample pitcher of soda for the young dog-nin and a sizable metal bowl (clearly not meant for dogs, but the waiter had all but given up on caring about the unconventionality of this whole thing at this point) filled with water for Akamaru and took his leave.  Grinning, Kiba grabbed his pitcher with both hands and exclaimed, \"Cheers, boy!\" and proceeded to take several ample gulps while Akamaru proceeded to lap his water bowl hastily, clearly rather parched himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, a few ongoers and fellow patrons observed the scene of the stuffed boy chugging down his beverage and a big white dog sitting at a booth, lapping away at a bowl of water, and; like the waiter, opted to just carry on and not ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued to drink their respective beverages...</span></div></div>",

And, at the rate he was chugging that soda, and the inevitable fact he'd be returning to his food soon, chances were more would be showing soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Kiba chugged, he felt a tightness in his waist. Curious, he lowered his pitcher, swallowing the soda left in his mouth. Scooting back as much as he could, he reached hand under his growing belly and felt around the waistline of his pants; sure enough, his consumption of ten bowls of ramen, 36 oz of beef, who knows how many cheesy fries, and some soda were now causing his midsection to begin pressing against his pants. It wasn't at the point where it was hard for him to breath, nor was it painful, but that snugness would only increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his head up from his bowl of water, Akamaru turned his head toward Kiba. <i>Pants feeling a little tight there, Kiba?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling around his waistline, Kiba looked towards Akamaru, shrugging. \"Eh, a little bit, but it's not too bad right now.\" He smirked. \"I can probably go a little longer without undoing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, tilting his head. <i>You sure that's a good idea? I mean, your mom was most upset about you busting net shirts, but she got pretty mad when you busted your pants button, too...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced, shuddering a bit. \"Y-yeah, that's true...\" He rubbed his distended belly absentmindedly, a couple of his fingers brushing against the exposed skin. His mom <i>would</i> be pretty mad if he'd have to his his button sewn back on <i>again</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But then again,</i> Kiba reasoned, taking a deep breath and once again feeling the snugness, <i>It's not <b>that</b> tight yet, and if I undo them now, it's almost like I'm chickening out...</i> He furrowed his brow, deep in thought. Akamaru, curious, tilted his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba had decided what he was going to do. Looking towards Akamaru, he smirked cockily. \"Ya know what, boy? I don't want Mom yelling or lecturing at me again, so I'm gonna undo my pants...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail, relieved Kiba was actually demonstrating some sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...as soon as my pants get really freaking tight and I can barely breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's face fell, his tail stopping mid-wag. <i>Kiba, I really don't think that's a...</i> The dog faltered as Kiba picked his jug of cola back up and resumed guzzling it down. Wearily, and with a sense of impending doom, he continued lapping at his bowl of water as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, both of their thirsts were quenched for the moment (even though they weren't even a quarter of the way through their respective beverages yet,) and they resumed ripping into their meals. Kiba, determination flowing through him, crammed forkful after forkful and handful after handful of fries into his mouth, chewing and grinning at the wonderful flavors before gulping them down and repeating the process. Before long, his hoodie began rising up a bit, slowly exposing more flesh. Simultaneously, he felt his pants' waistline become slowly but surely more snug; a jolt of nervousness ran through him, but he kept up his pace, not wanting to lose his groove....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was on a roll, tearing through his rib-eye and fries like he'd not eaten in years.  Akamaru, while not as fast paced, had also picked up the pace a considerable amount.  He had slowed down a tad, occasionally glancing back at the boy, and keeping his eye on Kiba's ever expanding tummy, to make sure he wouldn't bust his pants and suffer Tsume's wrath.  With every hearty mouthful of meat and cheesy laden fries gulped down, Kiba's tummy continued to push outward just little by little, exposing a tad more flesh, and pressing against his pants even further.  Akamaru whined, fearing the boy would be negligent and not unbutton in time, but hunger still had a hold over the big dog, and so, he cautiously resumed chomping into his steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ripping another big chunk of his rib-eye, Kiba chomped away vigorously then stuffed another mouthful of fries into his mouth, smiling as the two flavors complemented one another for a moment, then gulped heartily, sending them both down his throat and into his growing gullet.  This particular mouthful was larger than the others, however, causing his stomach to push outward slightly more.  The boy winced, as he pressed a hand against his belly, which was now snagged by the front of his pants, constricting his stomach tightly and causing considerable discomfort.  Akamaru, seeing this, whined to himself once more.  <i>Alright, I think you've made your point, Kiba.  You should probably undo the button while you still can.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Akamaru's protests, Kiba shook his head, and instead, opted for one more large mouthful of steak and fries.  \"Juuuust a little more,\" Kiba said, some obvious strain in his voice.  The constriction in his gut was making it harder to swallow food, and sending a sharp pain in the boys' midsection, which became facially visible.  Akamaru didn't like seeing his friend in pain like this, especially self induced pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the boy was committed to test his endurance without busting any of his attire, and so, he chewed vigorously, before taking one large gulp.  As he felt the mouthful of meat and fries slide down his throat, he immediately reached for his button and struggled a bit.  The sheer volume of food packed in his gut combined with how deeply constricted his pants were digging into his bloated tummy made grabbing a hold of the button a challenge, and time was running out, as he felt his belly begin to expand as more food was deposited into it.  Akamaru whimpered, covering his eyes with his ears, and ducking down beneath the table as he expected the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba could feel the button straining as his abdomen continued to try and force past the constricting front of his pants.  But to Akamaru's surprise, there was no dreaded SNAP, no button nailing an innocent bystander in the face, no Kiba apologizing sheepishly, and best of all, no wrath to suffer by Tsume.  For at long last, the boy grabbed a hold of the button and successfully undid it just in time, causing his belly to surge outward past the front of the pants, and down past the zipper slightly as it extended a considerable amount.  His hoodie now rode up just below his belly button, as his tummy was finally liberated.  Akamaru cautiously rose back up his seat, and confirmed that Kiba had indeed undone his button before it could break.  The big dog then sighed with relief, knowing all things considered, that could have gone south in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back against the booth seat, Kiba slouched and sighed with immense relief and newfound comfort.  \"Ahhhh, THERE we go!\" he said, patting his belly proudly.  Unfortunately, the sudden shift of movement, combined with all the meat and cheese, combined with a quarter of soda, and tapped off with some hearty patting had caused quite a stir brewing within Kiba's now troubled stomach, alarming both the boy and the dog as it proceeded to gurgle audibly, causing the young dog-nin to wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba?  A-are you alright?</i>  Akamaru inquired with some obvious concern...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooooh,\" Kiba suddenly groaned, leaning forward in his seat and clutching his distended tummy as a sharp pain erupted inside it. \"My stomach hurts, Akamaru...\" He squeezed his eyes shut, thumbs kneading his belly to try to relieve some of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined in concern, leaning over and licking Kiba's cheek. <i>Well, I hate to say I told you so, but...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned again, moving his hands up and down his midsection. \"C'mon, Akamaru, not now, OK? It really really hurts...\" He whimpered a bit, and Akamaru's ears shot up in alarm; Kiba really did sound like he was hurting. Couldn't have that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, c'mon, little buddy,</i> Akamaru barked softly, nuzzling the boy's cheek. <i>You know I was only joking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Kiba muttered, wincing as a particularly sharp bolt of pain shot through his belly. \"I-I know. Th-this just really hurts, is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his eyes flew open, and to Akamaru's shock, his face contorted in a scowl. \"Damn it!\" He banged a fist on the table angrily, startling the other patrons. \"Uh, kid?\" one tentatively asked. \"Everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Kiba snarled. \"Just shut the hell up and get back to your food!\" Eyes widening in shock, the patrons decided it'd be better to avoid the ill-tempered boy and quickly got back to their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stared at the seething boy, mouth agape. <i>Kiba,</i> he ventured slowly, <i>What's wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?!\" Kiba repeated, rounding on Akamaru. \"Akamaru, I haven't even gone through HALF the stuff here, and my stupid gut's starting to give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru gave a nonplussed look at the huge steak that was a little over half finished, along with the plate of fries that was noticeably diminished. <i>Kiba, you've eaten plenty, not to mention those ten bowls of ramen you had beforehand...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?!\" Kiba found himself yelling back, causing the dog to recoil a bit. On some level, he knew he shouldn't be yelling at Akamaru, but he was just so <i>mad</i>... \"I've eaten way more than this before, even if it was when I was competing with the bonehead! I know I can handle more! I <i>should</i> be able to handle more!\" Snarling, he held up his hands in front of his face. \"But this stupid body won't <i>let</i> me!\" He narrowed his eyes. \"It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like turning on a switch, his expression switched from enraged to despondent. \"It's too weak...\" he muttered in a very small tone. Akamaru, catching this, leaned back down towards him. <i>Kiba...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the dog's alarm, Kiba's hands started trembling a bit...as did his bottom lip. Akamaru's eyes widened. <i>Uh oh.</i> As if to confirm his worries, tears started gathering in Kiba's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost to complement this, the dog whined; the only thing worse than seeing Kiba in physical pain was seeing him emotionally distressed. As Kiba sniffled, a few tears running down his cheeks, it took Akamaru only a millisecond to decide his next course of action. <i>Kiba,</i> the dog barked softly. At the noise, Kiba's eyes widened, freeing a few more tears. <i>Listen to me.</i> Sniffling, Kiba turned towards Akamaru. Seeing he had his attention, the dog leaned his head in close to the boy's. <i>You are <b>not</b> weak. You're one of the toughest, most determined ninja I know, and I'm not just sayin' that 'cause you're my partner...</i> the side of his muzzle quirked up a bit. <i>...though that's definitely a factor.</i> Kiba, though he still had tears in his eyes, smiled at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally excited over his first little victory, Akamaru continued. <i>And I know I don't like it when you stuff yourself, but to be honest, on some level, I'm never really worried. Know why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-why?\" Kiba asked, sniffling again and wiping his eyes on his hoodie sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail. <i>Because I know that, however much food you might cram down your throat, I know you can take it. You're just that tough.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled again, this time showing some teeth. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, there's a smile,</i> the ninken thought, gratified. Out loud, he barked, <i>Does this look like a face that would lie to you?</i> At this, he stuck his tongue out, moved his ears at weird angles, and crossed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got the desired reaction: Kiba burst into a fit of giggles, the only tears running down his cheeks now the ones that had already accumulated in his eyes. Akamaru smirked to himself. <i>Heh; mission accomplished.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarcely had he finished this thought than Kiba reached up, seized the dog's neck, and pulled his head in close. \"Thanks, boy,\" Kiba muttered, rubbing the side of his face against Akamaru's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Always happy to help,</i> Akamaru woofed, nuzzling Kiba's face in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy and dog stayed this way for a good minute or so, and likely would have gone on longer had another sharp pain not erupted in Kiba's belly. Wincing, he released Akamaru's neck and jerked away, putting his hands to his belly. Akamaru, slightly disappointed, nonetheless  wagged his tail. <i>Still, your body's different than it would normally be, so ya might need to do something a little different if you wanna keep stuffing your craw.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tilted his head. \"A little...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, his eyes wandered to the pitcher of cola, and a grin lit up his face. <i>Bingo.</i> Whirling back around to face the table, he picked up the jug, opened wide, and tilted it to his mouth. As Akamaru watched, a bit confused, the cola poured down Kiba's throats, small rivulets of the drink running down his cheeks. As he chugged, Kiba felt his belly continue to churn, and he couldn't help but wince as more bolts of pain shot through his belly. Still, he pressed on, deterimned. Akamaru tilted his head. <i>Uh, Kiba...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winked at Akamaru, continuing to chug. Then, finally, he slammed the pitcher down (sloshing some cola about in the process), pressed hard on his tummy (which had bulged some more from the cola, forcing his hoodie up just high enough to expose his navel), opened his mouth, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...let loose with a titanic belch that startled Akamaru, and caused the other patrons of the restaurant to look towards them in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a good several seconds, the burp wound down. Kiba was blushing a bit from the sheer volume it had held, but nonetheless held a triumphant smirk on his face. \"Ahhh, just what I needed,\" he sighed, smacking his belly a few times, much to Akamaru's alarm. However, he did not wince in pain. At Akamaru's confused whine, Kiba giggled. \"Well, whaddaya know, boy? All I had ta do was release some pressure, and now I'm feelin' all better!\" A determined grin on his face, he turned back to what was left of his ribeye. \"Now, instead of wasting any more time....\" He picked his fork back up and continued ripping chunks of meat off and shoveling them into his mouth, cramming mouthfuls of fries in when he could. \"...let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched, a bit confused; had he just given Kiba a pep talk to keep stuffing himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail wagged; maybe, but if he had to choose between his little buddy continuing to be sad or cheering up and being happy while he stuffed himself...well, it was no contest, really. With that thought, he turned his attention back to his own steak and started ripping into it once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A good while had passed as Kiba; with newfound vigor, had resumed tearing into his ribeye and fries combo.  Akamaru also resumed chomping away at his fat steak, but he took it at a much slower rate, due to a mixture of his own fullness that he was beginning to experience, and just occasionally checking up on Kiba to see how he was fairing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had made ample progress, and didn't seem to be suffering anything but an increasingly larger tummy.  However, despite that, Akamaru couldn't help but wag his tail as he saw the hearty smile across his little pals face, because at this point, all Akamaru cared about was that Kiba was happy....even if that meant stuffing himself and making a spectacle of himself around the other patrons, though they seemed to be getting a bit more accustom to the boys particularly animated gorging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Kiba would stop to catch his breath; if only for a moment, before digging right back for more.  All the while, as the boy ate and ate, his tummy continued to distend more and more, as the pile of fries had begun to shrink and the depleting steak continued to lessen, Kiba's hoodie rose just ever so slightly more and more above his belly button.  His ballooned out belly had expanded to the point where it looked like Kiba had swallowed a sizable watermelon and then some, but his vigor remained just as strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Akamaru couldn't help but feel a semblance of pride in Kiba's progress.  Sure, as he'd said again and again, he's never been too thrilled with Kiba overdoing it when it came to food, but his words about Kiba being tough were 100% genuine, and whether he liked to admit it or not, there was something to be admired about his pal having enough endurance to push himself to his limits and beyond.  Not just with food, but training, fighting, tolerating Naruto's air-headedness, and just toughing it out when life was at its' hardest.  It was all part of the same package, and if anyone could take it, it was Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to prove that point, Kiba proceeded to down the last large chunk of steak and an extra hearty final mouthful of cheesy fries into his mouth in one go, chewing vigorously as his cheeks bulged comically large.  Akamaru couldn't help but giggle to himself at this ridiculous sight.  <i>Jeez, you look like a blowfish...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba mumbled something incoherent before wincing and taking a rather audible GULP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining a bit, Kiba gulped harder until the massive amount of food had traveled down his throat and down into his vastly bloated belly.  Finally, with a rather large belch, the boy sighed with immense relief and smacked his lips.  \"Phew!  Tasty or not, that steak was a contender!\"  Kiba exclaimed, patting his belly proudly.  Akamaru then proceeded to lick the boy's face happily, earning a ticklish giggle from the young dog-nin.  <i>Hehe, I knew you could do it, pal!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kiba ruffled the big dogs head and said, \"Thanks, boy!  But y'know...\" Kiba stopped for a moment and gave Akamaru a more sincere look of appreciation as he continued, \"...I doubt I'd have ever toughed it out as much as I did if it wasn't for you.\"  Akamaru glanced curiously.  <i>What do you mean?  I knew my little pep-talk reached you, but-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba waved his hand dismissively and said, \"Nah, not just now, but I mean, in general.  Being stuck like this has had its' ups and its' downs, and sure, me and the bonehead manage as best we can, but it's been hard, y'know?\"  Akamaru whined a bit, knowing all too well how true that was.  \"I know you probably already know and all that stuff, but...I just want'cha to know how grateful I am to you for always being there.   Even at the lowest points in all this, you were always there to help be right back up.  You even helped me see how being a kid again could actually be a blast!  So, thanks, Akamaru.  Thanks for being the best pal a guy could have.\"  The boy smiled warmly as he hugged the big dogs neck in appreciation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Akamaru already knew Kiba's always been grateful, but hearing it, even in this state?  Something about it was different, more meaningful, somehow.  Enough so to where he began to feel that familiar inner warmness, a mix of both brotherly and fatherly (given Kiba's current state) and so Akamaru nuzzled the boy in turn, before giggling to himself as he noticed Kiba's tummy accidentally pushing against the dog.  But he didn't mind.  Even some of the already on and off observing patrons; whether mortified by the rapid eating display or Kiba's earlier outburst, couldn't help but smile at the scene, before returning to their meals, knowing all too well it wouldn't be long before the boy and dog resumed said feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he licked the boy once more and smiled a doggy smile back at his pal.  <i>Hehe, hey, what are friends for, right?</i>  Akamaru then glanced at what remained of his steak and waterbowl, and back at the full stack of ribs and the remains of the cola pitcher Kiba had left unconsumed.  Kiba, seeing this, grinned as he nudged the dog more playfully.  \"Whadduya say, boy?  How 'bout we finish strong?\"  The dog barked happily.  <i>Hey, no use stopping now, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's the spirit, buddy!\"  Kiba exclaimed before grabbing one of the ribs and wasting no time chomping the meat right off the bone, smearing some of the BBQ sauce on his lips.  Akamaru smirked to himself as he jokingly mused.  <i>I swear, some people just eat like animals...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to put his paws on his steak and chomp voraciously, tearing off another hearty chunk before gulping it down.  The boy and dog pair continued ripping into what remained of their plates.  However determined, there was no denying that the two had eaten a considerable amount, and so their momentum was beginning to flag just slightly.  Akamaru would stop to pant for breath whilst occasionally lapping at his bowl before proceeding.  Kiba would also occasionally catch his breath, or take a gulp of his soda to help wash down his meal, or burp to relieve some pressure before resuming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time pressed on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In spite of their flagging momentum, the pair pressed on, determined not to let either of their meals go to waste; Kiba would grab a rib, stripping it of meat and licking his lips, only to swallow and go onto the next one, while Akamaru continued ripping off huge chunks of meat. Every several mouthfuls, they would pant, take a drink of their respective beverages, and/or let off a quick belch before continuing. As a result, it was somewhat slow going, especially compared to their earlier pace, but they nonetheless kept at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more meat vanished into their maws, their stomachs slowly grew; Akamaru's furry tummy continued swelling and pushing out, and he noted, with a blush, that he now looked as though he'd swallowed a basketball. Still, the steak was delicious, so he kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's midsection, likewise, continued ballooning out as he continued gulping down his ribs, forcing his hoodie higher and higher. His fly, already forced all the way down, began to strain as his stomach continued to put more pressure on it. Kiba winced as he felt this, but knowing full well there was nothing he could do about it (aside from taking off his pants, and there was no way he was gonna stoop to doing something like that), he shrugged, taking a drink of cola and burping before grabbing more of his ribs and ripping into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticked by as the two kept on soldiering away, cramming mouthful after mouthful of food and drink into their mouths, burping, panting, and repeating the whole thing over again. As they did, their stomachs continued to expand, Akamaru's continuing past \"basketball\" to \"small beach ball\" and <i>still</i> not letting up, and Kiba's growing bigger and closer to the table, putting more pressure on his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, Kiba stripped the last rib bone, tossed it aside, and let out a victorious belch as he leaned back in his seat, massaging his tummy. \"Oh man...now THAT was a meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru licked his lips, having just finished swallowing his last bit of steak. <i>You said it, pal!</i> He let loose with a burp of his own, then sighed, leaning back against his seat. He wagged his tail as Kiba reached an arm over and scratched his overstuffed tummy. <i>Ooh, yeah; that's the stuff...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach had ballooned out to near beach-ball proportions, his hoodie now riding entirely above the overstuffed sphere. and putting an uncomfortable amount of strain on his zipper. His navel, surprisingly, was still in its normal state, but a distinct pressure around it told Kiba it wouldn't stay that way for long. In spite of this, the boy sighed happily, leaning back and rubbing the appendage, closing his eyes and licking his lips as he tried getting at the steak juice, barbecue sauce, and cheese that was smeared across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru opened his eyes enough to look down at the boy massaging his oversized tummy, and that familiar warmth came flooding back. <i>He looks so happy, so content,</i> Akamaru thought to himself, wagging his tail some more. <i>I don't care how much trouble I'll get in; he looks so damn <b>cute</b>.....&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarcely had he finished this thought than Kiba's face contorted in a rather odd expression. Akamaru, curious, was about to ask what was up, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the boy's belly button finally gave up the ghost, popping out into a fleshy nub. With the sudden release of pressure and the relief it brought, Kiba couldn't help but giggle uproariously. \"Ah, THERE it goes! Always love it when that happens!\" Akamaru had to admit, it did look rather funny, and, somehow, made Kiba look even more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru suddenly let loose with a loud burp; looking down, he noted, to his displeasure, that his own tummy was now the size of a small-to-mid-size beach ball, to the point where he could feel his back legs beginning to become forced apart. <i>Well,</i> the dog thought, sighing, <i>at least this isn't the biggest it's ever been, not to mention I can probably still walk...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting to the side, he turned his headi toward Kiba. <i>Alright, Kiba, it looks like we're about done here; ya wanna get going?</i> He climbed down to the floor, swaying a bit as his belly, hanging very noticeably beneath him, pulled him along, but he managed to right himself. <i>Ya can get the money out once you get outta your seat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"Sounds like a plan, boy!\" He made as it to move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut stopped suddenly, his eyes widening in alarm and worry. \"Oh, you gotta be kidding me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, immediately shifting into \"Concerned Best Buddy\" mode. &lt;i&gt;Kiba? What's wrong?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gulped, shifting a bit in his seat. \"Uh, Akamaru,\" he mumbled as he stared down at his belly and the table, \"don't freak, but...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Rgh, my gut's wedged into the damn booth!\" Kiba said, both annoyed and dumbstruck that he actually managed to get himself stuck.  \"Ugh, figures I'd ask for a booth.  Nice and comfy, and bolted night and tight into the ground...\"  He tried forcing himself out, but winced in pain as his exposed belly rubbed hard against the table, causing him to recoil and halt his motion immediately.  Akamaru whined as he looked at his friend with concern.  <i>Be careful, Kiba.  You might cut yourself if your stomach rubs too hard against the tables' surface.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pouted a bit then nodded.  \"Well, then what the heck am I gonna do?\"  Kiba asked as he dropped his arms to his sides.  Akamaru glanced curiously at his pal as a few thoughts arose.  <i>Can't you just...tuck your tummy in and coot out?</i>  Kiba scowled a bit and tucked his tummy in as far as he could, going a little red in the face in the process, but having literally just eaten, it did little to nothing for the poor boy, who exhaled and caused his belly to distend outward slightly yet again.  \"Ah, dammit...I'm too full to suck my gut in right now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmm...maybe I could just hop up and push on your tummy so you could scoot out then?</i>  Kiba immediately grimaced as he rested a hand against his tummy and shook his head.  \"That much pressure on a full gut...?  Nooooo thanks...\"  Akamaru immediately nodded in agreement.  <i>Yeah, that could actually get pretty...messy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning a bit in annoyance, Kiba sighed to himself and said, \"Guess I just gotta wait til my stomach works off some of this meal or something...\"  Akamaru raised what would be an eyebrow and took a closer look at Kiba's bloated midsection pushing against the table, seeing just how truly bloated the young dog-nin was.  <i>Errrr...considering how much we...you in particular just ate...thaaaaaat might take a little while...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pouted some more as he looked down at his wedged tummy and winced.  \"But I can't sit like this for too long!  My stomach's starting to really hurt!\"  Whining a bit, Akamaru pondered for just a moment, then stopped as he looked back at the boy and grinned a bit to himself as he hopped back up to the booths seat and turned to Kiba.  <i>Okay, I MIGHT have an idea...and it MIGHT work...but we're gonna have to be a little quick on our feet about this, otherwise that big tip we're leaving is gonna be a LOT bigger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Akamaru uncertainly, Kiba gulped nervously and rested his hands against his tummy protectively.  \"Akamaru...?  W-what are you up to...?\" Kiba asked with some doubt as the dog leaned in and licked the boy's face assuredly before hopping down under the table and towards the one leg of the table bolted to the ground.  <i>Okay, soon as you have enough room to move, scoot your butt as far as you can before any damage is done to the table....or me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm...are you sure that's a good idea, boy?\"  Kiba asked, even more nervously.  Akamaru whined to himself.  <i>This is a lot of things, Kiba, but a good idea is not one of them.  Still, we gotta at least try something, right?  Okay, ready?</i>  However reluctant, Kiba nodded as Akamaru immediately pushed with all his canine might against the poll holding the table together.  Some more patrons looked at the scene, a little more than dumbfounded, none more so than their waiter.  Akamaru struggled a bit as he pushed against the poll more and more with a surprising amount of strength, until with a great sensation of relief, Kiba's belly was no longer getting clamped down by the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time at all, the boy scooted for his life until he stumbled out of the booth, clutching his sore belly with sweet relief.  Seeing this, Akamaru immediately stopped pushing and moved away from the table's poll before he could snap it off the ground.  Unfortunately, he didn't anticipate the plates atop the table, one of which he watched; almost in futile slow motion, tumble off the table, and almost come crashing down to the ground.  Luckily, their waiter dove into action and caught the plate before it could crash against the floor and cause any more commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching, Akamaru smiled happily, actually kind of impressed.  <i>Wow, good catch!</i>  Chuckling a bit sheepishly, Kiba winced nervously and said, \"Ehhh...s-sorry about that.\"  Sighing to himself, the waiter placed the plate atop the table and; despite himself, smirked at the boy and ruffled his head.  \"Eh, it's alright, kid,\" he said.  Rubbing the back of his head, Kiba grinned then paid for his meal, as well as leaving a more than generous tip for their waiter as both the boy and the dog took their leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting his hands against his more than bloated tummy, Kiba sighed as he and Akamaru sluggishly made their way down the road.  \"Ooof, oh man, I tell ya, boy, I dunno how far I'm gonna get on this gut,\" he said, patting his belly for emphasis, causing it and his inverted navel to wobble a bit.  Akamaru barked both happily and wearily, barely able to get by on his own bloated tummy.  <i>Heh, tell me about it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two try to get by...</span></div></div>",

The training ground's a good way off, and it's not like we can lay down on any benches or anything like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah,</i> Akamaru sighed, shaking his head. <i>To be honest, I don't really know where...</i> The dog suddenly trailed off, looking off into the distance. Curious, Kiba tilted his head at his buddy. \"Eh? What's up, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog barked, wagging his tail. <i>I think I might have just found the answer to our little problem.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, but nonetheless intrigued, Kiba followed his friend's gaze, his face lighting up when he saw what his pal was indicating: specifically, a nicely-sized park, with lots of green grass and a couple of trees, perfect for napping against. There were some villagers there, but it wasn't like they'd never seen him stuffed before. \"Nice eye, boy!\" Grinning, he stumbled over to Akamaru, resting his arm on the dog. \"Think you can manage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru woofed happily, licking Kiba's cheek. <i>Heh, don't worry about me.</i> Kiba grinned in response to this, and together, the two slowly but surely made their way over to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief as they finally reached the park, the two made a beeline for the nearest tree, doing their best to ignore the confused stares of the other park-goers. A couple of very young children pointed and chattered at them, but they were quickly shushed by their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blushed. \"Ah, man, you'd think I'd get used to that after all this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, though he was blushing as well, shook it off. <i>Eh, don't worry about it, Kiba; nothing we can do about it, anyway.</i> Kiba, though he was still blushing, managed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two made it to the tree. Wagging his tail, Akamaru flopped down, coming to rest his side against the tree. Sighing in relief, Kiba let himself fall against Akamaru, coming to rest against the dog's belly and draping his arms along his buddy, as though he were relaxing on a bench. \"Aaahhh....now this is more like it,\" the young dog-nin sighed, closing his eyes. \"Now we can just kick back, relax, and...\" His sentence ground to a stop as his cheeks puffed up, and he let out a loud, sudden burp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that, it turned out, was the last straw for his overtaxed zipper. Already straining, the thin piece of metal burst off, ripping right down the middle of his pants in the process. Kiba and Akamaru's eyes both widened at the noise, and they looked down, the former blushing wildly, realizing that some of his paw-print patterned boxers were now showing for the whole world to see, and even more would likely be showing by the time his gut digested everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, damn it,\" Kiba muttered, his voice very small. \"Mom's gonna kill me...\" Not sure of what he could say, Akamaru merely whined and licked Kiba's cheek once again. Acknowledging this action with a grateful smirk, Kiba settled back against Akamaru, sighing and closing his eyes. <i>Ah, well, it's like Akamaru said: nothing I can do about it...</i> Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath through his nostrils, taking note of the myriad scents that wafted to his sensitive nose as he did so. <i>Well,</i> he thought as he let a smile creep across his face, feeling the sunlight warm his face even beneath the tree, <i>At least it's a nice day out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, before...</span></div></div>",

Before either the boy or dog knew it, both had drifted into a deep, peaceful slumber beneath the large tree shading them from the sunlight shining down over the rest of the park.  A content smile grew over Kiba's face as he nuzzled comfortably against the dog's still rather bloated tummy.  Akamaru didn't seem to mind at all.  In fact, a weary dog smile crept over his face as well as the two continued to sleep off their massive meals.  With a perfect mix of shade, daylight warmth, and the heavy feeling of sleeping off their bulbous tummies, the two probably could have stayed in this spot and position for hours if only left in peace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If only...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, dog-breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing a bit, Kiba's eyes slowly fluttered open, only to be greeted by the sight of an all-too-familiar face grinning back at him.  Rubbing his eyes, Kiba groaned as he sat up, best he could.  \"Rgh, hello to you too, bonehead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid bonehead; Naruto Uzumaki, also in the same physical state as his dog-nin pal, held his hands behind his back and rocked back and forth idly as he glanced down at Kiba and Akamaru.  \"Whatcha doing all the way up here?\" the young ninja asked.  Kiba smirked and said, \"What's it look like?  Trying to rest this off!\"  The boy patted his bloated tummy for emphasis, causing it to wobble slightly.  Naruto's eyes widened with only faint surprise at the sight; far too used to seeing his friend...and himself in such a immobilized state post feasting.  \"Wow, guess ya musta been pretty damn hungry,\" Naruto said, poking Kiba's belly and causing Kiba to grunt in annoyance as he swatted Naruto's hand away then smirked to himself shortly after.  \"Well, I was actually kinda curious to see much I could put away on my own, without any kinda competitive edge attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not half bad,\" Naruto said, relatively impressed with Kiba's eating ability, before grinning smugly and adding, \"though I could still probably top that in my sleep if I really wanted to.\"  Kiba scoffed and rolled his eyes.  \"Uhhh-huh, whatever you say, Naruto, whateeever you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's too bad I was busy training.  I was feelin' energetic and all that jumping around worked up a hell of an appetite,\" Naruto said, rubbing his stomach hungrily, to which Kiba shrugged and said, \"Eh, next time.  Preferably when I'm not on the verge of bursting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snickered, earning a curiously glance from the dog-nin.  \"Hehe, ohhhh, I think you're well past the verge of bursting, Mr. Paw-Print-Undie-Wondies...\"  Kiba's face immediately flushed red with a fuming mixture of embarrassment and fury as Naruto pointed towards Kiba's exposed boxers and proceeded to laugh even harder.  \"S-shut up, dumbass!\" Kiba exclaimed angrily as he grumbled to himself and folded his arms angrily.  Naruto continued to snicker as Kiba glanced a bit more angrily and shouted, \"I mean it!  It's bad enough I gotta try and rest this gut off with all the damn world able to see these things; which'll be even worse once my stomach ain't obstructing view, and even worse that my mom's gonna raise Hell when she sees I busted another pair of pant!  I don't need any more lip, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing back a bit, Naruto nonetheless smiled a bit more playfully.  \"Easy, dog-boy, I'm just foolin' with'cha,\" he said, playfully nudging Kiba in the shoulder, eventually causing him to ease up a bit as he said, \"Ah, whatever.  Not much I can do about it, so I guess there's no use making a fuss, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, Naruto raised an eyebrow and said, \"Well, who says there's nothing you can do about it?\"  Kiba glanced curiously at the young blond as he continued.  \"It ain't like there's no tailors or clothing shops out there who don't make the same kinda pants, right?  You got money, don'tcha?  Why not just buy another pair and pretend it's the same?  It ain't like your mom'll notice the difference, right?\"  Kiba waved his hand a bit dismissively and said, \"Nah, she's more keen than that.  She'll know if something's new or worn out.\"  Hearing that, Naruto grinned a bit mischievously and said, \"Then why not break 'em in first?  Y'know, like by getting your ass kicked yet again by yours truly?  Besides, looks like you can use the workout,\" Naruto added, pointing at Kiba's bloated gut for emphasis.  That actually hadn't sounded like such a bad idea...and the idea of making Naruto eat his words, and dirt after kicking HIS ass didn't sound half bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know something, bonehead?  That might've been one of the smartest suggestions I've heard you make in a long time...only I'm still way too full and way too tired to be moving around just yet,\" Kiba said, to which Naruto smiled and said, \"You might be a bloated slug right now, but I've still got TONS of energy!  Tell ya what, lend me however much those pants cost, and I'll go pick'em up for ya!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that?\"  Kiba asked, to which Naruto nodded and said, \"Hey, why not?  Sooner you're not showcasing those stupid boxers to all of Konoha, the sooner we can play around and all that!\"  Kiba scowled at Naruto's remark, but eventually, his expression worked its way back to an appreciative smile.  \"Thanks, man,\" he said as he reached into his back pocket and spotted Naruto some cash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto immediately took off, while Kiba leaned back against Akamaru, who was still in a very deep sleep.  Smiling at the sight, Kiba stretched his arms up and yawned heartily before dropping them down and once again drifting off into a slumber alongside his canine companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a while had passed, as Naruto gunned through various different stores, looking for the same size and style pants as what Kiba was wearing, before eventually finding a pair and making his way back to the park where the boy and large dog were still resting off their ample meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Naruto reached the two...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto, pants in hand, tilted his head curiously. \"Huh, musta been gone longer than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, while he had been gone, Kiba and Akamaru's metabolisms had appeared to kick in, the massive amount of food in their midsections beginning to digest at an impressive rate. Kiba's, in particular, had shrunken a great deal, and no longer appeared quite so massively bloated, though his hoodie still rested just above his belly-button (which, Naruto noted, had reverted to its natural innie state.) Eyes moving downward, he snickered as he saw Kiba's paw-print boxers showing through his ruined pants even moreso than before, now that his belly wasn't obstructing them. <i>Damn, Kiba really did a number on those pants,</i> Naruto thought through his giggles. <i>Just how much did he eat?</i> Then, of course, he remembered just how big Kiba's tummy had been when he'd come across the pair; a gut that size, it was no wonder his pants had finally given up the ghost. It was a good thing their current states sped up their already-active metabolisms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gotta say, that was pretty impressive that he ate that much,</i> Naruto mused, getting himself under control. <i>Still, it's not like I couldn't eat him under the table, even if its by myself...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely planned to do so later, but for now, just as he'd told Kiba, he was practically bursting with energy, and he was itching to expend it. \"Alright, Kiba,\" Naruto muttered, smirking as he drew something from his pocket. It was a loose feather, a long, whispy thing he'd found while on his way back to the park, and which he'd picked up when a burst of inspiration hit him. \"Time to wake up...\" Grinning wickedly, he took the stem of the feather in his hand and extended it, not stopping until the tip was inside Kiba's navel. The young dog-nin jerked a bit, his face twitching, but otherwise continued to slumber. Naruto snickered. <i>Perfect.</i> He proceeded to wiggle the feather around in the pit, which, predictably, caused Kiba to continue twitching, even as the sides of his mouth lifted up. Faster and faster he went, and the wider and wider Kiba's smile became, and a few giggles even began to come forth from his lips, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAHAHAHAHA!\" The little dog nin broke into uproarious laughter, sitting up and wrapping his arms around his still somewhat-bloated tummy, just missing the feather as Naruto pulled it back. \"Stoppit, I'm tickl---\" His eyes opened, and his smile promptly faded as he laid eyes on<br>\r\nthe grinning blonde. \"Naruto? What---\" His eyes widened as he noticed the feather in the other boy's hand. \"What...don't tell me you...\" Naruto's only response was a wide, toothy grin and a giggle. \"...you did,\" Kiba deadpanned, folding his arms. \"Why am I not surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, c'mon, Kiba,\" Naruto answered, discarding the feather. \"You hafta admit, it was funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill scowling, Kiba got to his feet, tugging his hoodie down as far as it would go with one hand, which, it turned out, was right under his navel, the other holding up his busted pants. \"OK, <i>maybe</i> a little, but next time just shake me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stuck his tongue out. \"Awww, you're no fun...\" Suddenly, he remembered what he'd woken Kiba up for in the first place. \"Oh, by the way...\" Grinning, he thrust the pants he'd gotten for Kiba-identical to the ripped ones he was wearing-forward. \"I got these for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his annoyance, Kiba smiled a bit as he took the pants, a little touched. \"...thanks, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the blonde, smirked and punched Kiba lightly in the shoulder. \"Hey, what are friends for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed a little bit. \"Huh, ya know, Akamaru said the same thing to me earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his name being mentioned, the dog blinked opened his eyes, yawning widely. <i>Did someone call my name...?</i> the dog chuffed blearily, climbing to his paws. Hearing Akamaru wake up, Kiba turned around, grinning as he threw his arms around Akamaru's neck. \"Hey, Akamaru! Ya sleep good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking his chops, the dog wagged his tail, licking the side of Kiba's face. <i>Like a pup. What about you, little buddy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a little kid,\" Kiba replied, giggling a bit. At this, Akamaru wagged his tail some more, and was about to reply when he caught a glimpse of something behind Kiba. Refocusing his view, Akamaru's eyes widened as he saw Naruto, though his tail never stopped wagging. <i>Naruto?</i> the dog barked, surprised. Sensing what his buddy wanted to do, Kiba let go of the dog's neck and went behind the tree with his pants to change. Giving an appreciate glance at his retreating pal, Akamaru trotted towards Naruto, tongue lolling. Naruto, catching notice of this, began to greet the dog, but was caught off guard by Akamaru licking his face. \"WAGH! Good to see you too, Akamaru,\" Naruto giggled, wiping his face with a sleeve before ruffling the dog's big white head. The dog barked happily in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute or so, Kiba emerged from behind the tree, now clad in the new pair of pants that Naruto had gotten for him; they were zipped up, but considering his stomach was still somewhat swollen, he'd elected to leave them unbuttoned, at least until his gut digested some more. At the sight of Akamaru licking Naruto's face, Kiba smirked at the boy. \"Whatcha doin', Uzumaki? Tryin' ta steal my pal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked back. \"Nah, Akamaru was just sayin' hi; you can have him back, now.\" Woofing, and licking Naruto's face one last time, Akamaru trotted back to his dog-nin buddy. His eyes widened. <i>Hey, what happened to your pants? They're as good as new!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, petting the dog happily. \"That's 'cause they ARE new.\" He threw an appreciative look over at Naruto. \"Thank the bonehead, here; I spotted him some cash, and he got 'em for me.\" At this, the blonde giggled and folded his arms behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really?</i> Akamaru woofed, looking back at Naruto. <i>That was real nice of him.</i> He turned back to his little buddy. <i>When did he get here, anyway?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, walking around Akamaru to face his blonde friend. \"I'll tell ya later, boy...\" His eyes gleamed, and he smirked. \"...just as soon as I kick this moron's ass!\" Dropping to all fours, Kiba began rushing at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing uproariously, Naruto hopped backwards; regressed or no, they were still ninja, and had the jumping abilities to prove it. \"I'd like to see you try, dog-breath!\" Upon landing, Naruto turned and raced off through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"Oh, no way in hell you're gettin' away that easy, Naruto!\" Getting back to his feet, he raced off after Naruto. Akamaru, woofing happily, followed behind him. Soon, the laughter of two young boys and the happy barking of a dog filled the park as the three ran about, chased each other, and play-fought, having a blast as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

That the best ya can do?\" called out Naruto cockily as he avoided a flurry of sparring blows from an equally cocky grinning Kiba, before Naruto jumped back, creating some distance between the two; enough for him to stick his tongue out playfully at the young dog-nin.  \"See?  Told'ja I had tons of energy to spare today.  All that eating suck your energy away, smartass?\"  remarked Naruto, folding his arms with a grin across his face, more than ready and awaiting for Kiba to make the next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Kiba grinned mischievously at Naruto's remarked and feigned defeat as he kicked the grass beneath him.  \"Ah shucks!  You're just too fast for me today, Uzumaki!  I guess I outta just admit defeat while I-now, Akamaru!!\"  A flash of the last time the two had decided to play in the park played in Naruto mind, and immediately, the boy recalled when the big dog got involved and decided to topple over him, damn near crushing him on the spot!  Immediately, Naruto turned and stepped back, expecting Akamaru to flank his side.  But to his surprise, there was nothing to his side.  However, as soon as he took his eyes off of Kiba, a sudden rustling caught his ear, and immediately he turned back to where the boy was standing, eyes now wider than saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kiba lept from all fours and pounced at Naruto, causing the two boys to topple and roll on the grass while Akamaru continued to bark happily and follow not too far behind.  The two continued to roll down, sparring each other the entire way as they rolled down a slight incline before landing back down to the level plain with Kiba on top, pinning down Naruto in what he perceived to be victory.  Catching their breath, the two youths laughed heartily as Naruto struggled and noted, \"Heh, good one, dog-boy!  But lets see you top THIS!\"  With all the excitement of their play-fight, Kiba had forgotten all about Naruto's newfound secret weapon; the feather!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, the boy fluttered it at a portion of Kiba's skin now exposed from his hoodie being ruffled up from their roughhousing.  Immediately, the boy lost his grip just enough for Naruto to break free as Kiba laughed ticklishly, still trying to swat the feather away.  \"HeehahahaHEY!  No FAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\" was all Kiba could mutter in his current state, when suddenly Akamaru capitalized and seized the feather from Naruto unexpectedly with his mouth and trotted away.  Before Naruto could try and take it back, Kiba immediately lounged back at the boy, pinning him down yet again. \"Ha!  Gotta resort to cheating, eh?  Well, two can play that game!\"  Kiba then turned to his canine companion and held out his hand.  \"Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog barked happily as he trotted over to Kiba and placed the feather from his mouth to Kiba's hand.  Naruto's eyes widened.  \"Oh crap...\" was all he could get out as Kiba started flickering the boy in the face with it, causing to laugh uncontrollably while trying to escape.  Eventually, he managed to break Kiba's grip and tackle him from the ground, until he ended up on top, only for Kiba to retaliate in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack and forth, back and forth, the two were a pair of evenly matched young ninjas, each one landing one move while the other retaliated in kind, until both boys gave in and dropped onto their backs.  Panting heavily.  As they did, Akamaru loomed over the two and grinned mischievously to himself before leaning down towards the boys.  Knowing full well what was coming, however exhausted; the two rolled away just in time before Akamaru could come crashing down atop them, leaving all three on the ground, breathing heavily.  A few more moments of this passed, before the two young ninjas erupted into exhausted but hearty laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!  Ohhh man, that was a blast!\" said Naruto, as he wiped some sweat from his brow with his sleeve.  Kiba rested his hands atop his stomach and sighed heartily as he said, \"Ahhh, JUST what I needed!\" he said, feeling his stomach having shrunken an ample amount.  To the point where his hoodie concealed it completely, and there was only a barely noticeable bump beneath hoodie.  He looked back at Akamaru; whose tummy had also shrunken a great amount from all his running and jumping around to keep up with the boys, an smiled, scratching the dog's tummy wearily, causing the dog to stick his tongue to the side of his mouth and kick his hind leg happily.  Naruto and Kiba couldn't help but giggle at the scene.  \"Man, we outta do that more often as long as we're like this!\" Naruto exclaimed.  \"That was more fun than anything in training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded in agreement and was about to reply, when suddenly a loud rumbling filled the air.  He looked around curiously to find the source, only to see Naruto blushing as he rested his arms atop his roaring tummy.  \"Heh, guess whoopin' ass works up an appetite,\" Naruto said, chuckling sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his head.  Kiba raised an eyebrow and was about to reply yet again, when an even louder roaring emanating from his own stomach shut him down, earning an equally sheepish chuckle of embarrassment from the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess 'next time' is coming sooner than we thought, eh Bone-head?\" Kiba noted, rubbing his hungry tummy eagerly.  Hearing that, Akamaru's ears drooped to his sides.  But before he could protest, sure enough, his own slimmer tummy began to rumble hungrily as well.  Flushing beneath his fur, he sighed to himself, all but conceding against any notion of trying to make sure the two youths wouldn't end up overdoing it.  It was gonna happen, and Akamaru knew that, and he knew he'd likely end up going overboard himself.  So, rather than protest, he gave up and turned to his dog-nin friend and licked his face both playfully and to get his attention.  <i>Sooo.....what do you feel like eating, Kiba?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his face and giggling to himself, Kiba thought for a moment before he turned to Naruto, still catching his breath, and asked, \"Oi, ramen-for-brains, whadduya feel like eatin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head for a moment, Naruto thought, before grinning impishly and turning back to Kiba and Akamaru...</span></div></div>",

Kiba's eyes widened. \"Are those what I think they are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Naruto beamed, nodding eagerly. \"Two all-you-eat coupons to Ichiraku's!\" Akamaru whined, rolling his eyes skyward. He just <i>knew</i> how this was going to end....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning in return, Kiba took one of the slips of paper and examined it. \"Damn, all the ramen you can eat for one visit?\" Kiba read off the slip of paper. He turned his head toward Naruto, raising an eyebrow as he tucked it away into his pocket. \"How didja get your hands on these, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, pocketing the slip he was still holding. \"The old man gave them to me when we first got stuck like this, to sorta make things a little easier.\" His smile faded a bit. \"'Course, I wasn't really in the right sort of mood to take advantage of it, so I just stashed it away at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced a bit, recalling just how hard the initial days following their transformation had been. \"I don't blame ya...\" Something suddenly occurred to him. \"Wait a minute, we got used to being stuck like this just a couple weeks after it happened. Why didn't ya use it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his head. \"Uh, I guess, cause, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost it, didn't you.\" Kiba's deadpan statement was not a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" Naruto protested, jumping to his feet and pointing at Kiba. \"I couldn't help it! It was small, and there was a lot of stuff in my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause you haven't cleaned it in, like, a month or so?\" Kiba raised an eyebrow, folding his arms in the process. Akamaru thought about jumping in and pointing out that Kiba's own room was hardly the picture of neatness (as his mother had scolded him and his sister had calmly, but exasperatedly, brought to his attention), but he held his tongue; as much as he hated to admit it, it was always a bit amusing to watch these two go at it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so what?!\" Naruto spat back. \"I found it eventually, so what's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, pushing off his hands and climbing to his feet. \"Ah, come off it, Uzumaki; you should know by now I like to rib ya.\" At this, Naruto folded his arms and looked away, pouting and grumbling to himself. \"Hey, c'mon,\" Kiba prompted, throwing a friendly arm around Naruto's shoulders. \"Don't look so grumpy; you're about to stuff your face with your favorite ramen in the world, aren'tcha?\" He smirked, this time a bit more friendly. \"Lighten up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked back at Kiba's teasingly friendly expression, his face still in a pout.  \"I-I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, seeing that Naruto was starting to come around. \"Besides, didn't you say before they were getting new bowls in that are as big as the ones we had at that one restaurant? Ya know, the one where we ordered the entire dessert menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, unable to resist, cracked a smile. \"Y-yeah; they should be in by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering privately, Kiba went in for the finishing blow. \"Now, imagine ordering twenty, nah, thirty, heck, FORTY of those monsters and filling your gut to bursting...\" Kiba smirked. \"Sounds fun, don't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, now grinning like a dope, said nothing for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are we waiting around here for?\" Naruto ducked out from under Kiba's arms and began rushing away. \"We've got Ichiraku's to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru watched him go, the former smirking victoriously and the latter looking at Kiba with an expression containing something not unlike pride. <i>Wow, nice one, Kiba.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Eh, I just know how the dummy works.\" He moved in close to Akamaru; getting the cue, the big dog lowered himself, and the young dog-nin hopped onto Akamaru's back. Woofing, Akamaru rose back to his feet. <i>Ya ready, little buddy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, a determined look coming across his features. \"Always ready, pal; always ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Akamaru needed to hear; tensing his legs, he took off in the direction Naruto had run. As they picked up speed and the wind blew threw their hair/fur, Kiba grinned, pumped a fist in the air, and gave a joyful shout:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAHOO!\"</span></div></div>",

All the world was a blur in his frenzied full-throttle charge towards the stand.  Until he heard a four pronged prancing not too distantly, accompanied by, \"Move it or lose it, Uzumaki!\"  Turning, he saw Kiba riding Akamaru like a big white horse jetting from the distance and catching up to him in no time.  Not one to be showed up by anyone; least of all Kiba and a big dog, the young ninja grinned confidently and pushed himself onward as he ran as fast as his currently regressed little legs would take him.  Seeing that, Kiba grinned back and leaned towards Akamaru's ear and said, \"You know what to do, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoofing in acknowledgement, Akamaru pranced faster as the two raced as fast as they could, until both the trio noticed how dangerously close they were getting to the stand.  \"Oh...\" was all Kiba could mutter, anticipating yet another devastating wipeout.  To his surprise however, both Akamaru and Naruto noticed in time and skidded towards the end, as they decreased their rapidly accelerated speeds and came to an eventual stop.  Both Akamaru and Naruto panted heavily as Kiba leaped down from his big pals neck and ruffled his head in a congratulatory manner.  \"Hehe, man, nice job there, boy!\" exclaimed Kiba while Naruto, grinning and still panting for dear life, said, \"Heh...yeah...*pants*....nice job...*whew*...getting second place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kiba immediately snapped towards Naruto and raised an eyebrow as he exclaimed, \"Are you blind, dummy?  Akamaru and I just trail-blazed past you!\"  Naruto scowled, amidst catching his breath and said, \"First...*pants*...of all, you didn't trail-blaze past anyone....*phew*....Akamaru did!  Second of all, Akamaru ALMOST trail-blazed, before I went into maximum overdrive and made you both eat my dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got in each others faces and began their infamous back and forth arguing while Akamaru watched and rolled his eyes with a smirk.  <i>I wish I could contribute this to their regression...I really do...</i>  He continued watching and smirked to himself.  <i>Buuuuut at least it's funnier watching them do their back and forth as kids.</i>  He then looked up and remembered where they were, and immediately composed himself as he barked towards Kiba to get is attention while he was still having another obscure shouting match with Naruto.  <i>Ummm, Kiba?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up, and immediately, his scale retained a more nervous expression.  \"Oh, crap.\"  Catching Kiba retain his composure, Naruto turned curiously and immediately did the same as he saw Teuchi dumbfound as he watched the two go on and on.  \"Oi, old timer!  Heh...ehhhh h-how's it going?\"  Naruto asked, as a sheepish smile grew over his face.  Teuchi scratched the top of his head and added, \"I was just about to ask the two of you the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting himself in a more composed manner, Teuchi smirked and shook his head as he asked, \"So, what'll it, boys?

Naruto smiled and immediately hopped down from his stool to greet his friend.  \"Oh, hi, Shikamaru!  Long time!\"  Shikamaru smirked and said, \"Eh, not that long,\" he then looked past Naruto towards Kiba, who smiled a bit nervously, hoping his friend wouldn't notice his tummy still just slightly distended from his previous feasting.  \"Hey to you too.\" Shikamaru said with a faint smirk.  Kiba laughed, still uneasily, but nonetheless, hopped down from his seat to properly greet his ninja friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, where's Choji at?\" asked Kiba, noticing the absence of Shikamaru's best friend, to which Shikamaru shrugged lazily and shook his head, \"He's off stuffing his face somewhere.  Me?  I didn't really feel like eating, so I just went for a little walk and what have you.\"  Akamaru smirked to himself.  <i>A walk, eh?  I always figured something like that was way too much work for a lazy bum...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru tilted his head upward at the shack then back down at the two youths.  \"Ichiraku's, eh  I take it to mean you guys're doing a little better then?\"  he said, earning a curious glance from Naruto.  \"Err, well yeah, but how do ya figure?\"  Shikamaru sighed and said, \"Cause the only time I ever see you two eat together is when you're both stuffing your faces beyond reason,\" he then shrugged and added, \"...and you tend not to do that unless you're chipper.\"  Despite themselves, the two laughed sheepishly as Kiba said, \"Guess ya got us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That figures,\" Shikamaru murmured under his breath.  He then turned to Akamaru and added, \"Well, least you're here to help these guys get around after they overdo it...yet again...\"  Akamaru's face flushed red beneath his fur as he chuckled sheepishly.  Kiba just grinned happily and added, \"Actually, Akamaru's gonna be diggin' in with us!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ehhh hehe...what can I say...?  If you can't beat 'em...join 'em, right...?</i>  Akamaru mused, a mixture of embarrassment and submission to the futility of trying to protest the inevitable stuffing fest to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then grinned a bit mischievously as he turned his attention to Shikamaru and said, \"Well, if you're soooo worried about how we're gonna get around when we're done with the many many jumbo bowls we're gonna put away...you COULD stick around and keep an eye on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching this, Kiba grinned himself and shrugged innocently as he added, \"Yeah, you said it yourself, it's not like you have anything ELSE going on right about now, right?\"  Akamaru was unable to suppress some snickering as he saw Shikamaru rub his temples in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Ugh, this is gonna be a drag...</i> Shikamaru thought to himself, as he turned to the boys and; after mumbling some more annoyances, finally said, \"...It'd be irresponsible of me to just leave you guys on your own in this state...and after you're all immobilized...so fine, I'll...keep an eye on you guys...for now at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru couldn't help but sigh with some relief, knowing he wouldn't bare the burden of helping the boys get by all on his own.

Lowering his arms, he smiled and smacked his chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shifted a bit, lifting his massive head and letting out a great yawn of his own. &lt;i&gt;Mornin', Kiba...&lt;/i&gt; the dog woofed groggily, smacking his own chops. Smiling at the sound of his pal's voice, Kiba rested back against the dog, resting his palms on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile quickly became a frown as he felt some more. His bed felt...odd. Rather than a flat, somewhat soft surface, he felt multiple soft, firm points pressing against his palms. It almost felt like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shooting open, he looked down and noticed that, yes, he and Akamaru were sitting on the ground and fairly tall grasses. \"Wh-what the hell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon feeling a pleasant breeze against his face, he looked up...and gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving only half-registered Kiba's shock and sudden silence, Akamaru lifted his head up further, blearily blinking his eyes open. &lt;i&gt;Kiba, what're you...&lt;/i&gt; As soon as he laid eyes on his surroundings, however, all his tiredness fell away, and his expression mirrored that of his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than Kiba's bedroom, where they had fallen fast asleep after getting back from a strenuous mission-Kiba changing from his usual black jumpsuit and net shirt to a pair of old pants and an equally battered red shirt with several slash marks across them-, they now found themselves in the middle of what appeared to be a thick, lush forest. Trees reached high into the sky, their tops bursting with foliage, lush grass surrounded them, and flowers poked out of the ground at intermittent points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was the first to break the silence. \"Where...where the hell are we...?\" Cautiously, he got to his feet, further examining his surroundings. Following suit, Akamaru got to his own paws, joining his partner in ogling his surroundings. &lt;i&gt;Is...is this a dream...?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Realest damn dream I've ever had,\" Kiba murmured, not taking his eyes from his surroundings. As he continued staring, he brought his hand up to his mouth and bit down with his sharp, Inuzuka teeth. \"Ow!\" He exclaimed, jerking his hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whimpered, glancing at Kiba. &lt;i&gt;Yyyyeah, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this ISN'T a dream. A Genjutsu maybe, but...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded slightly, but something told him that this was no illusion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm checking this place out,\" he murmured, heading off into the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped the dog out of his reverie. &lt;i&gt;W-wait a sec, Kiba!&lt;/i&gt; he barked, hurrying after him. &lt;i&gt;We don't even know where we are! There could be literally ANYTHING waiting out there!&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked quickly, Kiba grinned at Akamaru. \"Hey, nothing I can't handle with my best buddy at my side,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Akamaru couldn't help but wag his tail. &lt;i&gt;Maybe, but like I said, we don't know if this is a Genjutsu or something; don't just go charging off.&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba mock-sighed. \"Alright, fine...\" He winked at the dog. \"If I decide to go charging off, I'll let you know, so you can be right beside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined a bit, though he couldn't help but wag his tail again; though Kiba's tone was jovial, it was also 100% serious. Of course it was; they were best buddies, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued wandering through the forest, marveling at the sights, and at just how...&lt;i&gt;vibrant&lt;/i&gt; everything looked. In spite of this, they both remained vigilant; for all they knew, this could be some elaborate trap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, they continued walking, alternatively taking in the sights and remaining on guard, until, finally, they emerged from the trees into a large, spacious clearing. The clearing was surrounded on all sides by more trees-an open space in the middle of an ocean of forest. That wasn't what caught their attention, though; what caught their attention was what was IN the clearing. Specifically, it was...</span></div></div>",

A MASSIVE slab of tenderloin steak, lathered in rich sauce, crumbled, caramelized onions, black crushed peppers, and accompanied by a huge slab of gravy soaked mashed potatoes, with those same caramelized onions crumbled on top with cheese melting right into the suds.  The steaming plate was accompanied by a large pitcher of cola, and a side loaf of freshly baked garlic bread.  Kiba and Akamaru could do little more than gape at the beyond appetizing sight before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, something is DEFINITELY up here...\" murmured Kiba as he cautiously approached the table with an equally cautious Akamaru.  The dog-nin and nin-dog both occasionally glanced back up at the trees, trying to check in case there were enemy ninjas waiting to pounce on what looked like a highly elaborate...yet kind of obvious trap...if it was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What are you doing, Kiba?</i> asked Akamaru as the teen approached the steak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer, Kiba sniffed sternly at the dish, the bread, and the beverage.  Due to his keen sense of smell, he of all people would be able to detect any irregularities, were substances implemented in anything set before them now.  This continued for a few moments more, Kiba sniffing and Akamaru waiting to see what the verdict was.  To Akamaru's surprise, Kiba's stern expression eased into one of even more confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?  What's wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it, boy, nothing...there's nothing odd about the steak, the bread or the drink at all...\" answered the teen.  And much to his and Akamaru's surprise, his mouth watered slightly at the sheer tenderness of the spread.  Shaking that off, the two looked around some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, obviously, someone's messing with us, because you don't just find this kind of stuff lying out in the open forest like this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, could be a distraction or something.  Wait til I start eating and gettin' REALLY into it, then jump me...well, sorry to disappoint whoever's out there, but I ain't no bonehead, so whatever they're plannin' ain't gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Kiba could finish, an especially LOUD rumble emitted from the young mans' abdomen.  Face reddening notably, Kiba's eyes widened as he glanced down at his stomach and rested a palm against it as it rumbled HUNGRILY again.  Some moments passed before the teen slowly turned his gaze towards the table behind him.  And almost immediately, Akamaru's ears drooped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba, you aren't SERIOUSLY thinking what you're thinking, are you...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kiba rubbed the back of his head and said, \"W-well, I know it ain't POISONOUS, and, well...it DOES look really freakin' good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Someone cooked a fresh, and MASSIVE steak and just left it out in the middle of nowhere.  You don't think that's...a LITTLE weird...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, of COURSE it is!  But, I mean, no use lettin' it all go to waste, right?  'Sides, ain't like I can't stop to kick the ass of whoever might try to get the jump on me, right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe so, but-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And besides, you know I forgot to eat...last time we were conscious.  I ain't gonna be at my best if I'm starvin', right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the dog immediately rolled his eyes and shook his head.  Before he could protest further, Kiba had pulled the seat out and set himself before the table, still glancing around him, waiting for someone or something to strike.  Taking a whiff again, Kiba couldn't help but salivate at the glorious scent of beef, and immediately cut himself a piece, lathered in sauce, peppers and the crumbled onions.  Slowly, he brought it to his mouth while Akamaru watched fearfully.  Then, after popping it in, the boy chewed slowly and cautiously, then his eyes widened.  Akamaru whined with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, it was poisonous, wasn't-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-And before Akamaru could finish, Kiba immediately cut himself another piece and chomped onto it voraciously, practically beaming at the sheer flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!  This tastes...this tastes...HOLY CRAP!\" was all Kiba could get out before digging more into his steak.  Akamaru just sat there, exoression deadpanned and flat as Kiba continued tearing into his steak with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Fantastic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stands watch, still glancing around in case this was still an elaborate rouse.  Kiba, meanwhile, tears into his steak with swift speed, savoring the raw flavor of beef...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even as Akamaru kept watch on the surrounding woods, he couldn't help but flick his eyes back to Kiba every now and again. The dog-nin was tearing voraciously into his unexpected meal, alternating bites of meat and mashed potatoes with bites right off the loaf of bread and long swigs of the cola. If the expression on his face was any indication, the tastes were indescribable....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed, even as he turned his attention back to the woods. <i>Even if he didn't smell anything off, I still don't think it's a good idea for him to be eating like that in a place like this.</i> True, eating WOULD help give him the energy he needed on the off chance this WAS a trap of some sort...but if he became too stuffed, that'd make him an easy target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's been spending too much time competing with Naruto,</i> the dog-nin decided, thinking of the blonde ninja. He was a strong shinobi, a worthy rival, and a good friend, but his and Kiba's personalities seemed to feed off one another, and their already competitive natures appeared to be amplified in the meantime....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed again; he'd have to find some way to break it to Kiba that stuffing himself in a place like this wouldn't exactly be the best---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's ears perked as he heard something coming from the woods. <i>What the...?</i> He strained his ears. Nothing for a few moments, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There!</i> A bush, right by the edge of the woods. A small part of it shook a bit, then went still again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru growled. <i>I knew it! It WAS a trap!</i> Acting almost entirely on instinct, Akamaru took off toward the disturbance. In response to this, whoever was hiding in the bushes darted out, rushing into the woods. In response, Akamaru gave chase, pursuing the intruder into the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran deeper into the forest and waved around and between the trees, he took note of his target: specifically, that it appeared quadrupedal, like he was, and, though the foliage made it hard to make out details, very, very small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't mean much, though; for all he knew, it could have been an enemy ninja disguising themselves, or a trained ninja animal like himself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he continued chasing the small figure, who, he noted, ran with a surprising speed. Still, he thought, with a measure of pride, he was much larger, and, from the glimpses he was able to catch of his quarry, much better-muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it wasn't long before the figure apparently stumbled...and at the speed it was going, that was enough to send it tumbling along at a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru smirked a doggy smirk, quickening his pace. <i>Gotcha.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure continued tumbling, eventually coming to stop against a bush. Grinning, Akamaru dug his paws into the ground, coming to a stop before the figure. <i>Alright, talk!</i> he barked loudly, turning his head down towards the figure. <i>Who the hell are you, and why were you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden whimpering cut through his demands, and Akamaru, despite himself, snapped his muzzle shut. <i>What the...? That sounded almost like....</i> Shaking his head, he peered down at his quarry, and this time, REALLY looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a very young pup, about as old as Akamaru had been when he'd first been given to Kiba. He was staring up at Akamaru, whimpering and shivering. Only one of his ears was erect; the other one was flopped over his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru winced. <i>Ah, geez, it's only a pup,</i> he thought, with no small measure of guilt. <i>Probably just heard Kiba eating and came to watch...wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling himself that he MUST be seeing things, he took a closer look at the pup. The pup had black fur all over his top, with white fur on the bottom starting from the middle of his muzzle, and yellow eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery familiar yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shook his head. <i>No, it can't be, that's ridiculous...</i> he began telling himself, but then stopped. He and Kiba had fallen asleep in his bed, woken up in this strange (though beautiful) place, found a huge steak meal set out seemingly for Kiba's benefit...ever moment since they had woken up had been sheer ridiculousness. Besides, he was a ninja dog; weirdness and strange situations were kind of his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, taking a breath, he asked, <i>Kid? What's your, erm, name?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup jolted a bit. \"Wh-what?\" he asked, somewhat fearfully...and in human language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru winced. He was speaking human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-your name,</i> Akamaru managed, <i>What's your name?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup gulped. \"M-my name...?\" He glanced around nervously, before returning his attention to the big dog before him. \"Kuromaru...m-my name's Kuromaru...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stared at the pup for a few moments longer, not sure in the slightest what to make of this. The pup spoke human, and he had the same coloring, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuromaru was stern. Kuromaru was intimidating. Kuromaru could be a hardass, especially when it came to training. But, above all else, Kuromaru was not the cutest little cinnamon roll he had ever seen in his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shook his head. <i>Wait, WHAT?</i> He continued shaking his head; where had THAT thought come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mister? A-are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stopped at this. <i>E-eh?</i> Composing himself, he looked down at the pup, who had his head tilted to the side. Thankfully, he appeared less scared and more confused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-yeah, I'm OK,</i> Akamaru assured the pup. After calming himself down a bit, he once again focused on the pup. <i>Al-alright, I'm just gonna ask you a couple questions....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this an interrogation?\" the pup suddenly spoke up. \"C-cause if it is, I really don't know anything; I just got a partner....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked. <i>N-no, this isn't an interrogation; I just wanna know a few things.</i> He took a breath. <i>O-OK, first, your partner...what's their name?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pup perked up, his tail wagging. \"Oh, that's easy! Tsume Inuzuka, of Konoha's Inuzuka clan!\" He puffed his chest out adorably. \"She's gonna be the clan head someday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stared at the pup for a moment. <i>O-OK, next question,</i> Akamaru continued, partially to fend off the sense of <i>weirdness</i> that was emanating from the whole damn situation. <i>H-how old is Tsume?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuromaru wagged his tail. \"She just got into the academy!\" He exclaimed, happy that he was doing so well with the grown-up dog's questions. \"It's a place where people learn how to be ninjas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh-huh,</i> Akamaru nodded slowly. <i>OK, one more; I don't know if you know this, but the village's Hokage...which one is he?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kuromaru's expression brightened. \"Oh, that's an easy one!\" he exclaimed. \"He's the Third Hokage! He's super nice and super smart, and he gives me treats sometimes!\" Before Akamaru could react to this, Kuromaru piped up. \"My turn! What's your name, Mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>M-mine...?</i> Akamaru replied faintly. <i>M-my name's Akamaru...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuromaru's eyes lit up. \"Ooh! You have \"maru\" at the end of your name? Are you an Inuzuka dog too, 'cause I've never seen you before...are you living in another village, and have you ever been to Konoha, and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru jolted back, taken off-guard by the questions. <i>Er...well, I live in Konoha,</i> he began slowly, carefully choosing his words, <i>but my partner and I have...errr... beeen away from the village for a while on a super-secret mission, and we haven't been back in a while....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuromaru's erect ear perked up. \"Oh, so THAT'S why we haven't met!\" he exclaimed, hopping to his paws. \"Well, pleased to meetcha, Mister Akamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru twitched slightly; being called 'Mister' by Kuromaru was the LAST thing he'd ever expected to happen. <i>N-nice to meet you too, Kuromaru...b-but what were you doing here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy!\" Kuromaru exclaimed happily. \"Well, I went to sleep with Tsume after a day of training, and then I woke up here!\" His smile faded a bit, and his ears drooped slightly. \"Sh-she wasn't here, and I couldn't smell her...but it's all so pretty! I-I couldn't help wandering around, looking at everything...and-and then I smelled something SUPER yummy, and I saw this human who looked like he was from our clan eating a GINORMOUS steak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Akamaru chuckled a bit. <i>That'd be my partner, Kiba. He's got a bit of an appetite...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pup started hopping up and down. \"Ooh! Can I go meet him? Pretty please? Ever since I woke up, I haven't had anyone to play with....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru thought about this. On one hand, Kiba might freak out upon seeing Cute Little Cinnamon Roll...Kuromaru...but on the other hand, this could all be a really, really elaborate Genjutsu, and it might not matter...and besides, who knew? Kiba seeing Kuromaru as a cute little puppy might help him feel a little less terrified of his adult self...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure, we can go see him,</i> Akamaru replied, wagging his tail in spite of himself. <i>I'm sure he'd like to meet you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Kuromaru exclaimed, his tail and rump wagging happily. He stopped suddenly, and he smiled sheepishly. \"But, er...can I ride on your head? I, erm, kinda got tired form the running...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Akamaru lowered himself to the ground. <i>S-sure thing, kid....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, Kuromaru ran up to Akamaru and jumped on his head, turning around so he faced the front before flopping down and sprawling out. Slowly, Akamaru got to his paws, and turned back to where he'd come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kuromaru's a puppy, and he's riding on my head,</i> Akamaru murmured. <i>I must be in the Twilight Zone...whatever that is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, he began trotting off towards the clearing, Kuromaru resting on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the clearing....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u2026Akamaru could see Kiba leaning back in his chair, hands rested firmly against his midsection, which a fairly decent sized chunk of the massive steak consumed\u2026and an AMPLE amount to still needing to be consumed.  His normally trim and flat stomach was currently pressing out against his red, slashed up t-shirt.  To anyone else, it would appear as though he was dreadfully full.  Akamaru, however, knew much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I see you\u2019ve made some progress, huh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba responded by burping forcefully then sighing and smacking his lips moments later.  Akamaru simply blinked dully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026I\u2019ll take that as a \u2018yes\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound, however, earned a giggle from the pup currently riding atop Akamaru\u2019s head, causing Kiba to blink in slight confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi, Akamaru, is that, <i>y-</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off when he saw the little pup riding atop Akamaru\u2019s head, giggling with amusement as Akamaru chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, you may not have noticed, but apparently, we had a little company\u2026and I DO mean \u2018little\u2019\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded as he glanced down at the beaming pup.  He couldn\u2019t put his finger on it.  Something about this happy little pup seemed familiar.  But before he could inquire, the pup adjusted himself to make himself comfortable atop Akamaru\u2019s head, causing one of his ears to flop over his eye.  In that moment, Kiba\u2019s eyes immediately went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Akamaru, is this, who I think it is\u2026?\u201d the teen asked in shock, to which, Akamaru nodded ever so slightly.  His response, however, contradicted the nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why, Kiba, I think you might have this pup confused for somebody else.  How about you introduce yourself, kid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuromaru nodded then beamed happy at Kiba, tail and rump wagging happily as he answered.  \u201cHiya!  My name is Kuromaru!  Nice to meetcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked in confusion before turning his gaze back down to Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aren\u2019t you gonna introduce yourself?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, right, erm, hey there.  I\u2019m Kiba,\u201d the teen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!  Akamaru told me you were his partner, and that you two were on some super secret mission!  Sounds super exciting!\u201d Kuromaru remarked merrily.  Earning a nod from Kiba, still keeping his gaze set on Akamaru with an eyebrow cocked.  The large dog just shrugged his shoulders slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh huh, super secret mission sounds about right\u2026\u201d replied Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup, meanwhile, turned his attention to that massive steak still being worked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!  Mister Akamaru wasn\u2019t kidding,\u201d Kuromaru began, tail and rump once again wagging anew, \u201cya really DO have an appetite, Mister Kiba!  Are you actually gonna finish this whole thing all by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his immense confusion, Kiba turned back to the steak and rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-heh, well, that\u2019s the plan, kiddo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoooooooow, that\u2019s super cool!  I mean, lookit how big y\u2019er tummy got already!  I bet it\u2019ll be the size of a HOUSE by the time you\u2019re done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba\u2019s face reddened a bit at that, but he was mainly just taken back by the pup who appeared to be the notorious hardass he\u2019d come to know and fear for years\u2026using the word \u2018tummy\u2019 in a sentence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Honestly, the whole thing was just surreal.  But it was clear he couldn\u2019t get answers so long as Kuromaru was around.  To which, Akamaru was made aware of through reading his partners\u2019 facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Say, kid, umm, you mind giving Kiba\u2019n I a few minutes?  Super secret mission stuff\u2026confidential, you know how it is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Sure, Mister Akamaru!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo saying, Kiba lowered his head to the grass, giving Kuromaru a chance to hop off, and go scampering off, playing in the grass merrily, which, much to Akamaru\u2019s surprise, caused his chest to hitch a bit.  Kiba, on the other hand, was too taken back to appreciate how cute the little pup was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Okay, I need to know, am I going insane?  Or is the big bad Kuromaru\u2026a freakin\u2019 <i>puppy</i>\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unless we\u2019re both going insane, that is exactly what is going on.  And his body doesn\u2019t seem to be the only thing regressed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhadduya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right now, his memories are as they were during the time of The Third Hokage.  He genuinely thinks it\u2019s around the time your mom graduated from the academy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026You\u2019re kidding me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wish I were.  Kiba, I have no idea how or why this happened to him, or what the Hell is going on, but it\u2019s very, VERY important that we don\u2019t freak him out with the truth.  Whatever is going on with him, we just\u2026need to play along with until he\u2019s back to normal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if he DOESN\u2019T go back to normal though\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked back at the puppy playing and rolling around in the grass from afar.  For a SPLIT second, the prospect of the normally scary and imposing dog staying an adorable puppy didn\u2019t exactly seem like the worst thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And that second lasted for another little while, but nonetheless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We\u2019ll figure something out.  Don\u2019t worry.  But for now, you and I are just\u2026members of the Inuzuka clan, you\u2019ve never met Tsume, and we\u2019ve been on a top secret mission.  Sound good?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just nodded before turning back to the pup, and smirking slightly despite himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Heh, gotta admit, Kuromaru was a pretty damn adorable puppy, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026Yyyyyyyep.  And get this, he\u2019s hoping you can play with him at some point.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage ninja snorted in surprise to that, but nonetheless, nodded before calling out to Kuromaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, lil guy, you\u2019re clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerking up, the pup scampered back to the duo, tail and rump wagging as merrily as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?  Ya gonna go back to trying to finish that ginormous steak, Mister Kiba?\u201d the puppy inquired, earning a chuckle from the teen before glancing back at the steak and pondering for a moment before answering\u2026</span></div></div>",

Rising from a pile of broken crates he'd just recently been thrown into; young fire mage Natsu Dragneel, smirking and breathing heavily from exhaustion as he wiped a bit of blood from his mouth.  \"You kidding, Frosty?  I'm just getting warmed up...\" said Natsu as fire pulsed through his fists.  With two simultaneous battle-cries, both mages charged at one another, exchanging blow for blow, with neither one showing any signs of slowing down anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping his fist into a ball of ice, Gray drove it straight into Natsu's stomach, knocking the wind out of him as he stumbled back, clutching his abdomen in pain.  Smirking, Gray stepped towards the winded Natsu, seemingly victorious.  \"Ready to give up now, Natsu?\" asked Gray.  No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, an open mouthed grin grew over the fire mage's face, catching Gray's attention.  \"Two words, Snowball....Fire Floor...\" said Natsu as smoke began to emit from the floor beneath Gray.  Wide eyed, Gray slowly glanced down, but before he could act, a torrent of fire roared from the floor beneath him, consuming him in a massive ball of flame for a few seconds before Natsu ended his attack, leaving Gray standing in the same position, smoldering, charred, and flabbergast.  \"Whadduya say we just call it a draw...?\" asked Natsu.<br>\r\n\"..........deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing from the smoke, Gray wiped some of the char from his sore body and looked down to see Natsu still a bit winded, then offered his hand to help him up.  Looking up, Natsu smirked wearily and took his rival-friend's hand as he pulled him up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud rumble emitted within the Guild's training room.  Blushing, Natsu grinned innocently as the source of the loud noise was revealed to be to his six pack laden stomach.  \"Ehhh heheh...guess whooping your butt kind of worked up an appetite,\" said Natsu, causing Gray to glare back furiously and say, \"Whooping <i>my butt</i>?!  I was kicking your ass left and right!  The only reason we tied was cause you pulled that cheapshot on me like-\" before Gray could rant further, a similar rumbling emitted from his own bare stomach, causing him to blush with embarrassment as Natsu laughed and nudged Gray on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, save it for next time, Ice-Brain.  For now, let's get some grub!\"<br>\r\n\"Works for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two head over to the kitchen, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both boys headed towards the kitchen.  Natsu investigated the pantries while Gray kept watch and made sure no one else was coming.  \"C'mon, some time today, Natsu!\" rushed Gray as he continued to nervously keep watch.  Natsu simply brushed him off as he checked for what was good and what could stay uneaten.  In his search, a wonderful aroma caught Natsu by surprise.  Sniffing towards the source of the scent, he discovered a large cauldron of noodles, and next to it, two trays of assorted tempura with two glasses of what smelled like fruit juice next to them, almost perfectly assembled for two certain hungry young mages.  Glaring wide eyed and mouth watering, Natsu; in an almost trance-like state, signaled for Gray to head over.  As he did, Gray too, found himself almost mesmerized by the wonderfully cooked feast waiting to happen.  \"Ohhh man, do you know how long it's been since I had tempura...?\" asked Gray to no one in particular.  Meanwhile Natsu, still oogly eyed at the lovely meal beset before him, simply shrugged as he took a tray and took a big whiff of the battered shrimp, moaning with delight as the delightful scent wafted through his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh yeah, now that's a meal fit for a champ...\" said Natsu as he rubbed his rumbling stomach with anticipation.  \"Champ's don't tie with other champs, idiot,\" responded Gray.  Too hungry to care, Natsu simply took his tray aside, then scooped himself a bowl of noodles, and immediately began chowing down.  Gray did the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a large chomp out of a piece of tempura, Natsu chewed vigorously and moaned with delight before gulping down the shrimp.  \"Mmmm!  That might be the best tempura I've ever eaten!\" said Natsu as he immediately continued to stuff his face with more shrimp.  Much to his surprise, Gray found himself shoveling bits and bits of tempura down his throat like clockwork, chewing and gulping down multiple pieces at once, he sighed with relief and gave his toned bare stomach a hearty pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Natsu had downed a good majority of his tempura, leaving only a few as he gulped down a large quantity from his throat down to his gullet.  Upon doing so, Natsu felt a great amount of pressure rise from his stomach as he clutched his abdomen in slight discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Pyro-lips?\" asked a half serious Gray as he began to gulp down noodles.  Natsu simply shook his head as he clutched onto his abs firmly.  His painful moaning suggested perhaps he wasn't feeling so hot.  This attitude soon changed as a loud rumble emitted from within Natsu's gut, and with a few hard thumps to his chest, Natsu was able to push out a void and lengthy belch, whch carried on for close to seven seconds before Natsu had to take a breath.  Gray rolled his eyes as Natsu sighed with sweet relief and gave his belly a hearty pat.  Much to Natsu's surprise, his meal thus far had taken quite a tole on his sculpture perfect physique.  His lower stomach, while still firm and muscle laden, had began to bulge outward by few inches.  Prodding at his gut, Natsu glared wide eye then smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....it would appear as though I'm also kicking your ass at eating too,\" he said with a blatant coyness that only Gray would get annoyed by...which he was.<br>\r\n\"Oh what?!  Now you think you can down more than me?!\" barked Gray.  <br>\r\nNatsu grinned toothily and said, \"Hey, nothing to be ashamed of, Not-So-Fullbuster.  Some people can just stomach more than others.\"  He said with a smirk as he slapped his belly for emphasis and began to get back to work on his meal.  Furious, Gray began to down his meal at a quicker rate than before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both boys were now stuffing their faces at rapid paces.  \" *SLUUURRRRP* Feel free to *munch* give up whenever you're ready to *GULP* admit that I'm number one, snow-boy!\" taunted Natsu between bite after bite of his large meal.  Gray did his best to block out his obnoxious rival with the sound of consumption.  \"Uh huh, *CRUNCH!* and you can *GULP* feel free to kiss my ass, dragon-breath!\" responded Gray as he took another mouthful of Tempura and gulped it down immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither one showed any signs of slowing down as they continued scarfing down their large meal at record paces.  Meanwhile, both their bellies continued to slowly bloat outward with every mouthful of food gulped down.  Natsu's stomach stuck outward by a few inches, creating a noticeable bulge from his unbuttoned vest, while Gray's stomach had only just begun to bloat up, creating just the slightest of bulges in his abs.  After several moments of consumption, Gray had to stop for a moment and rest his hand on his strained abdomen, rubbing it up and down as he winced with moderate discomfort.  \"Awwww, does the abominable snowmage have a tummy ache?\" asked Natsu sarcastically as he helped himself to another piece of tempura.  \"Yeah, you keep it up, flame boy, it's just gonna make me beating you taste all that much sweeter\u2026\" responded Gray as he swallowed down his discomfort and went back to stuffing his face against Natsu.  Little by little, both their six pack laden stomachs continued to swell up.  Natsu continued to taunt Gray at every opportunity between bites of food, or slurps of ramen, but Gray did his best to block Natsu's obnoxiousness out, and kept trying his hardest to keep up, swallowing beyond his fill again and again.  However, as he glanced down, his gradually expanding stomach began to gurgle violently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to feel the strain, Gray slowed down, resting one hand on his bloated stomach, rubbing it firmly in an effort to ease his pain while Natsu continued to scarf his face like no tomorrow.  Burping queasily, Gray moaned in pain as he began to look and feel a bit nauseous, but Natsu paid no heed to his rivals suffering, only packing away as much of it into his gullet as he possibly could.  \"Ugh, *hic* screw it, you *urrrrp* win, Dragon-Breath\u2026\" said a stuffed Gray, barely stifling another wet burp with his fist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even after Gray had just admitted defeat, Natsu still continued to scarf down what remained on his plate.  Gray looked flabbergast, albeit still very stuffed.  \"Natsu\u2026you won, why are you still eating?\"  asked Gray, to which Natsu; after taking a hearty gulp of his meal, replied, \"Because there's still food on my plate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray's jaw almost dropped from his skull, before he blurted out, \"How the HELL can you still be eating?!?!\"  Natsu greedily slurped up the remains of his ramen bowl, and sighed heartily with a smile on his face afterward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, y'know one of the beauties of being a fire mage, Gray?  I'm always fired up in just the right places!\" responded Natsu, before rubbing his noticeably bloated but still muscle bound belly for emphasis.  \"Thanks to all the fire I got stored up in the ol' tank, I can digest and burn these goodies off way quicker, which makes stuffing it all that more enjoyable.  I can eat til I'm about to burst, but in a few hours, I'll be right as rain!   Unfortunately, you and your frosty digestive system proooooobably can't say the same, can ya?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh screw off\u2026\" responded Gray.  <br>\r\n\"Now, if you'll excuse me\u2026.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu once again turned his attention to what remained of his and now Gray's unfinished meal, and with a lick of the lips, once again, went to town.  Fed up, Gray took his leave, one hand still rested on his bloated stomach, leaving Natsu to greedily consume everything on the table.  But after some time had passed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu groaned in pain after unleashing a rather loud belch as he massaged his painfully bloated midsection.  Hearing the loud eruption of noise, Gray returned to the kitchen; his stomach slightly less bloated, and found Natsu sprawled on the floor, clutching his bloated belly in pain.  After such a lengthy gorging, Natsu's belly had bloated outward by close to eight inches, sticking outward like a tiny beach ball.  Seeing this; Gray smirked cockily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, something wrong?  Does the big bad dragon breather have a tummy ache?\" taunted Gray, enjoying Natsu's comeuppance before he continued with, \"but I thought your fire guts would'a burned up all that food by now, what's the hold up?\"  But Natsu gave no response, instead his stomach gave one for him by gurgling in a vicious manner, causing Natsu to grit in sheer agony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gray stopped smirking, and a look of slight concern grew over his face.  \"\u2026H-hey, you okay, lava brain?\"<br>\r\n\"Rgh, do I look okay, dumbs?\" responded Natsu with an undercurrent of great pain in his voice.  \"Ugh, I dunno what's wrong with my stomach, it usually digests by now.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you usually eat THAT much?\"<br>\r\n\"\u2026.N-not really\u2026.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if you hadn't been such an arrogant prick; stuffing your stupid face even after I admitted defeat, you wouldn't be in this mess.\"<br>\r\n\"Y'know, SHOCKINGLY, that's not really all that helpful right now, you jackass\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Gray pondered for a solution\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly a light bulb lit up in Gray's head, followed by a disgruntled sigh as he approached the obnoxious fire mage.  \"Okay, I think I know how to solve your dilemma, buuuuuut it's gonna be a little weird,\" said Gray as he looked away a bit nervously.  \"Weird how?\" asked Natsu, between bouts of pain surging from his stuffed stomach.  His answer came when Gray placed his right palm atop Natsu's bare bloated stomach.  His eyes widened with surprise as he immediately slapped Gray's hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop being such a baby.  Lucy showed me this little trick.  Whenever Happy overdoes it on the fish, she gives him a little belly rub and he's right as rain.\"<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT A FLYING CAT, YOU DOLT!\"<br>\r\n\"No, you're a hot headed doofus who doesn't know when to quit.  Now do you want my help or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence grew over the two, until another painful rumble emitted from Natsu's stomach, causing him to wince in pain, then, after a reluctant pause, eventually nodded to Gray.  \"Just so we're clear, you say one word about this to anyone, and I will light your ass on fire for the rest of the week!\"  Warned Natsu, causing Gray simply to roll his eyes as he once again placed his right palm flat atop Natsu's distended stomach.  Natsu jerked slightly.  \"Jeez, forgot how icy your hands are....\"<br>\r\n\"Any second you wanna stop talking is fine by me,\" responded Gray as he began to gently rub Natsu's stomach in a slow circular motion, feeling his painfully distended abs, hard as stone from the amount of content currently just sitting within the Dragonslayer's belly.  Gray couldn't help but admire the sheer size of Natsu's stomach given it was only one; albeit massive, meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, guess you really put in your work, didn't you, Natsu?\"  No response.  \"Natsu?\"  Gray took his focus from Natsu's bloated gut and towards Natsu himself, and much to his surprise, Natsy appeared to be smiling, almost as if he were in a state of transcendence and relaxation.  \"Enjoying yourself?\" asked Gray.<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't know what to say, but, this actually feels pretty nice...\" responded Natsu.  Not at all what Gray was expecting the Fire Mage to say.  \"Do me a favor though, could you try a little higher?  That's where my stomach's really been killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Gray moved up to a tender place atop Natsu's stomach and slowly stroked away.  Natsu moaned with relief.  \"Ohhh yeah, there's the spot.  Please, don't stop, man...\"  Complying, Gray kept at it, until he felt Natsu's abs tense up.  \"Something wrong?\" asked Gray.  Natsu didn't respond, instead a large bulge rose from his throat and up towards his cheeks, until Natsu opened his mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bbbBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut came a wet, fiery belch.  Along with it, came a mild sprout of flames, followed by smoke.  Natsu sighed with relief as both he and Gray couldn't help but laugh.  \"Whew, wonder where that came from,\" asked Natsu as he smacked his lips.  Gray simply gave Natsu's gut a light pat and continued kneading at his slightly less bloated belly.  \"Well, like you always say, you got a fire in your belly, and it's gotta come out <i>somehow</i>, right?\" asked Gray as he rubbed.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I didn't eat any fire.  Just Tempura and noodles.\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares, do you at least feel any better?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, well, my belly still feels like a sandbag, but...yeah, a little actually....\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, maybe it's just a fiery case of indigestion.  Eating so much at once made your stomach work overtime, and now, it's storing up too much extra pressure.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, then let's push it out,\" Natsu said with a smirk, signalling towards his stomach for emphasis.  Gray shook his head but complied, continuing to rub at the tender spots in Natsu's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait!  I feel a big one coming!  Here, when I point to you, push down on my belly as hard as you can.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell no!  You're gonna burn the entire Guild to the ground, dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it agreed, Natsu's stomach quivered, forcing him to moan once again moan in pain.  Sighing angrily, Gray simply shrugged and clutched onto Natsu's abs once again.  Smiling, Natsu took a big gulp of air, forcing his tummy to push outward a little more.  He then pointed to Gray who reluctantly pressed down on Natsu's belly as hard as he could.  What exploded from Natsu's mouth was loud enough to be heard from well outside the FT Guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu burped loud and furiously for a good six seconds straight, which came with a considerable bout of smoke in the process.  Normally, Natsu's lack of manners disgusted Gray.  But this time, he couldn't help but find it, almost <i>attractive.</i>  \"Okay, even I have to admit, that was a pretty good one.\" said Gray.<br>\r\nSighing heartily, Natsu goes limp then turns to Gray.  \"Man, I've *URP* NEVER burped THAT loudly before!\" laughed Natsu.  Gray simply smirked as he continued to work out some of leftover gas festering in Natsu's belly.  \"I dunno how else to put it, but you know to work a fire out of a guy's belly.\"  Natsu paused, looking away, unable to say what he wanted to say, so finally he compromised by muttering a small \"thank you,\" under his breath.  Catching it, Gray too; looked away, trying not to blush, so he responded by saying, \"Just glad I could help...\" started Gray, trying to think of the right thing to say before following with, \"maybe now you'll stop whining like a little girl.\"  He patted Natsu's still pretty expanded middle for emphasis.  \"Oh ha ha ha.  Very *brruuup* funny.\" responded Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally all 'burped out,' Natsu rose from his seat, no longer in pain, and said, \"Well, I dunno about you, but I'm about to ready to call it a day.  PLUS...\" Natsu started, \"if we're still here by the time the others come back, we're dead...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA sudden look of dread grew over both boys as Gray realized Natsu was dead right.  Immediately, both fled the scene of the crime...</span></div></div>",

Whatever you say, crybaby...\"<br>\r\n\"CRYBABY?!

Natsu continued mumbling angrily before using what little fire he had left in him to melt the ice and catch up with Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time both had reached the town, they were groggy and half conscious, but the sight of the local \"All-you-can-eat\" place re-energized young Natsu as he jetted inside, practically drooling at the sight and smell of the meals to be.  Gray simply followed, almost too embarrassed to be seen directly with Natsu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were eventually seated, and immediately, both boys dig into their plates like ravenous jackals to fresh meat; particularly Natsu, who utilized the \"All-You-Can-Eat\" aspect to the buffet and had a series of several plates stacked before him ready to be devoured while Gray worked on a hearty helping of Steak.  \"Mmm, *GULP!* it all taste so freakin' good!\" noted Natsu between bites.  Finally, after swallowing a heaping mouthful, Natsu sighed then wasted no time in moving onto his next venture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, having just finishing his Steak, Gray sighed with content and leaned in his chair while Natsu raised a curious eyebrow.  \"Ummmm...what the hell is that?\" asked Natsu.<br>\r\n\"What the hell is what?\" responded Gray, only for Natsu to point at his one empty plate.<br>\r\n\"THAT.  We're *MUNCH* in a buffet and all your stomach can handle is *GULLLP* ONE PLATE of steak?!  I thought you said you were hungry!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, not EVERYONE goes out of their way to stuff themselves stupid, Smokey.  Then again, you tend to do a LOT of things stupid, don'tcha...?\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft, so not only can I outfight you, but I can out-eat too, hehe.  Man, it's gotta be rough for an icy little fella like you living under such a fiery badass shadow like mine,\" condescended Natsu as he continued to stuff his face.  Gritting his teeth angrily, Gray stood up; shirt randomly missing again, despite them being in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRST OF ALL, YOU DIDN'T BEAT ME!  SECONDLY-\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Gray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Gray immediately realized he'd somehow ended up in his boxers again, and quickly dressed up, before regaining composure and getting back in Natsu's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secondly, I can out-eat you with my mouth wired shut, dragon breath.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a challenge to me.\"<br>\r\n\"You're damn right it is!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, okay, eating contest it is.  Whoever can put away the most plates wins.\"<br>\r\n\"And whoever puts away the least, pays for BOTH meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu's face went white for a moment.

Both Natsu and Gray had stuffed their second plates with various meats and noodles then sat back at their table, glaring deeply at each other as they scarfed down their food.  *SLLUUUUURRP*  \"Y'know, these noodles, *GULP* aren't half bad,\" Natsu said, as he couldn't help but appreciate such a fine taste.  Slurping down his own noodles, Gray raised an eyebrow and nodded with agreement.  \"Yeah, this part of town's known for great noodles, I think,\" Gray started, \"I'll be sure to stock up after we finish up here.  Maybe I'll use the jewels I saved not having to pay for my meal here.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, in your friggin' dreams!\" replied Natsu as he grabbed his lamb shank and chomped a huge chunk of beef from the bone like a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour and several plates later, both Natsu and Gray were still going at it, albeit sluggishly.  Natsu's stomach had distended slightly, creating a small but noticeable bulge in his muscle bound belly.  Gray fared no better.  Once again spontaneously shirtless, his exposed stomach had also bloated outward to an equally sized bulge which he rubbed tenderly, feeling a tad full.  Natsu on the other hand, continued putting away his next plate with great fiery determination as he scarfed down fried chicken wings one wing at a time, until finally, his plate had become nothing but a massive pile of chicken bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in his chair, Natsu burped loudly and patted his belly happily.  \"Ahhh, it's been a while since I've eaten this good.  How about you, Mr. WayTooFullbuster?\" asked Natsu tauntingly.   Gray rubbed his slightly swollen stomach tenderly as he glared back at Natsu and said, \"You can trash talk all you want, but I'm not throwing in the bib just yet...\"  Smirking, Natsu rose from his seat and pointed Gray to the buffet table.  \"Then by all means, after you,\" he said with a cocky grin on his face.  Admittedly, Gray was feeling a bit full, but he wasn't about to lose to Natsu.  So he rose from his seat and joined Natsu as the two packed their next plates with various sushi rolls and seafood such as King Crab legs, Fried Shrimp Tempura, and smoked Salmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down, both the young mages once again proceeded to stuff themselves.  Gray cracked open the Crab Leg shell and immediately began sucking down the meat inside.  Natsu followed suit, only he dug it out with a fork and dipped it in sauce before scarfing it down.  Natsu then started stuffing the shrimp into his mouth and swallowing them down in comically huge mouthfuls.  Both their middles continued to expand in accordance with the amount of food they continued to stuff down their gullets. \"Okay, I'll be the first to admit, I didn't think you'd last this long,\" Natsu started, \"but it isn't gonna be enough, man.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what, if you admit defeat now, I'll only make you pay half.\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft, nice try, Snow Cone, but you're not getting off the hook that easily.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, don't say I didn't warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their taunting became tired and strained as both were now trying their best not to show the other just how full they really were.  All the while, both boys continued stuffing their faces, occasionally stopping to massage their ever expanding stomachs.  This carried on for quite a while, but ultimately, one would outlast the other.  And that somebody was...</span></div></div>",

He tried his best to keep up, but the more he ate, the more his ballooned belly began to quiver with fullness, until finally, the stuffed feeling was simply too much.  \"...Ugh....okay....okay....no more...\" mumbled an overly stuffed Gray as he slumped back in his chair and clutched his distended belly, groaning in pain.  Grinning, Natsu stuffed the remaining meats on his plate into his mouth and gulped it all down in one comically large mouthful, before giving Gray a victorious, toothy grin.  \"BOO-YA!  What did I tell ya, huh?!  Don't mess with the champ!\" gloated Natsu as he sat back in his chair, secretly relieved that he barely managed to out-eat Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscle bound belly had bloated outward past his open vest, appearing as though he'd swallowed a basketball.  It churned almost as violently as Gray's distended tummy, causing Natsu to wince and rub it in a massaging manner.  \"You can go ahead and pay the bill now, I'll be outside,\" winked Natsu as he chuckled to himself and hoisted himself and his distended gut from the table and slowly exited the buffet.  Gray sighed and grabbed his Jewel Bag, dumping enough Jewels to cover both himself and Natsu, before rolling his eyes and exiting the buffet to join the Fire Mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the two...</span></div></div>",

After it had ended, Natsu sighed with relief and gave a toothy grin.  \"Ahhh, the sound of victory...don'tcha just love it?\" he said, thumping his chest and let out a smaller flame free burp.  He then tenderly rubbed his bloated belly with a smile across his face.  Natsu always overdid it when it came to food, but never this much.  And doing it, feeling how much his stomach had taken in felt satisfying and almost, sensational.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to live up to your nickname, Dragon Breath,\" said Gray as he waved the air around him, causing Natsu to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Awww, is Frosty still upset because his little tummy couldn't handle a man's meal?\" said Natsu in a sarcastic cutesy voice as he poked Gray's slightly deflated stomach tauntingly.  \"Oh please, you BARELY beat me, and that was only because I didn't want to overdo it like a certain fiery dumbass,\" responded Gray as he gestured towards Natsu's still relatively bloated middle, though as little as Gray wanted to admit it, like Natsu; feeling as immensely full as he did, felt really good to him as well.  Smirking, Natsu slapped his belly firmly and said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep telling yourself that, Gray.  Face it, no matter what you do, I'll always be better at it then you.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n\"For the millionth and a half time, yes.  Why?  You wanna make something of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two went at it again, they chanced across a rather famous steakhouse, known for the 72 oz Steak Challenge.  Few of which had ever been completely consumed by anyone.  \"Put your money where your mouth is then.  The 72oz Steak Challenge.  Double or nothing.  Whoever can't finish pays for the others meals for a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu raised his eyebrow, rather tempted by the idea of free food for a whole week.  But 72 ounces of Steak when his stomach was already so full was going to be tricky.  On the other hand, that meant it would be tricky for Gray too...</span></div></div>",

Finally, two silver platters were placed before the young men.  The overwhelming surplus of beef caught both boys off guard as they immediately dropped their gaze and dropped their jaws in unison at the sheer size of their upcoming endeavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Natsu regained his composure, and with a toothy grin, said to Gray, \"Oh, for the record, I'm gonna want my ramen extra spicy this week.\"<br>\r\n\"Yup, keep on letting that hot air out, bozo.  You're gonna need as much room as you can if you're gonna try and beat me this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they were off.  Both mages immediately tore into their steak, chewing on heaping mouthfuls of beef and gulping it right on down before moving onto their next bites.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how full he had already felt, Natsu was still able to savor the smoky flavor of his juicy steak before gulping it down heartily.  \"Mmmm, remind me to get seconds after we're done here,\" moaned Natsu as he patted his already swollen belly happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, *GULLLP*, you'll have plenty left over for a doggie back when I'm done with you, pinky,\" taunted Gray between large gulps.  His overly full stomach was still pretty packed from their previously challenge, and had slowly begun to swell back up to a more than noticeable bulge.  It groaned in protest, causing Gray to once again wince in pain, but this time, he would not be dissuaded.  And so, the two ate.  And ate.  And ate.  And ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every mouthful, their stuffed bellies would expand just ever so slightly.  Yet, the two would continue to wolf down their massive meal like it was their last.  Both were equally determined to beat the other, no matter how straining it would be...</span></div></div>",

Neither appeared as though they would quit, and the possibility that both may actually beat the unbeaten steak challenge seemed more and more possible with each chunk of steak the boys wolfed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Natsu and Gray had successfully put away more then half their steaks, and continued to keep on eating.  Their bare bellies; a true testament to their gluttonous conquest, had both ballooned out comically, as though they had swallowed oversized basketballs.  Yet, they just kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon gulping down his latest mouthful of meat, Natsu sighed heartily as he clutched his immensely swollen gut firmly.  His skin felt tight, strained from engulfing so much in such a short period of time.  Feeling a rush of air rising from his gut, Natsu clutched his belly firmly and let fly a painfully loud burp which carried on for a few seconds straight and brought forth a tiny stream of fire in the process, frightening and disgusting many patrons at the same time.  Smacking his lips, Natsu gave his gut a firm pat then smiled wide at Gray, who ignored Natsu's boorishness and continued eating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still call it quits, y'know.  There's no shame in losing to me, Gray.  Hell, you outta be used to it by now,\" taunted Natsu.  Gray was able to continue ignoring Natsu's taunting, but the more he ate, the harder it became to ignore the searing pain emanating from his midsection.  It groaned audibly, causing Gray immense discomfort as he stopped eating and leaned back in his chair, clutching his gut in pain with both hands.  Taking notice of this, Natsu had assumed the challenge was too much for Gray and continued to taunt him further.  \"D'awwww, is the baby tossing in his itty bitty bib?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry, Gray opened his mouth to respond and put Natsu in his place once and for all.  \"Rgh, Natsu, will you shut the hell u-*UUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR-RRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray's response was cut short by a thunderous belch which carried enough force to blow Natsu's hair back, and stretched for a near 10 seconds flat, stunning patrons and Natsu in the process.  As it finally came to an end, Gray exhaled with great relief and leaned back in his chair.  \"Oooooh man, that felt good....\" he said, giving his slightly less strained belly a hearty pat, in a very Natsu-esque fashion.  He then grinned back at Natsu and proceeded to continue eating his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Natsu was taken back.  He hadn't seen this side of Gray before, and he almost had to admire it.  After a moment, Natsu collected himself and got back into eating more beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this wasn't going to be as one sided as he initially thought.  It was anyone's game at this point...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As more time went on, both Natsu and Gray were nearing the end.  Their pace had slowed down a considerable amount, their stomachs, stuffed and bloated beyond all logical comprehension.  Both would occasionally stop to massage their aching, medicine-ball sized bellies, or let out the over indulgent belch here or there to relieve as much excess pressure from their stomachs as possible.  Then they would get back to their meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray seemed to be struggling a bit more then Natsu with these final bites as his immensely bloated stomach gurgled viciously with each bite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu; on the other hand, was nearing the finish line of the challenge.  Taking the final chunk of steak, he stared groggily at it for a moment, then tossed it right in his maw, chewing a bit longer then usual, before taking one final, hearty gulp, and sending it straight down.  Slumping back to his chair, Natsu sighed weakly whilst rest both his hands atop his stupendously bloated middle.  Suddenly the restaurant owner stormed towards the table and held Natsu's arm up.  \"AND WE HAVE A WINNER!  Congratulations, young man!  You've successfully done the impossible and eaten the largest steak anyone in the city has ever or will ever eat!  How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to respond, Natsu brought his fist to his mouth and suppressed a loud burp, causing smoke to emanate from his mouth.  \"I feel like I just swallowed a cow...\" groaned Natsu as he rubbed his swollen gut tenderly.  As he did, he took notice to Gray, who clutched his own gut with one hand and began to sweat, struggling immensely to finish.  Normally, Natsu would have chalked this as yet another victory over Gray, but not this time.  For some reason, he actually wanted to see the Ice Mage succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Ugh, I give up....you win AGAIN....\"<br>\r\n\"The hell I do!  You're almost there!\"<br>\r\n\"Wha..?\"<br>\r\n\"You've come this far, right?  And you've only got a few bites left, so suck it up and eat that meat before I kick your ass right back to Erza for being a little quitting cry-baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray was stumped.  He was unsure if Natsu was trying to encourage him or if he was threatening him, but either way, it was enough to encourage him not to quit just yet.  And so, he ate on, with his bloated stomach protesting all the way.  Finally, after slugging through most of the steak, he came to the final bite.  Both Natsu and teh crowd were cheering Gray on to finish up.  The mere sight of this last piece of steak before his eyes was enough to cause his gorge to rise, but he mustered through it and took that final hearty bite, then successfully gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Gray leaned back, utterly exhausted and stuffed to his gills as he rubbed his gurgling gut with both hands.  Natsu simply smirked at the boy and let him have this moment.  The owner approached Gray and said, \"Good heavens!  TWO winners in one night?!  Somebody check the windows for flying pigs!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu immediately glanced out the restaurant windows and looked up at the clouds.  In unison, Gray, the owner and the crowd simply stared in awe at this kid's stupidity.  \"Nope, nothing but clouds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anyway, congratulations to you as well, son!  How's it feel to be the champ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Very, very, *URRP*...filling...\" was all Gray could muster as he attempted to calm his aching middle.  \"Well, I hope you'll save room down the road, because as you all know, anyone who beat the Steakhouse Challenge earns themselves a month of free meals whenever they stop by!  Because anyone who can put away that much meat deserves a free meal every now and then, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a victory and a definite bonus, the mere thought of food made both boys cover their mouths in effort to keep from losing their very bountiful lunch, causing the owner to laugh.  \"Anyway, congrats to the two'uh you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, both boys hauled themselves out of the restaurant and sluggishy headed towards the Guild, still rubbing their stuffed stomachs.  After a moment, Natsu finally broke the ice and said, \"Guess we'll call our bet a tie then?\"<br>\r\n\"Guess so,\" responded Gray.  \"Tell em something though.  You could've won.  So why'd you help me out back there?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, you'd come so far, it would've been a waste not to see it through, y'know?\"<br>\r\n\"...Well, thanks for that, man...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued walking, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Natsu?  A thought just occurred....\"<br>\r\n\"That's a first.\"<br>\r\n\"Har har.  But seriously, we look like we just swallowed elephants...don'tcha think Erza and the others might be a little pissed that we weren't on missions because we were too busy stuffing ourselves raw?\"<br>\r\n\"....Ehhhh, I could see Erza or Lucy being annoyed with that....or Gajeel pissed that we didn't invite him...\"<br>\r\n\"Then what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu pondered for a moment....</span></div></div>",

Natsu rolled his eyes and cleared a spot in the living room for Gray while he promptly plopped down on the couch.  \"Yeah, yeah...I'm seriously too damn full to think of any comebacks, okay...?\" responded Natsu as he rested one hand atop his bloated gut.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, tell me about it...\" responded Gray as he unbuttoned his pants, allowing his ridiculously swollen belly to push out even further while he rubbed it with both hands to make it ache less.  \"In all my life, I have never been this full before....\"<br>\r\n\"Think this might be a first for me too, actually...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't buy that for a second.  You and Happy are always stuffing yourselves.  Speaking of which, where is Happy, anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Probably off with Lucy.  Dunno if he'll be coming by after the mission's over or not.  But whatever...and I can't help it, man.  When you've got fire festering in your belly, it's harder to stay full.  But at least I won't look like a sumo wrestler by tomorrow thanks to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden grumbling caught Natsu's ear.  He turned towards the source and saw Gray once again clutching his belly in pain.  \"Awww, someone's still got a tummy ache?\" said Natsu in a mock cutesy voice.<br>\r\n\"Shut it,\" responded Gray, still wincing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu chuckled then hoisted himself from the couch, almost stumbling under his stomach's extra weight.  \"Ugh, should probably keep movement to a minimum,\" he said to himself as he clutched his bloated middle in pain.  He then headed towards the kitchen.  \"Here, want something to drink?  That always helps me whenever I get indigestion.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu came back with two canned beverages and tossed one Gray's way, almost clocking him in the forehead.  \"Nice throw, idiot...\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, my bad...\" responded Natsu as he scratched the back of his head a bit embarrassed.  \"What is this stuff, anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Got it from Super Express Restaurant, pretty tasty stuff actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys popped their cans open.  Natsu began chugging away.  Gray sipped first.  A torrent of bubbly flavor washed down his throat as he raised his eyebrows in pleasant surprise, then began to chug away as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments, both Gray and Natsu had finished chugging their beverages.  Natsu smacked his lips in satisfaction, crinkled up his can and tossed it amongst the already frightening pile of clutter around them.  Gray shrugged and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel any better?\" asked Natsu.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually.  A lot better!\" responded Gray.  However, downing his beverage so quickly caused a large air bubble to rise from the depths of his belly and up his throat, forcing its' way out of Gray's mouth in the form of a loud *BBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRP!!!*  Covering his mouth, Gray sheepishly muttered an apologetic \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse this, *BBBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP!!!*\" Natsu clutched his swollen gut and forced out a room shaking belch which carried on longer and louder than Gray's burp.  When it ended, Natsu sighed in satisfaction and patted his belly happily.  \"It's just us, Fullbuster.  You don't need to be afraid of cutting loose around here.  Got it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case...*HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!*\" Gray pushed out an even longer burp than his previous eruption, then smiled with relief.  \"Ohhh man, that felt good...\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, nice one, dude.  But I feel a BIG one coming up...\" warned Natsu as he rubbed his belly in anticipation.  Finally, he opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*urp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray bust out laughing.  \"That's IT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUU UUPP!!!!*  A thunderously loud and lengthy belch exploded from the Fire Mage's mouth and shook the very room in which the boys sat in, lasting close to seven seconds straight.  When it ended, the two sat in silence for a moment, before they had both burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange to think about.  In all Natsu's interactions with Gray, he'd always struck him as some stuck up jerk, while Gray had always seen Natsu as something of an egotistical moron, yet, here they were, staying the night over together, shooting the briefs, and having a good old fashion burping contest of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe neither were as bad as the other had once thought...</span></div></div>",

It was just a little friendly competition bewteen Frosty and yours truly.\"<br>\r\n\"...We were supposed to be on job this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu froze with fear, much to Gray's amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh?   Yeah, remember?  Big rampaging Wind Mage?  500,000 jewels?  Well, since you weren't around, the job went to Gajeel and me and Happy got stuck trying to clean up the mess you made on our last job.  I thought maybe you were training with Gray before we headed out, but instead you guys spent the time seeing which one of you was a bigger glutton?!\"<br>\r\n\"No-no, it's not like that, Lucy!  We were training, but then we got hungry and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Natsu was eventually going to say something stupid, Gray decided to step in.  \"Actually, Lucy, we're training for another mission.\"<br>\r\n\"Another mission?\"  asked a skeptical Lucy.<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, another mission?\" whispered an uncertain Natsu.<br>\r\n\"Yup, uhhh regional eating contest!  Winner gets 750,000 jewels and crowned King Glutton,...errr something like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy didn't appear convinced, until much to hers, Natsu's and especially Gray's surprise, they noticed a pamphlet for a Guild Regional Eating Contest coming up, and sure enough, same rewards, same stipulations, same everything.  \"Huh...\" was all Gray could respond with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in THAT case, c'mere you!\" said Lucy as she grabbed Natsu by the ear and pulled him towards the exit.  Natsu whined and cried aloud the whole way.  \"Ouch!  OW!  Hey!  E-easy!  W-where are we going?!\"<br>\r\n\"To my apartment.  We've got some training to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu's stomach groaned in protest as he glanced angrily at Gray who smirked mischievously at the young fire mage as he was being dragged back to an angry Lucy's apartment.</span></div></div>",

You're in for a treat!\" Before she ran off to the kitchen, cooking frantically. Natsu soon wondered whether his \"treat\" will be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu looked over to the kitchen entrance and saw various ingredients, utensils and such flying out in a comedic anime way. Soon enough, a fraying pan flew and hit him in the face. \"Hey Lucy, watch where you throw those things!\" Natsu yelled, with an \"Aye!\" heard from the nearby Happy, though the two heard no response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lucy yelled, \"Natsu! Get over here!\" Natsu then wandered into the kitchen, where he saw a large meal fit for a large family spread across the table. Natsu's jaw dropped as Lucy said, \"If you're going to win this competition, you'd better eat all of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu then complained, saying, \"I ate plenty already! I don't think I can eat anymore!\", patting his belly for emphasis. Lucy then yelled, \"You already took away the two-million jewel reward for that one book job! You're not taking this reward away too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, and much to Natsu and Happy's surprise, she stuffed a rice ball into his face, and with a puzzled look, he chewed it. He wasn't sure if he should like this, or if he should be afraid, as it wouldn't be long before he felt more than full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could complete that thought, however, Lucy stuffed a piece of fried chicken into his face, and he chewed it just like before. Soon enough, the two gained momentum, and Natsu was able to rub his own belly while Lucy stuffed him. That alleviated some pressure and allowed him to push further than he would normally be able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy held his mouth open, and pointed to it, and when Lucy noticed this, she yelled, \"In your dreams, cat!\" Either way, Happy then settled down and began to watch, fascinated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu's already bloated belly then began expanding outwards again, and it wasn't long before his belly was the size of a basketball. Thanks to his self belly rubs, however, his belly wasn't too overly stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, before he knew it, he had finished the table of food, and his belly was massive, and it stuck out quite a bit in front of him, sticking out quite a bit from his vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had a satisfied smile on her face, and Natsu looked completely dazed. She then told him, \"I knew you'd be able to finish it all! Now...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the still dazed Natsu could even comprehend what was happening, Lucy had another large platter of food placed before Natsu, whose face almost went pale upon the mere sight of it all.  \"...I think you can still handle some more,\" said Lucy as she grabbed a piece of fried chicken, ready to stuff it down Natsu's mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Lucy, I really don't think I can eat anymore...\" responded Natsu wearily as that look he gets whenever getting motion sick began to grow over his face.  <br>\r\n\"You think this is too much?  Just wait and see what you're up against at that competition.  If you can't handle an appetizer like this, then how do you expect to win?\" responded Lucy sharply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Natsu sighed, still cursing Gray in the back of his head for apparently being psychic and inadvertently trapping Natsu in a competition he had no idea existed.  After a moment, Natsu complied and opened his mouth begrudgingly as Lucy promptly stuffed the chicken down his mouth.  He chewed at a much slower rate, still far too full to go his usual rate, but he continued to massage his distended gut, in an effort to sate the sharp pain that was ailing the young fire mage.  After gulping down the chicken, Lucy grabbed a few pieces of tempura and shoved them right in Natsu's less than awaiting mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natsu tried to chew the multitude of tempura still in his mouth, Happy once again opened his mouth and gestured towards it eagerly at Lucy.  Rather than tell him off yet again, Lucy grabbed a rice ball and chucked it at Happy's face, causing him to fall flat on his back, with a rice ball square in the center of his jaws.  Though that probably hurt a bit, food is food, so Happy shrugged and gulped it down with gusto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down the tempura, Natsu tried to catch his breath, only to find yet another rice ball shoved down his mouth.  Rolling his eyes, he continued to massage his ever aching belly as he gulped down more and more.  The pressure was starting to become a little too much for the fire mage as his stomach continued to distend outward, to the point where his previous beachball sized balloon belly was starting to grow more like that of a medicine ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo before Lucy could stuff another piece of food into Natsu's mouth, he held his hand up for a moment and stopped her.  \"Why'd you stop?\" asked an impatient Lucy.  Natsu, still a little green in the gills, said, \"Ugh, one sec Lucy, but...I REEEAAALLY gotta burp.  Like, right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, Lucy scoffed and said, \"C'mon, be gross on your own time.  Right now, we gotta train.\"<br>\r\n\"I know that, but I'm dead serious.  I feel like if I don't get this gas outta my belly right this second, I may legitimately explode.\"  Raising an eyebrow, Lucy sighed then said, \"Fine.  Just get it outta your system so we can get back to work.\"  She then plugged her ears and walked out of the room for a moment, taking Lucy with her in case any fire came up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she did, Natsu smirked and glanced at the door to the outside.  Hoisting himself to his feet, Natsu attempted to sneak out and spare himself any more stuffing by Lucy's hand, but all that moving around, did in fact jostle the pent-up gas brewing within his stomach.  Before he could so much as take five steps past his seat, a massive belch forced itself out of Natsu's mouth, lasting several forceful seconds and shockingly no fire attached.  The sheer force of it caused Natsu to stumble back into his chair, and by the time it ended, Lucy and Happy returned to find Natsu sitting right back where he started, much to his dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, good one, Natsu!\" cheered Happy.  Natsu's face sweat dropped with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Lucy sighed and said, \"Feel better, you big baby?  Good.  Now, may we continue now?\"</span></div></div>",

Natsu merely ate anything that came to him. He may be beyond full, but Lucy did have a point about the training, and a chunk of the huge reward was quite appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours for Natsu, he had finished the plate, and was able to endure. His stomach was truly enormous, and it extended out to his knees, resting on his thighs like a boulder. The skin was taut and stretched, but surprisingly, there were no stretch marks, and it was perfectly smooth. He had eaten so much that his belly button popped outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy was quite distracted by it, and he playfully pawed at it, causing Natsu to turn green in the face. Lucy looked satisfied, and she said, \"Alright Natsu, get some rest! We're going to be doing even more training tomorrow!\" She looked at Natsu to guage his reaction, but he had already passed out on the chair. She got him a blanket, draped it over him, and went off to bed. Happy settled down on Natsu's wobbly belly, curled up, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was the first to wake up in the morning, and she went out to get more groceries. Luckily for her, the store was less than a block away, so she could simply walk there and back. She was back within the hour, and she found Natsu still asleep, snoring loudly. She then began cooking a massive breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, potatoes, and even homemade doughnuts made their way onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu woke up to the smell of the food, and he looked down to find that his stomach had gone down, but now instead of defined abdominal muscles, Natsu had a flat stomach. Upon careful inspection, it even looked like it may be sticking out a bit. Other than that, there were no noticeable changes yet. Either way, Natsu's stomach growled loudly, and Natsu said, \"Do you think that's going to be enough?\" Happy added an \"Aye!\" Lucy replied, saying, \"That's the Natsu I'm used to!\" before she went to finish a final plate that was piled high with omelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she struggled to find a place on the table for her last plate, Lucy said, \"Go ahead and dig in guys!\" This time around, Natsu was much more enthusiastic, so he didn't really need Lucy to stuff him anymore, though that was probably going to happen later. As he stuffed his maw greedily with scrambled eggs and sausage, Lucy said, \"Eat up! You need to train as much as possible. The contest is in only...\"</span></div></div>",

Which means I gotta get you into proper competition ready shape in just five short days!\"  Natsu simply shrugged as he continued stuffing his face with scrambled eggs.  Happy simply gnawed on one of Lucy's homemade donuts for a while.  Gulping down a mouthful of egg, Natsu sighed and said, \"Five days, huh?  Pfft, we'll be ready in no time!  Cause right now, I got a fire in my belly, and it's burning for as much as I can cram into my mouth!\"  With that, he took several pieces of sausage and laid them out near his eggs as he took his fork and stuck several pieces onto it with a bit of egg on top and immediately crammed it into his mouth.  Enjoying the mixed flavor of the two, Natsu almost mechanically began to shovel eggs and sausage into his maw in the same fashion, stuffing bigger mouthfuls into his jaws at once and gulping them down with gusto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, Natsu rubbed his stomach happily and with a smile, said, \"Damn, those were some great eggs, Lucy!  Honestly, had I known I'd be eating THIS good, I'd have done these eating contest things a long time ago!\"  He then grabbed a plate of bacon and began shoveling several at a time into his mouth like they were french fries.  Crumbs and bacon residue spewed from the sides of the fire mage's mouth as he munched down giant heaping mouthfuls of crunchy, crispy bacon.  Gulping it down heartily, he exhaled happily and proceeded to stuff more into his eager jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, Lucy had also noticed that Natsu's stomach had lost some of it's usually rock hard definition, and seemed...softer. with almost a slight angle to it, and with all the bacon he was consuming, it looked to be distending even more, albeit slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're making some progress.  Good thing you were already training with Gray before we got started, or it might've taken us a little longer,\" she said as she continued to cook up some more bacon, and began to pour batter for pancakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...yeah, uhhh, glad me'n Gray thought ahead...heh...\" muttered Natsu as he rubbed the back of his pink spiky hair sheepishly.  \"Oh, that reminds me!  Is Gray entering that contest too?\"<br>\r\n\"I-is he what now?\"<br>\r\n\"You guys were training for it before you came back to the Guild, and when you did, his belly looked almost as big as yours did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu grinned proudly upon being reminded that he was able to eat more than his rival Ice Mage, but quickly regained composure as he adjusted the collar on his vest a bit and said, \"Ummmm, y-yeah, I think he is too.  Why?\"  Pondering for a moment, Lucy said, \"Well, I was thinking maybe he could train with us too.\"<br>\r\n\"What?  Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Because that way, we have a bigger chance of winning if more of us are in the competition.  Besides, if I help him train, I can get him to agree to split the winnings with us three ways.  What do you think?  Should I get him on board with all of this too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu thought for a moment, glancing back as Happy continued to stuff his little face with another donut, then finally, he said...</span></div></div>",

I'll go get him!\" Natsu and Happy didn't respond, as they were already back to stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about ten minutes, Lucy was stomping back to the apartment, dragging Gray in by his ear.

Intrigued, she and the others headed on inside, where they were promptly greeted by the baker.  \"Hello, young lady!  What can I get you and your friends there?\"<br>\r\n\"Hi!  We saw outside that you're having a clearance sale?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes.  We're changing locations so everything's 75% off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Lucy's eyes immediately lit up as she quickly proceeded to run every which way and grab all her arms could carry from the shelves and everywhere else in between.  Meanwhile, Natsu looked around and saw another sign about an eating challenge.  \"There's an eating challenge going on?\" asked Naruto.  The baker laughed and said, \"Well, there would have been; I even just finished cooking all the platters for the challenge.  Unfortunately, both competitors were training beforehand, and I guess gave themselves bellyaches before they could compete.  Too many lightweights, young man.  At least it looks like you seem to appreciate a good meal here or there,\" he noted, pointing towards Natsu's bare stomach, which had deflated considerably since breakfast at Lucy's, but still had a hint of roundness forming where his abs used to reside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Natsu patted his stomach proudly.  \"That I do!  Definitely more than THIS lightweight!\"  He said with a toothy grin, pointing towards Gray, who glared back angrily and snapped back with, \"Laugh it up, you flaming moron!  We'll see whose laughing after I kick your ass at that regional eating contest!\"  Hearing this, the baker leaned in intrigued as the two were head to head as per usual and said, \"You mean that big eating contest taking place a few days from now?  Why wait then when you can settle your squabbles now?\"  Both mages turned to the baker curiously.  \"Afterall, I DID just finish baking all kinds of entrees for an eating contest two other guys weren't man enough to show up for.  Maybe you two are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring back at each other, the two grinned competitively.  Lucy and Happy returned with a comically massive pile of various baked goods, ready to pay, only to see no one in sight.  \"Happy, where is everyone?\"  she asked, struggling from the weight of everything she was carrying.  Happy looked around and saw Natsu and Gray at a table with an eating challenge sign at the front of it.  \"They're having an eating contest again.\"  The struggle was too much, immediately Lucy's pile collapsed on top of her and Happy.  Digging themselves out, Lucy glanced to see the two indeed about to have an eating contest and smirked as she said, \"Good.  Maybe a little competitive edge is just what those two idiots need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baker returned to the table carrying two platters, each one with five freshly baked apple pies on them each.  The sweet aroma filled the nostrils of all four residing in the bakery as he brought them down before Natsu and Gray respectively and said, \"The rules are simple: whoever can finish all their food the fastest wins.  The winner shall receive a weeks worth of baked goods on the house when we open in our new location tomorrow.\"  Hearing this immediately fired up both Natsu and Gray as they grabbed their forks and knives and immediately proceeded to ravenously dig into their pies.  The baker chuckled and said, \"Well...umm, begin?\" and stepped aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Natsu and Gray intently wolfed down big heaping forks full of pie crust and caramel sauce laden apple slices within the crust, taking big hearty mouthfuls, chewing down the pastry treat and gulping it down before immediately going back for more.  It only took the two a few minutes to completely demolish their first pies.  Within seconds, they were already sticking their forks into their second pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy and Happy watched with amazement as the two took big massive chunks of pie with their forks, sometimes big enough to be a tiny slice of pie itself and immediately open wide and stuff it right into their eager maws.  Much to her amusement, both continued to stare down intently as they occasionally glanced back at each other and exchanged a few choice insults, then resumed stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time their second pies had been reduced to crumbs...</span></div></div>",

Natsu's belly stuck out from his vest and over his lap, while Gray's had distended to the exact same point, to where he had to unbutton the bottom portion of his shirt just to keep it from tearing, exposing his belly button and a fair amount of distended skin above it in the process.  Both sat there for a moment, rubbing and massaging their bloated guts, occasionally burping to make some more room.  All the while, staring intently and competitively at one another.  Both had eaten and bloated to the same size, and neither was going to let the other take the lead without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Gray, wanna know the first thing I'm gonna eat here once I win that free weeks supply?\" taunted Natsu with a toothy grin.  Gray scoffed and said, \"Actually, I'm more curious about who you went up against that was such a lightweight that he couldn't even beat YOU?  Cause you sure as hell won't be winning squat today,\" responded Gray sharply.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two could go head to head again, the baker returned with several large pitchers of milk.  \"Nothing washes down a warm and doughy pastry like an old fashion pitcher of milk. Or a few,\" noted the baker jokingly as he stepped aside.  Immediately, both Natsu and Gray grabbed a pitcher each and began to chug away as intently as either one could chug anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued to chug in a seemingly endless pace, their stomachs continued to distend just ever so slightly with every few passing gulps.  By the time either one had stopped around the halfway point of their first pitchers for a breather...</span></div></div>",

Gray was trying to keep up, but soon he was an entire pitcher behind, despite the fact that he was essentially mimicking Natsu in how he drank milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't talk at all, as they were completely focused on the competition, but their glares at eat other were all the words they needed, and as one gained a bit of momentum, the other would push to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu still had the upper hand, though, and once he finished his milk, he went on to the final, and hardest, part of the competition, five loaves of bread. Natsu immediately grabbed a baguette, which was nearly four feet long, and he stuffed one end into his face, feeding it in continuously as his cheeks puffed out ridiculously in order to accommodate for all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Natsu was about a third of the way through his long baguette, Gray began on the first of his five loaves, a freshly-baked banana bread. He wanted to take care of the rich, sweet breads first. Forgetting any semblance of manners, Gray grabbed chunks of the banana bread and stuffed them in his face heartily. Soon enough, Natsu moved on to a loaf of classic white bread, one which was unlike anything he ever tasted, and not too long afterwards, Gray moved on to the pumpkin bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, their stomachs bloated further and further outwards, and they became heavier and heavier. Natsu's belly began to hang after his second loaf, and soon afterwards, Gray's followed suit. Soon enough, their bellies would both be resting on their thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up for Natsu was a massive, circular loaf of sourdough, with cross cuts in the top and everything. After that, Gray moved on to his loaf of sourdough. The two glared at each other, seeing that they were eating the same type of bread, but they didn't really care, as long as they were stuffing their face faster than the other, they were satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gray moved on to the leavened breads, he gained some momentum, and when Natsu moved on to the richer, sweeter breads, he began to slow down gradually, being overwhelmed by the heaviness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of heaviness, by this time, the bellies of the two were heavy enough to drag themselves down to the laps of their respective owners. From their, they continued outwards, consuming whatever space was left between them and the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two were on the last loaves of bread, and both of their bellies were now bisected by the table in front of them, and they both winced at the new pressure, but they both tried to hide it so that they show no weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at the end of the competition...</span></div></div>",

Natsu was doing his best to gulp it down, little by little, but no matter how much he tried, his belly would accept no more bread.  Gray struggled immensely, but slowly, he began to have some success, gulping down what remained of that final piece into his throat, until finally, after one of the thickest sounding gulps he'd ever had, he opened his mouth to show that there was indeed no bread left, and went practically limp in his chair as the baker approached him and called it.  \"And we have a winner!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning their attention back to the contest, Lucy and Happy were legitimately stunned when they saw the baker holding up a queasy looking Gray's arm up victoriously instead of Natsu's.  \"Whoa....Gray BEAT Natsu...?\" was all Happy could mutter, still in shock.  Lucy glanced over at Natsu who, despite his fullness, looked infuriated and shamed by his defeat.  Suddenly, a smile grew over her face.  Happy noticed this and asked, \"Why are you smiling?  The guy you need to win an eating contest just lost a pre-eating contest!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he lost.  But I know Natsu...\" Lucy responded as she folded her arms together and grinned, \"this is just the kinda motivation he needs to keep his training going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the baker turned to Gray and said, \"Congratulations, young man!  You've earned yourself all you can eat from our new establishment for a whole week!  How do ya feel?\"  Gray opened his mouth to respond, but a sudden and titantic belch erupted from him instead, causing him to blush as he covered his mouth.  But then he noticed Natsu's face and with a smirk, said, \"Like a winner.\"  Glancing back at a beaten Natsu, the baker turned to him and said, \"Don't feel too bad, kid.  You powered through like a champ til the very end.  And with some practice, I think you'll do dynamite at that eating competition five days from now.  Til then, pick out as much as you'd like from here today on the house.  You've earned it!\"  Hearing that softened the blow of defeat for Natsu and humbled him a bit as he turned to the banker, and smiled appreciatively.  \"Thanks,\" he said, still a bit woozy from the competition as well.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll give you two a moment to digest for a bit,\" said the baker before taking off.  Both Natsu and Gray's bellies pushed firmly against the table they were competing in, bloated to no absolute end.  The two simply sat there, caressing and massaging their bloated midsections, occasionally letting out monumentally loud and wet sounding belches back and forth, groaning in discomfort, and staring each other down despite the competition's end result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" started Gray as he massaged his vastly bloated gut, \"how'd it feel to get your ass kicked?\"  Scoffing as he folded his arms over his immense belly, Natsu turned away and said, \"Oh whatever.  I was kicking your ass that entire contest, but that damn sweet bread killed it for me...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, whatever you say, smoke-breath.  When are you gonna learn to not be such a sore loser?\"<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT A SORE LOSER, YOU OVERGROWN POPSICLE!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping in before the two bloated mages could go at it, Lucy interjected.  \"Easy, guys!  Easy.  Natsu, Gray beat you fair and square.  Accept it, and just do your best for next time.\"  Natsu pouted agitatedly, like that of a child, as Lucy turned to Gray and said, \"And Gray?  You don't have to rub it in Natsu's face, ESPECIALLY considering how seldom you've ever beaten him.\"  Hearing that, Natsu immediately lit up as he grinned smugly at the unamused ice mage.  <br>\r\n\"Anyway, rest up while you can, boys, cause your training isn't over for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, both young bloated mages shrank in their seats, mortified at the news of what Lucy had in store for them, causing their bellies to quiver in unison.  After Lucy had utilized Natsu's free \"all you can take,\" she had gathered enough baked goods to last the rest of the day, and after bidding the baker farewell, went along the daunting task of walking all the way home on their immensely bloated bellies...</span></div></div>",

There, Lucy and Happy distributed the comically large pile of baked goods, which were on the house today, throughout the house. Both Natsu and Gray rubbed their bellies tenderly, and they were actually focused more on that than on bickering at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a half hour, Lucy said, \"Alright guys, are you ready to eat more?\" Natsu was the first to yell, \"Lucy? We just ate?\". \"Yeah, don't you think we've had enough already?\" Gray said in agreement, surprising everyone there. When he said that, however, he was just in his boxers, which wasn't very surprising, and Lucy just sighed in an annoyed manner, not wanting to yell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said, \"Think about it, guys. Usually in an eating contest, the first part doesn't matter. Once the contestants get very full, however, the winners are usually the ones who keep going. If we work on endurance as well as speed, then we're bound to win!\" She didn't give the two much choice, however, as she stuffed cupcakes into both boys' mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Natsu smiled, then wolfed the cupcake down as he said, \"I guess you're right. Maybe frosty here can't handle it, but I'm up for testing my endurance. That fired Gray up, and he wolfed his cupcake down, saying, \"In you're dreams, hothead, I can beat you in an eating contest, and I can eat more than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that worked better than I thought.\" Lucy remarked as the two regained vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the two were beyond full, so they wouldn't last long. They stayed tied the entire way, and after only a few more baked goods, They were both at their limits, and they ate more slowly and laboriously.</span></div></div>",

Their movement was now sluggish and tired, and their guts had distended to the point where they now rested well beyond their laps.  Finally, after forcing himself to gulp down a mouthful of muffin, the young spiky haired mage turned to Lucy, almost looking a bit pale in the face and said, \"Lucy...we can't eat any more...\"  Folding her arms together, Lucy scoffed and said, \"C'mon, you guys said you wanted to work on building your endurance, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, y-yeah, but I mean, we can't-\" Natsu stuttered, both too full and too dense to respond properly.  Seeing this, Gray rolled his eyes and said, \"-We can't do it all at once.  Like anything, you need to build up with each passing day.  You can't just expect to work our endurance and stretch out our stomachs all in one fell swoop.  That's just gonna make us sick and perform even lousier in the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Lucy stopped for a moment, then ultimately nodded in agreement.  \"Okay, that makes sense, I guess.  I mean we DO still have a few days til the competition,\" responded Lucy as she put the rest of the baked goods and pastries away for the time being.  \"You two can stay here for the time being.  Just rest up, digest, do whatever.  But tomorrow, we're pushing on.  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Gray and Natsu nodded half scared, half sick while Lucy smirked at the two took her leave with Happy flying besides her with a whole donut sticking out of his maw.  But first, she stopped and said, \"Oh, and..good job today, boys.\"  Hearing this earned a weary but grateful smile from Natsu while Gray merely smirked, still massaging his achingly bloated belly with both hands.  \"Oh man, how do you do this more than once a year, Lava Brain?\" asked Gray before burping loudly. and groaning in discomfort.  \"Ugh...think something almost came up with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out an even louder burp, Natsu chuckled weakly and blew out some smoke in Gray's direction, causing him wave it out of his face in annoyance.  \"Real cute, dumbass,\" was all Gray could say, earning an innocent grin from the fire mage as he stroked his own bloated belly firmly yet gently and said, \"You wanna know the truth of it?  I just push on, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Push on?\"<br>\r\n\"Like, I eat and eat to the point where I get this major bellyache, but I don't let it stop me.  It's like whenever we're on mission and we're up against a really tough S.O.B.  Sure, they'll kick our ass again and again, and sure, it'll hurt like hell, and that pain may be too much for a lot of people, but not for us at Fairy Tail.  We take it all in and just keep on pushing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray had to scratch his head on that one.  For once, Natsu said something that made sense, as he opened his mouth, and after a moment of silence, simply said, \"Huh...good point.\"<br>\r\nGrinning mischievously, Natsu then turned to Gray and decided to add, \"Of course, luckily for me, that fire in my belly makes things digest a lot quicker than most.\"  Glancing back at Gray's distended gut, Natsu smirked and said, \"Hope you don't have ICE in your belly, or digestion's gonna SUCK.\"  <br>\r\n\"Funny.  Guess that's what happens when a dumbass tries to be a smartass...\" responded Gray, earning an angry glare from Natsu as he immediately rose from his sitting position and got in Gray's face as he shouted in his characteristically angry voice, \"WHO'RE YOU CALLIN' DUMBASS, SNOWFLAKE?!\"  All that sudden jostling and shifting caused Natsu's immensely bloated gut to gurgle violently as he went green and clutched his belly firmly with both hands, groaning in pain all the while.  Gray smiled victoriously.  \"That's what happens when you mouth off to m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry shifting had apparently worked up a gas pocket within Natsu's belly, causing him to let fly a lengthy belch right in Gray's face, carrying with it, a considerable torrent of fire, which set Gray's hair on fire, forcing him to immediately freeze the top of his head.  Natsu groaned in discomfort while Gray simply sighed in annoyance and muttered, \"Touch\u00e9...\"</span></div></div>",

His rounded belly rose and fell as he breathed, and Happy was curled up on top, sleeping silently. Gray couldn't help but chuckle to himself, and soon enough, he was sleeping silently as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy was counting the baked goods, taking inventory of everything that she got from the bakery. She then got a few boxes from when she moved in, and she sorted out the baked goods, with breads going into one box, cakes in another, so on and so forth. Either way, once she was finished, she took a couple of hours to study up on how to train for eating competitions, and then she looked for recipes for dinner to utilize some of the baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Natsu and Gray woke up to Lucy hitting a pot with a spoon, yelling, \"Natsu! Gray!

Still sore about losing again?\" asked Lucy, still focused on the baked goods in question.  Scoffing, Gray shook his head and said, \"I'm just tired of that gloating idiot somehow getting the jump on me at every freakin' turn!  Every time he wins ANYTHING, it goes straight to his head, and it's time someone took him down a peg or two!\"<br>\r\n\"How do you plan on doing that?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna challenge him to another eating contest tomorrow.  I'll make the stakes high enough so that he'll HAVE to accept.  And when he does?  I'll show him up once and for all!\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Gray.  History has a tendency to repeat itself.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I'm here.  I want you to help me the way you did with him.  He had an edge on me from the start cause he was training with you.  But now he's asleep, and by the time he wakes up, I wanna be ready for 'em.  Whadduya say?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a little late, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it, Lucy.  If you have two really skilled eaters instead of just one, then imagine how your odds'll fair when the REAL competition starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy considered the notion.  On one hand, Gray made a good point, but at the same time, if humiliation was driving Gray this far, then if she could help him humiliate a defeated Natsu, he'd push himself further than ever.  With a devilish grin, she turned to Gray and said, \"Have a seat.  I'll have the first few dishes for you ready in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she brought out a series of baked goods and some leftover roasted chicken for Gray to put away, but despite his vigor, he was still rather full from his earlier session and defeat against Natsu.  So Lucy decided to...</span></div></div>",

He took to several other wooden targets and angrily punched them to bits, one by one.  The others raised their eyebrows in concern, except Natsu, who simply watched disinterested.  Erza nudged to Natsu who glanced back and scoffed, still uninterested.  Erza then glared angrily at Natsu, who looked back at her, a bit more nervously, then with a roll of his eyes, approached the young Ice Mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu approached the still rapidly fierce Gray and said, \"You know, you've been training yourself to the bone these past few days, maybe you outta ease up.\"<br>\r\n\"So what?  Afraid I might show you up?\" Gray responded, irritating Natsu to no end.<br>\r\n\"Show ME up?  YOU?!\"  Fire began to form from the Fire Mage's palm but after hearing Erza clear her throat angrily, he calmed himself down and diffused his flames.  \"I'm not here to fight, I'm just saying that the others are kind of worried about you.  You've been really tense lately and the others for one reason or another, thought I should let you know that you're making them uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n\"Tense?\"  Gray responded angrily, then after hearing himself, stopped and considered what Natsu had just said.  \"...Okay, maybe I have been, but it's just because I'm tired of always being overshadowed out there!\"<br>\r\n\"Overshadowed?\"  Natsu asked.  Gray raised his eyebrows angrily.  <br>\r\n\"Oh, don't even start, you know exactly why I mean.  'Save us, Natsu!  You're my hero, Natsu!'  All day, every day.  We all put in the work, but Mr. Hero gets all the credit.  Well, I'm sick of it, and I'm gonna make sure the people remember that there's more than one hero in this guild!\"  said Gray before punching an icicle clear through a cutting log.  Natsu glanced, then also thought about what Gray had just said.  \"Okay, maybe I HAVE been kinda hogging it as of late.  If it's bothering you that much, I'm sorry.  I'll try and ease up on it.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean it?\"<br>\r\n\"For you, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray smiled, indeed grateful to the Fire Mage for understanding and being a good sport.  There was a brief silence in the room, until a loud rumbling emitted from Gray's stomach.  Blushing red from embarrassment, Gray placed a palm flat on his chiseled six pack then smirked sheepishly.  \"You may've been right about the intensity thing.  Think all that training worked up one hell of an appetite,\" said Gray as Natsu laughed., then responded, \"You up to grab a bite in the kitchen?  Think Erza was putting the finishing touches on a lamb spit before all this happened.\"<br>\r\n\"At this rate, I could eat the lamb,\" said Gray hungrily.  Sniffing briefly, Natsu stepped away and said, \"Maybe after a quick bath?  You stink like a wet hatchling over here.\"<br>\r\nGray mock laughed, then headed to the bath house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two were in the kitchen, ready to get their grub on...</span></div></div>",

Both mages looked around, spotted none of the other guild members.  \"It's all ours...\" said Natsu.  With that, the two dug right in.  Both were shoveling chunks of meat down their throats at record paces, neither showing any signs of stopping.  Suddenly a loud banging sounded from the kitchen door.  \"ARE YOU EATING OUR LAMB?!!\"  screamed Erza, but Gray immediately froze the door while stuffing his face at the same time.  Natsu, mouth full of beef, glanced back and said, \"Mmmmppf, you realize that we're dead, right?\"<br>\r\n\"<b>*SLLURRRP!*</b>  Yup.  But at least we won't die hungry!\" responded Gray between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed and Natsu was leaning back against his chair with both hands resting on his extended stomach which stuck out slightly from his open vest.  \"Ahhhh <i><b>*URP*</b></i> that hit the spit, eh Gray?\"  Natsu paused for a moment, then glanced back at Gray, only to see him still stuffing his face with lamb.  He raised his eyebrows in awe, that someone so small could still be eating a meal so massive.  Looking down, Natsu also noticed that Gray's six pack had bloated out considerably from the massive intake of food.  \"Ummmmm....y-you might wanna slow it down a tad, Fullbuster...\" said an uneasy Natsu.  But Gray wasn't hearing it.  Still, he stuffed himself silly, until finally, the entire platter was nothing but a pile of bones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking his teeth of some leftover meat remnants, Gray leaned back as his far more extended stomach pushed outward a good few inches.  \"Ahhh, that was fantastic...\" said Gray as he rested one hand atop his bloated belly.  He then felt a rumbling emit from his stomach and immediately opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP !*</b></i>  Gray unleashed a massive and lengthy belch with carried out for several seconds before winding down.  Sighing heartily, Gray gave his belly a few pats before rubbing it up and down.  \"Hehe, s'cuse me...\" he said, clearly not too bothered by his lack of manners.  Meanwhile, Natsu was in utter awe.  \"That was...pretty damn awesome!\" thought Natsu as he almost admired Gray's bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Gray winced, but smirked, \"That; Fire Breath, is the sound of me finally landing victory over you,\" he said before giving his belly a hearty slap.  The gurgling grew louder however, like that of a bubbling pot, growing more and more painful for the boy, even if he wouldn't admit it.  Natsu glanced for a moment, then stared back at Gray.  \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<i><b>*urrrrp*</b></i> \"Yeah, my gut's just a little raw, right now...\" he said, trying to mask the pain in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Natsu finally got up, sat down next to Gray and began rubbing his stomach with one hand.  Gray's eyes widened with shock as he glanced back at Natsu.  \"Hey, w-what the hell are you-\" Gray began, but stopped as Natsu continued and cut him off.<br>\r\n\"Oh just shut up and relax, Blizzard Brain, I know what I'm doing.\"  responded Natsu as he continued to rub Gray's bloated stomach in circular strokes.  \"Starting to feel a little better?\" asked Natsu.<br>\r\nGray paused, letting Natsu continue, and oddly enough, his bellyache had subsided a considerable amount.  \"Y-yeah actually...\" responded Gray as he let Natsu do his thing. <br>\r\n\"I get carried away all the time, so after a really big meal, nothing settles my stomach quite like a good tummy rub.  Though, I've never eaten anywhere NEAR as much as you just did.  You really put it away, didn't ya?\" laughed Natsu.  Gray merely smirked and shrugged.  As it continued, Natsu's rubbing worked up some of the excess pressure building in Gray's stomach since his hearty meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*uuuurrrrrrrrrrp!*</b></i>  \"Man, I gotta admit, Natsu, this actually <i><b>*URP*</b></i> feels really good <i><b>*UUUUURRRRRP!*</b></i> said Gray between burps.

After a moment of silence, both young mages laughed heartily.  \"Hahaha, NICE one, man!\" said Natsu as he patted Gray's belly.  Gray merely smirked, letting out a smaller burp, and said, \"Now if THAT wasn't teamwork, I don't know what is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys laughed again, as it began to dawn that...</span></div></div>",

To be more precise, they were NEETs: they never went to college, never bothered to get a job, and weren't actively looking to get a job either. People considered them on the lowest rank of of the social ladder, and them not having girlfriends didn't help either. Jobless, lowly virgins. That's all people considered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three eldest were currently on a walk through town. Osomatsu was trying to catch some glances at pretty women, Karamatsu was attempting to walk in a confident stride, and Choromatsu was dedicated to making sure the two didn't embarrass themselves today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really need some money...\" Osomatsu sighed, stopping in front of his brothers. Karamatsu bumped into him, nearly tripping over as Choromatsu helped held him up by his leather jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get a job...\" Choromatsu suggested, even if he knew that Osomatsu would reject it. Sure enough, he didn't even acknowledge his statement, mind racing for some sort of scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there some sort of get rich quick thing we can do? Like getting first place in a contest or something? Ugh, making money is so hard...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoromatsu rolled his eyes. Osomatsu wasn't anywhere close to acting like the eldest brother, always abusing his position to wring favors out of the other five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, I think I found a solution.\" Karamatsu held up a flyer that had blown into his face, detailing an eating contest event. Osomatsu immediately grabbed for it, eyes widening with every sentence before getting to the cash prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100,000 yen?\" His jaw dropped, eyes practically yen symbols as he imagined the possibilities. \"Guys, we gotta enter! The contest starts in two weeks, we need to practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want an excuse to pig out!\" Choromatsu scolded. But still, 100,000 yen was nothing to sneeze at. All the idol merchandise he could buy with that money would be unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Starting today, the eldest three Matsu brothers will compete to win 100,000 yen! Winner takes all!\" Osomatsu grinned from ear-to-ear, clearly the most enthusiastic about the contest. He loved all types of food, there was no way he was going to lose to Karamatsu or Choromatsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your challenge, my brother,\" Karamatsu said with a twinkle in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Choromatsu sighed. \"But where are we going to practice at?\"</span></div></div>",

At least a reprieve was something to be glad about licking their wounds after the conflict between Deucalion and Jennifer. Stile\u2019s dad was okay and had even been brought into the loop about the supernatural activities that had been going on in their town which meant Stiles was finally free of the guilt he had been feeling on keeping things hidden and having to be sneaky. Everything seemed good but little did they know something different was about to happen\u2026<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nDerek was out for a run when he felt it. Glancing up he saw the partly full moon and his face morphed for a moment before he realized it without meaning to. Concentrating, he shifted back but shivered feeling the urge to transform crawl under his skin. This was unusual since usually he could voluntarily control it and it had been a long time since he lost it on a day that wasn\u2019t a full moon. It grew stronger and he ran his tongue along his fangs. Most unexpected and a bit worrisome because if he was losing control without meaning to on a day that wasn\u2019t a full moon there could be trouble. He better talk to Peter to see if he knew anything about it as his uncle knew pretty much everything about werewolves and what he didn\u2019t Dr. Deaton would probably know (why he posed as an ordinary vet Derek didn\u2019t know). Running back, Derek headed back to the apartment house where the Pack were living. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cPeter where are you?\u201d Derek called out and Peter appeared giving a yawn. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Derek? I was napping,\u201d Peter said rubbing his eyes. Derek snorted not caring as he tapped his foot and Peter shrugged as he came down the stairs. <br>\r\n\u201cUncle, something weird happened while I was out on my run today,\u201d Derek stated.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter said sarcastically. Clearly there had to have been if Derek came in out of schedule shouting for him during his naptime. It was one of the sucky things about getting old, he felt so tired, especially since his werewolf powers had been alternately waning and coming back. However after Derek had given him some of his powers Peter had been feeling better, his body just needed to adjust after the upshot that had felt like after a stimulant. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI changed partially without meaning too,\u201d Derek said. He waited a moment while Peter stared at him before shock registering. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026oh,\u201d Peter said. That was weird since Derek usually had amazing control of himself barring the full moon days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Any ideas?\u201d Peter was about to say something but then he saw the moon outside and something strange came over him and next thing he was running his tongue over his own fangs. His fangs! He hadn\u2019t been able to shift ever since coming back from the dead but now he was getting it back. Derek stared at him and Peter growled at him, feeling powerful at the rumble of his chest compressing that sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026changed,\u201d Derek said surprised. <br>\r\n\u201cApparently so,\u201d Peter said snapping his teeth together. <br>\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d Derek asked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea, but I like it.\u201d Peter said, going over to a mirror and checking out his face, the morphed back, eyes squinting, hairy, elongated nose, and large inscissors for snapping with each tooth razor sharp. \u201cI missed feeling this.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that is a good idea.\u201d Derek said, staring suspiciously at Peter.<br>\r\n\u201cDerek, don\u2019t you trust me yet? You should know I don\u2019t want to kill you. In fact I\u2019ve only helped.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026I just can\u2019t help it,\u201d Derek said. \u201cYou know after killing my sister to become Alpha and then trying to kill me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood points but I have changed a bit after dying. Anyhow, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on so we should talk to the other person who might know. That druid Deaton.\u201d Derek nodded in agreement and they both went to the clinic where they could find him. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cScott, is Deaton in?\u201d demanded Derek brusquely, in that straight to the point manner he always had. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Derek,\u201d Scott rolled his eyes a moment when he thought Derek wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cHe\u2019s in the back with a patient.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell when he\u2019s done we need to talk to him,\u201d Derek stated.<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Scott asked confused. <br>\r\n\u201cSome weird things that have been happening. Have you seen the moon lately?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo why?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI changed partially while running and not voluntarily.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good,\u201d Scott said worried.<br>\r\n\u201cNo duh Scott and Peter has changed too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPeter too?!\u201d Scott shouted loudly and worried. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Peter.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am right here you know,\u201d Peter said sarcastically. \u201cNice to be talked about as if I\u2019m not.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut you changed!\u201d Scott said, staring suspiciously at Peter and Peter felt the urge to growl back and his fangs came down. Oh magnificence it felt good. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Scott said staring at Peter.<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Peter said pleasantly while giving a creepy smile to Scott just to make him jump. \u201cI am getting my powers back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d Scott demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cWell saving Cora, Derek lent me some of his\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou did what?!\u201d Scott shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cI lent some of my power to heal Cora so keep up Scott.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes, please do Scott. The issue isn\u2019t the return of my powers but the uncontrolled transition my nephew Derek has gone through.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Deaton asked coming out.<br>\r\n\u201cPeter has powers!\u201d Scott shouted. <br>\r\n\u201cI transformed,\u201d Derek said at the same time.<br>\r\n\"What?\u201d Deaton said confused.<br>\r\n\u201cPeter and Derek have shifted,\u201d Scott said. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Awakening moon coming up.\u201d They all stared blankly at him and Deaton sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA special time that happens every now and then, generally following once a century period where werewolves go through a special\u2026puberty type transformation.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWerewolf puberty? Really?\u201d Scott asked. \u201cI thought we already did that when transitioning.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes but a different type where those with the lupine bloodline go through a super-transformation thing. For the next few months or so, sometimes longer but usually months, your werewolf powers will be volatile and could come or go at random moments, uncontrollable shifts, spurts of energy, extreme hunger, total body transformations\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIs it dangerous?\u201d Scott asked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cPotentially. However it won\u2019t drive you crazy during the full moon. In fact, in the midst of this transitioning stage, you will no longer completely lose yourself to the bestial side during the full moon and would be able to retain one\u2019s rational capacities. It\u2019ll be random shifts from human to wolf and in between but you wouldn\u2019t actually notice it unless you focus as your thought processes will be continuous and one might not even be aware they shifted.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026this is natural?\u201d Derek asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in fact it is a blessing since you could reach full potential and retain oneself even in the midst of a full on full moon not to mention even more strength and powers.\u201d Deaton explained. \u201cHowever this will require a lot of energy to fuel so expect to be hungry all the time hence the super-transformation.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026how come Scott hasn\u2019t yet?\u201d Derek asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has to see or come in contact with the moon and he\u2019s been in here with me all day. He will almost certainly be affected and shift to some degree as soon as he goes outside.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWill we be able to go to school?\u201d Scott asked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI would not really recommend that. Though the likelihood of harm coming to anyone else is rather small assuming no extreme mood swinging, the random shifts might not be a good thing to show in school. I\u2019d withdraw for the rest of the semester and continue your education another way for these next few months.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWell dang. Wait, is this going to affect everyone?\u201d Scott asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it will affect all werewolves nearby.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need to talk to Isaac and the twins,\u201d Scott said getting up.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said. \u201cYou can stay with us while we\u2019re all going through this\u2026Awakening thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I got to tell my mom and Allison as well.\u201d Derek rolled his eyes. Of course Scott did but grudgingly Derek was beginning to like her and Mr. Argent . Gerard was another story but it was good to have honorable hunters that he could work with. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cFine then, just come over later and bring Stiles with you.\u201d Derek nodded to Scott and left with Peter, shivering as he felt the moon upon him with whatever weird power was going on. It made him feel alive but it also made him extremely\u2026hungry. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cErr, want to stop somewhere to eat?\u201d Derek asked Peter. He wasn\u2019t really in the mood to go hunting after fresh game at the moment. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost like clockwork both his and Derek's stomachs let out a loud grumble in desperate need of food.  Peter chucked, \"Well, I guess a small dinner just won't cut it, huh?\"  Peter asked.<br>\r\n\"Guess not.\"  Derek replied as he drove.  Out of the corner of his eye Peter noticed a billboard advertising a new buffet in town, \"How about we go there?  The place is called...The Gut Buster.  It's a new buffet.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"  Peter said, looking down at his abs, \"I don't wanna gain any weight..\"<br>\r\nJust then the sound of two loud growls came from both of their bellies, once again simultaneously, and Peter sighed, \"Sure, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Derek pulled into the parking spot they were lucky enough to find in the very front of the tightly packed parking lot.  They both headed inside to the buffet, which they were honestly surprised to see had been built right next door to a gym, and were quickly lead to their table.  Peter and Derek set their phones and receipt down before they both headed over in silence to the buffet and started loading up on food.  Both men decided on steak but they differed on everything else.  Derek's first plate was 3 massive steaks, almost an entire plate of mashed potatoes covered in cheese, and an entire second plate of cheesy bread while Peter had 2 steaks, 3 baked potatoes with all the toppings, and an entire bowl of macaroni and cheese.  Derek and Peter weren't the most talkative duo but tonight not a single word would be said between them at dinner.  Both wolves sat down at their table and wasted no time digging in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second food touched their lips both of them became ravenous and tore into their meat like actual wolves, though they never shifted into their wolf forms.  They had both devoured their first big courses in a matter of minutes and the second their plates were clean they went for more, both of them getting the same things.  Normally neither Peter nor Derek could eat more than a second helping but thanks to the Awakening Moon they couldn't seem to stop and the two ate and ate and ate.  Peter groaned as he finally came to a complete and total stop when it came to eating.  The older werewolf slumped back in his seat and groaned as he rubbed his bloated stomach, \"Oh God....  I've never eaten that much in my life.\"  Peter said, looking at the stack of 10 plates.  Derek added his twelfth plate to his stack and grinned at Peter, picking at his teeth with a claw, \"Already full, uncle?  Shame I thought you could have eaten more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I'm so full or I'd punch you in the face.\"  Peter said, burping and rubbing his sore, bloated belly which was trapped underneath his skin tight shirt.<br>\r\nDerek stood up, revealing his massive belly, which was far bigger than Peter's, \"Yeah, I'm getting pretty full too.\"  Derek said, rubbing his also trapped belly, \"But I think I have room for dessert.\"  Derek said walking slowly to the desert table.  The bloated wolf returned with a massive sundae covered in a mountain of whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  Derek started eating and Peter groaned again before speaking,<br>\r\n\"You know..\"  he began, \"This must be that extreme hunger Deacon was talking about.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Derek said between bites, \"I'll be honest though it's pretty fun eating like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes Derek and done and was equally as bloated and full as Peter, his belly far larger in size.  When the two stood up they realized their skin tight shirts couldn't contain the size of their bloated guts; The bottom of Peter's was sticking out from under his shirt and Derek's was up far past his belly button.  The two groaned as they headed to Derek's care to go home; tired, bloated, and ready to pass out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Derek was not sure how they managed to get home in the building they were staying at but somehow Derek had managed to drive home, park, and climb up the steps with Peter, say goodnight, and get into his bed where he immediately passed out in blessed sleep. He slept for hours until the knocking of the front door entered his consciousness and he groaned as he got up and stretched. He was still tired so he hoped the person would either go away or he was going to have to scare them off as he was not in the mood for this. Mumbling death threats, Derek sleepily made his way down the staircase and to the front door and opened it where he was greeted with the surprising appearance of one Stiles Stilinski who was way too chipper and animated for this ungodly hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Derek! Scott told me that he was bringing everyone here in a bit and that he had something to say, though I don't know why he didn't tell me right then but I just came early with snacks and what not because he did say you guys were going to need some and...\" Stiles took a look at Derek and stared, his mouth trailing off in surprise. Derek raised his eyebrow and wondered what had distracted Stiles since it looked like he was going to pass out in a moment. His feet sure looked shaky and before Stiles did, Derek grabbed him and plopped Stiles on a couch who had not stopped staring, his mouth fluttering a bit. Beginning to get worried and a bit creeped out, Derek backed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" He asked, his voice coming out in a growl and he realized his face had shifted so with extreme concentration forced it back. \"What is it?\" Derek tried again sounding human. There, that was much better. Stiles's mouth fluttered a few more times with nothing before he visibly straightened up and pull himself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh...you look different,\" Stiles said quickly. Derek stared at him not understanding.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Derek asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look different,\" Stiles repeated staring him in the eyes which normally he didn't do. Derek looked confused until he looked down at his hands, legs, and...belly. Going to the repaired full length mirror, Derek stopped and stared in front of it, Stiles close behind. His tiredness gone, Derek could only stare in disbelief and a bit of horror as he stared at himself, though more disbelieving. He was still wearing the clothes he went to sleep in which was a black sleeveless tanktop and jeans. He was covered in hair. His arms were hairy, his legs were hairy, his chest, his beard looked wild and thick and the hair on his head was all over the place. Also was the fact that his tanktop, normally stretched tight against his flat ripped well-muscled stomach (Derek wasn't normally vain but he did think it a point of pride of good maintenance and well-keeping) was no longer flat but kind of bowed out with the definition warped and kind of faded under the new light covering of fine dark hair. The covering of the shirt was pushed up, exposing his hairy gut. To his horror when Derek jiggled it, it did a little and felt kind of fleshy though at least not as soft as he had worried (yet). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Derek said stunned. Stiles who had been surreptitiously eying him straightened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty hairy,\" Stiles said without thinking and poked Derek in the gut, \"Man you've really let yourself go, I hear there is a new gym opening and you might want to go to fix this before it becomes permanent.\" Derek stared death at him and Stiles backed up. \"I'm sorry uh...I don't know what's going on, please don't hurt me!\" Derek snorted and returned to staring at the mirror in bewilderment while Stiles gathering his courage poked Derek in the gut again. \"Hehe fun,\" he said feeling it and getting out of Derek's reach when his hands went out to catch him. Normally Stiles would have stood no chance but Derek was out of it still staring so he barely missed grabbing Stiles. Soon they heard Peter come down and they both turned to look at him. Upon seeing their shocked faces Peter stared back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked before he caught sight of Derek and his mouth dropped open. Derek and Stiles both stared at him as he was covered in hair as well and while not to the extent of Derek, he was definitely looking a bit furry with his normally clean shaven face covered in scruff as well as a thick coating on his arms, assumably his legs though they were covered by his pants, and definitely his chest and gut as well which poked from underneath his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this is...interesting,\" Derek said, not quite sure what to say as he and Peter stared in shock at each other. <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, though I wouldn't really say that,\" Peter mumbled, taking a view of himself in the mirror and wincing. <br>\r\n\"So what's going on?\" Stiles asked confused, reminding them that he was there as well.<br>\r\n\"The Awakening Moon, did Scott tell you about it yet?\" Derek asked. Stiles shook his head no and Derek rubbed his forehead.<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, its pretty much a werewolf puberty transition stage caused by a special moon every hundred years or so...\" Derek explained to Stiles all they had learned so far from Deaton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's weird.\" Stiles said after they explained. \"Werewolf puberty? I hated going through puberty once, I can't imagine going through it a second time. So what you're saying is that you guys, Scott, and everyone will be going through this weird growing phase over the next few months?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Derek replied. \"All werewolves that come in contact with the moon.\"<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Stiles asked. \"What's so special about this moon that causes it?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know it just does,\" Derek said again his temper rising.<br>\r\n\"But aren't you wondering...\" Stiles started and all of a sudden he was up against a wall with Derek's clawed hand on his throat looking into red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Derek growled, his voice amplified by his transition into his alpha form. Normally Stiles would be scared, and make no mistake he was, but he also found it oddly arousing Derek being so close to him, pushing him against a wall and Derek's thicker gut brushing his. He smelled some sort of natural forest musky animal Derek smell and Stiles smiled briefly as he turned and offered his neck in submission without realizing he did so. Derek's eyes glared red for one more moment before turning back to normal and the squeezing hand removed. Stiles was oddly disappointed when Derek stepped away. \"I'm sorry,\" Derek murmured. Stiles blinked and stared. Did he just hear right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Stiles asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Derek repeated looking abashed. \"I lost control for a second.\" <br>\r\n\"It's okay, you didn't hurt me,\" Stiles said to the suddenly upset Derek. \"You got it back.\"<br>\r\n\"I could have hurt you,\" Derek pointed out.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you didn't. Besides, you threaten to hurt me a lot of times.\" Stiles said. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Derek said again, looking almost...were those seriously tears? Unsure what to do with a suddenly emotional Derek, Stiles looked to Peter who looked as baffled as he did and Stiles hesitantly put his arm around Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...it's okay...and stuff...dude you're seriously freaking me out, please stop crying.\" Stiles said as he patted Derek. Derek glared at him a moment and the sniffling stopped which made Stiles feel relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously suck at comforting people. Even I can do better than that,\" Derek said in his normal tone of voice. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I do. That sure would be a sight to see though, you comforting people. How would it go? 'Stop crying or I'll rip your throat out so you can't anymore?'\" Derek grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that. It works though.\"<br>\r\n\"Only because it scares the crap out of them...anyhow that was...something different,\" Stiles said. \"I don't know if I can handle all you guys going through such hormonal mood swings for the next couple months with PWSing\" Derek and Peter looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, like PMSing for girls but with the M flipped over for werewolves and the fact that you are all pretty much guys and from what you describe it's going to be for the next couple months. Wait, what about Cora? Will she go through it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Peter said shrugging. \"Speaking of, where is she? I haven't seen her yet.\" As if saying her name summoned her, there was a loud yawn coming from upstairs and Cora padded out to the top of the staircase. She still looked pale and sickly but she was getting better by the day after her injuries. She blinked looking down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stiles, what are you doing here?\" she asked confused.<br>\r\n\"I just came over to bring food since Scott told me there will be a Pack meeting here.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Why is that?\" She asked confused before she looked over at Derek and Peter and screamed. They all winced as she screamed real loud and Stiles couldn't help but wonder why she was screaming when she was a werewolf. Surely she wouldn't be afraid just like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Cora sniffed the air and her mouth dropped. \"Derek, Peter, is that you?\" With a burst of werewolf speed she was down the stairs and staring at them in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" Derek said to her stunned face. Her eyes raked over his suddenly quite furry body and her eyebrows rose dramatically at the sight of Derek's sudden expanded gut. She ran her fingers over it in wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this thing real?\" She asked in stunned surprise. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, for the moment.\" Derek said. Cora looked over to Peter and she ran over to him too running her hands over his as well. <br>\r\n\"You too Uncle Peter?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, unfortunately,\" Peter said uncomfortably. <br>\r\n\"That's so cool!\" she said excitedly. They all stared at her. \"How did you do the hair so fast though?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, its part of the Awakening Moon and uh say what?\" Derek asked stuttering. <br>\r\n\"You just look so cute like that, you should keep it. Same for you Uncle Peter. So what's this about an Awakening Moon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you see,\" Derek started before sniffing the air. \"Whew, Scott is here, I'm getting real tired of explaining this.\" As soon as he said that, Scott, Issac, Ethan, and Aiden came into the room. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whoa...\u201d Stiles said under his breath at the sight of the four werewolves who just entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, Isaac, Ethan, and Aiden all stood there in skin tight clothing with huge, bloated guts, much like Peter and Derek, but unlike the two male Hale wolves none of them had massive amounts of body hair.  Stiles looked around at all of the wolves in the room and mentally started comparing sizes: he could instantly tell that Derek's gut was the biggest, followed by Scott's own huge, bloated belly.  After those two were Peter, the twins who had identical guts, and then Isaac, who had the smallest (though it was still big by Stiles' standards).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the moon got to you four big boys as well?\"  Peter said in his usual flirtatious voice.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Scott said, thinking back to the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott took a deep breath as he stared at the door of the vet's office he worked at.  Deaton had already left for the night and Scott still hadn't even attempted to go outside since they found out about the whole Awakening Moon thing.  He had already texted Isaac about it, who made the mistake of going outside before hand, and from the texts he got earlier so did Ethan and Aiden who were both currently gorging themselves on massive amounts of food at one of Beacon Hill's buffets.  Scott knew he couldn't put this off any longer and pushed the door open, stepping into the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott felt himself temporarily shift and let out a loud howl before shifting back, gathering his senses the best he could.  The very second Scott was in control of his changes he felt and heard a massive growl come from his stomach.  Knowing this would happen, based on what he knew about the twin's exposure to the moon, and had already set up plans to meet Isaac at a nearby buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took maybe 10 minutes for Scott to drive to the buffet and he saw that Isaac was already there when he arrived, having borrowed Scott\u2019s mom\u2019s car.  He entered the buffet and grinned to see that the place was totally empty save for a single employee and Isaac who was already scarfing down his 5th plate of food.  The ravenous blonde wolf looked up at Scott and grinned, swallowing down the last of his meatloaf, \u201cScott!\u201d  Isaac said, getting up and walking over to the now Alpha wolf and kissing him hard on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott returned the kiss and grinned as he pulled back, \u201cHey, babe.  Wow, you\u2019re really putting it away, huh?\u201d Scott said patting the small bloated belly Isaac was now sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I\u2019m getting kind of full\u2026\u201d he said, rubbing his belly.  Without another word the two boyfriends went straight into an eating frenzy.  Since it was so empty in the buffet the one employee left said they could eat the remained of the food so they wouldn\u2019t have to throw it all away.  Scott and Isaac, now with extra determination to eat on top of the already massive hunger they had went straight to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wolves ate and ate and ate but there was way more food than they originally thought.  After a complete hour of eating Isaac couldn\u2019t do it anymore and he fell back in his booth seat, groaning as he rubbed his enormous beach ball sized gut, which was stuffed, tightly in his fashionable sweater.  Scott, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t fazed in the slightest.  His stomach was only a tiny bit smaller than Isaacs but Scott wasn\u2019t even beginning to feel the effects of fullness.  With his mind obsessed with the idea of eating more food, his own primal instincts taking over, Scott got up and walked over to the huge amount of buffet food left over.  The teenage wolf wasted no time even bothering to grab a plate and just started shoveling food into his mouth.  His eye glowed red as he scarfed down pound after pound and after another hour of eating the remained of the buffet had been picked clean by Scott.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen groaned as he stood up, his massive stomach sticking out almost two feet in front of him and looking like it\u2019s about to pop.  Isaac, who was now in less pain, walked over and helped his bloated boyfriend up and the two headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys haven\u2019t shifted the hair away?\u201d  Scott asked looking at Peter and Derek.  The two looked at each other, not even thinking about that, and did so revealing smooth but bloated bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo whats this Awakening moon thing?\u201d  Cora asked, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell..\u201d Scott started and he went on to explain everything about the moon.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d  Cora said, placing her fingers on her chin, \u201cI went out last night and wasn\u2019t affected.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt must only work on men.\u201d  Isaac said.<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case I guess I could stay with Allison or Lydia until this whole thing wears off.\u201d  Cora said, heading to her room to pack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019d be best.\u201d  Derek said.  As Cora headed off Derek turned to the other bloated wolves and asked\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Is anybody as hungry as I am?\" Derek asked and when the other wolves nodded, Stiles raised his hand in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you guys are actually hungry? I can't believe it!\" Just at that moment though, Derek's stomach let out a growl as did some of the others. Stiles's eyes widened. \"I stand corrected then but I just can't believe it. I mean you guys already ate a ton recently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stiles, shut up. Did you bring the snacks like I asked you to?\" Derek wondered. <br>\r\n\"Yeah they're in the car but thinking about it now I probably haven't brought enough...\" Stiles gestured helplessly as he looked at the big ravenous wolves around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, just bring whatever you have in,\" Derek ordered and Stiles jumped to do so, hoping they weren't thinking of making a meal out of him. They were pretty hungry after all and he'd definitely would prefer not being wolf chow because he was too slow at bringing in snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I could use some help...\" Stiles started but Derek was already there with him. Muttering under his breath about Derek sneaking up on people, Stiles opened the trunk and Derek immediately picked up six bulging bags of groceries and was (sort of) speed walking back without strain. Stiles noticed two things: how easily Derek carried those and probably could have done more if space had allowed, and his still sexily bloated gut bouncing as he moved. Stiles remembered when Derek had just earlier pushed him against the wall and it had somewhat pushed against him and when he got to poke at it...it sure was different from that infuriatingly ripped six pack hard body. Stiles had liked that too but this...this could be more fun and maybe this whole Awakening Moon thing wouldn't be so bad. Especially if it got bigger which would undoubtedly happen. Stiles felt himself get excited at the thought of Derek getting even bigger, like a real beef-cake wolf with those huge muscles and a big bulging protruding gut...hmm, this wouldn't be so bad after all. Shaking his head, Stiles was about to grab the last couple bags when Derek appeared again and already grabbed them and was walking back in with them at a fast pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was bringing those in!\" Stiles yelled. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well you were taking too long!\" Derek shouted back as he went back in. Running in behind him Stiles could see that the wolves were already going through the bags to see what he brought considering the torn scraps they had left when eagerly ripping open the bags. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just...go help yourselves.\" There was a howl of joy from Scott as he pulled out boxes of doughnuts and poptarts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got Donuts and Poptarts? You're the best Stiles!\" Ethan, Aiden, and Isaac made noises that might have been agreement as they each took a box and started chomping down like no other. Stiles stood their awkwardly looking around the feeding wolves before going to sit in the corner with the best view of Derek who was eating poptarts. Although the noise was overwhelming, the viewing was fantastic as Derek ate poptart after poptart into that growing gut of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stiles?\" Derek's voice interrupted his wandering thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Ahh! I mean hi, what is it?\" Stiles asked sweating a little. Derek smirks at him as if knowing what he had been thinking about but he doesn't mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is a lot to ask since you just brought snacks but maybe you could make some breakfast as well...?\" Derek trailed off with a hopeful note in his voice. Stiles winced and sighed before putting on a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not? I already brought the snacks which would have at least lasted a week or two before but now only a couple days if that. Man feeding you guys is going to be tough work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Derek said apologetically. \"Don't worry about paying for everything, after today me and Peter will probably pay for most of the food except what is eaten on their own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How are you guys going to do that?\" <br>\r\n\"We actually do have quite a bit of family money saved up,\" Derek said. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Well that's good.\" Stiles awkwardly patted the back of his head not sure what to say.<br>\r\n\"The answer is pancakes.\" Derek declared. Stiles looked at him blankly.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What about pancakes?\" <br>\r\n\"What all of us want. You're going to need to make pancakes.\" Derek got closer all of a sudden in Stile's space setting his body on high alert.<br>\r\n\"Lots of them,\" Derek whispered in his ear and smirked again at Stile's reaction. <br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Stiles tried to huff out exasperated but came out more breathless and turned on which widened that infernal smirk and for a second Derek's eyes flashed red. Stepping closer, Derek reached out to touch Stiles before Stiles jumped out of the way and headed into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pancakes coming right up,\" Stiles said, hoping to slow down his racing heart. Derek looked sad for a moment before he shrugged and pulled out another poptart and munched on it. Looking out of the kitchen, Stiles could see that Derek was the only one at the moment eating Poptarts which made him the Poptart king which made for a hilarious image of Derek in little to no clothing other than a crown while nibbling daintily, actually more like stuffing down like a hungry wolf, poptarts at high speed. It was just too funny. Still chuckling, he wondered if he could convince Derek to do it while he got the ingredients out of the cupboards to hopefully make enough pancakes to satisfy supernaturally starving werewolves. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He always made enough of whatever he cooked to last at least a day or two so he wouldn't have to cook every single day.  As the 6 bulky werewolves chowed down on two weeks worth of baked breakfast goods Stiles flipped away, making as many pancakes as he possibly could.  He found himself shaking his round, cute ass to the beat of the music and soon found himself lost in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour went by as Stiles cooked, undisturbed, and when he finally ran out of batter he pulled his earbuds out, \"Huh... guess I'm out.\"  Stiles looked at the massive amount of pancakes he made and let out a low whistle.  He made 6 full stacks; 12 pancakes on each plate and each cake was made with the perfect amount of butter.  He turned around and was about to tell everybody they were finished when he was surprised by what he saw.  While Peter, Scott, and Derek were sitting back rubbing their's much bigger stomachs Isaac and the twins were lying on the ground groaning slightly by from how stuffed they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess they aren't eating..\"  Stiles said, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Scott said, \"They gave up half an hour ago and we had to pick up the slack.\"  He said, giving his round solid gut a nice smack, a bit of pride in his face by the size of it though it was nowhere near as huge as Derek's gut, which sat swollen and full on his lap.<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Well, do you guys want their stacks then?\"  Stiles asked.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"  Peter said and the three got up and walked towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles took 3 plates of 12 and added them to the wolves plates.<br>\r\n\"Hope you guys are hungry enough for 24 pancakes.\"  Stiles said as he set them down in front of the gluttonous werewolves before dousing them in syrup.  All three of their stomachs let out loud growls, Derek's being the loudest, before the three of them dived in, scarfing down as much as they could.<br>\r\nFive minutes went by before Peter set down his fork and pushed the plate away, having eating only 7 of the pancakes before giving up, \"Those were just delectable, Stilinski but I'm too full to finish.\"  Peter said before letting out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second though Scott grabbed the remaining 16 pancakes pancakes and splitting them between himself and Derek.  The two kept going, not saying a word except for groans of appreciation as they swallowed down bite after bite.  Stiles watched, happy the apron around his waist hid the boner he got from watching some huge guys stuff their bellies.  Stiles just wanted them to keep going; to get even bigger and bigger.  A couple minutes went by and Scott gave in, leaving five pancakes on the plate that Derek inhaled in no time at all.  Derek pushed his empty plate back and groaned happily as he leaned back, rubbing his huge gut, \"Ooooh, that was so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  Stiles said as he put the plates in the sick, \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" Derek said, rubbing his gut and listening to the sounds of the other sleeping wolves.  \"How about..\"</span></div></div>",

Stiles's jaw nearly dropped hearing that and he had to shake his head to see if he heard Derek correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just say that you were still hungry?!\" Stiles asked disbelievingly, looking at Derek's massively bloated stomach. Stiles thought if it got any bigger Derek might actually go pop it looked utterly rounded and distended a good distance from his body and sitting on Derek's lap. Derek nodded and Stiles swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit um wow I can't believe you're still hungry and stuff after those pancakes...and donuts and poptarts mania, and the stuffing I understand you had last night at the buffet. Crap well um I didn't plan this and don't really have anything. Is there anything at all in the house?\" Derek rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if there was we'd have eaten it by now,\" he pointed out. Stiles nodded. That was a pretty good point. <br>\r\n\"Well I guess I could order some pizza or something. I hope that will be enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Make it a couple just in case. Besides, we'll need some leftover pizza for the others,\" Derek said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. I'll be honest, I'm kind of scared by how much food you guys are going to eat if this moon thing lasts a month or whatever and you already ate this much in the past 1 to 2 days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this will be fun,\" Derek muttered, scowling at the thought of how much money it was going to be. How did Werewolves deal with this in the past before easy to obtain food? Maybe that's when they especially ripped people and wildlife apart because this hunger was ridiculous. Massaging his gut, he let out a belch and groaned because he was both stuffed beyond belief yet still oh so hungry that he couldn't stop and he didn't know if he could wait for a large pizza order to arrive yet at the same time really felt he would explode if he ate one more bite and certainly looked like it. His gut had grown far beyond the confines of his shirt and had pushed it all the way up essentially before he removed it during the pancakes and was more like a big heavy flesh boulder on his lap utterly distended and he had long ago ripped off his jean from getting far too tight and was in his underwear that also felt increasingly small. He heard Stiles on the telephone ordering pizza and immediately he started drooling again even though there wasn't any pizza around nor would be for another good couple hours considering the large order Stiles had to leave for 20 extra-extra large meat lover supreme pizzas. Derek could hear the astonished incredulity of the cashier as he wrote down the order and asked if Stiles was having a massive party. Stiles looked over and Derek felt him being eyed up and down with a weird smile on Stiles's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could say that. It is for a real big party.\" Stiles said with that still somewhat creepy admiring look. Giving directions and hearing that the pizza will be there in 2 hours (and both of them hearing the muttered exclamations of amazement by the person who took the order), Stiles hung up and shrugged. \"Sorry big guy, it looks like that you're just going to have to wait a bit even though I know you're hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay and I expected that. It's probably for the better though to allow some of this to digest and get some room in this tank. If I ate anything now despite the need too, I'd probably explode,\" Derek said patting his drum belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I reckon so,\" Stiles said grinning. \"But seriously, despite the utter absurdity of just how much it is you can put away, you are a tank.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah...thanks...I guess,\" Derek said scratching his head not quite sure what to say. Stiles looked delighted and looked again at Derek's massive gut. <br>\r\n\"So like until the pizza comes can I like rub your belly for you?\" Derek almost immediately said no but stopped and thought about it, especially when a low rumble went through him and out came an especially massive belch that rocked them both and had Derek clutching his upset stomach protectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Stiles said. <br>\r\n\"If you shut up and don't annoy me I might allow you to rub my unfortunately bloated stomach.\" Derek said, trying to rub himself in relief. <br>\r\n\"Really? That's awesome! I'll-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and do it if you're going to or leave before I rip out your throat and eat you too!\" Derek said only partly joking on the last bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, love you too Sourwolf,\" Stiles slipped in the nickname which caused Derek to growl threateningly until he felt Stiles's hands placed on his massive bloated stomach and begin to rub and it felt good. Letting out noises of enjoyment, Derek immediately relaxed as he felt Stiles massage his gut and relieving the built up pressure of his far too stretched stomach lining. Letting out belch after belch, Stiles released the pressure that had built up and Derek moaned in between earth shattering belches in relief. Stiles made his own humming noises of encouragement and whispered silly things like congratulating him and possibly things that might have ordinarily been taken as condescending like burping a baby but Derek was too out of it in bliss and relief of getting the pressure gone to care. Stiles's hands were also magic and made him feel so much better that he moved and stretched out as much as his heavy food laden stomach could allow him too let Stiles touch everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiles was amazed at the change in Derek. First he was going to say something threatening about ripping his throat out and while Derek had used that line far too many times now for Stiles to take as a serious threat by this point, one would never know and there were times when he was sure he had almost pushed Derek over the edge but as soon as he put his hands on him and started rubbing, Derek went into a near ecstatic bliss that almost had Stiles come as well. It was so hot to watch and it took all of his self-control to keep rubbing and not join Derek but he could understand why as Derek's stomach really was tight. Stiles couldn't imagine how anything could have fit in there if there was anything around. Surely the Awakening Moon came with an off switch at some point? If so, it certainly hadn't triggered for Derek Hale yet. At least he was helping relieve some of the pressure if the thunderous belches coming from Derek Hale were any indication. It was one of the most sexiest things Stiles had ever seen but frankly Derek Hale was sexy in all activities and forms. Still, laid out and needing to be relieved from fullness and letting go certainly jumped up there in the macho manly scale adjusted to Derek and werewolves, but mainly Derek. Eventually Derek finally settled and Stiles was able to do a more leisurely pace and examination of Derek's amazingly bloated midsection. Who knew it could inflate so big? It was solid and fun to push and the little moans and sighs and occasional after shock burps were just awesome. Stiles and Derek had lost track of time until the doorbell rang and Stiles looked down at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, two hours have passed already?!\" He shouted in surprise. Derek looked blearily up at him.<br>\r\n\"Wazzit?\" he asked and Stiles cursed him mentally for being so cute. At some point, Derek had gone to sleep on him but Stiles couldn't help but continue to rub Derek's majestic stomach. Why did he have to be so cute? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the pizza.\" Immediately Derek was awake and jumping up. He was in a better mood and mobility now that time and pressure has gone by though his gut was still at the moment pretty bloated. Stiles sighed and got up as he went to the door where he was greeted with a load of boxes. Derek followed him and signed the order to the gaping surprise of the delivery boy. Looking down, Derek blushed forgetting he was only in his snug-fit underwear and nothing else and his belly was big and still bloated and bulging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the pizza,\" he said and slammed the door in the guy's face. <br>\r\n\"That was rude,\" Stiles said.<br>\r\n\"Don't care. I'm hungry and well he saw me like this,\" Derek said poking his belly. \"I'd be more upset but right now I just really want this pizza.\" Suddenly they heard scrabbling as 5 stampeding pairs of feet came rushing down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude is that pizza?!\" Scott asked excitedly while the twins high-fived behind him. <br>\r\n\"I think it is,\" Isaac said excitedly. \"Meat to be exact,\" he said, his eyes glowing wolfishly as his fangs came out. <br>\r\n\"Woah careful,\" Scott said. \"Don't want to ruin the pizza.\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, you already did,\" Stiles said both smirking and twitching a little as the box that Scott had grabbed into his hand had already been punctured by wolf claws. Scott looked down and growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well damn it. At least the pizza will still be good,\" he said pulling out a slice and biting into it. Immediately the twins grabbed their own boxes while Peter slyly slipped one and daintily was already nibbling on his pizza. Raising an eyebrow, Stiles mouthed 'really?' at him and he just smirked. Stiles didn't know how or why Peter was restraining himself since they all knew that earlier he had also been stuffing his face with the best of them and better than the twins and Isaac but if he wanted to pretend for the moment then fine. Perhaps he needed a belly rub too or something? Stiles made a face at the thought although it did make sense and even if Peter was sometimes annoying not to mention utterly crazy he was pretty good looking especially with that big round belly munching away on food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreaking attractive werewolves. Why did they all have to be so supernaturally good at everything and good looking and look so adorable? <br>\r\nScott was getting pretty big there...Stiles grinned at the sight of Scott's also thick belly that while still not matching the size of Derek's was pretty big as well that Scott kept rubbing with one hand while eating pizza with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want help Scott?\" Scott looked confused until Stiles moved over and started massaging his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, that feels so good,\" Scott said happily. </span></div></div>",

The scrawny teen could barely believe how huge his best friend has already gotten.  Stiles rubbed the swollen mass all over, relieving his best friend as he stuffed his face, his gut expanding with each slice of pizza.  Eventually, Scott finished off his entire pizza and groaned happily as Stiles played and massaged his gorged stomach.  As Stiles worked his magic, kneading the swollen flesh of Scott's belly, he had started to notice how much, well, softer the outside felt.  He pushed it out of his head and once Scott had passed out, shirt pulled up to his chest and his gut, containing three whole pizzas, on full display, Stiles stood up and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac and the twins had all passed out in a big pile, stuffed bellies full of pizza, and Peter had also fallen asleep on a nearby arm chair.  Stiles' eyes drifted away from Peter's enormous gut to the massive, protruding mound if flesh that was Derek's.  Derek was laying back on the ground, his stomach impossibly bloated and full of all the remaining pizzas.  He looked over at Stiles and nudged his head, \"You uh..  wanna help me out?\"  Derek asked, patting his gut.  Stiles could actually hear the tightness as Derek patted and the sounded reminded him of a drum.  Without a second thought Stiles walked over and started to massage, amazed by the sheer size and MASS of Derek's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on Derek slowly drifted off to sleep, much like the rest of the wolves, and Stiles found himself curled up next to Derek's giant gut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stiles grumbled when he felt the warmth beneath him move and made a yelp when he slid off and touched the ground. Opening his eyes he felt like giving his pillow a stern talking too. Or would have if his mind hadn't taken a detour and been blown by the sight of Derek now. Granted, Derek wasn't huge like he was before after all that food but he was way different than the Derek he knew of only just days ago. This Derek was...well, huge and probably mostly digested of the calories from that feast but not without leaving a mark. Gone were the perfect six pack abs replaced by a pretty solid looking ball that stuck out. He was also beefier in other places as well in the arms which definitely looked thicker if less defined at the moment, legs, and chest which had broadened out. He was again covered in patches of thick fur which he glared at and made retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop drooling,\" Derek said without looking over, awakening Stiles from his trance. <br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" Stiles denied offended. <br>\r\n\"Yes you are. It's very distracting.\" Stiles wiped his mouth and sure enough there was.<br>\r\n\"Okay fine but you're very distracting.\" Stiles watched as Derek poked and prod his thick gut examining. <br>\r\n\"Yes I know I'm fat and ugly,\" Derek said and Stiles gaped. What was this nonsense? Derek Hale being self-conscious and thinking he was ugly? Stiles moved over and reached out a hand and grabbed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fat or ugly and while you're definitely bigger this is some pretty sexy solid beef here, not fat. I mean you were always big but now you're even bigger and it's like woah, you're even more of a sexy stud. Just look at those arms and legs. I know you work out like all the time but you couldn't have reached this level for a long time the natural way and what's a bit of a belly anyhow? It's only to be expected after all that food and I think it's hot.\" Stiles babbled. Derek looked down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You think so?\" He asked sounding unsure. <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah I am because the only people who would really matter are kind of in the same boat, I think you look fantastic like you always have but better, and you'd be surprised by what people like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that is true.\" Derek patted his gut and flexed his arm. \"And excellent point about the working out bit because even though werewolves can grow fast compared to humans you also do run into plateaus requiring more supernatural force even faster...it's been a bit of time since my last growth so I guess this is doable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, this thing is solid as a rock,\" Stiles said squeezing the flexed bicep. \"Well I mean it's always been but I think you just exploded another inch or two so wow the moon does a body good.\" Derek grunted in affirmation as he shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if the others are awake. I'm going to go get dressed...maybe,\" Derek said looking down. Stiles smirked at the thought as he knew what Derek was thinking. Watching Derek try to slip into his tight body hugging jeans and shirts would be hilarious so Stiles almost followed him before Derek stared back at him with a meaningful look and Stiles made his way quickly back down the stairs. By this time some of the others were beginning to stir so Stiles sat in a chair and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was the first up, giving a loud yawn and stretch as he stood up, stomach thrusting out. Unsurprisingly, Peter and everyone else had also gotten bigger. He wasn't as beefy thick as Derek (none of them were as Derek was special) but Peter had some nice gains and a pretty decent sized belly that was more jiggly than Derek's. Peter looked over at Stiles and shrugged nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like middle age caught up to me quicker than I imagined but I am pretty fit for all that,\" Peter said examining. <br>\r\n\"So again, just how old are you-?\" Stiles asked and Peter smirked. <br>\r\n\"Still none of your business. Older than I look, younger than you would probably guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh I would ask Derek but he won't tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"He doesn't know either,\" Peter smiled grinning. \"I am a marvel.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay whatever. At least you're like...I don't know...nice now or something when you're not trying to kill everyone. But don't think I'm not still watching you.\" Stiles said, giving him the 'I'm watching you signal'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is. But right now I'm on my best behavior.\" Peter said giving that annoying smirk again causing Stiles to sigh. Peter left the room to do whatever Peter does, still smirking. Sitting down, Stiles took a look over to where Scott and Isaac were cuddling together with Ethan and Aiden, a weird position that wouldn't really happen as often when awake. Sure Ethan and Aiden were good guys and part of the Pack but the whole Alpha pack thing did make them just the tiny bit suspicious though they certainly were trying to be good. Free of Deucalion though, Stiles did grudgingly admit they were sort of okay and still more trustworthy than Peter, no matter how helpful and snarky Peter was. Plus it was sort of cute to see everyone cuddled in a pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiden was the next up giving a stretch with Ethan seconds behind. Although they had eaten far more than Stiles could dream of eating and the binges close together, they actually didn't change quite as dramatically as the Derek, Peter, or Scott. They did have some pretty nice pot bellies but definitely not huge yet and they were slightly bigger than before but not near as dramatic a change. Aiden (or was it Ethan? Stiles was guessing it was Aiden though) was slightly buffer while Ethan was that but with just a slightly thicker gut. Now that they weren't so identical maybe he could finally know which one was which. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up?\" Ethan asked Stiles as they both pulled up their pants with the slightest bit of difficulty and put on their shirts which stretched and rolled up a bit, especially on Ethan. <br>\r\n\"Don't know, just watching you guys get up.\"<br>\r\n\"That's kind of creepy,\" Aiden said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah well...okay yeah it is but you guys look so different.\" Stiles said. <br>\r\n\"I can't believe how fat I've gotten,\" Ethan said pinching his gut and trying to yank his shirt further down only to have it roll back up and exposing the bit of pooch over his jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have seen Derek and Peter who you just missed. That's just child's play compared to them,\" Stiles said. <br>\r\n\"Wow, how big did they get?\" wondered Aiden. <br>\r\n\"Peter pretty big and Derek massive. Good lord, how big will you guys be by the end of the moon?\" <br>\r\n\"Holy shit you're right,\" Aiden said. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Isaac said, squeezing out from underneath Scott who was slightly snoring and getting up. \"Moring. Or late afternoon. Whichever.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually night,\" Stiles said. \"You guys were OUT. Of course I was too for a while till Derek had to get up...err...\"<br>\r\n\"It's cool. Everyone knows you're like, hot for Derek except maybe Derek. We still can't figure out if he's just in extreme denial, trying hard to not like you, doesn't think of you that way, is utterly clueless, or if you guys have some weird flirt games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows,\" Stiles shrugged. \"I'm not even sure myself sometimes.\" They all looked at Isaac who seemed the least affected at the moment just having a slight bit of pudge and maybe slightly bigger elsewhere. It was noticeable as it was still a growth from before but really, Isaac mainly just got the slightest bit chubby and softer and slight jiggle where before was mostly muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you were like, barely affected at all,\" Ethan said. Isaac smirked, seeing Ethan's new gut and poked it. <br>\r\n\"Yeah fatty.\" Ethan rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Whatever. It's not like Derek's, Peter's or Scott's though.\" They all looked over to Scott who was still asleep and snoring. <br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up,\" Isaac said, poking Scott causing him to jump and look around. <br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Isaac said. <br>\r\n\"Oh hey,\" Scott said enthusiastically. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just seeing the damages the special moon has given. It looks like it affected you quite a bit,\" Isaac said staring though he wasn't the only one. They all were. Though he wasn't quite as big as Derek, Scott definitely gained with a broader if slightly softer chest and pecs, a protruding gut that hung out further than Ethan's, and some thickness added to the arms and legs. Stiles reached out and had to touch it, jiggling Scott's gut which bounced slightly and was definitely softer than Derek's though not terribly so. It did however cause his whole body to go with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sure different,\" Scott said lightly as he jiggled his gut a bit. Isaac licked his lips and nodded which made Stile's smirk when he made a strangled noise. Isaac was looking at Scott like a thick juicy beef steak at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's..nice,\" Isaac said touching Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm out of here,\" Aiden said, leaving the room and Ethan quickly following behind neither one in the mood to see Scott and Isaac in a love fest. Well, Ethan might have been interested but Stiles pushed him out into the next room so that Scott and Isaac could do whatever in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's happening?\" Derek asked, coming down in sweatpants. Stile was surprised as he didn't know Derek owned any clothing that wasn't body hugging let alone sweatpants. He was also wearing a blue polo, sort of. Trying to wear one anyways. It was looking pretty strained at the seams against those thick arms and beefy chest and unable to cover more than half of his thick muscle gut which protruded proudly over the drawstrings. Stiles felt his mouth dry and he made a noise that was honestly similar to the one that Isaac made upon seeing Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we'll leave you guys alone then. I'm going to find Lydia and Ethan will probably bone Danny.\" Aiden said leaving. Derek nodded, as he smirked slightly at Stiles, the upper corner of his lip going up and setting Stiles on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" he said and Ethan and Aiden made quick escape. Neither Derek nor Stiles paid any attention to them though, completely focused on the other as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Derek said sidling closer, pushing Stiles against a wall. Suddenly Derek was all over him and Stiles loved it. </span></div></div>",

I feel like I should go find him and talk.\"<br>\r\n\"Only if that talking is in really close contact. I find that to be the best sort of talking. At least Lydia knows what's going on.\"<br>\r\n\"Yay for you,\" Ethan groaned. \"Not telling him I'm a werewolf sucks. I just don't want to scare him off yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Danny is a strong guy and I'm fairly sure he suspects something. Just tell him and be done with it. If it is meant to be, it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow Aiden, that's actually really serious,\" Ethan said surprised. Aiden grinned at him teeth flashing. <br>\r\n\"I have my moments but I'm going to find Lydia. We got some things to catch up on.\" Aiden loped off leaving Ethan standing there. Not wanting to get left behind, he also ran for where they had parked their motorcycles the night before. Slapping high fives, they split off in different directions, Aiden to find Lydia and Ethan heading to Danny's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a nervous breath, Ethan fiddled with the hem of his shirt nervously. He had stopped on the way to Danny's to pick up a change of clothes and he had found looser clothes and a hoodie which at least for the moment hid his new belly. Obviously it wouldn't work for long but Danny might need to be eased into the idea. Knocking, Ethan waited for Danny. Then he knocked again and Danny came out wearing an apron and a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's with the get-up?\" Ethan asked confused. <br>\r\n\"No hello? I'm offended,\" Danny said smiling. \"I'm actually trying out recipes for food to bring for the lacrosse team bake sale.\" <br>\r\n\"Lacrosse...bake sale?\" Ethan said slowly. <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, remember when I told you about it?\" <br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so,\" Ethan said struggling to recall. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you were a bit distracted. Anyhow, you should have been paying more attention for when Coach talked about it.\"<br>\r\n\"I was too busy staring at you,\" Ethan muttered. <br>\r\n\"Figures. Anyhow, come on in.\" Danny stepped aside and Ethan followed, smelling the delicious scents wafting in from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"So what are you making?\" Ethan asked casually though he was fairly certain he recognized most of the delicious scents. <br>\r\n\"My special meat chili, fried chicken, and I am also trying to decide between whether or not to bring cherry, apple, blueberry, and/or rhubarb pie.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you make that all today already?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I made some last night but yeah, I did most of it today.\" Danny was about to continue when Ethan's stomach let out a loud growl, the smells finally getting to him and triggering his hunger drive. Ethan blanched a little but Danny was delighted, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're hungry I could get some for you to eat. Besides, I do need a taste tester,\"<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Ethan tried to say before his treacherous stomach let out another growl and Danny gave him a weird look. \"Oh okay, maybe a little.\" Danny smiled heading to the kitchen. \"Make yourself at home!\" he called back and Ethan took off his shoes and sat on the couch. Pretty soon Danny was coming back with a giant pot of chili which he placed down, then went to get the fried chicken. Ethan asked if Danny wanted any help but Danny waved him off. \"Nah, I just want this to be something special for you. Besides, you're going to help me decide on what I'm going to bring.\" Ethan wasn't sure therefore why he needed to test the chili and fried chicken but Danny seemed insistent and he was getting more excited and hungry by the second as he barely restrained from pouncing on the food until Danny had backed off. Suddenly a thought popped into Ethan's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this is a bake sale, what bake sale sells Chili and Fried Chicken?\" Danny shot him a death stare that actually made Ethan quiver a bit. <br>\r\n\"Its Beacon Hills, its a combination of desserts and cooking and people bringing whatever they want. It's just called one though I suppose a better name would be Potluck, just go with it okay? I really want to know what you think.\" Shrugging, Ethan took the spoon Danny offered and dipped it into the meat chili and tasted. The long orgasmic groans of enjoyment and lip-smacking were more than enough as Ethan started to shovel it into his face. Danny took the chair opposite watching, extremely aroused by the sight and sounds. Watching Ethan stuff his face like that and making those sounds over his cooking...one of the most erotic things he had ever seen and heard. He hadn't actually intended for that to happen and really had just honestly wanted Ethan's opinion but fuck wow this was a way better reaction and something that needed to happen again. Perhaps he did need to start cooking more. Fantasizing a little, Danny was surprised to see that Ethan had actually just about finished the entire pot of chili. That about made Danny cum until Ethan actually upped and started eating the fried chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Danny thought to himself. \"I can't believe Ethan is still going.\" He could see the bulging outline of Ethan's belly against his shirt and the bottom part peeking out a little bit. Danny bit his lips, trying to not make any audible noises as Ethan did have extremely good hearing but he did let out an embarrassing whimper which got Ethan to briefly look at him while he gnawed on fried chicken like a hungry animal before returning to his feast. Danny suspected Ethan planned on finishing everything but that was okay because he could always make more and this still was the most fucking amazing thing he ever witnessed and needed to repeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had torn through the fried chicken very quickly before he started upon the first pie which was cherry. That honestly wasn't his favorite flavor (that would be apple) but he still liked most flavors and everything Danny made was absolutely stunning. Taking his first bite, he nodded. It was most assuredly amazing. Danny really did a great job cooking as everything was absolutely perfect. The pie wasn't big but it felt filling after the fried chicken and chili and he was finally beginning to feel a bit full at last. Licking the last crumbs up, he felt stuffed and finally was aware of the condition his body was in, his belly digging against the confines of his pants and jutting out from underneath the bigger shirt which no longer felt so big. Danny was staring at him with some weird sort of expression on his face that was making Ethan nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Ethan started before he burped really loudly and long, it sounding like a gunshot in the awkward silence. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP\" Ethan flushed in embarrassment and Danny stared some more before his mouth twitched into a smile which made Ethan feel better, especially when Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one. Thanks for the compliment\" and Ethan laughed. Danny walked over and sat beside Ethan on the couch and touched Ethan's quivering belly. <br>\r\n\"I can't believe you ate so much. This looks uncomfortable. Mind if I help?\" Danny asked gesturing to Ethan's pants. Ethan nodded and Danny felt a bit. pushing up Ethan's overhanging gut until he found the strained button and undid it. This allowed Ethan's poor pent up gut to surge forward and he gave a sigh of relief. Danny was a bit surprised at how big Ethan had gotten since he was used to the hard-bodied Ethan with perfect abs that even made him kind of jealous, but now it was all stretching forward and kind of jiggly, Danny smirked as he maneuvered the pants off Ethan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you still got room in your stomach for a bit more,\" Danny said grinning. Ethan moaned no which turned into happy groans when Danny started massaging his aching stomach. \"I still need to know what you think of the rest of the pies.\" Ethan acquiesced, not wanting to disappoint Danny and totally enjoying the belly massage he was getting, and slowly began to start on the next pie. At least this one was an apple his favorite and between the delicious taste and Danny's massages, Ethan choked down the apple pie feeling really stuffed now. Letting out another tremendous belch, Ethan pushed himself back against the couch and trying to let his poor abused stomach distend further. Danny was moving faster now, encouraging him to eat just a little bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ethan, there are only two pies left. I know you can do it after I saw you eat everything else.\" Ethan moaned.<br>\r\n\"I'm so full though, it hurts.\" He said, adding his own hands to join Danny's rubbing his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only just a little bit more, don't worry. I'll give you a special reward if you finish.\" Ethan was about to inquire what Danny meant when he felt Danny grab his dick and lovingly stroke it through his underwear. Twitching, Ethan grinned and then frowned when Danny removed his hand and stepped back, pointing at the pies. \"I need to know what you think. If you finish one I'll get you off and if you finish both I'll give you a blowjob.\" Ethan was turned on, especially by how assertive Danny was being and he really did want the latter so he summoned his last inner resources and picked up the fork and continued to eat. It was complete utter agony because while the flavor was delicious, it felt too much and he was trying to not throw up as he much more slowly than before, ate blueberry. Eventually though he finished and he glared hatefully at the last pie which sat there taunting him. It had to be rhubarb didn't it? Although properly cooked it wasn't harmful to werewolves, he still thought it just honestly tasted nasty and he almost threw up at the thought of eating it. It was only the thought of Danny being happy, not to mention the reward, that motivated him to keep going. It took him what felt like an eternity but Ethan actually managed to do it. Danny smirked and made good on what he promised. </span></div></div>",

I'm actually kind of excited.\" Aiden stared at her. <br>\r\n\"You don't have a problem with this?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Why would I? Its a natural result of supernatural phenomena. Who knows what the rules are? I've just learned to roll with these things around here. After all, I'm a banshee, my friend is a hunter, my other friend is a kitsune, you guys are all werewolves, Jackson was a Kanima, and Stiles is...Stiles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a reason you actually said your ex-boyfriend's name?\" growled Aiden. <br>\r\n\"Jackson?

He hasn't called or texted once during the past couple months. Besides, I'm having fun with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good,\" Aiden said relieved. While he would be reluctant to admit it, Lydia had been growing on him and he might be having...feelings?...for her or something. Not as close as Ethan but of the general mill people Lydia had to be the closest. Then Scott sort of but romantic wise maybe Lydia. His brother thought that was hilarious but there was just something about Lydia. Plus, she liked to play and he liked to play and they certainly made wonderful play together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the damage? I'm curious,\" Lydia asked, tugging up Aiden's shirt. Her eyes fixed on his slightly distended stomach. \"That's it? I thought it would have been more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of digested for the most part but I've been one of the least affected. You should have seen Derek, Scott, Peter...\" Lydia gave a wide grin.<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god Peter. Take that asshole\" Aiden looked at her funny. \"What? Peter is Peter and the thought of that vain self-loving idiot getting big amuses me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your friends Scott and Derek?\" Lydia frowned. <br>\r\n\"Okay true but again, you guys can't help it and we always need to roll with this so uh...I hope they enjoy?\" Aiden smirked. <br>\r\n\"Heartless.\" <br>\r\n\"Am not,\" she smacked him and winced. \"Oww, stupid werewolf bulk.\" He grinned at her tauntingly flashing his fangs and then groaned as she ran her hands up his chest. \"Wonderful werewolf bulk. You're so much bigger and stronger than Jackson anyhow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you could talk about how much better I am than your ex,\" AIden flexed. Lydia nodded as she felt him. <br>\r\n\"Well, you're both cocky douchebag assholes. Fortunately for you that seems to be my type.\" <br>\r\n\"You mean dominant alpha male?\" Aiden bragged. <br>\r\n\"You mean when you think you're dominating me and I make you my bitch riding you until you beg for mercy? Jackson never did that plus he was a real jerk. Well, you are too but less of one.\" <br>\r\n\"You say the sweetest things,\" Aiden groaned. Suddenly Lydia removed her hands and he opened his eyes confused. \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You're going to work for it.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n\"Pizza.\" She turned her back and went to the phone, giving AIden a show as she swung her hips.<br>\r\n\"What?\" He was confused. <br>\r\n\"I mean if you guys have to do it, then maybe I want to see. Hey, I'd like an order of um...3?\" she turned her head to look back at him and he shrugged, \"actually make that 5 extra-large carnivore pizzas with all the meat? Also, two boxes of breadsticks.\"  She gave the address and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there going to be a party or something?\" Aiden asked. <br>\r\n\"No silly, that's all for you.\" Aiden raised his eyebrows. <br>\r\n\"While I do have increased appetite and werewolf metabolism, I don't think I'd be able to eat 5 pizzas so you know. You should have done that to Peter though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually a good idea, I should do that sometime,\" Lydia said. Aiden laughed. <br>\r\n\"Wow you are cruel.\" <br>\r\n\"Not really but the opportunity to mess with his head like he messed with mine...well, I think it warrants some payback.\"<br>\r\n\"I hope I get to watch. But umm again, I don't think I will actually be able to eat 5 pizzas. Derek or Scott maybe though.\"<br>\r\n\"Shush, only as much as you can handle...and a little bit more.\" <br>\r\n\"Is this really necessary?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Aiden trailed off. They waited for the order to arrive, Lydia rubbing her hands all over him and telling him exactly what he will get for being a good boy and as good as the playtime was, he was excited to begin so Lydia could get to the good stuff and the door bell couldn't ring fast enough for him. He twitched in anticipation as Lydia opened the doorbell and the strong smell of cheese and meat pizza wafted through the house. He ran his tongue over elongated teeth and he could already feel his face transformed. Unusual since it wasn't directly a full moon but due to the cosmic phenomena it didn't need to be to force out the wolf. When Lydia came back she smirked seeing him salivating. His face might have scared her and it definitely might have if he was going to hurt her, but now that Aiden wasn't with the Alpha Pack and trying to murder her friends and she was sure he probably wouldn't hurt her, how she had no idea but she did, it was kind of adorable. In the supernatural scary monster way. It was a relief not to see red glowing eyes though because she still had nightmares with Peter's as he chased her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed her fingers through the thick hair that covered his face and chest. \"I've never been much into hairy dudes before but you at least persuade me,\" she murmured. Then she straightened up and grinned. \"Besides, I've got pizza! With all the meat toppings that I know you love, being a carnivore and all. He rolled his eyes at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it to me now,\" he snarled, the words distorted by his shifted mouth. The loud growling of his stomach betrayed the hunger that the smell had awakened in him. She set the boxes of pizza in front of him and stepped back as he opened the first one in a blur of speed, the first piece already in his clawed hands and half gone into his mouth. It was a tad terrifying but also interesting to watch Aiden eat, piercing each piece with clawed hands before tearing into it like a wild animal, which he was. It was in almost no time at all before he got through the first box and started on the second. Making growling noises and other sounds that Lydia guessed were enjoyment but was hard to tell, Aiden buried his face into the box and stopped using hands to just use his head. Okay then, he was just tearing into it. Lydia was just glad it wasn't flesh which was all too easy to imagine. Pushing aside the second box, Aiden reached for the third box and Lydia was amazed. It took only 10 minutes, perhaps 15 at the most to eat through those pizzas and they weren't small by any means. Then again, he was a werewolf and probably ate a whole deer in a sittig so maybe it wasn't so surprising. That was just a ton of meat though on those pizzas though. The third pizza went extinct much the same way the first two did and then the fourth. Aiden was finally slowing down and the fevered hungry look was disappearing from his eyes as satiation overtook. His fangs drew back and his ears returned to normal as the fur withdrew and he was back in his human state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I've always wondered where the hair goes,\" Lydia said. \"Does it just magically disappear or return back inside or what?\" Aiden stared at her. <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Where does the hair go? I've always wondered.\" <br>\r\n\"I have to say inside sort of. I actually don't know how to describe it. You never asked Scott or Derek?\"<br>\r\n\"No. Never got the opportunity or kept forgetting. Plus it would be kind of awkward and embarassing.\"<br>\r\n\"You embarassed?\" Aiden scoffed. \"I don't believe it.\" He thumped his stomach and let out a loud belch. \"Uuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrppppp oh yeah that hit the spot.\" Lydia deemed it safe so she went behind him and wrapped her fingers around, feeling his stretched stomach that was pushing forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, I can't actually believe you fit all that in there. Well until you went wolf on it. But there is still a bit more room for more.\" Lydia pushed down bringing another loud burp from Aiden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this don't you,\" Aiden asked, leaning agaist her rubbing his stomach. <br>\r\n\"Just a little.\"<br>\r\n\"Liar. I smell you lying. You are definitely into this more than just a little.\" Aiden was a bit surprised but she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, its interesting, seeing you stuff yourself whether in wolf or human form.\" Lydia admitted. Not that she thought she could lie to a werewolf considering they could sense someone's heartbeat and sniff the perspiration when lying but still, she didn't really quite understand it herself. \"Well you do have breadsticks to finish,\" she teased as she rubbed his rounded bulging stomach. She opened the first box of breadsticks and waved it in front of his nose. His stomach gave a low gurgle and she grinned. \"Someone's still hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but stop waving it in front of my face and do something with it before I bite your hand.\" Lydia pushed it into his mouth and he opened obediently as she fed him the breadstick. Then she pulled out the next one and then the next one, feeding each one into Aiden's open mouth. She was impressed because despite complaining, he took each piece and ate it until she reached into the box and couldn't find another. She had fed them all. She was tempted to feed him the last box of pizza but by now Aiden looked stuffed, his poor stuffed stomach pushing heavly against his too tight jeans, abs buried underneath the weight of food he just consumed. Lydia took pity on him and saved it for later.</span></div></div>",

All these terrible things happening\u2026you\u2019d think there would be an end at some point right?\u201d Scott said, looking out over the school grounds. \u201cWhat are they doing, turning people into monsters?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Theo replied. \u201cThese\u2026Dread Doctors from the book. They\u2019re trying to create a new world or something.\u201d Scott swayed a little on his feet and Theo caught him concerned. \u201cScott are you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI felt a little woozy there for a second.\u201d Scott mumbled. <br>\r\n\u201cScott, tell me the truth. Are you okay for real?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve just been feeling sick for some reason lately and I haven\u2019t been sleeping well.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take you to the Nurse\u2019s office and lie you down.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sick\u2026.\u201d Scott said weakly.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just keep telling yourself that. You\u2019ve been under a lot of strain lately.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo, I have to\u2026have to find out what they want. I have to protect the others.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough Scott. The pack is fine. You need to take care of yourself at this time.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just feel responsible somehow. They all depend on me and I\u2019ve been doing a terrible job.\u201d Scott tried to sit up, but Theo put his hands on Scott\u2019s stomach and pushed down. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cStay Scott. The Pack is fine. It is you I\u2019m worrying about. You haven\u2019t been sleeping, it looks like you haven\u2019t eaten in days, and you can barely stand. <br>\r\n\u201cBut I have too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut nothing, if you can\u2019t take care of yourself, how can you expect to take care of them?\u201d Theo asked him. Scott let out a hollow laugh.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is\u2026that\u2019s actually a really good point,\u201d he muttered, his face flushing.<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Now let\u2019s go and get you something to eat before you pass out. And don\u2019t you dare so you\u2019re not hungry or I might have to smack some sense into you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Theo\u2026\u201d Scott sighed. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d Theo said. \u201cNow we have to get you better.\u201d Letting Scott lean on him, Theo helped Scott to his car. \u201cIn fact, don\u2019t even worry about the nurse or school, I\u2019ll just take you home. They\u2019ll understand.\u201d After Scott buckled the seatbelt of Theo\u2019s car, in the passenger side, Theo trotted off to the nurse\u2019s office to tell of the situation. Scott\u2019s mind wandered for a bit and he was started when Theo was back and tapping on the windows. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just checking on you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Theo got in and began driving. \u201cI guess you can stay at my house for a bit. My parents are out but I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind if you stay for a little bit.\u201d There was silence for the rest of the drive which Scott didn\u2019t mind because he was having a massive headache. Theo helped him out of the car and into the rather long driveway of a massive house. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually live here?\u201d Scott said amazed. <br>\r\n\u201cYep. Home sweet home.\u201d Theo input the keycode and the gate went up. \u201cNow come on, let\u2019s get you inside.\u201d Theo led Scott inside and Scott frowned at his dirty shoes and clothes, afraid to touch and get the slightest dirt on anything. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHere, get on the couch and lie down. I\u2019ve got some soup and cookies for you.\u201d Scott protested but after Theo helped him take off his shoes and moved him to the couch, Scott fell silent and couldn\u2019t help but stretch out and relax on the luxurious sofa. He didn\u2019t know couches could come this soft. Theo was soon back and placing a very large plate of cookies and a cauldron of sop down on the table in front of the couch. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAre those wolf shaped cookies?\u201d Scott asked amused and Theo smiled. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I couldn\u2019t help myself. Since we\u2019re werewolves you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is with the white stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know, wolves in sheep's clothing. I like puns and tricks.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo is this a trick?\u201d Scott asked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is not a trick,\u201d Theo said looking into Scott\u2019s eyes. \u201cI really am glad you\u2019re here and I want to take care of you. I want to make you feel better. You do so much for other people that it has been taking a toll on you. Let other people help you the way you help them. I want to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to take no for an answer are you?\u201d Scott asked looking at him.<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d Theo told him, popping his mouth at the o sound.<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then.\u201d Scott said. \u201cThen I accept.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSmart boy,\u201d Theo laughed. \u201cNow let\u2019s get some food in you before you collapse or faint.\u201d He picked up a cookie. \u201cWant me to feed this to you?\u201d He asked slyly. <br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m good, thanks. I can feed myself right now. But thank you very much for the food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d Theo smiled. \u201cTell me what you think about them okay?\u201d Scott nodded and then took a bite. Scott\u2019s face widened in surprise and Theo smirked a little seeing the look on Scott\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019re good huh?\u201d Theo asked, his lips curled up in a pleased expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah they\u2019re good,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThese might be the best damn tasting cookies I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them so much. I\u2019ve spent a long time working on them for you.\u201d Theo said.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t know you were going to be nearly passing out a couple of times from stress and not eating enough but I am glad you enjoy them. What did you eat yesterday?\u201d Theo asked Scott. Scott mumbled something garbled and even with super hearing, it sounded garbled to Theo. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d <br>\r\n\"Some toast, orange juice, a couple slices of pizza \u2026that\u2019s about it.\u201d Theo shook his head. <br>\r\n\u201cIs that all day? That\u2019s barely enough for a human your age, let alone with a werewolf metabolism. No wonder you\u2019re beginning to fall apart.\u201d Theo tsked, shaking his head. \"You need to eat more. That is not healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Scott started and Theo pointedly stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine? You call that fine? You almost passed out and have been drifting in and out of consciousness at school and the ride here. How do you expect to survive a Dread Doctor, or even regular supernatural attack in the state you\u2019re in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll find a way\u2026\u201d Scott said attempting to get up and Theo bodily shoved him back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, and no. If I have to smack some sense into you, I will. You\u2019re not well enough and I don\u2019t like seeing you suffer. You\u2019re too\u2026good for that.\u201d Theo frowned. \u201cI care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheo\u2026\u201d Scott started.<br>\r\n\u201cScott, eat the damn cookies and soup.\u201d Theo snapped. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d Scott said as he sat back down into the couch. He picked up another cookie and ate it, groaning a little. It really did taste fantastic. Looking at Theo, he saw Theo wink and nod at him encouragingly so Scott picked up another, and another. His blood sugar levels must have been low because he really was feeling better after each and every cookie and less that he was about to collapse. Theo was right about him not eating enough. After a dozen or so cookies, Scott slowed down, licking his lips clean of the white frosting. He wasn\u2019t sure why Theo decided to make Wolves-In-Sheep\u2019s-Clothing cookies but they tasted really good. Looking over, he saw Theo just looking at him and smiling encouragingly. He tilted his head and gave a nod towards the remainder of the plate of cookies and the giant serving of soup was. Clearly Scott was supposed to finish the whole thing. Scott didn\u2019t know why as he was feeling a little full from the cookies but Theo wanted him to finish. If Theo would feel better about Scott eating this stuff, then he was going to eat all this stuff. Shifting positions, Scott straightened and reached for another cookie and bit into it, giving little whimpers of delight from the burst of sugary goodness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all 24 cookies were gone and the plate licked clean of crumbs and frosting. Giving a little burp Scott stretched his arms and body back. Theo\u2019s eyes darted to the flash of skin and he found himself smiling at the sight of the little bump of Scott\u2019s belly filled with his treats. Scott looked good and happy and not skeletal. Now Scott just had to keep going. He eagerly watched as Scott took a spoonful of chicken noodle soup and sipped at it. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it? Is it a good temperature? It\u2019s not too hot is it?\u201d Theo asked worriedly. He wanted it to taste good to Scott. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine Theo,\u201d Scott smiled. \u201cActually, it\u2019s perfect, just like those cookies which were so good by the way.\u201d <br>\r\n\"I\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Theo said relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to burn your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine. I could handle hot soup. I mean, we\u2019re werewolves after all. But it really is at the perfect temperature at the moment now that it has cooled a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that. You're feeling better right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in fact I feel pretty stuffed,\" Scott said, rubbing his stomach. Theo's eyes followed the path Scott's fingers made on the taut skin. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, it looks good. It's much better than hungry or starving I say,\" Theo said smiling at Scott. <br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Scott said, pushing down and giving a satisfied burp and yawn. \"I'm feeling kind of tired.\" <br>\r\n\"Lay back and rest Scott,\" Theo said, coming over and kneeling in the space between the couch and the table. \"Let me take care of you. You deserve to be cared for.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Booth frowned slightly annoyed seeing that he had gained a little weight, he looked at the mirror and flexed showing off his muscles and even his belly grew hard showing that he wasn't losing any muscle just added weight. Booth looked again, this time with a more optimistic view this time. The added weight made him look more... beefier. As long as he kept his muscle mass in ratio to the added weight he'd keep his muscles and look big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs on queue, his stomach rumbled signaling his hunger, Booth swiftly dried himself off with his towel and put his clean clothes on.

As soon as it hit his table he began to devour one of the many burgers that he ordered. It had already been a week since he tried out his new regime, he had already gained a few pounds his stomach slightly bigger than it was yesterday but so was his muscles. His stomach though rounder was still firm as though he still had his six pack, actually, if he flexed you could see the six pack appear from the flab. His biceps were slightly bigger as well and his pecs a bit bigger as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Booth continued to eat he heard someone say \"Well good to see that you are eating well.\" Booth was already on his second burger and as he looked up he was surprised to see Sweets, his friend and colleague in the FBI. He hadn't seen him for some time as there weren't any murders to investigate for some time. He noticed that Sweets seemed... different in some way. As Booth scanned his friend he noticed that he seemed bigger. He looked to see that Sweets' belly seemed.. bigger. His face was a little puffier as well. He guessed that he wasn't the only one gaining weight, but he realized that unlike himself, Sweets wasn't gaining any muscle like him, making him appear soft and doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweets,\" Booth said while he was chowing down on his second burger, he stopped swallowed and then repeated what he said. \"Good to see ya\" he continued with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah its been a while, figured I would meet you at the diner around lunch time, I see that its been treating you well.\" Sweets said as he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw that I was getting some flab and decided instead of burning it off I thought I would beef up instead and although its only been a week, I have to say I'm quite impressed with the results,\" Booth said as he flexed his muscles. \"It seems that you've been gaining weight yourself, getting ready for the winter months\" Booth joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweets gave his goofy smile after hearing the comment. \"Well if you must know, I've actually been gaining weight on purpose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Booth said interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just like you I accidently gained some weight and.. I liked it... I mean I hated it at first but then it kinda grew on me, I loved how soft it was and when it would jiggle when I shaked my flab. I decided that I would get bigger, though its been kinda hard to gain weight, to be honest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooth was interested by this, he kinda liked the idea of Sweets getting bigger, not like him with his muscle and fat, but just fat, he was already imaging what Sweets looked like if he got bigger. \"you know what Sweets I'll help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?!\" Sweets said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what its like to want to get bigger, I mean I want to be beefy more than fat but I can understand why you want to get bigger.\" Booth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\" Sweets said, his stomach growled as if on queue making Sweets blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we needed to get started right away.\" Booth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Sweets chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweets was about to signal the waitress to order his food when Booth had an idea.

As he took a bite and the chocolate covered cream hit his mouth his stomach rumbled saying it he wanted more. Which Sweets was happy to oblige by. He began to tear through them and when he was done he started on the Pop-Tarts and so on till he couldn't eat another sweet thing. He felt so full and bloated that he took of his shirt and began to insticntly rub his bloated belly. Soothing the mass of junk he had just eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Sweets we haven't even started on the main course and you're already taken your shirt off.\" Booth said As Sweets looked over he saw Booth carrying a huge amount of food he prepared for Sweets.

Maybe we should hold it off when I'm not as full.\" Sweets said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, junk food doesn't fill the belly.\" Booth said as he shoved a hot dog in Sweets mouth forcing him to eat it. Sweets was trying to resist  feeling like he could burst at any moment but didn't have the strength to overpower him so he just chewed and swallowed whatever Booth fed him till everything was gone. With that Sweets collapsed, lying down on the sofa bloated beyond the point of max. Booth rubbed Sweets bloated stomach impressed with how much Sweets was able to contain. He cupped one of Sweet's pectoral wondering what it would be like soon when it was covered in fat. Then looking at his own body thinking of how big he was going to get.</span></div></div>",

Booth was admiring his bigger shirtless body in the mirror. He had put on a modest amount of fat and muscles. He had a basketball sized gt but it didn't sag or drop, with training his muscle his belly was firm and wasn't soft to the touch. Of course, that wasn't the only thing bigger. Booth's arms had swelled up with fat but were firm as well. His calves were huge, any bodybuilder would be green with envy seeing it. Booth kept making muscular poses viewing his new girth combined with muscle and fat. He smiled loving how his body was coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urp\" As Booth was admiring his new body he heard Sweets making more room in his growing stomach. Booth walked over to the sofa where Sweets was having his binge session. His face had a pained expression on his face and was giving his gut a nice rub. His belly had blossomed over the month. Unlike Booth's, Sweet's was soft and pillowy, it rested in his on his lap slightly. with small love handles forming at his side. And Booth's favorite part his moobs. They weren't big, but they were a nice pair of starter moobs that Booth like to toy with after Sweet's finished his binge. \"Man Sweets, you're getting big.\" Booth said as he began to rub Sweets bloated gut making Sweets mona slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't be as big as I am now if a certain someone wasn't always pushing food in my face.\" Sweets said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooth smirked, \"Hey I'm just helping you get fatter like you want and of course in exchange,\" Booth got up and began posing, \"you get a close-up view of my beefy bod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweets rolled his eyes, though he had to admit it was impressive not only was Booth joining in on his stuffing session but he had been keeping up with his training regime crafting a muscle gut. As Sweets turned his attention back over to Booth he saw that he was beginning to stuff his face again, something he typically did after a good workout.</span></div></div>",

Billy was making numerous poses shirtless like those bodybuilders would do. Steve knew that Billy was vain about his body and how he loved working out, and it looked like Billy was keeping track of his progress. Though there was something that Steve noticed and it was Billy's belly. In some photos Billy's belly was flat but in others, it was bloated or rounder. Steve wondered if Billy was letting himself go, though as he looked closer at some of the posters he could tell that his gut looked more solid than flabby. But before he could examine closer he heard the door swing wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrington!\" Billy yelled. Steve jumped shocked by Billy's dramatic entrance. Billy laughed seeing how jumpy Steve was. Oh man, you should have seen your face. Billy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Steve said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly looked around the old studio marveling himself. \"So do you like what you see,\" He said impressed with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like seeing the new bad boy letting himself go\" Steve quipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly glared at Steve. \"As if, I'm just bulking,\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Steve said with a hint of doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me?\" Billy said with a smirk, Billy then took off his shirt revealing his upper body. Steve then took a good view of Billy's body, it seemed more muscled than he remembered but instead of a six-pack, there was a rounded firm belly. \"Feel it,\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Steve said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel my belly. Steve hesitated, not sure what to do. \"Now Harrington!\" Steve then without a second thought Steve grabbed Billy's gut. But instead of Steve's hand sinking into Billy's flesh, he felt it firm and full. Steve hated to admit that it was kinda hot. Steve then darted his hand away not wanting to arise suspicion. \"Fat and muscle baby,\" Billy said giving a flex. \"Now you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Steve said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your shirt,\" Billy said. Steve looked dumbfounded by what Billy just said, not to mention he was embarrassed by his pudgy body. \"Now Harrington\" Billy demanded. Steve reluctantly took off his shirt, revealing the fat pooling in his belly, though it wasn't much it was clearly noticeable without his shirt on. \"Oh man, and you have the nerve to say that I'm fat\" Billy then went into grabbing Steve's fat which Steve's slapped Billy's hand away. \"Oh come on Harrington its all good fun I let you touch my belly,\" Billy said in a mocking fashion. As Billy went into for another touch Steve didn't resist this time. As Billy's hand touched Steve's belly roll, Steve blushed a little, Billy then gave it a little shake making Steve blush a little brighter. \"See was that so bad\" Billy smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what now,\" Steve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was getting a tad hungry, gotta eat a lot to keep bulking,\" Billy said as he rubbed his belly \"Wanna come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Steve asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have anything else better to do, obviously,\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Steve did what Billy said and got in his car and drove to Billy's place. It took a few minutes and when he arrived there, he can tell no one is home, not even Billy yet. So Steve was left with his thoughts for a bit and they were drifting towards that muscle gut Billy had, how firm it was and smooth. Steve shook his head, \"Why I'm I thinking that?!\" he thought aloud. Yet Billy was so confident in his belly unlike Steve, who was embarrassed with the small fat he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Billy's car pulled up and he got out of the car. \"Waiting long enough Harrington?\" Billy said a he walked up, holding two pizza boxes, to the front door and unlocked it. \"Let's go, Harrington,\" Billy said as the two walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a bit much of food?\" Steve asked as Billy et the boxes on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just plenty for this,\" Billy replied rubbing his belly, \"Now let's eat.\" Billy said grabbing two beers and sat at the table, where grabbed a slice of pizza. He looked at Harrington and said, \"Sit and join me Harrington.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sat at the table and grabbed his own slice. He realized that this ha been the longest that him and Billy interacted with each other without beating each other up.

Steve kinda wanted to stop but he knew that he wasn't a match for Billy, Billy would probably keep him pinned down if he tried to get up. But before Steve could continue his thought process another burger was slammed into his mouth and Steve could do nothing but chew. \"I know it might seem a lot now Harrington, but believe it will get easier the more we do it.\" Though words couldn't help the bloated feeling that Steve was feeling, was more and more food was forced into Steve's mouth the tight his gut was feeling.

Billy moved in closer to the helpless Steve and placed his hands on Steve's full gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing,\" Steve asked, helpless to do anything, but before he knew it he felt the pressure on his gut being relived and it was a comforting feeling, as he looked he saw that Billy was massaging his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do this all the time when I stuff myself helps relieve the pain after a binge\" Billy continued massaging Steve's gut who could only moan in response. \"Man Harrington you're gut is as tight as mine, almost as tight as mine anyway, you're just stuffed with food, and soon it will go back to being flabby gut it was\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Steve was gonna put on weight he was going to have to increase the amount he ate. Steve looked over to Jonathan, knowing that Jonathan was binge eating when he found him. \"How about you, are you in the mood to eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve said that Jonathan's belly let out a growl of hunger. Jonathan blushed embarrassed. \"Oh come now Jonathan there's nothing to be embarrassed about, you're surrounded by men who are gonna get big and fat, take pride in your gluttony,\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, if you say so, I guess I didn't eat as much as I usually did anyway, so I'm alright with eating out,\" Jonathan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so its decide, we eat out, don't worry you guys I have the perfect place,\" Billy said as he ushered both Jonathan and Steve out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Billy was the only one that knew the place he was the one the drove, both Jonathan and Steve thought they were lucky to be alive after being in the car with Billy.  He drove like a demon, they were surprised that they weren't pulled over for Billy's speeding. The trio headed up to the restaurant that Billy was talking about, Jonathan and Steve looked up at the sign which said \"The Scarlet Dragon\" the boys could only assume that this was some Chinese buffet restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I come when I need to eat a lot, cause you know gotta make sure I have mass,\" Billy said as he flexed his arm again. Steve rolled his eyes wondering how many times Billy was going to do this today. Billy opened the door and let Jonathan and Steve in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was rather quiet, which made sense it was a little the way out of town, but the atmosphere was good. It took no time at all for the three of them to be ushered ot a table and of course, they spent no time wasting as they headed over to the buffet table the three of them stacked their plates high filled with food. And then returned to their table. Which the three boys began to dig in. Steve was eating some egg rolls when he looked across the table, Steve tapped Billy on the arm who was sitting beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly was tearing into some orange chicken when he looked over to Steve. \"Dude what I'm trying to- holy shit,\" Billy said as he looked to where Steve was looking. Both boys looked in awe as they saw Jonathan who was sitting across from them basically inhaling his food. Jonathan paid no attention to his surroundings as Billy and Steve just looked on. As Jonathan finished everything on his plate he saw the stunned faces of Steve and Billy. \"Sorry I get kinda carried away,\" Jonathan said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that was hot,\" Billy blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jonathan said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man just seeing you just swallow your food like that was incredible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was impressive to watch,\" Steve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys,\" Jonathan said with sincerity in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway come on we got guts to fill,\" Billy said as he got you to eat more food with Jonathan and Steve closely following behind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 3 weeks since both Steve and Jonathan had joined Billy in gaining weight, both of the boys had gotten a call from Billy earlier today saying that he wanted to meet up with them back at the old studio. They could also assume that Billy wanted to take new pictures today so show off how their bodies had changed. Both Jonathan and Steve meet up outside the studio, Jonathan was wearing some baggy clothes trying to hide his growth, though he was comforted by both Steve and Billy he was still shy about letting other people see his new weight gain. While to contrast Steve was wearing his tight Scoops Ahoy uniform. Steve knew that Billy liked seeing him in ill-fitted clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... hey Steve,\" Jonathan said caught off guard by Steve's choice in clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see\" Steve smiled while showing off his figure. With Steve's new fatten figure, he filled out his uniform. His belly stretched against the fabric and his love handles were easy to see. Jonathan tried not to stare. \"Alright come on,\" Steve said trying to avoid another awkward moment between the two boys.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs the boys entered the studio they saw Billy getting the photoshoot set up while also curling a weight in his right arm. he heard the studio door close behind him and looked toward where the sound came from to see Steve and Billy enter the building. Billy was wearing a wife-beater, to show off his muscle body and of course his firm gut that stretched across his shirt. \"Hey, guys you ready?\" Billy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I guess\" Jonathan said with shrug, still sorta uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get started then,\" Billy said as he took off his wife-beater. He revealed his fattened muscled body. Steve noticed how Billy had slightly filled out since the last time they took their photos. Billy arms and legs had swelled up but they were still firm with muscle. You could still see how his biceps curved but a little more padding with the extra fat. His calves were also the same as his arms, and of course his muscle gut the jutted out from his midsection. It didn't sag at all. \"Well come on guys,\" Billy said getting a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was next to take his shirt off. His was a contrast to Billy's. While Billy was bulk, Steve was nothing but flab. His soft belly pooled in his lap, he didn't have an overhang yet but there were signs that it was starting. His pectorals were starting to soften and fatten up. Steve swore he saw Billy stealing a glance at them, not that he minded though, Steve secretly liked to fondle them when he was alone. \"Come on Jonathan,\" we all have to do it. Steve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan reluctantly took off his shirt, though his body was much different than both Billy's and Steve's, most of the weight was centered on his belly and was already getting slight back folds in order to support it. Though both Steve and Jonathan were just putting on weight one could say Steve had more emphasis on his moobs while Jonathan was more focused on his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly put the final adjustments on the camera, to make sure it was on a timer once everyone was shirtless. He then rushed over in range to the camera and began to make poses as the camera went off, Each pose showing off his muscles, something Steve and Jonathan couldn't look away from, both in awe of his strength and confidence in himself. As the camera fired its last shot, Billy went back to messing with the camera to get it set up for the next shot. \"Well come on Steve!\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Steve said as he got in front of the camera, Steve then began to make his own poses, hugging his developing gut, pushing together his moobs and jiggling them. Billy bit his lip finding every second of this hot. He was so happy to see Steve enjoying this...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air was still, until Shinra Infantryman Cloud Strife stumbled back, struggled as he barely managed to fight off a G-Reaper.  Panting heavily, he gripped his sword tight as the reaper roared viciously and charged at him full throttle.  Charging right back at the beast, the two exchanged blows, sword to scythe, their metal clashed again and again, until the beast kicked Cloud in the chest, knocking him flat on his back as the monster leaped up in the air and swung his scythe down for a killing blow.  Luckily, Cloud managed to roll away last second before the scythe could make mince meat out of the young blond.  In that brief moment, Cloud capitalized by slashing down at the beast, ending it on the spot.  \"Phew, that wasn't so bad...\" Cloud said with pride, albeit out of breathe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Level 1 complete.  Now beginning level two simulation,\" declared the AI announcer.  Suddenly several G-Reapers appeared from thin air, all around Cloud, causing him to gulp nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, SOLDIER Third Class Kunsel was wandering down the lower levels of Shinra when an enormous commotion from the VR Training Room caught his ear.  After what sounded sounded like a brutal battle ensued, Kunsel listened in to hear the announcer cancelling the Level 2 Simulation.  Moments later, a bruised and battered Cloud exited the Training Lab, beaten and humiliated...again, only to be greeted by Kunsel's friendly smile as he said, \"Hey, you're that new Infantryman, right?  The one who helped Zack stopped Genesis in the mountains?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, yeah,\" responded a still dazed Cloud.  \"Nice to meet'cha.  Name's Kunsel.  Soldier Third Class.\"  Kunsel shook the boy's hand as Cloud offered a faint smile and said, \"Cloud.  Nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n\"So I hear you're gonna be part of Zack and Sephiroth's new field team, is that right?  Pretty cool, man.  I'm guessing that's why you're running VR so late.  My advice?  Don't take it too personally if Zack or Sephiroth make the rest of you guys look bad in the field.  Very few are on par with those two.  Only ones I can think of were Angeal and Genesis, and well, you know what happened to them...\" said Kunsel as his smile faded a bit.  Curious and a bit concerned, Cloud turned a bit more attentively to Kunsel and asked, \"So...how's he been doing?  Y'know...since the mission in the mountains-\"<br>\r\n\"You mean since he took down Angeal?  Well....he's tough, man, and sure, he puts on a strong or happy face, but he's human, just like you or me.  It's never easy losing a friend and mentor....and I can't even imagine how it'd feel to lose them to your own blade...but I'm sure he'll be fine.  He's the man afterall!  Anyway, good meeting you, man!  And best of luck on the field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel headed out for the night.  Still dirty and beaten from training, Cloud opted to wash up real quick before heading home.  After a brief shower, Cloud dried up in the Shinra Locker rooms, dressing up in his casual long sleeved blue shirt and black pants, when he spotted a familiar face sitting on a bench nearby; Zack.  Cloud wanted to greet him, but he could see that he was in a deeply focused state as he examined Angeal's parted Buster Sword.  Before he could say anything, Zack noticed the younger man in the reflection of the blade and turned to him, his face immediately lighting up at the sight.  \"Oh, hey, Cloud!  Long time no see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit nervously, Cloud walked up to Zack and shook his hand and said, \"Hey, Zack.  Good to see you again.  Looking forward to working with you.\"  <br>\r\n\"Same!  Sooooo, what're you doing 'round these parts so late?  I thought Third Class and Infantry were off the clock.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, we are.  I just, ummm, thought I'd do a lil training in VR before tackling any field missions.\"<br>\r\n\"Pffft, dude, with the way you handled yourself on our first mission together, I think you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"B-but Professor Hollander escaped because of me...\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, he escaped because he's a slippery slimeball.  Besides, at the time we all had more pressing threats than that fat scumbag.  Like Genesis and...well, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.  I just, really don't want to let you guys down.\"<br>\r\n\"You won't, man.  Trust me.  We'll get Hollander sooner or later.  Meantime, we got the week off since G-Copy sightings are all but non-existent now that Genesis is gone.  Spend that time chilling and enjoying some YOU time, y'know?\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cloud could say anything else, a loud, hungry rumbling emanated from his stomach, causing him to blush with embarrassment as he covered his stomach and tried to silence it, earning a laugh from Zack.  \"I take it you haven't eaten yet?\"<br>\r\n\"Heh...i-it kinda slipped my mind, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Zack grabbed Cloud by the arm and playfully pulled him out of the locker room and back into the main lobby.  \"Rule number one of being in SOLDIER; NEVER head into battle on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n\"THAT'S rule number one...?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it should be.  Now come on, let's grab a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n\"It's kinda late, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly, which means fewer customers to worry about.  There's plenty of places around Midgar that're open well into the night.  Besides, I'm so hungry, I could eat an extra large Chocobo...\" said Zack as he rubbed his own stomach hungrily.  Glancing back at Cloud, he smirked and said, \"My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his eyebrows, Cloud paused for a moment, and said, \"Weeeeell, in that case, lead the way, boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do the two eat at?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a lengthy stroll through Migdar, the two teens eventually make their way to Midgar's All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.  Doing his best to maintain composure, Cloud simply smirks while Zack is practically drooling at the mere word Buffet.  Happily, both boys headed right in.  Zack paid up front and immediately the two headed over to the food selections, still fresh, steamy and unoccupied.  Cloud got himself a plate of roast beef and potatoes and found a seat, while Zack returned with what appeared to be a mountain of food stacked on top of a plate.  Cloud glanced in utter bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you weren't kidding when you said you were hungry...\" said Cloud, to which Zack scoffed upon glancing at Cloud's plate and said, \"Yeah, but apparently you were.  C'mon, we're at a Buffet.  Get your moneys worth, man!  Here, tell you what-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying that, Zack took Cloud's plate and swapped with his infinitely larger plate, causing Cloud's eyes widen with intimidation at the mere sight of so much food at once.  \"I'm gonna go refill this plate, you show me what you can do.\"  Zack rose and began to stock up with many of the same entrees he had stuffed on what was now Cloud's plate, until he returned with yet another mountain of Buffet food under a plate and sat down across from Cloud, who was still just looking at his plate.  Finally, Zack said, \"Come on, dude.  You're in SOLDER now.  There's no pussy footing around.  Show me you got what it takes to be on our team.\"  With that, Zack immediately dug into his plate hungrily and voraciously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud, a bit more refined, stuck his fork in and pulled out a dumpling which he promptly stuffed into his mouth.  As he chewed on it, he noticed Zack was literally shoving food into his gaping maw like a madman.  Luckily no one was around to bare witness to such a sight, though Cloud suspected Zack probably wouldn't care too much.  As he swallowed his dumpling, his stomach roared hungrily for more.  Placing a hand on it embarrassed, Cloud blushed for a moment, then glanced back at the mountain Zack had just ordered him to 'overcome'.  \"Well, if it's for SOLDIER...\" Cloud said to himself before taking another dumpling and stuffing it into his mouth.  The young blond chewed a bit quicker and gulped it down heartily, finding himself to be enjoying the taste before he took another bite, and another, and another.  Before he knew it, he too, had become a human vacuum, inhaling whatever delights he could fit into his mouth, much to Zack's approval.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing down a comically large mouthful, Zack gulped it down and sighed with relief as he leaned back in his chair and patted his stomach and smiled back at Cloud who was still shoveling food into his gaping maw.  \"That's the spirit, bud!  Keep it up!\" he said with approval as Cloud simply kept on eating.  As Zack proceeded to resume his own feast, he looked past the mountain of food Cloud was consuming and down to the younger teens stomach.  Much to Zack's surprise, it had vaguely begun to bloat outward ever so slightly from Cloud's rapid food intake.  He promptly smirked, doubly impressed by the young blond's drive, then proceeded to resume his own stack of food...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time had passed as Zack continued to work on his pile of food.  In the midst of his consumption, he heard the CLANK of a fork dropping onto an empty plate and looked up, to see Cloud's plate picked bone dry, while Cloud himself leaned back satisfied as he picked at something between his teeth and rested one hand atop his just slightly bloated stomach.  A satisfied grin grew across his face as he said, \"Mmm, man, you weren't kidding, Zack.  That was some good eating!\"<br>\r\n\"Damn, that's gotta be some kind of record eating pace, dude!  Don't think I've ever seen anyone in SOLDIER put away so much food so quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, Cloud rose from his seat and headed back to the buffet line.  \"Dude, no way...\" was all Zack could mutter as he watched Cloud pile on even more meats, and side entrees on a larger sized plate than before.  \"Huh...this could be interesting...\"  With that, Zack resumed working on the sizable remainder of his own ample meal.  Taking a huge bite of pasta, Zack looked up with awe as Cloud dropped his massive plate with a heavy thud atop their table.  Piled on it were various ribs, fried and BBQ'd chocobo, egg rolls, more mashed potatoes, and a few slices of pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude....\" was all Zack could mutter, earning a smirk from Cloud as he replied with, \"You said it yourself, if I'm gonna be in SOLDIER, I gotta see how far I can push myself, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, guess so,\" was all Zack could say.  He found himself actually rather eager to see if his new pal; a thin and fellow countryboy could really put away so much food or not.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he watched the blond eat as ravenously as he'd ever seen anyone eat in between his own bouts of ravenously devouring the rest of his own plate.  Cloud was like a machine, tearing the meat off the ribs and scarfing it down one bone at a time.  Occasionally, he'd get some BBQ sauce on his face which he'd promptly lick off whatever he could and wipe the rest with a napkin.  In no time at all, his ribs were reduced to a pile of sauce laden bones while Cloud worked his way towards his fried chocobo wings and drumsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, and Zack had all but completely stuffed himself on his first large plate alone.  Thumping his chest a few times, Zack burped loudly and smacked his lips happily as he rubbed his satisfied stomach with his right hand.  He then proceeded to shift all his attention to Cloud, who had consumed his fried chocobo and was finishing up with the pizza and egg rolls like they were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cloud continued to stuff his face, Zack's focus shifted down towards his midsection.  The sheer volume of food Cloud had consumed in so short a time had caused it to distend and bloat outwards slightly more noticeably than before.  It was no longer a concave firm, but flat with the slightest bit of roundness forming at the surface beneath his blue long sleeved shirt.  Smiling a bit, Zack looked back up at Cloud, who had now just successfully polished off this next plate with relative ease.  \"Phew, that hit the spot!\" said Cloud as he patted his belly happily and licked his lips of some pizza sauce remnants.  As Cloud leaned back in his chair, feeling relatively satisfied with all he'd eaten, a feeling of ease wafted over the normally uptight and shy young man.  Fullness.  That heavy feeling in his belly, pushing the limits in such a way, that it actually felt quite good to the boy, and even though what he'd eaten would have satisfied anyone else for about a few days straight, he felt as though he could keep going if he absolutely wanted to.  But considering Zack had paid and it was getting late, he opted against it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like it's getting kinda late,\" said Cloud as he checked his watch.  Zack examined his to confirm and nodded as he pointed towards the exit.  \"Wanna jet?\"  Cloud nodded, and after the two boys had almost forced themselves to hoist up to their feet, they exited the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed back out to the nearly empty nightlife, Cloud smiled at Zack and said, \"Thanks a lot for the dinner, man!  I haven't eaten that great in years!\"  Nudging the blond playfully in the shoulder, Zack winked and said, \"Anything for a fellow countryboy, dude.\"  After bro-fisting each other, Cloud walked off, but after a moment, Zack stopped and added, \"Hey, Cloud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud stopped and turned his attention to the older boy.  \"Yeah, Zack?\"<br>\r\n\"Y'know, anytime you wanna go out and grab a bite, just hit me up.  Believe it or not, a lotta these dudes'll give us free meals for tending to Genesis and his G-Copies, and it'd be cool to kick back with someone from the countryside every now and then.\"  A moment passed before Cloud smiled back and said, \"Sounds cool, man.  Til next time!\"  And with that, Cloud took his leave...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a good while walking back to his apartment, Cloud's living conditions were all but bare, sporting a clean; albeit empty apartment with little occupation of furniture, photographs, or any real signs of residence.  Things seemed rather bare, and empty.  All things considered, it was the last thing on the young blond's mind, as he finally made his way home and plopped down wearily upon his couch, exhausted from the day of training, and night of binge eating.Resting one hand atop his once again thin, and firm stomach, Cloud reminisced back to that sensation of fullness.  It wasn't one he was particularly used to or too familiar with, but boy did it feel good at the time.  Lifting up his shirt, he examined his smooth, bare stomach's flat surface.  Once again, completely flat, muscle toned, and lacking of any additional or extra weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cloud had always maintained a physically perfect physique, he couldn't help but frown due to the lack of that previous sensation.  That fullness was something part of him greatly wished to experience again.  In fact, Cloud began to wonder how far his concave stomach could truly go if pushed to its' absolute limits, and he wondered if perhaps Zack might just be the person to help him reach that state.  He certainly seemed intrigued in watching Cloud push himself to his limits, and was even going as far as to encourage and challenge him all the way onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the boy's muscularly thin stomach let out a rather audible growl.  Dropping his shirt to once again cover his bare torso, Cloud rose up from his couch and headed towards his kitchen, examining the contents of his fridge to see if there were anything that could sate his hunger.  But nothing looked appetizing or more importantly, filling.  So Cloud grabbed his phone and was about to dial for late-night takeout, but then he stopped and wondered if maybe Zack was serious about continuing to push him.  Standing in his kitchen for a moment with his phone at hand, Cloud thought for a moment, then finally, decided to...</span></div></div>",

So he grabbed his phone and dialed Zack's home number; one hand still rested atop his hungrily gurgling abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hello?\" said Zack on the other line, causing Cloud to light up slightly.<br>\r\n\"Zack!  Hi!  Erm...h-how are you doing?\" asked a timid Cloud.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty late and I just woke up, sooooo peaches...whassup, Cloud?\"<br>\r\n\"What's up?  Well, I was...I was kinda wondering if....\"<br>\r\n\"Cloud, what is it?\"<br>\r\n\"-Are you serious about you willing to push me to my limits as SOLDIER?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Cloud smirks then presses his phone to his stomach so Zack can hear the loud gurgling emanating from it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" responded Zack as he listened in for a moment.  <br>\r\n\"I was thinking maybe I could come over and take you up on your offer, but-\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah!  Come on over!  I've got TONS of good eats lyin' around!  It'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Cloud, don't question a superior officer, just hop on by, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud smiles then agrees before Zack gave him his apartment address and hung up and immediately getting on his bike and peeling over to Zack's place.  Knocking at the door, he waited while his abdomen continued to gurgle viciously demanding food.  \"It's open, come on in!\" came Zack's voice from inside.  Cloud complied and headed inside, looking around the not-so-surprisingly messy apartment of Zack Fair, only to find him in the kitchen; wearing only a sleeveless tanktop and board shorts, piling several dozen dishes on his counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up, dude?\" asked Zack as he warmed up some steak and potatoes.  \"Wow, you weren't kidding...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I'm usually too busy on the field or training to ever really eat half this stuff.  Don't worry, none of it's expired.  In fact, I get most from grateful citizens.  Heh, what better way to thank the heroes than by plumping 'em up, right?\" responded Zack with a smile as he patted his ripped stomach for emphasis, earning a chuckle from Cloud.  Finally, Zack pulled out an extra large Pizza and placed it on the table with a 2L bottle of soda.  He then opened the box and let the rich smell of melted cheese and peperoni fill Cloud's nose.  \"What better way to start than the classics, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud glanced back at Zack for a moment then went wide eyed.  \"Y-you want me to finish that WHOLE pizza?\"<br>\r\n\"All sixteen slices.  A good way to start, don'tcha think?\"<br>\r\nBut Cloud didn't respond.  He was too dumbstruck at the notion to say anything to the contrary.  Seeing this, Zack smirked than sat the younger man down at his table in front of the pizza.  Cloud paused for a moment, when suddenly his stomach ROARED for subsistence. Feeling this, Cloud winced, then glanced back at the pizza and nodded.  \"Alright, let's do it!\" he said as he grabbed the first slice and stuffed a good chunk of pizza straight into his mouth, biting almost a third of the pizza slice in one bite, chewing immensely before gulping it down.  As the flavors burst unto his tongue, Cloud smirked then took another bite, and another, until the first slice was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, he grabbed the next slice, and proceeded to eat it in all but three massive bites, earning an impressed smile from Zack.  \"Not bad, dude.  Not bad at all...\"  Hearing this, Cloud smirks a bit more confidently and proceeds to take even larger bites of his third slice and down it all in TWO massive bites, which he spent more time chewing before gulping heartily and sighing with relief as each mouthful of pizza slid down his throat and deposited into his ever-so-hungry gullet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cloud continued to gulp down his slices two surprisingly massive bites at a time.  Zack's eyes wandered from Cloud stuffing his face to his stomach.  All the while, as he did, his stomach would push outward just ever so slightly, to where it was no longer perfectly concave, but now flat and just slightly rounded outward a little bit.  Eight slices of pizza gulped down, Cloud groaned in moderate discomfort and leaned back against his chair, rubbing his belly in an effort to coax the tense pain that was brewing from within.  \"Urgh...my stomach hurts,\" complained Cloud as he clutched his abdomen firmly.  Zack shrugged and said, \"That'll happen, man.  Your stomach isn't used to taking in so much in so large a volume at so quick a pace.  You're trying to eat too fast.\"<br>\r\n\"Lesson number one, I guess...\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess so.  What do you feel exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh....just a lot of pressure in my upper stomach...\"<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, is THAT all?  Jeez, why didn't ya say so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud stared at Zack curiously beneath the pain he was feeling, then continued groaning.  \"Rgh, w-what is it, Zack?\"  Zack smirked and said, \"Don't worry, like I said, you were eating a lot more and a lot faster than your stomach is used to, so it's taken on a lot of the air that came with your meal being scarfed down so quickly.\"<br>\r\n\"Meaning what exactly?\"<br>\r\n\"Meaning all you gotta do is burp and your stomach'll feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud's eyes widened slightly, before he put on a cool face and said, \"O-oh, heh...is that all?  Okay...\" he then nervously sat up for a moment and opened his mouth as he pounded his fist to his chest a few timse, but nothing came out.  Zack raised an eyebrow curiously as Cloud grinned a bit nervously and said, \"Uhhh...g-guess it's stuck or something.  Maybe I should just eat some more and it'll come out on its' own?\"<br>\r\n\"Bad idea.  You try and eat with all that pressure building and you're gonna feel even sicker.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Well, see the thing about it, Zack...\" Cloud said as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, \"...I, uhhh...don't know how to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack simply sat there for a moment, scratching his head.  \"How to do what?  Wait, you dunno how to burp?!\"  Cloud shrugged and said, \"No one ever taught me.\"  Rolling his eyes, Zack shuts the pizza box close for a moment and turns to Cloud.  \"Okay, watch carefully...\" Zack said as he stood up straight and proceeded to gulp down some air.  \"The key to burping,\" Zack said with a bit of a strained voice, \"...is to gulping down as much air from your esophagus as you can into your stomach.\"  Pressing one hand against his stomach, Zack continued sinking his chin into his neck as he gulped down more and more air.  \"You'll start to feel your stomach expand with all the air you're taking in.  And then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud watched a bit confused as Zack stopped and after thumping his fist into his toned chest, pushed out a mighty and lengthy belch which carried on for almost 4 seconds straight.  \"And there you have it!\" said Zack as he sighed and patted his stomach proudly.  Cloud, however, scratched his head and; in a classic blond moment, said, \"Yeaaah...I'm not exactly sure how to do any of that...\"  Hearing that, Zack immediately facepalmed before turning to the fridge and returning with a 2L bottle of soda, earning a nervous gulp from Cloud.  \"Drink up,\" said Zack.  Less than anxiously, Cloud unscrewed the top, and after a moment, brought the whole bottle up to his lips as he proceeded to slowly gulp down the fizzy beverage...</span></div></div>",

Shinra devoted every and any resource it could spare into wiping out the threat as best it could.  Determined above all others, was SOLDIER First Class Zack Fair.  Spending every waking hour he could, he searched the city and confronted all G-Copies head on, leaving each battle stronger yet no more victorious.  Every sword fight ended with G-Copies defeated and Zack victorious, yet they just kept on coming.  So long as Genesis, Hollander and unfortunately, Zack's mentor and friend Angeal were at large and degraded, the onslaught would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after one particularly draining day, Zack found himself wandering through the Slums.  Beat up, dirty, and utterly worn.  His entire body ached from his most recent battle with a G-Reaper, but for the time being; all was well.  So he thought he'd go and visit Aerith at the Church.  Opening the large doors, Zack wearily made his way down to the alter, where he saw Aerith picking flowers growing out of the grass patch before the main alter.  \"Still getting that Flower Cart ready, eh?\" asked Zack with a smile on his face.  Something about seeing Aerith could always bring a sprig of energy back into the young man's step.  She simply smiled back at him and nodded.  \"They've been getting plenty of sunlight so I thought I'd start sampling them to the people in the market,\" she replied, continuing to pick more wild flowers from their roots and stuff them into dirt vases.<br>\r\n\"Smart thinking.  May as well get a good jump start when the season's right.  Need a hand?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness no.  You've been wearing yourself paper thin dealing with the threat to Midgar, I don't want you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed as best he could given his current state and said, \"Trust me, compared to fighting the never ending G-Dorks, wheeling a flower cart around will be like a day at the spa.  Besides, it gives me a chance to spend more time with you,\" he said a bit more tenderly as he brushed her bangs and gave her a warm hearted smile.  She blushed and laughed to herself.  \"Oh okay, if you insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two continued picking flowers uninterrupted, when suddenly a loud rumbling sound echoed through the run down old church.  Aerith looked around curiously, trying to detect the source of the sound, eventually discovering it, when she looked back at Zack and saw his face flushed with embarrassment as his stomach roared hungrily for fuel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone could use a lunch break,\" she said light heartedly as she jokingly poked Zack's six pack, causing him to chuckle sheepishly.  \"Okay, I'll admit, fighting the G-Dudes takes a bit out of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how hard Zack had been fighting, Aerith wanted to make this special, so she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Noticing he was the only one in the gym, he removed his shirt and let the air conditioning waft down over his sweat covered body.  He sighed with relief before sitting down on the crunch machine, and worked several sets of sit-ups, with no signs of slowing down.  The young man always had plenty of energy to spare, and never tired easily, which made keeping his physique sculpture perfect was much easier for him than most of his fellow SOLDIER employees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after he could crunch no more, Zack plopped onto the crunch bench, breathing heavily from exhaustion.

Hey dude, w-what's shaking?\"  Said Zack as he tried to play off his little accident.  Kunsei merely laughed, then looked around the gym.<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I didn't think the weight room was open this late.  Go figure.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I figure it's easier to get a proper workout this way than having to fight off 50 boneheads for a treadmill,\" said Zack as he grabbed his towel and wiped up.  \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I kinda wanted to thank you for saving my ass when Professor Hojo's VR Room malfunctioned.  One virtual Sephiroth was bad enough, but six glitchy ones?  Noooo thanks....\"<br>\r\nZack laughed then gave his pal a pat on the shoulder.  \"Don't sweat it, dude,\" said Zack as he grabbed his water bottle and downed it in seconds, before removing the bottle from his lips with a deep breath afterwards.  Kunsei was a bit nervous to continue, but worked the courage to ask, \"So, I was wondering if I could get you dinner, y'know, as thanks for your help.  How about it?\"  <br>\r\nZack glanced back at Kunsei, but before he could speak, a loud rumble emitted from Zack's stomach.  Embarrassed, Zack placed his palm flat on his six pack abs and laughed, \"Guess I DID kinda work up an appetite, hehe.  And a free meal don't sound too bad either.  But first, lemme hit up the showers.  I'm kinda stinking like a wet moogle over here.\"  The two boys laughed as Zack grabbed his duffel bag and headed for the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Afterwards~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took a bus from Midgar all the way to the Slums.  Zack, now dressed in a black sleeveless t-shirt and green board shorts exited the bus alongside Kunsei, who was still in his SOLDIER Uniform, minus the helmet, revealing short frizzy brown hair and blue as sky Mako fused eyes, like Zack and most SOLDIER employees.  \"So where are we off to?\" asked Zack.  His answer came as the two approached a modest restaurant near the flea market called 'Desperado's All-You-Can-Eat.'  <br>\r\n\"You'll love this place, man.  It's got everything and then some!  Not like those crappy second hand buffets in Midgar,\" said Kunsei as the two entered the buffet.  \"Good thing it's all you can eat, cause right about now, I think I could eat an Ifrit!\" said Zack as his stomach once again growled with anticipation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys sat at their booth, Kunsei brought back a modest plate of Grilled Chicken with Green Beans and a glass of Water while Zack came back with an assortment of Steak, Stuffing, Mashed Potatoes, French Fries and Fried Chicken Nuggets all on one plate alongside a glass of coke.  Kunsei was dumbstruck.  \"...Yoooooou realize you can make more than one trip, right...?\" asked Kunsei, to which Zack laughed and said, \"I'll be making plenty of trips, don't you worry, dude...\" said Zack before he began to hungrily scarf down his meal.  Kunsei couldn't help but watch as Zack began to clear his plate at an incredibly fast pace, and without any sign of slowly down.  \"Ho-ly-crap...\" said Kunsei to himself as he watched his friend put away an ample meal.  Kunsei had to admit, it was pretty damn impressive.  Finally, Zack finished and took a deep breath before grabbing his plate and heading back for another batch of food.  Finally broken from an almost trance-like state, Kunsei started eating his much leaner plate of Chicken as Zack returned with an even larger batch of assorted foods onto an even more cramped-tight plate than before.  Zack licked his lips and looked down at the meal to be with a smile, \"And now for round two....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei couldn't help but resume watching his friend chow down at inhuman paces, until...</span></div></div>",

Licking the remaining food remnants from his fingers, Zack sighed heartily before he leaned back into his seat and rested his hands on his his stomach.  As Kunsei glanced, he could see the other teen's tummy had bloated ever so slightly due to two simultaneously vast meals.  \"Ahhhh, you weren't kidding, Kunsei.  This place ROCKS!\" said Zack as he rubbed his hands over his still firm and rock hard yet vaguely extended tummy.  But Kunsei could only focus on Zack as he blissfully rubbed his belly up and down.  \"Uh, g-glad to hear it, man,\" stuttered a nervous Kunsei as he proceeded to resume working on his first plate.  Zack proceeded to pound his fist into his chest a few times, before working up a short but juicy burp.  Kunsei laughs nervously and says, \"Good one.\"<br>\r\n\"I try,\" responds Zack before he gets up and grabs his plate yet again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei looks up at him utterly in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't POSSIBLY still have room after that...\" says Kunsei.  <br>\r\nBut Zack merely shrugs back at his friend and says, \"Like I said, dude, I could eat an Ifrit right about now,\" he says with a smile before giving his belly a hearty pat and heading back for a third course.  Kunsei nervously drinks his water, trying to process what was going on.  Sure enough, Zack returned with even more food on his plate, and the same hungry look in his eyes.  <br>\r\n\"Oh, you can't be serious...\" Kunsei says to himself before taking another bite from his chicken.  <br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seatbelts,\" said Zack to no one in particular before greedily stuffing his face with one last assortment of meat, pasta and stuffing.  All the while as Zack stuffed his face, Kunsei watched Zack's stomach slowly began to extend little by little as his meal progressed.  After just a few short minutes, Zack had completed his meal and decided to wash it down with the glass of coke, which he downed in just a few seconds flat.  Exhausted, Zack plopped back into his seat and rested both hands on his stomach which had bloated out about three to four inches, nothing too big, but visibly noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, did you enjoy your meal?\"  asked Kunsei sarcastically.  Zack opened his mouth to reply, but what came out instead was a loud and booming belch.  <u><i><b>*BBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!*</b></i></u>  Laughing, Kunsei waves the air in front of him and smiles back at his friend.  \"I'll take that as a yes.\"<br>\r\nZack smiled sheepishly at other patrons then covered his mouth, \"Excuse me.  And yes, I enjoyed my meal very, very, very, <u><i><b>*URP*</b></i></u>...very much.\"<br>\r\nThe two boys laughed.  Then Kunsei paid the bill and the two were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kunsei walks Zack to the bus stop, Zack groaned and said, \"Ugh, y'know what?  I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it al the way back to Sector 7.\"  Kunsei thinks for a moment, then says, \"Well, actually I live about a block from here.  If you want, you could spend the night over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack considered Kunsei's proposal....</span></div></div>",

Consider this my way of meeting you half way there,\" he said as the two laughed and headed to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relatively small but clean place.  Had a small living room, a kitchen, a bedroom and a bathroom, everything a young bachelor would need in a place like Midgar.  Zack promptly took off his sandals and laid down onto the couch, feet resting on the arm rest while hands rested on his groaning stomach.  Kunsei looked back at him with some concern.  \"Are you okay?\" he asked.  Zack groaned but nodded.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, yeah.  Just...think I kind of overdid it back at the buffet,\" he said as he pressed down on his just slightly bloated stomach.  Kunsei shook his head, \"You THINK you overdid it...?\" he scoffed, but stopped as he noticed his friend was in legitimate pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, Kunsei sat on his couch next to Zack.  \"I THINK I have a solution, but I warn you, it may be a little weird...\" Kunsei says as he removes his gloves and gently pulls up the bottom of Zack's T-Shirt, exposing his smooth tan, muscular, aching belly.  Zack glanced up curiously, \"Rgh, what're you doing, man?\" he asked.  Kunsei then gently placed his palm flat atop Zack's stomach, and began rubbing in gentle, circular motions.  Zack's eyes widened for a moment, then after a brief pause, he began to ease back.  \"Your stomach's trying to work off a much larger meal than your usual intake is used to.  So this should ease the pain some of that work is causing you,\" Kunsei explains as he continues to stroke Zack's belly up and down in a slow, precise pattern.  Zack eased greatly as he seemed to be enjoying it.  \"Y'know what?  That actually...feels amazing....!\" Zack says as Kunsei smiles and continues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs little as he was willing to admit, the feel of Zack's smooth abs against his hand was a pleasurable experience for Kunsei as well.  This moment of tranquility was interrupted as another loud belch emerged from Zack's mouth.  <u><i><b>*BBBBRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRP!*</b></i></u>  Zack's burp extended for several seconds before it unwinded, causing Kunsei to laugh as Zack sighed with relief.  \"Ugh, sorry about that,\" Zack responded, but Kunsei smiled, patting Zack's belly assuring.  \"That's only normal.  In the process of easing the pain, the rubbing is also working up some of the excess gas that's stuck in your stomach,\" Kunsei responded.  \"Besides, what are you apologizing for?  It's not like you're shy about it at HQ.  I remember one time in the lobby, you burped so loud, the front desk lady thought Hojo's lab blew up again!\" Kunsei says, as the two boys laugh again.  \"Which was all natural, for the record!\" said a slightly less pained Zack.  Suddenly a loud bubbling began to brew from within his stomach as he and Kunsei both looked down at his bloated gut, \"Speaking of which, you might wanna hold onto something, because I feel a biiiiiig one coming up, man,\" he said almost nervously.  Suddenly Kunsei got an idea, \"Here, when you're ready, I'm gonna push down as hard as I can.  Ready?\"  Zack paused for a moment, then said, \"Ready!\"  With that, Kunsei knedded deep into Zack's bloated abdomen, the resulting rush of air was massive and lengthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*</b></i>{/u }<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's burp extended close to ten seconds straight, growing with bass and volume the whole way before it came to an end.  The two boys paused for a moment, then broke into a fit of laughter.  \"I officially declare you; Zack Fair, best burper of Midgar!\" Kunsei said mockingly as he gave Zack's bare belly a congratulatory pat.  \"Ahhh, I'm still nowhere near the same league as Angeal, but thanks anyway,\" Zack said as he sat up and pressed his hand against his stomach, \"Y'know, I think those fingers of yours are magic, cause my stomach doesn't hurt at all anymore.\"  he went on.  Kunsei shrugged and headed for his room, \"I try.  Anyway, it's getting late.  Lemme grab you a spare blanket and you can sleep on the couch.  Sound good?\"  Zack merely yawned from exhaustion and nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater into the night, Zack was laying on the coach, hand rested atop his stomach, which seemed to be back to normal.  However, as Zack lifted his up shirt and pressed onto his bare stomach, he noticed his abs had slightly less definition to them, feeling a bit softer than he was accustom.  But he was still far too full to care, and promptly went to sleep...</u></span></div></div>",

I mean, what the hell!\" he yelled silently so as not to wake up Kunsei.  But his stomach would not let up.

Zack's face went green as he begin to feel nauseated from the horrid smell, before immediately shutting it and throwing it back into the fridge.  \"Okay, second time's the charm.....right?\"  Zack said nervously as he hesitated before opening the second container.  Sure enough, a few steaks and some fries.  Smelled decent enough, so it was probably safe to eat.  Zack smiled as he tossed the meal onto a plate and into the microwave, watching and waiting eagerly before canceling the heat just a second before it would have gone off and beeped aloud throughout the tiny apartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the plate onto the table, he poured himself a glass of milk and dug right in, eating the steak with his bare hands rather than traditional fork and knife.  The steak tasted thick and juicy, each bite was better than the last.  As he ate, Zack rested his free hand down to his stomach, feeling its' current softness expand as more and more meat traveled downward into it.  Around two steaks in, Zack downed his glass of milk and leaned back in the chair, sighing contently as he massaged his once again bloated midsection from under his shirt, exposing his more noticeably stuffed tummy.  Zack brought his fist to his lips and muffled an upcoming burp in an effort to keep quiet.  The sound of the burp reverberating through his cheeks was still pretty loud, but much quieter than the alternative.  Giving his belly a good pat, he glanced back down at the remaining steak and fries and resumed his late-course meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Kunsei, dressed only in a black undershirt and striped boxers, rubbed his eyes before standing nearby and watching Zack continue to feast.  A few moments passed before Zack finally noticed his friend, and, like the first two times prior, was startled out of his seat, as Kunsei laughed quietly from how tired he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, Zack said, \"Kuh-Kunsei!  Umm, w-what're you doing up?\"  Kunsei stares curiously then says, \"With all the commotion earlier, I forgot to have my bedtime cup of milk.  So....having fun?\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm so sorry, I know I shouldn't be going through your fridge, it's just that-\" but Kunsei held his hand up, halting his explanation as he sat down next to Zack.  \"Hey, mi casa es su casa, pal.\"  Kunsei responded.  Zack tilted his head curiously.<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Look, if you're hungry enough to be gorging THIS late into the night, then absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack brushed the back of his head embarrassed and looked away.  \"Honestly, I don't know WHY I'm so hungry.  I just...AM!\" he said, almost ashamed.<br>\r\n\"Really, it's fine.  Besides, you're my guest, and I believe in being a good host.\"  After a moment, Zack looked back at the other boy and smiled, then proceeded to get to work on the last two steaks.  As he did, Kunsei  got up and reached for the milk on the table, pouring himself a glass.  As he drank, he glanced back down at Zack's tummy, which, shockingly, had bloated outward quite noticeably, at least 5 inches, enough to lift the bottom of Zack's undershirt up ever so slightly, exposing his bare stomach just below his belly button.  Kunsei was so distracted, he hadn't realized he was still drinking his milk and accidentally choked down the cold drink in one gulp, coughing violently as he finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stopped eating and looked back up at Kunsei.  \"You okay, dude?\"  Coughing, Kunsei nodded, pounding his chest a couple times before letting out a surprisingly loud burp.  Sighing with relief, Kunsei plopped into his seat next to Zack as he glanced at him rather impressed.  \"Nice one, man!\"  Kunsei blushes then shakes his head, \"Still nothing compared to one of yours, dude.\"  Zack shrugged and resumed eating.  Kunsei continued to watch as Zack's belly slowly pushed outward with each chunk of steak.  Finally, after some time, all the leftover steaks had been consumed along with the fries.  Zack was slouching back in his seat, a bloated mess.  His stomach bulged outward a good 6 inches as he rested both hands atop it, in utter bliss.  \"Ohhh man, am I stuffed...\" Zack said as he glanced down at his bloated gut.  Smiling, Kunsei gave Zack's belly a few hearty pats and said, \"Glad everything was to your liking, champ.\"  Zack burped loudly from the patting and said, \"Ohhh, <u><i><b>*UUUUURRRRRRRRP!*</b></i></u> dude.  Sorry to ask, but, umm..... do you think you could give my belly a little rub like before?\"  Kunsei glanced back at him, unsure what to say.  Zack looked away, blushing, \"I know this sounds weird, but when you did it last time, it felt, like, REALLY good.  Don't make me beg...\" Zack said, almost mock pouting, and giving Kunsei his trademark puppy dog eyes.  Kunsei laughed, then reached for Zack's middle, until Zack leaned forward and removed his shirt completely.  \"This outta make it a little easier.  I-I mean, if you don't mind, of course!\"  Zack said, flustered.  Kunsei blushed harder as he looked down at Zack's chiseled body, and stretched out and bloated abdomen.  \"I don't mind at all, heh...\" Kunsei said as he placed his hand on Zack's taut flesh, and like before, rubbed in slow, circular motions.  Zack moaned with delight as Kunsei's touch eased a lot of the pressure building in his stomach.  \"Ohhh, <u><b>*uuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp*</b></u> duuuude, that feels <u><b>*bbbrrrraaaaap*</b></u> amazing!\"  Zack said between burps.  Kunsei merely smiled and continued to work his magic...</span></div></div>",

Zack winced in immense pain as he rested back in his seat.  Sweating heavily, he rubbed his stomach gently, hoping to coax this bout of indigestion, but the painfully acidic gurgles continued to emanate from his belly.  Bringing his fist to his mouth, Zack muffled another loud burp, followed by another, and another, with each one getting harder and harder to keep down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly quaked furiously, Zack was expecting another burp, but instead he actually lurched forward, feeling bile rise up his throat.  Covering his mouth and trying to maintain himself, and trying so quietly, he felt like he wanted to cry from how painful it all was.

He readied to take a hearty gulp, but stopped, as he remembered something else.  \"Waaaaait a minute, if I drink this, I'll be burping up a storm...aaaaaaand if I do that, I'll probably wake Kunsei up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he pondered an alternative, quieter solution to his tummy problems, his stomach once again emitted a vicious gurgling, causing the boy to wince in pain yet again.

Groaning, he rubbed his eyes and rose from his bed.  \"Rgh, what is that...?\" he said to himself as he groggily stepped from his bedroom and to the living room.  Sure enough, he saw Zack searching the fridge.  He stared almost blank eyed for a moment, then cleared his throat to get his attention.  Startled, Zack fumbled to put everything back in its' place then slammed the fridge shut, then, like a child, smiled wide and innocently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, h-hi!\"  said Zack.  Kunsei simply stared for a moment before asking, \"So I see your stomach is better now.\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm, y-yup!  All better!\" he said happily as he gave his stomach a firm pat before glancing at the fridge, then back at Kunsei.  \"Look, I know it's late, and I'm really sorry I woke you-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it.  I've actually been meaning to clean the fridge out for a while,\" said Kunsei as he stepped towards the fridge.  \"I probably won't have time to eat a lot of this stuff anyway, and when I do, it'll just go bad.  So no harm putting it to use.\"  He opened the fridge and looked around.  \"Let's see what we got in stock for ya,\" he said as Zack sat down and said, \"Oh, dude, you've already done plenty, you don't need to-\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it'd be my pleasure,\" Kunsei responded.  Zack merely shrugged, too hungry to really respond with anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of watching Kunsei cook whatever seemed edible, Zack's stomach began to growl hungrily with anticipation.  He clutched his once again thin but softer tummy and licked his lips, \"Everything smells great, dude!\" he said as Kunsei smiled back and began to stack everything onto some paper plates.  \"Welcome to Kunsei's All-You-Can-Eat.  Tonight, we've got some Beef Ramen, some rotisserie chicken, shrimp dumplings, and Cajun Sausage.  And of course, for some late night sweets, we've got a few Rice Balls, and a slice of Chocolate Moose.  To wash it all down, we've got Ginger Ale, Milk and Sparkling Water.  Please, help yourself,\" he closed his little speech as Zack marveled at what legitimately looked like Restaurant Grade food laid before him.  He glanced back at Kunsei, \"Dude, you are the MAN!\" he shouted before digging into the Sausage.  Chewing, he glanced back at his friend, then, after a hearty gulp, asked \"Aren't you gonna eat too?\"  Kunsei shook his head, \"I typically don't eat too late, plus I don't mind just watching.  It's kind of intriguing.\"  Kunsei said.  Zack wasn't sure what to make of that, but simply shrugged it off and went to town on his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei watched in marvel as Zack's stomach began to expand once again from ingesting so much in so little time.  Finishing the Cajun Sausage, Zack moved onto the dumplings, but paused for a moment, to let out a huge burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!*</b></i>  \"Whew, that tasted spicy!\"  laughed Zack as he slapped his belly heartily before rubbing it up and down.  After a few minutes of rubbing and burping, Zack continued his meal with the dumplings.  After every few, his belly began to bulge a little more outward, until all were gone.  He then took the bowl of Beef Ramen to his lips and began slurping the whole thing down into his gullet, which was expanding outward even further, to the point where his sleeveless t-shirt began to ride up, exposing just the near bottom of his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon completion, Zack placed the bowl aside and sighed with relief as he leaned back in his chair, placing both hands atop his bloated belly.  \"Ohhhh man, I-am-STUFFED...\" moaned Zack as he caressed his stomach.  Kunsei was admiring Zack's bloated midsection, how it pushed outward so vastly.  Zack had really put in his money's worth.  Kunsei sat next to Zack and poured him a glass of Ginger Ale.  \"Here, this'll help ease your stomach,\" said Kunsei as he offered Zack the glass.  Taking it, he gulped the beverage down in a matter of seconds.  Zack felt a vicious rumbling from his stomach, and immediately opened his mouth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*HHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's disgustingly loud belch extended several seconds, and smelled of Cajun spices.  As it finished, Kunsei laughed, then said, \"Damn.  GOOD one, man!\" he said.  Zack merely smiled and burped again, causing the two to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back down at his bloated stomach, then back at the table, which still had some desert left, Zack decided to...</span></div></div>",

The sizzle of a frying pan sent a lifting aroma wafting over near Zack, who; in his sleep, sniffed the delicious scent and woke up on the spot.  He slowly rose from his spot on the couch and spotted Kunsei, dressed in casual attire, frying up some breakfast.  Kunsei glanced back at Zack and smiled before shifting his attention back to his stove.  \"Heeeeeey, rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty,\" he said as he flipped a few pancakes from a separate pan.  Zack rose to his feet, yawning, still a mess in comparison to his friend.  \"What's all this, dude?\" Zack asked, groggily.  \"Well, I figured before you headed out, I'd make a little breakfast to send you on your way,\" said Kunsei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning again, Zack nodded and scratched his stomach sleepily.  He then stopped, a tad more wide eyed as something seemed strange.  He turned away from Kunsei and lifted his shirt up, examining his abdominals more thoroughly.  His stomach was no longer bloated and his abs were still visibly present, but they felt softer and looked softer; with less definition.  \"Wow, guess I really did overdo it last night,\" he said a tad embarrassed.  \"But maaaaaan, was it worth it,\" he decided, giving his abs a hearty slap, before turning back to Kunsei.  \"Breakfast, huh?  Sounds and smells great, thank you!\" said Zack, to which Kunsei nodded and said, \"Ah, think nothing of it, pal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Zack washed up, using Kunsei's spare toothbrushes and deodorant, before sitting back at the table as Kunsei served up two plates of Flapjacks, bacon and scrambled eggs.  \"Jeez, I can't even remember the last time I had Flapjacks.  You're something else, y'know that, Kunsei?\"<br>\r\n\"So I've been told, heh.  Welp, bon appetit!\" said Kunsei, marking that breakfast was indeed served.  Zack scarfed down his food happily, enjoying every bit of it.  \"Mmm, MAN this stuff tastes great!\" said Zack as he consumed his meal.  \"I'm glad ya like it, Champ,\" said Kunsei as he smirked and took a bite of eggs, \"but you might wanna slow down.  Don't wanna eat too fast and get another bellyache, right?\" he said as his friend continued to scarf down his meal as though it would be his last.  Still, admittedly, he thought Zack's tummy troubles last night were quite adorable, and he rather enjoyed helping him cope through it...</span></div></div>",

Zack was still licking his lips.  \"Dude, all I'm saying is if you can turn scrambled eggs into THAT?  Then you outta have your own restaurant,\" said Zack as he slapped his belly in appreciation.  As he did, he glanced down curiously.  All this binge eating had taken a surprising toll on Zack's perfect physique, as his stomach had softened quite a considerable amount, and even stuck out an inch or two more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap.  Dude, is it me or have I put on a couple pounds?\"  Asked Zack.  Kunsei glanced at Zack's midsection.  It was indeed noticeably different.  He poked Zack's stomach, and it no longer had that hard feeling to it, nor was it concave any longer, but instead flat and much softer than usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I'd say you've been overdoing it a bit since last night,\" said Kunsei, who continued, \"Still, I mean you work hard for SOLDIER.  If anyone's earned a little overindulgence time, it's you.\"<br>\r\n\"I DO work hard...\" Zack said, pondering his situation, \"and considering how extensively I work out, I'll be back to normal in like a week TOPS!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack rested his hand dead center on his stomach and smirked.  \"And truth be told,\" he said before gesturing to his stomach, \"this actually kinda feels good.  Eating til my gut's on the verge of exploding, resting it off, and eating some more.  If I'm just gonna work it all off when work starts again, no reason I can't enjoy this a little while longer, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly!  We still got a few days off, why not enjoy them to their...fullest?\"  Kunsei said, giving Zack's softer belly a light pat.  Zack raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Do you feel good about that pun?\"<br>\r\n\"....Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shook his head and laughed, Kunsei eventually joined in, though still a little embarrassed, then asked, \"So where do you wanna go from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Feeling the sun bake his body, Zack removed his shirt and exposed his muscular torso to the hot sun.  Kunsei glanced and saw that Zack's abs had indeed softened a considerable amount, and that his stomach had expanded maybe an inch or two forward since last night.  Zack stretched his arms up and yawned as he looked around the pier.  \"Guess it's still pretty early for most folks, huh?\" said Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei simply nodded, then began to sweat from the merciless sun.  \"Jeez, apparently not early enough for the sun though.  Can't believe how hot it is!\" he said, wiping the already forming sweat from his forehead.  He then removed his own shirt, exposing his also muscular but much less tone and far more pale body to Zack, who glanced back and raised his eyebrows.  \"Dude, you REALLY need to start going out in the daylight more.\" he said, causing Kunsei to flush with embarrassment as he wrapped his arms around his torso, but Zack simply chuckled and said, \"Oh come on, dude, I'm just messing with you, don't worry about it.\"  Considering it, Kunsei eased up as the two headed towards the beach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two bare chested boys walked along the sand, a loud grumble caught their attention.  Looking down, Kunsei laughed at and said, \"That didn't take long.\"  Smirking, Zack patted his bare stomach and and said, \"Nope, sure didn't.\"  He then spotted a Hot Dog vendor alongside the beach and nudged Kunsei.  \"Wanna grab a quick bite?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei's stomach also growled surprisingly as he clutched it, blushing.  Zack laughed, \"I'll take that as a yes.\"  So the two ordered extra large hot dogs and Cokes, then sat by the water, chowing down.  Zack finished first obviously, but surprisingly Kunsei wasn't too far behind.  Finished, Kunsei leaned back, resting his hand on his stomach.  \"Man, that was actually pretty filling,\" said Kunsei, but Zack shrugged and responded, \"Eh, whatever you say, Light weight.\"  Zack then proceeded to gulp down his soda rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei mock laughed then took a sip of his own drink.  Taking his drink aside, Kunsei let out a small burp then covered his mouth, \"Pardon me,\" he said, as Zack raised his eyebrow, clearly unimpressed.  \"Pfft.  Weak.\"  He said before continuing with, \"Come on, you can do better than THAT, right?\"  Kunsei shrugged then took a heartier drink of his soda.  Finishing, he sighed heartily then rested one hand on his stomach, pushing out a slightly louder burp, but still nothing special.   Kunsei shrugged then said, \" <b>*URP*</b> That's all I got left.  I'm not as good at this as you are, what can I say?\"  Zack scoffed then said, \"Here, lemme show you how a real man burps.\"  He then pounded his chest a few times and let out a much louder belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*UUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!*</b></i>  Upon completion, Zack smacked his lips and gave his slightly more bloated stomach a pat, letting out a smaller but relatively juicy afterburp.  He then glanced back at the vendor from afar...</span></div></div>",

Kunsei rubbed his stomach, still full from his first one, but simply nodded so Zack wouldn't have to eat alone.  Zack then came back with another pair of footlongs with two drinks a piece, handing Kunsei his dog and his soda while he plopped back down on the sand and immediately began chowing down on his dog.  \"Mmmmm, MAN these bad boys taste great!\" Zack said between bites.  Kunsei took his first bite, and already was feeling absolutely full.  His stomach was substantially smaller than Zack's, so ingesting so much so quickly wasn't something Kunsei was used to at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way into his hot dog, Kunsei glanced groggily as Zack had just finished consuming his.  Smacking his lips, he gave his slightly more bloated stomach a hearty slap, before rubbing it in satisfaction.  \"Oh man, that tasted great.\"  He then glanced back at Kunsei who was still struggling with the remainder of his hotdog.  \"How you holding up, dude?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei groggily looked back at Zack, then stopped, lowering his hotdog and clutching onto his bare stomach with his free hand as he felt a painful rumbling emit from within himself.  Zack looked at his friend with concern.  \"Hey, y-you alright, man?\"<br>\r\nKunsei looked quite green around the gills, as if he were about to vomit profusely.  Suddenly his cheeks bulged and his eyes widened as Zack inched away, preparing for the worst.  But what exited Kunsei's mouth instead wasn't his meal, but instead a shockingly loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP!*</b> </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei burped louder than he'd ever burped before.  After several loud and bassy seconds, Kunsei's mouth shut, leaving him staring blankly as Zack burst into hysterical laughter.  \"HAHAHAHAHA!!  Dude!  NICE!\" congratulated Zack as Kunsei just sat there in shock.<br>\r\n\"Ho-ly-crap.....w-was that <i>ME</i>....?!\" Kunsei asked, legitimately stunned by his gassy eruption.  Zack was still catching his breath.  Kunsei then glanced down on his stomach, and sure enough, the pain and excess pressure was gone.  \"Huh....guess I've got room afterall,\" he said with a shrug, and promptly went back to finishing the rest of his hotdog.  Sighing with relief, Kunsei patted his stomach, then stopped suddenly and glanced down.  Much to his surprise, it seems his stomach had bloated just slightly by an inch or two from consuming two footlong hotdogs in such short a time.  Looking down, Zack poked his friend in the stomach and laughed.  \"Haha, careful dude.  You keep that up, and it won't be long before you're at my level,\" he slapped his belly to illustrate his point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei pondered that, deciding...</span></div></div>",

Zack plopped back down on the couch, as Kunsei placed the pizza down on the table.  Having baked in the sun all day gave the young man a bit of a full body tan.  Zack looked down at Kunsei's stomach and noticed that it had deflated almost back to normal, while his own had only stuck out just a few inches.  He prodded at his stomach and sure enough, it felt much softer than before.  His abs barely visible, now layered under softer flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm making progress,\" Zack said with a smile as he slapped his stomach in satisfaction a few times.  Kunsei smirked at him then felt his much harder and firm stomach, then said, \"Hopefully I'll be saying the same after this.\"  Zack flipped from the couch and sat down at the table with Kunsei as both boys began digging into the pizza.  \"Mmmm, who'd have guessed BBQ Chocobo pizza could taste so good?\" said Kunsei as he finished his first slice.  Zack had already moved onto his third as he hungrily devoured his meal.  Upon finishing his third slice, Zack moved onto his third, but before taking it to his lips, needed to stop for a second as a look of discomfort grew over his face, which Kunsei caught as he consumed his second slice.  \"Mmmphhf, something wrong?\" said Kunsei between bites, but Zack didn't respond.  Instead, he thumped his upper stomach a few times and pushed out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*UUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, not anymore,\" responded Zack before patting his belly and getting to work on slice number four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing a few slices, Kunsei grabbed his liter of cola and began downing it directly from the bottle.  After reaching all the way down to the label, his stomach began to push into his swim trunks.  As soon as he removed the bottle from his lips, Kunsei burped loudly, then held his hand forward in a \"wait a second\" fashion.  He began thumping his chest a few times, pushing out a few small burps, but still had a look of dissatisfaction on his face.  Zack recognized it, and smirked.  \"Here, allow me,\" said Zack as he got up and approached Kunsei.  He then placed his palm dead center on Kunsei's bloated belly, and pushed down, forcing out a mammoth sized belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPP!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending several seconds, Kunsei had to catch his breath after that large and sudden eruption.  <i><b>*urrrrrrrp*</b></i> \"Thanks, man,\" said Kunsei before getting back to work on pizza.  In a matter of time, both boys had completely demolished the extra large pizza, and were now slumped in their chairs, utterly stuffed to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack groaned in discomfort before unbuttoning his board shorts.  The result caused his belly to seep forward several inches as he caressed it with one hand.  Kunsei, meanwhile, was massaging his aching and bloated tummy as it stuck out quite some inches as well, but nowhere near as far as many as Zack's.  Both boys just sat there, rubbing their bloated bellies, letting out moans of satisfaction or the occasional wet burps here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kunsei got an idea...</span></div></div>",

Not that it would be fair, you already drank yours down to the label.  I haven't even opened mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kunsei rose from his seat, one hand rested on his bare still slightly bloated stomach, and browsed in his fridge, pulling out another liter of unopened cola and sat back down across from Zack, who nodded and grabbed his liter.  \"Okay, Light weight.  Let's see what you got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, both youths had screwed their tops open and immediately began chugging down their fizzy beverages.  Both gulped at rapid paces, reaching the labels at around the same time.  Kunsei's eyes began to water from all the carbonation being ingested at once, before removing his lips from the bottle about 40% down.  Upon catching his breath, Kunsei burped loudly several times one after the other, while Zack continued downing his at a slower rate.  Burping again, Kunsei looked down at his stomach, seeing that it had bloated outward a considerable amount since their contest began.  Pausing to finish catching his breath, Kunsei once again brought his beverage to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to around 60%, Zack finally stopped, belching enormously several times almost immediately after taking the bottle from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carbonated beverage combined with his previous meals had expanded Zack's belly outward by about 10 inches even, making him appear pregnant as he rested his free hand atop his bare, vastly bloated middle, pushing down on it hard to coax out some even louder belches and free his belly up of some of the immensely building pressure from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBRRRRAAAAAAAP!*  *BBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!* *HHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!*</b></i>  \"Hehehe...*urp*, feel like giving *UUUUUUUUUUUPPPPP*, yet?\" asked Zack between burps.  Kunsei continued to chug profusely, until Zack got an idea.  Placing his cola on the table, Zack took both hands and shook his bloated belly up profusely, shaking up all the gas building inside himself violently.  Just then, Zack leaned in front of Kunsei and let rip his nastiest and perhaps loudest belch yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*bbBbBbbbBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPppPpPPPpPpPPpPPpPppPpPPPPPPPP!!!!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive 12 second eruption caused Kunsei to choke and gag mid sip, forcing him to stop and cough from the stench.  Coughing, Kunsei turned back to Zack and shouted between coughs, \"Zack, you ass!\"  Laughing, Zack leaned back, patting his belly and responded with, \"Heeeeey, all's fair in love and drinking contests, right?\"  Before he resumed drinking.  Glancing back at him, Kunsei smirked, feeling an immense amount of pressure building within his own bloated stomach, and in a mirrored chain of events, let rip an equally rank belch right in Zack's face mid-drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP P!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost as lengthy but equally disgusting belch in his face forced Zack to stop drinking as well, coughing and laughing from the stench.  \"Ugh, okay fair enough, we'll play fair from here on, deal?\"  Kunsei was about to say deal, but the carbonation forced him to burp a *DDDDDEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLPPPP* instead, causing both boys to laugh.  After a little while of catching their breath, the two resumed their contest.  Both chugged vigorously, stopping only to catch their breath and let out the occasional monstrous belch, but in the end, the victor was...</span></div></div>",

Unable to contain it any longer, Kunsei opened wide as what spewed from his mouth was not the contents of his meal, but perhaps the single largest belch Zack had ever heard in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*mmmMMMMMMMMBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending over 20 seconds straight, Kunsei's belch carried enough force to blow Zack's hair back as he stared wide eyed at his friend's stench-ridden expulsion.

Kunsei moaned with delight as Zack's hands continued to gently stroke his bloated gut, easing a lot of the pressure still festering in Kunsei's belly, resulting in the young man to let rip several loud belches one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPP!* *HHHHUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPP!* *brraaaap!* *bbrrrraaaaaaaaaapppp!* *BBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed as Kunsei burped uncontrollably.  \"Damn, man.  I didn't know what a beast you were!\"<br>\r\n\"<b>*uuuuoooooorrrrrrp*</b> Ugh, I never realized how badly my stomach reacts to so much soda at once...\"<br>\r\n\"Well now you know,\" responded Zack as he gave his friends belly a light hearted pat, causing another burp to erupt from the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of 'burping' his bloated friend, the two then decided...</span></div></div>",

You wanna eat here?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack's stomach rumbled loudly, \"Eh hehe, guess that answers that,\" Kunsei said as Zack just sort of chuckled, a bit embarrassed.  Both boys entered as a larger, older man greeted them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey, I've seen you's two 'round before, haven't I?\" he asked.  Zack and Kunsei just glanced at each other curiously, as neither recalled meeting this guy before.  Then, as if a light bulb had gone off in his head, he snapped his fingers.  \"Oh yeah!  Soldier!  You boys're wit Soldier, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Weeeell, we try not to make a big deal about it,\" said Zack in a comically bad nonchalant tone.  Kunsei facepalmed immediately after.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my oldest boy works dere too, heh.  You's guys do some mighty fine work keepin' us norms safe and what not!  So tell ya what, anything you want here?  On da house!\"<br>\r\nBoth boys eyes lit up with excitement.  Though Kunsei wasn't too hungry after those hotdogs, he'd never say no to a free burger.  Zack meanwhile, glanced at the menu up top and asked, \"What's like the biggest burger you guys got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man glanced fora moment, then reluctantly said, \"Uhhh, well dat'd be the Triple Decker Belly Bustuh.  A full pound'uh meat slabbed on sour dough bread, with grilled onions, secret sauce, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, and'uh side fries.  You sure you wanna take her on though, kid?  I know she sounds temptin', but she's a beast to be reckoned with, and no disrespect, buuuuut you're kinda small to be eatin' somethin' like this.  Ya sure you can stomach her?\"<br>\r\nAs with before, Zack's bare stomach growled audibly as he smirked, placed a hand atop it and said with a wink, \"Trust me.  Oh, and two sodas please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two sat at a table outside, alone, with the sun setting over the ocean.  T'was a pretty remarkable sight for so early in the morning.  \"Man, sure is a nice day today, huh?\" said Kunsei.  Zack, staring out to the sea, nodded in agreement.  As if on cue, the Restaurant owner approached the table, placing Kunsei's burger plate down, then Zack's much larger meal.  Zack took a whiff, the smell of his massive meal was absolutely intoxicating.  \"Well boys, enjoy!\" said the older man as he then glanced down at Zack and followed with, \"good luck, kid...\" before taking his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a massive first bite, Zack moaned in ecstasy at the burst of flavors.  He then took another massive bite, and another, and another.  \"Mmmppff, dude!\" said Zack before gulping down the massive amounts of beef still in his mouth, \"this might be the single greatest burger I've ever eaten in my entire life!\"  He then resumed eating.  Kunsei glanced as he ate his much smaller burger.  As both were only wearing swim trunks / board shorts, it was very easy to see the extent of how much the meal was taking its' toll on Zack's stomach as it gradually began to push outward a bit with every few bites of his massive burger.  Zack, meanwhile, showed very little sign of slowing down...</span></div></div>",

As Kunsei finished his meal, he looked back at Zack, whose stomach was pushing outward on his board shorts.  Finishing another hearty bite, Zack paused for a moment and rested his free hand on his belly as he let rip a loud and strained belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPP!*</b></i> \"Ugh, I can see why they call this thing the Belly Buster...\" said an exhausted Zack as he unbuttoned his shorts, letting his bloated gut extend freely.  Kunsei hadn't seen anything like it, it was as though Zack had swallowed a beach ball.  \"Jesus, Zack, you look like you're pregnant!\" laughed Kunsei, half joking, half dead serious.  Zack massaged his stomach briefly, then tried taking a bite of burger.  As he leaned in, he felt nauseous, then placed what remained of his massive burger on his plate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, man?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack moaned then leaned back in his chair, resting both hands atop his stomach.  \"Yeah, I'm just getting pretty full,\" responded Zack.<br>\r\n\"If you want, we can take the rest to go and just eat it later.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, the old dude said this thing wasn't for lightweights, you know full well that means I'm practically obligated to show him up.\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but Zack, dude, look at your stomach.  I've NEVER seen it that big before.\" said Kunsei as he reached over and poked Zack's belly a few times to demonstrate his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack glanced down, almost surprised at how bloated he really was.  \"Wow...\" was all Zack could say as he prodded at his stomach.

Each bite took longer to swallow, but gradually, he managed each one.  Finally, it was done.  Zack had finished that full pound of meat, downed his coke and eaten all his fries in one outing.  As he leaned back, stuffed to no end, his belly quivered from the rapid intake.  Kunsei was damn near astonished that anyone; even Zack, could eat so much at once.  Zack rested both hands atop his bulging gut and sighed heartily as the old restaurant owner stopped by to check on progress.  He looked down at Zack's plate, then back at Zack and his bloated stomach and laughed in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  I don't believe it, kid!  You...actually pulled it off?  Un-freakin'-real, heh!  How ya feel?\" asked the impressed restaurant owner.  Zack, still looking a bit ill from the intake, opened his mouth to speak.  What came out instead was perhaps the loudest and wettest burp Zack ever emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*MMMMMMMMMMMMMMBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's burp extended for several seconds straight as the amuses restaurant owner immediately whipped out a camera from his pocket and snapped a shot of Zack mid burp, confusing both boys.  As Zack's eruption concluded, the owners' picture came out developed as he glanced at it and said with a smirk, \"Welcome to history, son!  Normally, I'd have asked you to put a friggin shirt on before I took a legacy shot, but I don't that'd even matter at this point, would it?\"  He said with a laugh then walked back inside and stuck the picture on a wall with just a few other pictures.  Obviously the only customers who could ever stomach such a massive burger.  Kunsei glanced back at it then to Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congrats I guess?\" said Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Ohhh <i><b>*uuurrrrrp*</b></i> man, I <i><b>*URP*</b></i> don't think I've EVER been this <i><b>*BUUURP*</b></i> stuffed be-<i><b>*UUUUUUUUURRRRP*</b></i>-fore...\" responded Zack between burps as he almost helplessly caressed his belly, moaning in a mix of pain and satisfaction.  Kunsei walked over to his friend and placed his hand flat on his belly, feeling how utterly stuffed he was.  \"Hehe, you're definitely gonna have to kick it in overtime at the gym if you're gonna work <i>this</i> monster off...\" said Kunsei as he rubbed Zack's belly all around.<br>\r\n<i><b>*uuuUUuuUUUUUrrrRRRAAAAAPPP!*</b></i>  \"Tell me about it, dude...\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Sooooo, where to now?\" asked Kunsei.

Could we just chill at the beach for a bit so I can digest the friggin' cow I just swallowed...?\" said Zack, strained from perhaps his largest meal yet.  Kunsei smiled at his friend and nodded as the two headed back down the beach.  Zack's swollen belly almost jiggling as they walked along the still pretty empty beach.  Finally, reaching a warm, secluded spot, Kunsei said while Zack simply plopped onto his back from exhaustion, body sprawled along the sand.  Kunsei was amazed as Zack's belly stuck up outward as his back laid in the sand, it looked as though the young man had swallowed a volley ball.  Exhausted, Zack rested a hand atop his belly and patted it several times before rubbing up and down.  \"Oooooh man, did I overdo it or what?\" he asked as Kunsei simply watched.  <br>\r\n\"Like a champ,\" he said as he patted his friends' engorged belly.  Zack grunted in discomfort.  \"Ooof, easy dude, I'm about one pat away from blowing...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud rumbling emitted from Zack's stomach.  Kunsei pressed his ear against his extended gut and listened as it bubbled vigorously, breaking down his heavy meal.  \"Wow, do you hear that?\" asked Kunsei.<br>\r\nZack chuckled wearily and gave his belly a light pat.  \"How could I not?\" he responded.  Kunsei continued to listen curiously, before saying, \"You know?  I think it's just excess pressure that's giving you a hard time.  I mean it WAS a pretty greasy burger, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kunsei placed his hand atop Zack's belly, whose eyes widened nervously.  \"Oh no no no, Kunsei you don't wanna do-\"  Too late.  Kunsei pushed down hard, forcing the pressure in Zack's tummy out of balance, resulting in a massive belch to fire from Zack's strained mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP !!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's burp extended several, gassy seconds before it winded down.  Kunsei smiled and pressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*HHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zack could even catch his breath from the last burp, Kunsei forced out an even louder one from Zack's gut, causing him to cough violently as he halted Kunsei.  \"Easy, man!  Just <i><b>*URP*</b></i> lemme catch my breath, sheesh!\"<br>\r\nKunsei laughed nervously as he took his hands off Zack's stomach.  \"Sorry, man,\" he said.  Zack simply nodded and rested his right hand atop his bloated stomach while he hoisted himself to a sitting position with his left.  He paused for a moment then glanced back at his friend.  \"You like this, don't you?\"  asked Zack.  Kunsei glanced back nervously.  \"Like w-what?\"<br>\r\n\"You know, <i>this</i>...\" Zack patted his belly for emphasis.  \"Is that why you've been so eager to treat me to free food?  To rub my belly whenever it needed and <i>burp</i> me?\"<br>\r\nKunsei looked away, embarrassed.  \"...Kinda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei, flustered, looked for the right words to say without sounding weird.  \"Here's the thing; I...<i>like</i> you, Zack.  And in addition to which, I...well, like feeding you.  Like at SHINRA, you always push yourself to the limit, and, well, seeing you do that with your stomach; going further than anyone else could ever try to go, is well, amazing.  Look, I'm sorry if this is all weird, I really didn't-\"<br>\r\nZack patted his friend on the shoulder and smiled back at him reassuringly.  \"Dude, don't sweat it.  For real.  Because, well, ya wanna know the truth?  I like you too.\" <br>\r\nKunsei glared back at him wide eyed.  Zack blushed a bit and resumed, saying \"You've always been a really nice dude, really easy to talk to, never judgemental, and you care about people.  That's more than most folks can say.\"<br>\r\nA beat passed, then Kunsei smiled, almost teary eyed.  Zack smiled back and resumed to say, \"and if you wanna know the truth?  I like this little stuffing thing we've got going, and how great you are at helping along the way.  It's...well, pretty fun!  And speaking of fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack paused a moment, then thumped his gut a few times, before opening his mouth with yet another loud <i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPP!* </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys laughed.  \"Ahhh, that felt great...\"  said Zack as he patted his belly happily.<br>\r\n\"Have I mentioned how awesome and manly your burps are?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack laughed rose to his feet and said, \"Yes, as a matter of fact.  Now, I dunno about you, but all that mushiness and gassiness has got my gut rumbling for more.  Whadduya say we fill this tank up?\"</span></div></div>",

The aroma of their meal was intoxicating to both boys.  \"Mmmmm, this is gonna taste heavenly...\" said Zack as his bloated stomach rumbled in anticipation.  Smiling, Kunsei gave Zack's belly a light pat in agreement, then said \"Sounds like someone's eager.\"`<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two grabbed a slice each and in unison, took that first bite.  Once again in unison, both their eyes lit up at the incredible taste, and promptly, both began devouring their slice.  \"Oh my God, I...I think this might be the best pizza I've ever eaten...\" said Zack in an almost trancelike state.  Kunsei was too busy rapidly consuming his own pizza to even agree.  Promptly finishing, both boys moved onto their next slice.  Kunsei, still being the thin and firm lightweight, began to slow down at this point as his stomach began to feel pretty full.  Zack, on the other hand, was already onto slice number 3.  Finishing his slice, Kunsei groaned from fullness as he leaned back in his chair, burping loudly and spontaneously.  Too occupied by his food to complement him, Zack stuck his free hand out for a high five as he consumed number 4.  Watching, Kunsei glanced down at Zack's already bloated stomach, watching it actually push outward with each slice consumed.  He'd truly been outdoing himself, as with each outing, Zack's stomach had been growing progressively bigger and bigger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy slice seven, Zack began to slow down as Kunsei sat next to him, placing a hand atop Zack's bare and soft flesh, feeling it push outward with each bite.  \"Maaaaan, I don't think I've ever seen your tummy get this big before.  H-how do you feel?\" asked a dumbstruck Kunsei.  Finishing his seventh slice, Zack wiped his mouth and was about to say something, but Kunsei felt a gaseous quivering emit from Zack's taut stomach, and immediately, out from his mouth expelled a nasty <i><b>*uuuuuUUuuUuUUuUUuUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpelling at a wet pitch, Kunsei laughed as he patted Zack's belly assuring and began to rub it, to ease some of the built up pressure that came from eating so much.  \"Ohhh dude, that pizza was....unbelievable,\" said Zack as he leaned back, causing his belly to protrude forward by almost 10 inches.  \"Tell me about it,\" responded Kunsei, patting his own full, albeit considerably less bloated stomach in satisfaction.  He then glanced back down at the table, looking at the box of pizza still leftover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, there's still a few slices left.  Not to push or anything, but something tells me you could still polish that off no problem,\" said Kunsei as he urged Zack to finish up.  \"Let's see just how big your belly can <i>really</i> get...\"</span></div></div>",

Nonsense!  I know it looks like a lot, but if anyone could overcome the odds, it's the soon-to-be hero of Midgar!\"  said Kunsei as he patted Zack's stomach encouragingly.  Zack paused for a moment and let what Kunsei just said reflect.  'Heroes overcome the odds all the time,' he thought to himself, and hero of Midgar didn't have a bad ring to it at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do this!\" started Zack, before a quivering emanated from his extended gut.  \"Ugh, but first thing's first...my stomach's got way too much air inside.  Kunsei?\"  Smiling, Kunsei said, \"Say no more,\" and pressed hard on Zack's belly, pushing out a loud burp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in satisfaction, Zack let out a smaller burp as Kunsei pushed on Zack's stomach again.  Nothing was coming out.  \"Is that all of it?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack shook his head and said, \"Nope, but I think it's stuck.  Here, hand me that pitcher.\"  More than eager, Kunsei grabbed the large pitcher of cola and handed it to Zack.  Giving his friend a wink, Zack began chugging straight from the pitcher, spilling across his mouth slightly as the rest went straight to Zack's expanding stomach.  Feeling Zack's belly slosh, Kunsei instead pressed his ear against Zack's huge belly, listening as the soda caused immense bubbling and churning like that of a cauldron.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kunsei's shock, Zack managed to down the entire pitcher in one lengthy go.  Placing the pitcher on the table, Zack exhaled from exhaustion as Kunsei could hear Zack's belly bubble viciously.  Smiling, Zack placed both hands on his even more bloated belly and pushed down.  What came out was hands down the loudest and most forceful belch Zack had ever emitted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLasting almost 20 straight seconds, Zack's burp carried enough force to almost blow some of the napkins off the table.  As his burp finally came to an end, Zack leaned back and patted his belly.  Kunsei was utterly dumbstruck.  \"That....was amazing...\" he said, still in awe.  Smiling, Zack faced his friend, and after thumping his gut once, burped out a <i><b>*TTTTTHHHHHAAAAAAAANNNNKKKSSSSS-DDDDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDDDDE!*</b></i> right in Kunsei's face.  Letting the belch waft in his face, Kunsei bit his lip, hardly able to contain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his breath, Kunsei coughed nervously and asked \"Sooooo, think you got enough space now?\"</span></div></div>",

Sighing with relief, he wiped his mouth after completing the first of the seven and immediately got to work on the second slice.  It was almost as if freeing up some of that excess space had given Zack his second wind so to speak.  Kunsei watched as Zack devoured the next slice almost just as quickly as the first before it.  With each bite, his belly began to expand more and more, truly being pushed to its' limits.  By slice three, Zack began to slow down again, leaning back on his chair and resting one hand atop his grossly bloated gut.  \"Ugh *UUUURP* dude, I dunno if I can do this on my own here...\" said Zack, starting feel weak again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kunsei stepped in with an idea.  Gently, he placed both hands atop Zack's gut and kneaded at it, pushing right about Zack's belly button, working up some of the excess gas and pushing out another lengthy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*HHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*</b></i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that one tasted bad...\" said Zack.  Kunsei chuckled, then explained, \"I think I've got it figured out.  This pizza; while heavenly, is also really greasy, and with grease comes gas, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I guess?\"  responded Zack, scratching his head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Well, if too much gas is building up at once, it's gonna make you fuller quicker.  That's why after you let out those huge burps earlier, you were able to plow through those first three slices so simply.  Because there was no excess gas in your tummy taking room away from where the pizza could be going.\"<br>\r\n\"Meaning what?\"<br>\r\n\"Meaning all you gotta do is just keep eating, and after each slice, I'll make sure you've got enough room for the next one.  It's like what you were doing earlier, only I'll be able to push out every bit of gas so no time is wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's eyes lit up, as he noticed he <i>did</i> suddenly feel less like blowing chunks and more like downing another slice.  \"Alright, let's give it a go!\" he said with a smile, and immediately went to work on number four.  His pace had picked up as expected.  Upon completing it.  Kunsei immediately pushed onto Zack's bloated belly, forcing out a loud and bassy belch immediately after.  Smacking his lips, Zack gave Kunsei a thumbs up and finished up number five at rapid pace.  His belly began to push outward substantially more than before.  Kunsei couldn't help but admire the taut flesh in his hands as he began to rub it slowly.  Zack however, grunted impatiently at his friend, once again catching his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!  Heh, s-sorry!\"  said an embarrassed Kunsei as he once again pushed deep into Zack's belly, and with gusto, caused Zack to burp enormously.  Zack still had a look of discomfort on his face, so Kunsei pushed again, forcing out an even louder burp than before.  Sighing with deep satisfaction, Zack proceeded to down six with ease.  Not even needing to be burped that time, Zack moved straight ahead to number seven, and slowly but surely, finished it, and thus marked the end of their endeavor as Zack let rip one last mighty burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his burp came to an end, Zack plopped down on his seat, appearing as though he had fallen into a deep food coma, while Kunsei rubbed his friends' stomach to congratulate him on the effort.  His belly had expanded outward by close to a full foot, making him appear damn near pregnant with triplets.  Moaning in ecstasy, he rested both hands atop his vastly bloated middle and sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did great, dude!\" said Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Number one all the way, man...\" said an utterly stuffed Zack.<br>\r\n\"So should we call it a day?\"</span></div></div>",

Plopping back down on the couch, the much heavier Zack clutched his gut and moaned from a mix of satisfaction and discomfort.  \"Ohhh God, I feel and look like a freaking whale...\" said Zack as he rubbed all over his bloated, gurgling belly.  Kunsei simply smirked and sat down on the couch next to Zack, prodding his stomach with one hand gently, causing his moaning to change from that of discomfort to that of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're no whale.  Whales aren't as sexy and manly,\" Kunsei responded, patting Zack's shoulder assuring, causing him to blush profusely as he tried to play it off cool.  Just then, his bloated stomach emitted a very violent gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*GGGGGGGGGGUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGLLLLLLLEEEE!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, yeah yeah...\" responded Zack as he prodded at his gut annoyed.  Kunsei was still overwhelmed by the massive orb of flesh just planted perfectly atop Zack's middle, to his otherwise still sculpture perfect body.  It just made Zack all that much more sexy to his eyes as he nudged Zack's gut some more, almost playing with his immensely bloated stomach.  \"I gotta know, man, how do you manage?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack glanced, then pondered for a moment, before responding, \"Don't get me wrong, it's painful and difficult, but this feeling of bliss and satisfaction that comes after makes it all so worth it, because I pushed for it, like you said.  Plus...\" he started before nuzzling up next to Kunsei like a puppy to its' owner, \"...it's even better being able to share that with someone as supportive and caring as you.\"  Kunsei looked away, chuckling nervously as he blushed and brushed the back of his hair as Zack would normally do.<br>\r\n\"Well, just glad you've allowed me to share in the moment,\" responded Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Dude, if you hadn't been so cool, there wouldn't have been <i>a moment</i>.\"<br>\r\n\"...Thank you,\" said Kunsei in a much more sincere tone than before.  As thanks, he began slowly rubbing Zack's belly in his usual slow gentle fashion, causing Zack to moan in pleasure even more as he leaned back in the couch.  \"Ohhh, dude, that feels amaaaaaaazing....\" cooed Zack as Kunsei simply smiled and pecked Zack across the cheek, whose eyes lit up as he immediately turned to Kunsei, who looked away, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...S-sorry, heh.  Too fast....?\" Kunsei asked nervously.  Smiling back at him, Zack leaned in to return the favor.  However, Kunsei's rubbing had once again worked up some of the gas bubbles festering inside Zack's gut and up his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!*</b></i>&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Zack kissing Kunsei, he accidentally let rip a monstrous belch right in his face, blowing his hair back and spraying his face with the odor of Zack's gargantuan meal of the day.  As it finally winded down, Zack's eyes widened terrified as he reeled back, horrified.  \"Oh my God, I'm-I'm so sorry, Kunsei!  I-I didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei then began to burst out laughing, cutting Zack's apology short as he glanced curiously at his friend who was now applauding him.  \"That was fantastic!\" said Kunsei, confusing Zack to no end.  \"What...?\" was all Zack could ask in his confused state.  \"...b-but we were being open and I just, totally ruined the moment...\"<br>\r\n\"Ruined the moment?\" asked Kunsei with an eyebrow raised, before shaking his head and following with, \"no, you <i>made</i> the moment, man.  That burp was amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"But I, <i>literally</i>, smacked you in the face with it!\" responded Zack, which Kunsei nodded to, before leaning closer to Zack.<br>\r\n\"That you did, and guess what?  It was incredibly sexy.  I told you already how much I loved how awesome your burps are, what'd you think I meant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Zack managed to put two and two together, as he nodded slowly then smirked.  \"Well, glad you liked it then,\" Zack said with a chuckle as Kunsei pulled him closer by the shoulder with one hand, and used the other to massage all over Zack's bloated belly.  \"Is there any more where that came from?\" asked Kunsei hopeful.  Zack laughed then took a deep gulp of air, before thumping against his chest a few times, pushing out another loud belch right in Kunsei's face.  <i><b>*UUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!*</b></i> \"Oh don't you worry, dude, there's boat loads more where that came from,\" responded Zack between burps.  The next while was spent with Kunsei nudging and massaging Zack's belly, forcing out the occasional monstrous belch from Zack, much to Kunsei's pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Zack finally just glanced down at his stomach, and was finally able to marvel at how vastly expanded it had become in the day of gorging on so many wonderful meals at once.  \"Wow, I really did pack it on today, didn't I...?\" said Zack in almost awe, as he spent most of the day gorging, not actually seeing the extent of its' labor.  Kunsei simply smiled and nodded, patting Zack's belly comforting.  \"That you did, Zack, that you did...\" responded Kunsei as he also marveled at Zack's bulging midsection.<br>\r\n\"Kinda makes me wonder what tomorrow's got in store...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, the night <i>is</i> still young, right....?\"</span></div></div>",

Feeling his stomach, Zack could sense it had softened immensely.  Looking down, he saw that there was no longer any visible muscle definition to his stomach, but rather a solid layer of soft flesh.  His stomach itself had softened and gotten rather pudgy since the gorging began, now naturally just sticking out a few inches on its' own.  \"Wow, I really put down my money's worth, didn't I...\" Zack said to no one in particular as he yawned again and groggily scratched his shirtless torso as he rose from the sofa and headed to the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing up and brushing his teeth, Zack stepped onto the scale to see the damage.  Before all this, he was a solid 125 lbs of all muscle, but as it stood now, Zack weighed in at around 155 lbs.  \"Dude, around 30 pounds in just two days?  Am I the man or am I <i>the man?\"</i> he said as he slapped his pudgier belly in congratulations to himself.  \"Let's see how much further we can take this...\" he said as his tummy gave a hungry rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" he said, laughing as he slapped his gut heartily and got dressed in a separate pair of board shorts and a sleeveless T-Shirt from his favorite band.  As he stepped out, Kunsei groggily emerged from his bedroom, dressed in nothing but his shorts as he yawned and rubbed his eyes.  \"Mmmm, g'morning...\" muttered a half-awake Kunsei as he brushed back his messy brown hair.  Chuckling, Zack smiled back at his friend and said, \"Good morning to you too, sunshine.  Dude, you gotta check this out!\" responded Zack as he lifted up his shirt, exposing his pudgier abdomen to Kunsei.  Rubbing his eyes, Kunsei observed, and was quite astonished at how quick Zack's gorging was effecting his body.  \"Goodness, all in just two days?\" he responded as he poked at Zack's pudgy middle, causing him to chuckle and nod.  \"And like you said,\" Zack started before he dropped his shirt back down and stood near the kitchen, \"the night is still young, riiiiiiiiight?\"</span></div></div>",

Coming back out, dressed in casual ware, Kunsei went back to the kitchen and opened the fridge door.  \"So what do you feel like for breakfast?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack shrugged.  \"Whatever is edible, dude,\" responded Zack as he sat back down at the table, eagerly rubbing his hungry tummy.  Smiling, Kunsei browsed the fridge and pulled out some bacon, pancake batter and eggs, and went right to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you always been such a great cook?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei scoffed and said, \"Trust me, I'm thoroughly average.\"<br>\r\n\"You kidding?  These last two breakfast's have been some of the best I've ever had in years!  Not even my mom could whip up a breakfast like that, and she's one of the best cooks in Gongoga!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I've always enjoyed cooking for people.  It's cathartic, and as aspiring artists, it's nice to have an outlet to express some of my creative needs that I otherwise couldn't express at Shinra or in SOLDIER.  Although, breakfast is a pretty straight forward thing really, I don't really shine until I'm cooking dinner, then I've got more room to be creative.\"<br>\r\n\"Creative, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Not that kind of creative, you perv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Zack leaned back in his chair and sniffed the aroma of cooked bacon and pancakes atop the pan and moaned eagerly.  \"You ever consider going full time?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei shrugged and responded, \"Hadn't crossed my mind, but considering how poorly I've been doing with SOLDIER, perhaps I should be considering different employment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stood up and nudged his friends' shoulder assuredly, then said, \"Come on, don't think like that.  Everyone starts out a little rocky before they get the hang of things.\"  Kunsei smiles then says, \"Not you.  For you, being a soldier; even a hero, is just basic.  The VR incident wasn't the first time you saved my ass, Zack.  Plus, we've both been working at Shinra for the same amount of time.  Some people just have what it takes, some don't.  I mean I'm not upset about that, I just think it's better to accept certain realities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was done and ready to be consumed.  \"Besides, going full time cook wouldn't mean we couldn't still hang out.  In fact, if I DID go full time cook, I'd need a taster,\" Kunsei said as he nudged towards Zack who considered the delicious possibilities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with that, breakfast is served...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei placed down a massive stack of flapjacks smothered in syrup onto a plate for Zack alongside several strips of bacon next to a side of scrambled eggs and a pitcher of orange juice.

Dude, I don't know how you managed to do it, but somehow you made flapjacks taste even better!\" he said between bites.  Kunsei smiled, appreciating the complement as he took a bite out of his substantially smaller plate.  \"I aim to please,\" responded Kunsei as he took another bite.  Taking a large piece of flapjack, Zack saturated it with the syrup on his plate then opened his mouth wide as he stuffed an almost whole-sized piece of flapjack into his mouth, chewing quickly and taking a hearty gulp, sending a noticeable bulge from his cheeks down to his throat and eventually out of sight as it reached his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several flapjacks had been consumed, Zack's now thicker stomach began to bloat slightly again.  After ingesting several pieces of bacon at once, Zack leaned back in his chair, with both hands rested on his gut for a breather.  \"I swear, I don't think I've ever enjoyed breakfast this much before in my entire life, and bare in mind, my mom's cooking was always amazing!  So that says something, man,\" said Zack as he massaged his fairly bloated middle.  Kunsei once again smiled back at Zack, then said, \"You know, I actually remember that one time I came over and your mom made those chocolate waffles.  Those ARE really good, so thank you.  Hehe, I also remember even back then when we were kids, you'd always overdo it.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't help it if I'm surrounded by awesome chefs.  Still, for real, those were always good times.\"<br>\r\n\"Things were simpler back then.\"<br>\r\n\"And right now at this moment, things are nice and simple too.  May as well enjoy it while we can, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei nodded in agreement as Zack hoisted himself forward and resumed his hearty breakfast.  Continuing to tear through what remained of his flapjacks, Zack took larger mouthfuls of bites before chewing and swallowing larger quantities, sending larger gulps down to his tummy each time, pushing it outward ever so slightly with each mouthful swallowed, until finally, his plate of flapjacks was licked clean.  Licking the syrup remnants from his fingers, Zack began consuming what remained of his eggs and bacon.  All the while, Kunsei watched as Zack's stomach began to push outward a bit more with every few bites of his remaining meal.  Zack then took a large swig of his orange juice, before placing the glass back on the table and thumping his chest, resulting in a sharp burp from Zack as he sighed with relief and got back to work on his meal, until eventually, his plate was nothing more than a few egg and bacon grease remnants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in his chair, Zack rested both hands atop his stuffed belly and smiled blissfully.  \"Best.  Breakfast.  Ever...\" said Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately afterwards...</span></div></div>",

Sitting next to Zack, Kunsei as per usual, began to ease Zack's pain with another one of his post-meal tummy rubs.  The resulting massage brought a look of bliss to Zack's face as his body went limp.  As Kunsei rubbed, he could feel just how soft and expansive Zack's belly was starting to feel.  He felt around briefly, and sure enough, couldn't find any hidden abs beneath the soft flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really coming along, aren't you,\" said Kunsei as he continued to rub, resulting in a moan of delight from Zack.  \"Ahhhh, sure am,\" responded Zack as he gave his belly a hearty slap.  The resulting slap caused a brief ripple which Kunsei could feel as the flesh almost seemed to jiggle in response to the slap.  His eyes widened with amazement.  \"Goodness, you really DID come along!\" laughed Kunsei as he continued.  It truly was remarkable how vastly the normally chiseled Zack had transformed his once stone cutter six-pack abs to a continuously growing gut.  Oddly enough, the rest of Zack was still as fit as ever.  The fat in his stomach had not transferred over to the rest of his body, likely due to Mako fusion all SOLDIER members have within themselves; Kunsei included.  Which wasn't a bad thing at all.  It simply meant more weight was going straight to Zack's belly, causing it to grow at much quicker rates than it would of a normal human.  It was all very scientific, but it mattered very little to either Kunsei or Zack.  Right now, they were both simply enjoying the moment as Kunsei continued to gently rub his hands across his friends belly.  Sure enough, the rubbing worked up some of the excess air that was stowed away in Zack's stomach from the meal.  Feeling a rush of air work its' way of his throat, Zack smirked at Kunsei then opened his mouth nice and wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpppppp!*</b></i>&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nZack belched a bit lower but surprisingly lengthy as it carried on for close to six seconds straight.  Laughing, Kunsei gave Zack's belly a light pat then got back to work.  \"Not bad, Zack,\" said Kunsei as he continued to rub Zack's tummy.  But Zack still had a look of discomfort o his face.  \"Something wrong?\" asked Kunsei, but Zack just held his hand forward in a 'hold on a moment' fashion. He then pressed his hand against his chest and swallowed some air, pushing out a quick but juicy burp after.  Wincing, he burped again and again and again, still looking as though he were in pain.  \"Ugh, I can feel it right there, but I just can't get it out,\" said Zack as he belched again, just unable to get the big one out.  Catching on, Kunsei then clutched Zack's gassy stomach and with considerable force, pushed down hard on it.  The resulting push forced out the pent-up gas within Zack and forced it immediately out of his mouth in the form of a massive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPP!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack belched long and loud, extending several length seconds and carrying enough force to blow Kunsei's hair back.  As it came to an end, Zack slouched with relief as Kunsei just stared in awe.  \"Ahhhhhh <i><b>*uuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrp*</b></i> that felt good....\" said Zack.  Kunsei simply laughed then patted Zack's belly admirably.  \"That was beastly, dude!  Guess you really DO like my flapjacks!\" laughed Kunsei.  Zack simply smirked and nudged his friend in the shoulder, saying \"You know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards...</span></div></div>",

Placing the food on the table, Kunsei sat down across from Zack as he marveled at all the delicious smelling fried foods.  Boxes of spicy Chocobo Wings and drumsticks, Cajun Fries, all kinds of dipping sauces, and a 2 Liter bottle of Cola, Zack's mouth was practically watering at the sight.  \"Well?  Dig in, my man!\" said Kunsei, to which Zack more than happily complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreedily scarfing down a handful of fries at once, Zack hummed in delight as the many spices sent a burst of flavor and zest into his mouth.  He then wiped his mouth and targeted the wings, ripping the meat from the bones with his teeth and ingesting them immediately.  Picking one wing bone dry after another.  All the while, Kunsei's focus kept shifting from Zack to his bloated but still growing stomach.  As more and more was deposited inside, his belly began to stretch outward and outward even further, stretching into his buttoned up board shorts.  After a few minutes, Zack had to stop to massage his aching tummy.  \"Mmmmph, hold on, I know what to do...\" said Zack before unbuttoning his shorts.  Almost immediately after, his belly surged outward considerably, almost hitting the table as Zack moaned with sweet relief.  \"Ahhhhh, there we go...\" he said before getting back to work on the wings.  Kunsei was dumbstruck.  His belly had to be sticking out by at least 11 inches at this point.  What was even more amazing was that the rest of him was still completely tone, all except for his massive balloon belly, which continued to inflate with more and more consumed.  Occasionally, he would pour himself a glass of cola and down it in just a few seconds flat, usually ending each gulp with a loud burp or a forceful hiccup, or both, then go right back to stuffing his already stuffed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, all that remained of the wings was a pile of sauce laden bones, as Zack was just finishing the Cajun fries.  Finaly finished, Zack sighed with relief and leaned back in his chair, picking at his teeth.  \"So, how was it?\" asked Kunsei.  Stuffed to the brim, Zack simply gave a thumbs up.  <b>*hic* <i>*urrrrrrrp*</i></b> \"Ohhh man, that wing place is something else, dude...\" said Zack as he caressed his gut with one hand.  Kunsei moved his chair next to his and placed his hand on Zack's stomach, feeling it break down his massive meal.  \"I didn't even know places like that were open this *hic* late...\" said Zack, thumping his chest, to force out another sharp belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBRRRRRRUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRPPPP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, spicy,\" half-joked Zack, causing both boys to laugh.  \"Yeah, Chocobo BBQ Wings is one of those 24/7 places.  Used to always order if I was working late-night at Shinra and couldn't eat there.\" responded Kunsei as he massaged Zack's aching belly, before yawning from exhaustion.  Zack did the same.  \"Well, I dunno 'bout you, but I'm about ready to hit the hay,\" said Zack as he groggily rubbed his eyes.  Kunsei nodded in agreement, but looked as though he had something to say, which Zack caught.  \"Something on your mind, dude?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I was-uhhh, I was gonna say...that couch is kind of old and rough, and my bed's a king-sized.  If you wanted to, you could always...well, uhhh, y'know....least for the night.  Course if you don't want to, that's cool too!\" said a nervous and flush Kunsei.</span></div></div>",

Kunsei was nodding, accepting it as an unspoken \"no\" when much to his surprise, Zack placed his arm around his shoulder and pecked him on the cheek, saying \"I'd love to.\"  Kunsei smiled back at his friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing up for the night, Kunsei stripped to his boxers and laid down in bed while Zack kept his board shorts on and did the same; his extensively bloated middle sticking up as he did.  Cuddling, Zack kept his arm wrapped around Kunsei's shoulder while he kept his wrapped around Zack's bulging stomach.  \"It's been quite a weekend thus far, hasn't it?\" asked Kunsei as he massaged Zack's stomach, to which, Zack smirked and simply nodded.  \"I swear, you could be a masseuse with those hands, dude...\" said Zack as he leaned back, enjoying his tummy rub.  <br>\r\n\"Hehe, weeeell, I don't think there's an open market for <i>'professional belly rubber'</i> just yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you could make your own business out of it.  Hell, you could probably make top dollar with hands like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Your pleasure is all the payment I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked back at his friend and smiled.  \"Right back at you, dude.  Which is why I was holding this in just for you...\"  Kunsei glanced curiously, until he felt Zack's stomach lurch inward as he took a quick gulp of air and immediately pushed it out in the form of a massive belch right in Kunsei's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP P!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer force was blowing Kunsei's hair back as Kunsei himself bit his lip with delight as Zack's burp extended for several seconds, carrying with it, the stench of his recently consumed meal.  As it finished, Kunsei sniffed and half-jokingly said, \"Mmmm, smells spicy.\"  Zack smiled and pulled his friend closer as Kunsei playfully rested his head onto Zack's chest.  \"Y'know, maybe I could wait a little longer before working this thing off,\" said Zack as he slapped his belly admirably.  Kunsei glanced curiously.  \"But what about SOLDIER?  Won't they get pissed if you're unfit enough for active field work?\" asked Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got plenty of vacation time I haven't cashed in, plus after the VR incident, Director Lazard tossed in a few extra weeks with pay as well.  Juuuuust one of the many perks of being a hero,\" joked Zack.  Kunsei chuckled alongside him.  <br>\r\n\"You really are amazing, Zack.\"<br>\r\n\"No, those wings...now THOSE were amazing...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, I'm not the only one who knows it.  Everyone loves you, man.  For all that you do for people, how hard you work, and that's not even getting into how amazing you are as just a person.  I mean you're funny, gentle, kind, optimistic, how many at Shinra can say the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blushed, from flattery and embarrassment as Kunsei kissed him on the cheek and followed by saying \"You're an amazing person, Zack Fair.\"  Zack glanced back at Kunsei and smiled sincerely, then said, \"Right back at you, Kunsei.\"  The two then locked lips and kissed intimately.</span></div></div>",

All was quiet and peaceful for a few minutes until a loud gurgling emanated from Zack's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GGGGUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRGGGGGGGLLLLLLE!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay in there?\" asked Kunsei as he stopped rubbing Zack's tummy.  A familiar look of discomfort grew over Zack's face as he turned to Kunsei and jokingly said, \"Are you SURE all this burping isn't ruining the mood?  I can't help but feel like sharing an amazing kiss and following it up with a monstrous burp is somewhat of a moment killer.\"<br>\r\nKunsei scoffed then said, \"Maybe that'd be true if your burps weren't so loud and manly, but because they are...\" he hinted with his eyes as he playfully nuzzled Zack's chest.  Taking the hint, Zack smiled then placed one hand atop his bloated belly, then after pressing rather hard, pushed out a massive <i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRR RRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei cooed with delight as Zack's burp carried on for several seconds as always.  As it finished, Zack sighed with relief and patted his belly proudly.  \"Just gets sexier every time,\" said Kunsei.  Zack smirked then turned to Kunsei and said, \"Please, I bet you could push out some mean ones too.\"  Kunsei stared curiously, \"...M-me?\" he said, a bit nervous about being on the spot.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you were letting out some pretty good ones when we ate.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, that was because I had food in my stomach, I was full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack scoffed then shook his head.  \"Oh no no no, this is <i>not</i> full,\" he said as he pat Kunsei's still slim and trim stomach.  \"THIS is full...\" he followed with before giving his infinitely larger belly a hearty slap.  \"Heh, no argument there.  Still, I'm not sure I know how to really do it on cue like you.  I really don't wanna embarrass myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Embarrassed?  It's me, you got nothing to be embarrassed about.  Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei glanced back at his friend then nodded.  He then took a deep breath and waited.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*urp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stared blankly for a moment, trying his best not to snicker.  Kunsei caught that and frowned, \"See?!  I told you!\" he said, humiliated.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's fine.  You just need a little guidance.  Who better than the master, right?\"<br>\r\nKunsei shrugged, still pretty embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Here, all you need to do is suck in a bunch of air from your esophagus down into your stomach.  Like so,\" Zack started before taking a few hearty gulps and burping it right back out.  \"Now, <i><b>*urrrrp*</b></i> you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Zack's advice, Kunsei reluctantly started gulping air.  He then pushed out a slightly louder burp, but still dinky in comparison.  \"Remember, the trick is to gulp it down into your stomach through your esophagus.  Your stomach should feel a little bloated before you let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it one more go, Kunsei gulped down a few more times, hand pressed against his stomach.  Sure enough, he felt it begin to feel harder and a bit expanded as the air accumulated.  He then paused briefly, before pushing out a shockingly loud and booming belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP PPPP!!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouder than any before it, Kunsei's burp was almost on par with one of Zack's.  Zack, meanwhile just stared in awe at his friend then applauded as it came to a close.  Kunsei sighed with relief, still wide eyed from the unexpected belch.  \"Holy crap....that came from me....?\"<br>\r\n\"It sure did, stud!\" Zack said, quite impressed.  <br>\r\n\"Y'know, that actually felt....really good!\" said Kunsei as he rubbed his stomach, satisfied with his expulsion.  He then gulped down more air and let rip an even longer burp than the one he'd just released.  Zack raised an eyebrow and smirked at his friend.  \"Sounds and smells like you're getting the hang of this...\" started Zack as he jokingly waved his hand around.  Kunsei chuckled.  \"What would you say to putting that newfound talent of yours to the test?\"<br>\r\n\"What, you mean like a burping contest?\"<br>\r\n\"If you're up to it.\"</span></div></div>",

Resting his hand against his bare stomach, he could feel his stomach push outward with all the air he'd just gulped down.  Letting it sit for a moment, Kunsei pushed firmly onto his stomach, forcing out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei's belch was impressive, particularly from a first timer, but Zack wasn't phased.  Instead, he simply gave his bloated stomach a good pat and let out a louder and gassier belch on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*HHHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer amount of content still being digested by Zack was working up a lot of natural gas which Zack had little to no problem letting rip almost immediately.  Kunsei caught on and scoffed.  \"I'm not giving up that easily, Fair.\"  Zack smiled and said, \"I would hope for no less,\" then thumped his chest and let out a sharp but quick belch right in Kunsei's face, causing both boys to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei then thumped his fist into his chest a few times, forcing out a small but pretty loud burp.  Looking unsatisfied, he continued down to his upper stomach, thumping at his top abs, and forcing out a louder belch than before, but nothing that would even come close to topping Zack's belches.  Meanwhile, Zack laughed and said, \"Oh come on, you can do better than that!\"  Both taunting yet encouraging his friend.  He then pressed against his stomach and pushed out another lengthy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRPP!!* </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, Zack smirked and awaited Kunsei's response.  He sucked a large quantity of air into his stomach, and tried to let rip a louder one, but as he opened his mouth, what emitted instead was not a booming belch, but instead a watery pre-vomit sounding burp, which caused Kunsei to cover his mouth and gag, before breaking into a violent coughing fit.  As he finished coughing, he thumped his chest, forcing out another small but deep belch.  Rolling his eyes, Zack leaned in towards his friend and placed his hand on Kunsei's thin stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing?  I don't have any food in my stomach,\" asked a confused Kunsei.  Zack nodded but continued onward to say, \"No, but there's always pent up air in your stomach somewhere.  The key is to find it and force as much of it out as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, he began to rub Kunsei's thin stomach much like how he would Zack's bloated stomach.  Feeling his abs against his hand, Zack smiled, seeing why Kunsei enjoyed working on Zack's stomach so much.  He then felt one part of the stomach to be a bit more tense than the rest, and clutched onto that part.  \"Aaaaaand eureka!\"  He then pressed on that part, forcing Kunsei's mouth open immediately as a gargantuan belch emitted from his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei's pent-up belch lasted longer and louder than any Zack had emitted over the night and carried enough force to blow Zack's lengthy hair back as he smiled proudly at his friend.  When the belch was over, Kunsei almost plopped back in his bed, exhausted.  Sighing with sweet relief, Kunsei patted his bare stomach, laughing wearily as he said \"Whew, that felt amazing...\"<br>\r\n\"Sounded amazing too...\" responded Zack, still in utter awe that his shy friend could produce such a monstrous belch.  \"Think it's safe to say who won the burping contest...\"<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Kunsei started, pausing as he pressed a hand to his stomach and forced out a wet after-burp, \"considering I could only burp that loudly with YOUR help, I think we'll call it a draw.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back at his friend, Zack gave him a peck on the cheek and said, \"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then laid back down in bed and cuddled the night away.</span></div></div>",

As the chocobo's outside crowed, Zack groggily opened his eyes, finding a still slumbering Kunsei lying peacefully atop his no longer bloated stomach.  The contents of Zack's stomach had finally digested overnight, and the result left Zack with a noticeably fatter gut, particularly his lower abdomen around his belly button.  Scooting the sleeping Kunsei aside to investigate, Zack clutched and felt around his tummy, which now felt much softer and a bit pudgier than he was accustomed.  Poking at his belly, Zack was amazed as it had a bit of a jiggle to it now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm a bloated little cow...\" he thought to himself with a smirk as Kunsei slowly awakened atop his friend.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, morning, stud...\" said a half awake Kunsei, head still laying comfortably atop Zack's belly like a pillow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack ruffled his friends hair and smiled back, responding with, \"Morning to you too, sunshine.  Hey, check out the work in progress...\" he said as he slapped his belly to illustrate his point, once again causing a ripple amidst his abdomen.  Kunsei looked down and was in shock at how much pudgier Zack's tummy had grown in such a short time.  Jaw damn near dropped, he began to prod and caress Zack's belly in an observatory fashion, producing a few suppressed and surprisingly ticklish giggles from Zack.<br>\r\n\"Wow, who'd have thought it would have grown so big in so short a while?\" said Kunsei.  Zack simply shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Not me.  Anyway, we should probably get back to it, shouldn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei nodded in agreement, then reluctantly rose from atop Zack's soft tummy.  Yawning, Zack scratched himself and rose to his feet, stretching his arms upward as he yawned again and headed towards the bathroom.  After washing up, he stepped atop the scale, and much to his surprise, the scale read 160 lbs.  Zack's eyes widened.  \"HO-LY-CRAP....160?  T-that would mean I put on almost 40 pounds since this weekend began!\"  Zack stopped for a moment then rested his hand atop his gut, pondering as his fingers drummed atop his slightly bulging belly.  \"Might take a little longer to work this bad boy off than I initially expected....although, alternatively, I COULD just keep it for a little while...\" he thought to himself.  As he did...</span></div></div>",

Clutching it with one hand, Zack smirked and licked his lips.  \"May as well get started then, shouldn't I?\" Zack thought to himself as he slapped his belly happily and exited the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting, the aroma of bacon and eggs sizzling on a pan almost lifted Zack off the ground as he took a big whiff and smiled, mouth watering at the flavorful scent emanating from the kitchen.  \"Mmmmm, smells like the Iron Chef of Shinra is hard at work.\" joked Zack as he approached Kunsei; now dressed in sweat pants and a black t-shirt, from behind and wrapped his arms around his shoulders, nuzzling the back of his neck with his chin playfully.  Kunsei smirked and added a dash of pepper to his pan.  \"Figured I'd make us a nice breakfast to start the day.  Then maybe we could go out and do something fun like see a movie or something.  How's that sound to you?\" asked Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Sounds delicious,\" he said with a smirk, tightening his grip ever so slightly around Kunsei's shoulders.  Kunsei smiled back at Zack and gave him a light peck before resuming his scrambling of the eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack changed his board shorts, and put on another oversized sleeveless t-shirt.  However, due to the increase in the size of his stomach, his shirt road up slightly, not hanging off as loosely as it always did.  As time passed, Kunsei had whipped up a hearty amount of bacon, with scrambled eggs, some sausage, and buttery French Toast lathered with Maple Syrup.  The mere sight of this feast made Zack's mouth water as the two placed everything on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, the proportions were plenty, but this time, both plates were stacked up pretty bountiful, though Zack's still had much more in comparison to Kunsei's plate.  \"Is that French Toast?\" asked Zack curiously.<br>\r\n\"Sure is.  Figured I'd mix things up instead of the usual bout of Pancakes and Waffles.  You don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, not at all, dude!  I've just never actually had French Toast before.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT??!\" blurted out Kunsei surprisingly astonished, startling Zack for a moment.  \"NEVER?!!\"<br>\r\n\"...No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Kunsei immediately cut up a tiny piece of his French Toast and stuck it with a fork, bringing it towards Zack's mouth.  \"I'm sorry, but such an injustice has to be resolved immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"Injustice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Zack opened wide and bit off the piece of French Toast hanging from Kunsei's fork and chewed briefly.  Kunsei waited eagerly for Zack's feedback, and got it when Zack's eyes widened.  \"Ho-ly-crap...\" muttered a dumbstruck Zack.  He then glanced down at his own plate of French Toast and immediately tore into it with his fork and knife.  Kunsei smirked and went back to his own breakfast.  \"Justice has been served...\" he said to himself half-jokingly and half-serious.</span></div></div>",

Zack was a beast, putting it all away with way more ease than before, all the while, his already bigger gut was growing ever so slowly with each mouthful gulped down, and it didn't even seem to phase Zack in the slightest, or even slow him down.  It was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei admired as the young man continued to scarf his face with no signs of slowly down anywhere in sight.  \"Hehe, I guess with that jollier gut of yours, you can put away more now, can'tcha?\" said Kunsei as he poked Zack's belly.  Zack smirked as he wiped some bacon grease from his mouth.  \"Definitely seems that way, don't it?\" he said as he leaned back in his chair and gave his thick belly a hearty slap, letting it jiggle briefly for emphasis before he resumed scarfing down his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dude, *GULP* this is all so good, dude!  *MUNCH!*  I'm telling ya, man!  I've NEVER met a cook as good as you!\" Zack said to Kunsei, causing his friend to blush a bit from the complement.  \"If you like it, that's good enough for me, Zack.\" responded Kunsei as he watched Zack take a large chunk of French Toast and munch it down in one go.  He then poured himself a glass of OJ and gulped it down in one go, just barely six seconds flat.  Slamming his cup onto the table, Zack pressed a hand to his belly and burped enormously immediately after.  Kunsei grinned.  \"Good one as always, champ.\"  Grinning like a kid, Zack gulped some air and burped out the words, *THAAAANK*....*YYEEEEOOOOOOUUUUU*....*URRRP* and then continued onward with his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, Zack continued to stuff his face, and more and more, his gut continued to push outward little by little, eventually to the point where his shirt road up high enough to expose his belly button.  After some time had finally passed, all that remained of Zack's hearty breakfast was a stack of plates and a few crumbs here and there.  Licking his lips, Zack leaned back and rested both hands atop his vastly bloated belly victoriously.  Kunsei then sat next to Zack and rested his ear atop his exposed belly like a father to a pregnant wife.  \"Enjoying the show?\" laughed Zack as he wrapped his arm around Kunsei, making him almost hug against his belly.  \"Hehe, I can hear it all sloshing and digesting in there.  It's absolutely incredible, dude!\" responded Kunsei as he continued to listen in the breakfast he had prepared for his friend now breaking down and digesting in Zack's large stomach.  Suddenly, Kunsei could hear a loud gassy gurgling emanate from Zack's stomach.  \"Hehe, let's see if you can hear this....\" said Zack mischievously as he clutched the side of his gut with one hand, and looked down at Kunsei, who looked back up at Zack, awaiting eagerly as he knew what was gonna happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR UUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let fly another massive, gassy belch, this time right in Kunsei's face.  Several seconds passed as Kunsei almost basked in the bacon scented gas blowing in his face.  Finally when it ended, Zack sighed and Kunsei patted Zack's belly happily.  \"Smelled like you really did enjoy your breakfast,\" laughed Kunsei.  Zack merely nodded and licked his lips, still savoring the delightful taste.  \"I suuuuure did...\" he said, slapping his belly for emphasis, soliciting a smaller burp afterward.  He then glanced down at Kunsei and with puppy dog eyes, asked, \"Hate to ask, but would you mind working your magic?\"  Grinning widely, Kunsei nodded and began to rub his large belly with both hands.  Admiring his bloated flesh, Kunsei kissed Zack's stomach tenderly as he rubbed it in large, circular motions with both hands.  \"Do you have any idea just how hot you are right now?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack smirked cheesily and brushed the back of his head and nodded, \"Hehe, well I have a hunch, dude.  I have a hunch...\"  The two continued on for a little while as Zack moaned in delight at the feel of Kunsei's magic fingers easing the tension to Zack's immensely bloated gut, occasionally letting out another monstrous burp in the process, much to Kunsei's delight.</span></div></div>",

Debating whether or not he should share said thought with Kunsei while receive perhaps the most incredible tummy rub a man could receive, Zack finally decided to ask and see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Kunsei...can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Anything you like, man.\"<br>\r\n\"All this; the belly rubs, the feeding, the getting to know each other better...you ever do this sorta thing with anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei stopped for a moment and pondered long and hard at Zack's question.  Finally, Kunsei responded by saying, \"Well, yes and no,\" and proceeded to resume rubbing Zack's large stomach.  \"See, when I was younger, I...well, wasn't quite as sure what to make of things in terms of how I felt about people.  But I had a hunch, since back then, I'd love nothing more than to see my friends stuff their little faces, and to see their always razor thin stomachs push outward to their absolute limits.  And being the only kid that I could think of who knew how to cook, and cook WELL, that made it all that much easier to help make it happen so I could watch them gorge themselves whenever we hung out.\"  Zack nodded then chuckled to himself, still enjoying the feeling of Kunsei's hands stroking Zack's still tender belly, before responding with, \"I figured as much.  You're way too good at all this for me to be the first.  I mean, I'm definitely not that special, haha!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei stopped for a moment and stared back at Zack in a very direct manner.  \"But you are special, because I didn't love any of them.\"  And as soon as those words exited Kunsei's mouth, it was almost as though Zack had forgotten he was utterly stuffed to the brim, and glanced back down at Kunsei as the two locked eyes for a moment.  Zack couldn't explain it, for some reason, he got misty eyed for a moment, then smiled back at the young man.  \"Love you too, dude.\"  He then wrapped his muscular arm around Kunsei's hip and gave him a big old bear hug, almost lifting him from his seat.  Kunsei laughed and embraced Zack proudly, before continuing to give Zack his tension easing tummy rub.  \"Plus, none of them were ever lucky enough to enjoy this either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed, as he resumed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a hearty breakfast, both teens headed out for the day, simply wandering down the Slums towards old town.  Zack kept one muscular arm around Kunsei, and the other atop his vastly bloated gut.  His shirt was especially tight on him given how distended his stomach had grown since breakfast.  Kunsei could notice a faint jiggle in Zack's belly with every step they took, and smiled.  \"You're really coming along, aren't you?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack smirked and gave his gut a hearty slap, then said, \"Trying to, hehe.  I almost wonder how much further this bad boy can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well I'm sure we'll find out soon enough, won't we?\"  Said Kunsei.  \"Sooner than that.\" responded Zack.  And as if to emphasize this, his large stomach let out a shockingly hungry rumble, much to Kunsei's surprise.  \"And here I thought breakfast would sate you.  Alas...\" he said, smiling to himself, and earning a chuckle from Zack, before he jokingly said, \"Sorry, all that good eatin' just made me so darn hungry!\"  The two laughed then continued wandering down the desolate region of old decaying buildings and temples, impressed that places like this could survive as long as they have in Midgar.  \"It's kind of peaceful here,\" said Zack, while Kunsei nodded and admired the scene, then said \"I always try to imagine what kind of people lived here, how they spent every day life, or even where they all went and why they left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not EVERYONE left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turn around and spot a hooded figure approaching them with a toothy malicious grin over his shadowy face.  \"Some of us came back...thought we might keep an eye on the ol' place...and uhhh, between you'n me, we don't really take to kindly to having outsiders in our neck'uh the woods...\"  Zack guarded Kunsei and edged back cautiously.  \"...Alright pal, just take it easy and we'll be outta your hair,\" stated an alert Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, sorry kid, but it don't work that way....\" said the hooded figure as he pulled his hood back, revealing glowing red eyes and dead skin.  As Zack took notice, two other figures came from behind the two, both armed with knives, both whom had the same condition.  \"Marauders...\" warned Kunsei.  \"Think I know what happened to the people who lived here, Kunsei.  They lived in peace and got by just fine, until bastards like this came along and terrorized them to the point of abandoning the place they once called home for their own safety.\"  The head Marauder laughed and said, \"More or less.  Difference is, THEY were smart enough not to come back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack took a fighting stance, but winced as his stomach began to cramp up, Kunsei looked worried and whispered, \"...you up for this?\"  Zack grimaced, but took his stance firmly and fiercely, before responding with, \"I'm always up for taking out the garbage.\"  The three marauders circled the two young men like a pack of wolves, and on the Alpha Marauders command, all three moved in for the kill.  One several swings with his blade at Kunsei, who barely managed to evade each attack.  Zack however, was holding off two including the Alpha, until one of the underlings overpowered Zack and grabbed him by the arms in a shoulder lock while Alpha jumped towards the boy and began delivering a flurry of punches into Zack's stomach, none of which was helping with his previous cramping.  Kunsei kicked the underling he was fighting aside and moved in to aide his friend, pulling the guy holding Zack down off just long enough for Zack to break free and deliver one fierce punch to the Alpha's jaw, knocking him off his feet and into a pile of rubble while he immediately moved in on the other two.  One took a swing with his knife, which Zack blocked with his forearm, slicing it good, while the other slashed at Zack's bicep.  Zack's blood painted the ruins, but it wasn't enough to stop him from grabbing one of the Marauders by the arm and hurling him with all his might into the second one, knocking them both back while Zack moved on the offensive and grabbed the two while they were down and punched them both out cold.  Zack was on fire, but his still bloated stomach was in agony from all the sudden burst of movement and impact.  The adrenaline rush was too much for it to slow Zack down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha rose back to his feet, eyes glowing an unnatural red as fire began to form from his palm.  \"Now I'm pissed...\" he said before sending a wave of Fira blasts at Zack and Kunsei, forcing both behind a pile of rubble for cover.  Kunsei noticed the blood leaking rapidly from his friend, Zack smirked to him and said, \"Just superficial wounds, I'll be fine.  But THIS jackass...?\"  Zack grabbed a piece of stone and as soon as the Alpha reeled to toss another Fira ball, Zack hurled the chunk of stone right to his dome and knocked him out cold.  The two stepped out, the trouble was over.  \"Are you okay?\" asked Zack, who appeared noticeably white in the face, forcing Kunsei to disregard the question and examine his friend immensely concerned.  \"Don't worry about me, look at yourself!  We gotta get you treated now!\" pleaded Kunsei, only to be drowned out by a vicious gurgling in Zack's stomach, causing him to clutch his gut in pain and fall to his knees.  \"W-what's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I probably should'a waited to digest breakfast before taking on a pack of Marauders...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Zack wretched profusely, spewing the contents of his previous meal and then some.  While disgusting, Kunsei sat beside his friend and rubbed his back to help coax the process.  \"It's okay, it's okay, man.  Just let it out,\" said Kunsei as comforting as he could, to which Zack complied.  After several moments, Zack groaned and clutched his slightly less distended stomach in agony.  \"Oh man, that hurt like hell...\" said a weakened Zack.  Kunsei then placed Zack's arm over his shoulder and helped walk him back towards the Slums while still trying to dial for medical emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, no signal,\" cursed Kunsei.  Zack simply groaned in response.  \"Alright, just hang tight, man, they might be able to help out back home.  Just tough it out.\"  <br>\r\n\"...I told you, I'm fine...\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, you're about to pass out from blood loss.\"<br>\r\n\"......Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually arrived to the slums, and much to Kunsei's surprise, a crowd of people were already waiting for them.  \"Oh God, what did Sev do to this boy?!  Get the doctor now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of young boys ran back into the central Slums while everyone else backed up, giving Zack and Kunsei room to breath.  \"...How do you guys know what happened....?\" asked a weakened Zack.  One of the residents said, \"We started hearing explosions back in old town and knew it could only be Sev.\"<br>\r\n\"...Oh, you mean that Marauder jerk...?  Yeah, he's not gonna be bothering anyone for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd stared amongst themselves then back to Zack and Kunsei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Zack took that Sev guy and both his cronies down.  In fact, all three are still out cold.  Now I know you guys don't like Shinra all that much, but if you can get them on the line-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kunsei could finish, several had already pulled out their phones and dialed to have the three captured and detained before they could regain consciousness.  \"....I don't understand, w-who was that guy...?\"<br>\r\n\"Ten years ago, Sev worked for SOLDIER before he was dishonorably discharged for what he did to a local village housing an enemy milita.  His Fira magic made him a menace, and when he came to our town demanding we join him in his vendetta against SOLDIER, he used Fira to terrorize our fair city into submission.\"<br>\r\n\"But when that didn't work, he just started attacking us nonstop until we fled.  He single handedly took our town and claimed it for himself, letting the whole thing rot.  That's why the Slums is what it is today.  There's so many of us and so little to go around.  We tried turning to the rest of Midgar, but none of us could really afford to live there.\"<br>\r\n\"But with Sev gone, maybe now we can actually start rebuilding what he took from us.  Hell, maybe a few us'll join Shinra and learn the same kind of spells he learned in case others like him or any of those monsters try to stir up trouble!\"<br>\r\n\"You single handedly saved this town, young man.  And we owe you an immense debt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack smiled weakly then nudged Kunsei.  \"...No.  WE saved the town.  I'd have been mince meat if Kunsei here didn't save me from Sev's goons...and thanks by the way...\"  Kunsei was at a loss for words.  Even in such a weakened state, his friend was still looking out for him.  He smiled back and whispered, \"...thanks, Zack.\"  Zack winked back then turned to the crowd and said, \"....Uh, not to be a burden, but I'm kinda....dying over here?  Any chance I can see a doctor any time soon....?\"  He laughed cheesily then passed out just as the doctor arrived.</span></div></div>",

Kunsei's fear subsided as he saw the item.  \"Is that...?\"<br>\r\n\"I was saving it for a rainy day, but all things considered, I suppose I could spare one for the occasion,\" said the doctor.  The magical feather glowed bright as it broke into thousands of white particles which were absorbed into Zack's body, healing his wounds and returning the color to his skin.  Groaning, Zack's eyes flickered as he regained consciousness.  Kunsei sighed with relief and immediately hugged his friend.  The crowd cheered as Zack came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, w-what just happened...?\" asked Zack.  The doctor smiled to the boy and said, \"Young man, if you ever intend to take on another renegade SOLDIER operative and his flunkies, I recommend you invest in a Phoenix Down or two.  Don't worry, that one's on the house.  Call it a gift for taking down Sev.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, those things really DO work!  Thanks a bunch, doc!\"<br>\r\n\"Please, we're the one's who're thankful.  And if there's anything you need-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the doctor could finish his praise, a familiar rumbling emanated from Zack's much less distended stomach, causing him to chuckle sheepishly and blush with embarrassment.  \"Ehehe, weeeeell, now that you mention it, kicking Sev's butt DID kinda made me a little peckish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, as long as you're here, anywhere you feel like grabbing a bite; all you can stomach, on the house,\" called out a grateful voice from the crowd.  Zack turned to Kunsei and smiled innocently.  \"How's that sound to you?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei smiled back and patted Zack's stomach lightly then said, \"Sounds delicious.  What'll it be, Mr. Hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack pondered while his stomach continued to growl audibly.  Then decided....</span></div></div>",

Stop on by any time if you think you're up for the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack raised an eyebrow, very intrigued by the burly Steakhouse Owners offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, both Zack and Kunsei headed to his Steakhouse and were seated immediately by the owner himself.  He turned to Kunsei and asked, \"Can I get you anything, son?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Tri-Tip medium rare sounds good.  And I guess, a lemonade and baked potato on the side if you wouldn't mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said, then turned to Zack grinning, \"As for you; anyone who can take on Sev and live can surely take on the Show Stopper.\"<br>\r\nZack glanced curiously.  \"What's that?\" he asked.  \"The ultimate piece of meat heaven.  72 ounces of tender meat, marinaded to zesty perfection, with caramelized onions sprinkled on top, and a cash prize for anyone who can overcome her.  FYI, that current list consists of zero.  I wanna see if you got the stomach to be number one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked back at Kunsei and winked confidently.  \"Let's do it!  Also, can I get a pitcher of cola?\"  The owner nodded then headed back with their orders.  Kunsei glanced a bit curiously at Zack and asked, \"Soooo, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel lively, to be honest.  Could be the Phoenix Down, could be the fact that I'm not dead, or it could just be the idea of eating 72 ounces of steak in one sitting.  How about you?  How are you holding up, man?\"<br>\r\n\"Me?  Oh, I'm uhh, I'm fine.  Just a little exhausted after all the commotion.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.  It's so much to take in.  I had no idea things got so bad over here because of one person.  It almost makes you wonder why SOLDIER was never sent to deal with Sev.  Surely he'd have been taken out with ease against Angeal, Sephiroth or even Genesis.  So why wasn't anyone ever deployed?  More important than that, how come neither of us ever even heard the name Sev until today?\"<br>\r\n\"A lot's changed in Shinra and SOLDIER the past 10 years.  Most of us were just kids when Sev got thrown out of SOLDIER, and command probably wanted to wipe any trace of him and his crimes ever existing within their ranks.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you think SOLDIER will do with him now that he's been arrested?\"<br>\r\n\"Sev's an enemy to the state, they'll lock him up and throw away the key.  After what he's done to these people, and what he's probably done to a lot more, he deserves a lot worse.\"<br>\r\n\"Killing him won't undo his crimes or make the pain he inflicted on others any easier, Kunsei.  Better we learn from him and his mistakes and hopefully, our own so SOLDIER doesn't make another mistake like Sev again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei nodded.  What happened was clearly troubling him, so Zack didn't push the subject further.  Instead, he hoped to take his mind off the trouble that ensued and back to taking his stomach to the max when the Owner returned with Kunsei's steak at hand.  \"Here ya go.\"  He placed it in front of the young man while a separate waiter brought the two their drinks.  Then, yet another waiter heaved out a massive silver platter with a giant hunk of meat painted exactly how the owner had described it and set it before a wide-eyed Zack.  \"Good luck, kid.\" he said, half confident and half tauntingly then let them be.  Both Zack and Kunsei simply stared at the massive slab of cow meat for a good while, at a complete loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's....that's a lot of meat...\" said Kunsei.  \"....I hadn't noticed....\" responded Zack, half sarcastic, but too in awe to really emphasize his sarcasm.  Zack turned to see several patrons watching eagerly to see how far Zack would take it.  Just then, his stomach rumbled eagerly.  Glancing down, he shrugged then grabbed his fork and knife.  \"Well...here goes nothing.\"  And with that, he dug right in.  Slicing that first piece, Zack took his first bite.  His eyes widened as the sheer juiciness and flavor was absolutely overwhelming.  Licking his lips, he immediately dug in and took his second bite.  Then his third.  Then his forth.  \"MMmm, *GULP*, dude, this may seriously be one of the best steaks I've ever tasted...\" said Zack between bites.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei had already made good progress on his regular steak, but was all too in awe at Zack chowing down to focus his attention on his own meal.  Several bites in, and Zack hadn't shown any signs of slowing down.  His belly had expanded little by little, pushing outward to its' previously bloated state this morning, and the steak wasn't even a third of the way finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, and Kunsei had long since finished his meal.  Zack was roughly half way into the Show Stopper.  36 straight ounces of juicy steak was now just sitting in his vastly bloated belly.  Zack's stomach strained his shorts, and had grown so large that his oversized shirt had grown quite tight atop it, so much so that the very bottom of his shirt rode up, exposing his bare belly flesh, while he himself had slowed down immensely since starting this endeavor.  After finishing his next bite, Zack stopped for a moment and leaned back into his chair, rubbing his distended gut tenderly.  His stomach felt like a small boulder with the amount of meat that had yet to be digested just sitting inside it.  \"Oh man, I don't think I've ever been this full before...\" groaned Zack as he unbuttoned his shorts and let his belly protrude outward to the point that his shirt rode up just above his belly button.  His gut gurgled, digesting what it could while Zack continued to nurse it from the outside.  Suddenly, he began to look a little green around the gills.  The crowd around him, owner included, winced, preparing for the worst.  Kunsei however, smirked, knowing what was about to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRU UUUUPPPPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let fly a monstrous belch which lasted close to eight seconds.  Kunsei watched as Zack's belly actually quaked with his massive eruption, almost like jello.  Some patrons appeared grossed out, others laughed, while the owner was still invested in seeing if Zack could finish.  Smacking his lips, Zack groaned with relief.  \"Ohhhh man, that felt good...\" said Zack before burping again and giving his belly a good pat.  \"Y'know, I think that may've cleared up some room.  So onto round two,\" he said to himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Digging right back in, Zack continued onto the second half of the 72 ounces.  Each bite, a strain, but Zack downed it all the same, while his abdomen continued to swell outward more and more with every few bites.  Kunsei just stared in awe at how large his belly had grown and how much larger it was going to get.  At no point since this week began had Zack ever pushed himself this far.  Just imagining how badly Zack was going to need someone to help ease the pain of such an immense fullness was overwhelming for Kunsei as he discreetly bit his lip with anticipation.  For the most part, undertaking this challenge had helped take Kunsei's mind off of Sev and the Marauders, just as Zack had hoped.  Unfortunately for Zack, this steak may have been quite literally a bit more than he could chew.  Still, that didn't stop him.  Swallowing another mouthful, Zack poured himself a glass of cola and chugged it down within seconds to help wash down the steak.  Sighing heartily, Zack gave his muscular chest an open palm thump and burped loud enough for patrons outside the restaurant to hear, then got back to work on the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little, the steak began to disappear into Zack's ever expanding stomach.  The crowd was eager with anticipation to see if Zack could truly be the first to beat the Steakhouse challenge.  So much so that they were no longer grossed out by the piggish noises emanating from the boy as he progressed.  Some more time had passed and the steak was almost finished.  Zack, however, looked like he was about ready to toss the bib.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned in pain and clenched his immensely bloated belly with both hands, wanting so badly for the challenge to be over.  The mere thought of taking another bite was nauseating to the young hero.  Pressure was building within him, but he knew if he burped it out, there was a good chance something else would come up with the excess air, which would disqualify him and render this entire endeavor meaningless.  So he just sat there, sweating and hurting.  \"Ugh....Kunsei, I really don't know if I can...*mrrp* keep going...\" said Zack, whose voice was horsed from the pain.  But Kunsei glanced back at Zack assuredly and intensely then said, \"Of course you can!  I know you, Zack!  There's not a single obstacle that you can't overcome!  No amount of pain you can't fight through!  Hell, you already conquered a giant burger not too longer ago, this outta be a cakewalk!\"<br>\r\n\"PLEASE...stop mentioning giant food...\" said Zack queasily.  Kunsei shrugged then said, \"Point being, you're a warrior, and one of the toughest I've ever known.  Now, do what you set out to do and show these people how a REAL man eats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at the last little bit of steak left, Zack took a deep breath, and slowly brought it to his lips and after a moment, opened wide.    He chewed on the large chunk of meat for quite a while, while everyone around him watched, anxiously and cautiously.  After some time, Zack gulped down that one final mouthful  Then winced.  After a moment, he opened his mouth to prove it was gone and held his empty platter up high.  There was silence.  Then, the crowd cheered.  \"I KNEW you had it in you!\" said Kunsei.  Zack smiled weakly and said, \"...that makes one of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant owner then came to Zack would a large trophy stuffed with some prize money and shook his hand for a photo.  \"Well done, son.  I knew anyone tough enough to beat Sev and save our town was tough enough for the Show Stopper.  Heh, how'd ya like the steak?\"  Zack opened his mouth to answer, but as he did, the air that was building up and waiting to be expelled could wait no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRR RRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the largest belch Zack had ever produced, it was loud enough to drown out the congratulatory cheers and forceful enough to blow the owners hair back.  After several seconds, it winded down, and Zack blushed with immense embarrassment, before rubbing the back of his head nervously and muttering a sheepish, \"...s'cuse me...\"  The patrons couldn't help but laugh, the owner included.  \"I'll take that as a complement, hehe.  Well, congrats on your victory, boy.  And once again, thanks so much for all you've done for us.  Remember, you and your friend are always welcome back here, whenever you want a bite to eat on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Kunsei thanked the man and after a few more thanks and expressions of gratitude from the rest of the crowd, both teens headed back to Kunsei's apartment.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Returning immediately back to the apartment, Kunsei helped Zack in, only for both to stumble onto the couch as Zack's immensely bloated gut stuck ouward and rested down almost towards as far as his thighs.  He groaned; exhausted from the day.  \"Ugh, man...was that something or what...?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei simply smirked, still impressed and in awe that Zack actually managed to finish the Steak Challenge in one piece, then patted his friends belly gently in a congratulatory manner.  \"Fantastic progress, man,\" said Kunsei, I didn't think anyone could eat that much in just one sitting, let ALONE one plate!\"  Zack's stomach rumbled as he groaned and said, \"Ugh, neither did I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kunsei lifted Zack's strained shirt off, exposing his still muscular torso coinciding with his bulbous gut and said, \"Here, lemme make it feel a little better,\" and with that, began rubbing his friends rock hard boulder of a gut.  \"Ohhhhh, thank you so much, Kunsei.  Can't tell you how badly I needed this...\" said Zack with a much more relaxed and less strained voice.  Kunsei was amazed.  Zack's belly was more distended now than it had ever been, and the feel of his taut, bloated, yet still firm flesh along the palm of his hands felt heartier than ever.  Kunsei found himself grabbing big slabs of flesh amidst the dome of a belly protruding through Zack's torso.  He could feel his gut tense up and ease as he did his best to rub around the much larger gut.  Zack simply kicked back and enjoyed the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as he felt his friends body in his hands, he remembered back to that moment during their fight against Sev and his goons, watching Zack taking such a vicious beating, then getting cut up left and right before overpowering Sev's henchmen, and despite his best efforts, it began to overwhelm Kunsei, who looked away, troubled.  Zack took notice, then nudged his friend gently.  \"Something wrong?\" asked Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was just, thinking about our fight with Sev.  Seeing what they almost did to you...\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Almost</i> being the key word-\"<br>\r\n\"Zack, you could've been killed...w-who knows what might've happened if we didn't make it back to the Slums in time, o-or if that doctor didn't just happen to have a Phoenix Down on him!  I mean, I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered and scared, Kunsei tried his best not to break down.  Zack did his best to calm him down.  \"What happened, happened.  It's done now, and so is Sev.\"<br>\r\n\"...I was scared.  I didn't want to lose you, but I'm not as strong as you...I couldn't keep you safe from their assault...\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?  You DID keep me safe, remember?  If you hadn't gotten me out of their hold, Sev would probably STILL be using my gut as a punching bag!\" Zack said, half joking as he gave his large gut a pat for emphasis.  \"Don't ever doubt yourself, Kunsei.  You didn't run away.  You stuck by me.  You fought alongside me, and you carried me and this friggin keg all the way back to the town.  I owe you my life, man...\"  Hearing that, Kunsei glanced back at Zack as tears welled up, he rolled his eyes and looked away.  \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be such a baby....\" said an embarrassed Kunsei, but Zack wrapped his arm around him tight and squeezed playfully.  \"Don't sweat it, <i>Mr. Hero.</i>\"  Kunsei rolled his eyes and nudged back.  \"Oh gimme a break,\" responded Kunsei.  After a brief moment, he smiled back and rested his head on Zack's chiseled chest while wrapping his arms around Zack's bloated middle.  He could feel it rumbling fiercely.  \"Sounds like someone's tummy is working overtime,\" joked Kunsei as he rested his palm dead center to Zack's gut.  \"May I?\"  Zack leaned back, smiling then said, \"Have at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kunsei pressed down onto Zack's gurgling belly, forcing up a considerable amount of the excess gas building from his stomach digesting all that steak at once in the form of a disgustingly loud and bassy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR RRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not the longest, Zack's burp was loud enough to be heard from well outside the apartment.  As it ended, Zack sighed with relief.  \"Ahhhh, there it is...\" said Zack happily as he patted his belly proudly.  Kunsei smiled and said, \"Jeez, maybe I should'a worn earplugs!\" joked Kunsei, before he asked \"Feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shook his head and grinned mischievously before saying, \"Actually, I think there's still quite a bit left in there.  That much meat always gives me a wicked case of gas.  Would you do the honors?\"  Kunsei smiled back eagerly and said, \"My pleasure.\"  And so, Kunsei spent the next several moments prodding and pushing against Zack's bloated belly, forcing out one monstrous belch after another, and enjoying every second of it.  Zack felt as though a cinderblock had been lifted from his stomach as each burp relieved a great deal of pressure from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!*  \"Man, I dunno how you *EEEERRRRRPP!* do it, dude, but when it comes to helping a man *BBBUUUURRRRRP*...burp, you're a *PRO!*\" said Zack between burps.  Kunsei smiled and nudged ever so slightly just above Zack's belly button, forcing out a particularly loud belch which carried on for several seconds.  \"What can I say?  I know what a body needs and where it needs it,\" responded Kunsei as he continued to prod and push away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, but finally, Zack was all 'burped out', save for a few little afterburps here and there.  His stomach felt just slightly lighter, still immensely bloated, but relieved enough to where he could move around with a little more ease.  Looking at the time, Kunsei yawned and said, \"Well, I don't know about you, but I could REALLY use some shut eye right about now.  How about you, Zack?\"</span></div></div>",

Still in board shorts, Zack plopped heavily onto Kunsei's bed as his stomach stuck up tremendously.  Resting both hands atop it, Zack felt the added weight and how far out his midsection had now expanded since this gaining escapade had begun.  \"Damn, I'm gettin' huuuuuuge!\" Zack thought to himself.  He then turned to see Kunsei stripping down to his striped boxers.  Jokingly, Zack started mouthing pole dancing music as Kunsei neatly tucked his clothes aside and rolled his eyes.  \"Har har har.  Too funny, Porky Pine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack giggled immaturely as Kunsei hopped into bed alongside his friend, snuggling gently into Zack's bloated belly.  \"Mmm, your stomach's so warm and cozy,\" said Kunsei with a tired smile on his face.  Smiling back, Zack wrapped his toned arm around his friend and snugged him closer.  \"Yeah, well, this big ol' tank's gotta be good for something,\" responded Zack as he patted his gut gently for emphasis.  \"And thanks for working your magic earlier, man.  I'd still be a complete gassy mess if it weren't for those magic fingers'uh yours.\"  Kunsei nodded then kneaded the sides of Zack's belly gently as a response, causing the bloated boy to moan in ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how much bigger do you plan on getting?\" asked Kunsei half eager half curious as he absent mindedly continue to rub Zack's belly slowly.  Zack shrugged, then after giving his belly a hearty slap, causing his taut flesh to jiggle slightly, he said, \"I guess however bigger I can physically take it.  Cause afterall, the bigger the stomach, the cozier the pillow, right?\"  To respond, Kunsei teasingly adjusted himself to Zack's stomach then plopped his head back into Zack's belly freely.  \"Besides,\" Zack started, \"I've really enjoyed doing all this with you since we started.  The eating, hanging out, eating, getting to know each other, eating, and just...just having this together.  It's a feeling I wouldn't trade for anything else in the world, and one I want to keep experiencing for as long as I can.\"  The two then stared silently for a moment before sharing in a short but tender kiss,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither would I,\" responded Kunsei afterward.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, Zack's eyes flickered opened as he groggily rubbed them with his fist.  Looking over at the alarm clock, he saw that it was almost 10:30am and Kunsei was already wide awake and in the living room.  Cracking his neck, Zack yawned heartily, stretching both his arms high towards the sky before plopping them both to his tummy.  His meal had properly digested overnight and therefore, his stomach had shrunken down considerably.  However, as he prodded and clutched his taut flesh, he felt a considerable surplus of pudge where muscle used to be.  Surprised, Zack smiled and slowly caressed his belly admirably.  \"Heh, coming along quite handsomely, aren't we?\" said Zack to no one in particular, before giving his gut a hearty slap and feeling it jiggle in the palm of his hand.  Giggling to himself, he rose up and exited to the living room.  His eyes widened with curiosity when he saw several bags of what looked like Take-Out on the table and Kunsei on the couch watching T.V.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, studly,\" greeted Kunsei.  Zack was still curious about the bags.  \"Morning.  Uhh did you go out?\" asked Zack.<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh yeah, I ordered take-out for breakfast.  Figured you'd wanna put that 'free food' thing to use from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n\"Free food?  When did I-oh-OHHHH, right!  Right, cause we saved the town from that pyro nut.  Sorry, dude, I'm still all over the place from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n\"No apologies necessary.  Anyway, go wash up and whenever you're ready, let's dig in.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sniff, Zack licked his lips at the smell in the air and rubbed his now growling stomach with anticipation.  \"Sounds delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a soothing shower, Zack scrubbed down and stepped onto the scale to see where he was at currently.  \"166 lbs, not half bad,\" said Zack as he slapped his gut proudly.  166 wasn't a lot at all, but the fat hadn't been distributing to other portions of his body, which was why the rest of Zack was still as chiseled and trim as ever.  Instead, it all went straight to his stomach, creating a gradually distending belly where his abs once were.  After brushing his teeth, Zack just stared in the mirror, continuing to admire his gradually growing gut.  He was surprised at how he could now grab a big chunk of fat towards his lower abdomen pull it slightly.  He found that his softer middle complemented the rest of his muscle bound physique quite handsomely, and it only made him want to push on further.  Just then, his stomach rumbled loudly, reminding Zack of what was waiting for him outside.  So he rinsed out his mouth and headed right out eagerly and hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat awaited him was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ho-lee-crap...\" was all Zack could say when he saw the sheer size of the pizza on the table, whose mix of sweet tangy BBQ sauce, sausage and zesty cheddar cheese was filling the room with an enchanting aroma.  Zack took one big whiff and his mouth immediately began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking, after all the excitement yesterday, how would you feel about just relaxing here for the day?\" asked Kunsei.<br>\r\n\"Eh hehe, I could definitely use a lazy day after all that,\" Zack responded, brushing the back of his head nervously reliving the attack.  \"Besides, it'll be fun!  Like we can kick back, watch TV, play games, and everything in between!  Plus, if we're all by ourselves...\" Zack started before grinning mischievously, \"...then no reason to so modest, riiiiight?\" he finished before pulling his short of and letting his bare torso do all the talking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei nodded in agreement then smiled as he grabbed some paper plates and his mugs for the 2Liter bottle of cola set alongside the pizza box.  \"Hope you're hungry.\"  As if to respond, Zack's stomach let out a tremendous groan, causing the young bloated hero to chuckle sheepishly.  \"Ask questions; get answers,\" he muttered as Kunsei laughed to himself and handed Zack his plate and cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetite,\" said Kunsei before grabbing a few slices and putting them on his plate.  Glancing back, he saw Zack already scarfing down his first slice at immensely quick pace.  \"Holy cow, you keep getting quicker and quicker.  Watch, next time, it'll be a slice per bite!\" Kunsei half joked, thinking that wasn't all together impossible for Zack, especially if challenged.  Chewing up the last bit of crust and gulping down a hearty mouthful, Zack smacked his lips and promptly moved onto his second slice like clockwork, eventually gulping the whole thing down in no time at all.  Licking the sauce from his hands, Zack grinned before giving his belly a hearty pat of satisfaction.  \"Mmmm-MMM!  Now THESE folks know how to make a pizza!\" said Zack as he continued to rub his sated tummy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing his first slice, Kunsei glanced back at Zack and asked, \"You're done eating?\"  Zack raised an eyebrow before glancing back and Kunsei and blurting out a very blunt \"Hell no!\" and getting right back into his third slice.  Kunsei smiled as he got to work on his second slice.  Zack's pace had slowed down a tad, but he was nonetheless determined to fill his hungry tummy no matter how satisfied it already was.  Stuffing the third slice down his gullet, Zack sighed heartily before feeling a bit of pressure build up from eating the third slice so quickly.  After a moments break, the discomfort passed and after thumping his stomach, he moved onto the fourth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed until both young men had cleaned their plates, (for the most part) and were leaning back in their chairs, stuffed and satisfied.  \"Ahhhh, now was that a breakfast or what?\" said a stuffed Kunsei as he rubbed his thin, albeit full from pizza stomach with both hands.  \"You can say that again...\" responded Zack before giving his much bigger bare belly a hearty slap, causing it to jiggle, which solicited a small chuckle from both Kunsei and himself.  Then without warning, Kunsei let out a surprise burp, audible and sudden enough to startle Kunsei and get a laugh out of Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, bro!\"  laughed Zack.  Kunsei smiled sheepishly then played it off as intentional.  \"Hehe, thanks.\"  Then, for some reason, he poured himself a cup of soda and began chugging it down at a much faster rate than he was used to.  Soda began to dribble down his chin and spill onto the collar of his t-shirt, but he didn't care.  Upon finishing, Kunsei exhaled deeply, almost out of breath from downing so much so quick.  He then pushed out a low, watery sounding burp immediately after, trailing off weakly towards the end, causing him to wince in pain as the rest began to build up.  \"Ugh, one sec, I think it's stu-*UUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*\"  Before Kunsei could finish the rest of his statement, a much louder belch forced itself out from his throat and past his lips, extending for a few seconds straight quite loudly.  When it came to an end, he sighed and wiped his forehead while Zack burst out laughing hysterically, his belly jiggling with him as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, it felt pretty good to kick back and just pig out.  Of course, given his high metabolism, and already pretty docile albeit slightly muscular figure, it would take quite a while before Kunsei would ever get anywhere near as big as Zack, if he even could.  All he knew was right now, he felt good.  Feeling full and carefree made him blissful enough not to dwell on the near life threatening attack the two faced yesterday, and was just the outlet Kunsei needed.  Though he'd be damned if he ever told Zack that after Zack saw how emotional the whole ordeal made him last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!  Oh man, where the hell'd that come from, dude?\" asked Zack.  To which, Kunsei feigned a shrug and said, \"Been practicing, and wanted to show the sensei my skills.\"  Zack nodded then held his hand forward, \"You've got the skills, young warrior,\" Zack said in a mock elder's voice, causing Kunsei to snicker at the hilariously bad impression.  \"But, if we're talking skills...\"  Zack started before clutching his bloated midsection, \"....then you may need some practice...\" he then pressed firmly, promptly releasing a massive belch for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's burp carried on for almost seven seconds straight and carried enough force to blow Kunsei's brown hair back.  \"Ahhhh, sorry, was holding that one in for a while, hehe.\" responded Zack as he patted his belly happily.  Laughing, Kunsei gave Zack a thumbs up, then leaned back once more.  \"Never gets old,\" Kunsei said.  The morning was going great thus far.  Then he remembered one outlet he'd enjoy more than himself getting bigger; Zack continuing to get bigger, as he noticed the pizza box still had around six more slices out of the initial 18 leftover and asked, \"Hey, there's still a few slices left.  Want 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack glanced back at the box, \"Hmmm....I could probably down those no problem.  On the other hand, I'm pretty full...\"  Zack thought for a moment, then decided...</span></div></div>",

As he brought it to his mouth however, his bloated gut groaned violently, causing him to wince in pain as he clutched his midsection firmly.  \"Something wrong?\" asked Kunsei, who heard Zack's noisy tummy all the way from the other side of the table, to which Zack replied, \"Ugh, I dunno man.  I'm kinda having a hard time with these...might be fuller than I thought...\" he said as he continued to clutch and prod at his belly in an effort to calm it down.  Kunsei thought for a moment then:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help,\" he said as he pulled his seat right next to Zack's and began to rub Zack's boulder heavy stomach gently with only one hand.  The always soothing feeling of Kunsei's hand caressing his bloated and tense flesh made Zack coo gently as his stomach continued to groan heavily.  In his eased state, Kunsei was able to take the slice of pizza and bring it to Zack's mouth.  \"Now, open wide,\" said Kunsei as Zack, much more relaxed, simply complied and took a large bite.  Chewing for a moment, he struggled to gulp down his mouthful, but Kunsei continued to rub the tensest portions of Zack's stomach, easing his stomach muscles as they worked on the pizza Zack had just gulped down.  After continuing to rub for a little while longer, Kunsei brought the rest of the slice into Zack's mouth, depositing the whole thing slowly and gently into Zack's mouth as he bit down on the pizza and pulled it into his mouth bit by bit until the entire thing was one giant mouthful.  Kunsei giggled at the slight of Zack's cheeks ballooned outward with virtually entire slice of pizza being chewed up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULLLLP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but Zack managed to gulp down the entire mouthful, sighing heartily from near exhaustion.  His stomach churned wickedly, almost in protest from so much being broken down at once.  Zack moaned in discomfort and said weakly, \"Ugh, dude, it's too much.  I swear if I eat anymore, I'm gonna hurl...\"  Kunsei could hear that there was a lot building up in Zack's belly all at once.  Then another idea came to mind.  \"Hold that thought, my man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed the liter of soda and uncapped the bottle's top.  Zack glanced with confusion and a bit of worry then nervously asked, \"Uhhh, w-what are you doing?\"  Kunsei brought the bottle's top near Zack's lip and said, \"I have a theory, and I'm pretty sure this should work.\"<br>\r\n\"....<i>Pretty</i> sure...?\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon, just trust me on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitant, Zack slowly opened his mouth as Kunsei brought the bottle to his lips and lifted it upward as the carbonated cola washed down Zack's throat.  Zack gulped down great amounts of soda, his eyes tearing up from so much carbonation at once, then Kunsei pulled the bottle back, as Zack burped wetly immediately after and began panting heavily, nearly out of breath.  His stomach bubbled and churned even more violently than it was before, causing Zack immense discomfort.  \"Oof...dude, whatever your plan was, I really don't think...\" was all Zack could muster before Kunsei pressed on the tensest portion of Zack's belly, replacing the rest of Zack's sentence with a disgustingly loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*buuurrr-RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's short but bassy belch boomed through Kunsei's apartment forcefully.  Suddenly, Zack's stomach wasn't churning so heavily anymore.  \"There we go.  Feel better?\" asked Kunsei.  Zack paused for a moment, still a bit startled by his sudden eruption, but then he noticed the discomfort in his midsection had softened considerably.  \"Yeah.  I feel a lot better actually!\"  <br>\r\n\"I figured as much.  That much food and grease at once had to be collecting a lot of unneeded air.  And between all the other stuff your tummy was working on, it was starting to get a little crowded.  Ergo, problem solved.\"  Smiling, Kunsei gave Zack's belly a light hearted pat, accidentally forcing out another loud belch, which caught them both by surprise.  \"...A little warning next time...?\" said Zack, half-joking, half-startled.<br>\r\n\"...S-sorry, heh...\" responded Kunsei sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kunsei fed Zack the next slice, and the next, and the next.  All the while easing his belly with his soothing massage and working out any excess pressure whenever needed, until finally, the pizza box was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was sprawled onto the couch, groaning weakly as his immensely bloated gut gurgled and churned immensely, working down its' massive intake.  Kunsei had finished putting everything away then sat beside Zack, leaning on him as he heard his tired gut digest noisily.  \"How's that for a hero's breakfast?\" asked Kunsei.  Too stuffed to speak, Zack merely groaned, half from pain, half from satisfaction.  \"Ohhhh man, talk about overkill, heh...\" was all Zack could muster.  Kunsei rested his hand atop Zack's taut flesh, admiring just how distended it had grown, pushing outward like a balloon.  He massaged wherever felt tense, trying to ease the pain as best he could.  \"How's that feel?\" asked Kunsei as he gently rubbed Zack's belly in his usual circular motion, near his upper and lower abdomen.  \"Incredible...\" moaned Zack in comfort as Kunsei continued to rub Zack's aching belly, gradually making the pain go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kunsei rubbed Zack's middle, he simply glanced at it with awe.  It never ceased to amaze him to see just how much food Zack could put away in one outing.  And the feel and sight of his bloated flesh just drove Kunsei wild, though he masked it as best he could around his friend, though Zack was more than aware and as much as he loved this satisfied, stuffed feeling, he loved how much Kunsei loved it even more.  Which was why he nudged Kunsei closer to his belly and said, \"Hey, check this out.\"  Zack then held his breath and pushed his belly outward more, like a balloon being blown up even bigger.  Kunsei couldn't believe how much larger Zack's stomach grew as it pushed outward.  Playfully, Kunsei pressed his ear to Zack's belly and drummed on it.  The echo felt and sounded almost hollow like an empty water gallon.  Zack then exhaled, as his belly dropped back to its' regular bloated form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could you do that again?  Pretty please?\" asked Kunsei anxiously, giving Zack puppy dog eyes to coax him into a 'yes.'  \"Awww, no fair.  I thought that was my thing,\" joked Zack in response.  Laughing, he nodded then took a deep breath and held it, pushing out his belly even more than his previous breath.  Kunsei enjoyed hugging Zack's immensely bloated gut like a fleshy pillow while Zack enjoyed the feel of Kunsei around his stomach.  But rather than simply exhale, Zack smiled to himself and instead gulped down the air he'd held, causing his stomach to retract slightly before he poked Kunsei's back.  Kunsei looked up at Zack curiously, then;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUuUuUuUuUuUuUuUOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRPPPPP! *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let rip a disgustingly explosive burp right in Kunsei's face, forceful enough to blow his hair back and carrying with it, the scent of his massive meal.  \"Ahhhh, how's THAT for showing off talent?\" said Zack as he sighed and patted his belly.  The sight and the sheer beauty of Zack's manly display was too much.  Unable to contain himself any longer, Kunsei jumped towards Zack and the two started making out on the spot.  Zack's stomach churned the entire time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the excitement had passed for the time being, the two decided to unwind with some video games, which proved to be quite a refreshing endeavor.  Both had been on the field so often and so fiercely, that just kicking back with a little video game action seemed like but a fond memory of someone much older than these teenaged warriors.  As with real life, Zack was also quite superior in the gaming world as well.  Match after match, the two played fighting games for hours, and each one ended the same, with Zack beating Kunsei ridiculously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  Aaaaaand that's game.  <i>Again</i>,\" gloated Zack.  Kunsei simply scoffed and grabbed his control.  \"C'mon, best two out of three!\" he urged, eager to play some more.  Zack laughed.  He hadn't seen Kunsei's competitive side before, and simply put; it was just adorable.  \"Well, technically, wouldn't be best two out of....like a million?\"<br>\r\n\"Bah!  You game or what?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, you know it.  I just hope you don't mind getting crushed....<i>again.</i>  But this time...\" Zack started, \"let's shake things up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei glanced curiously.  \"Shake things up?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  If I win again; which I will, then you gotta down that entire 2 liter bottle of soda in one go.\"  Kunsei looked a bit nervous.  Such a task would be a breeze for Zack, less so for him.  But part of him really wanted to see what pushing himself the way Zack had done was like, and if he could pull it off.  So he accepted.  \"Fine.  You're on!  But!  If <i>I</i> win-\"<br>\r\n\"-which you won't.\"<br>\r\n\"IF I win...then you gotta chug <i>two</i> of those 2 liter bottles in one go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack raised an eyebrow.  He[d never downed that much fizzy drink before.  But glancing down at his mighty gut, he figured he could take it.  And besides, it's not like he'd ever lose to Kunsei.  So he accepted.  \"Okay.  You're on.  Let's do this!\" he said, giving his stomach a slap of confidence for emphasis, causing it to ripple for a few seconds before the two grabbed their controllers and went at it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button mashing was immense, and both fought relentlessly, but ultimately, there would be one winner, and that winner was...</span></div></div>",

Kunsei rolled his eyes and put his controller down.  \"Ugh, good game, I guess...\" he said begrudgingly.  Zack then ruffled his short brown hair jokingly then, with a smirk, pointed to the 2 liter bottle of cola sitting on the table for him.  Taking a deep breath, he grabbed the bottle and twisted off the cap.  Pausing for a moment, he then took off his shirt, exposing his thin muscular torso; albeit nowhere near as muscular as Zack then said, \"I like that shirt, don't wanna spill anything on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack waited eagerly and asked, \"Ready?\"  A moment passed, then Kunsei brought the bottle to his lips and started chugging.  \"Chug!  Chug!  Chug!\" chanted Zack jokingly.  Kunsei's eyes watered as he continued chugging nonstop, all the way down to the top of the label, until finally, stopping so he could take a breath.  Panting heavily, he burped loudly then rested one hand on his abs, trying to catch his breath.  After a moment, he went right on back to chugging.  The more he chugged, the more his stomach began to push out just ever so slightly. Combined with the heavy breakfast of BBQ Pizza he and Zack had indulged themselves earlier, the bulge wasn't noticeable, but the more carbonated beverage he ingested, the more it became apparent to both Zack and himself.  He was roughly one third of the way done with the bottle before he needed to catch his breath again.  Pulling the bottle from his lips and burping wetly immediately after, Kunsei clutched his uncomfortably bloated (for him) stomach with one hand and groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya feeling, champ?\" asked Zack.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I don't know how you can put away so much at once, man...\" responded Kunsei as another smaller burp worked its' way out of his mouth.  Catching his breath, he went right back to chugging.  Some cola dribbled past his cheeks and dripped down on his chest as it had reached near the halfway mark.  All the while, Zack watched as his friends abs began to noticeably bloat outward from so much carbonation being ingested at once.  Considering how thin Kunsei was, it was impressive to see him put away so much in so quick a pace.  \"Damn, dude.  Not bad.  Not bad at all, actually!\"  At this rate, he could give Zack himself a run for his money should the two ever compete in this faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downing more than half the 2 liter bottle, Kunsei caught his breath for the third time, and moaned in pain as he rubbed his now noticeably bloated stomach in pain.  \"You alright, man?\" asked Zack.  Kunsei winced then saying, \"Oof, I dunno, my tummy feels like a balloon on the verge of popping...\"  Zack laughed aloud and said, \"Did you just say 'tummy'?  Awww, that's adorable!\"  Kunsei chuckled a bit.  It was kind of a cute word, though he was not quite sure why he said 'tummy' either.  Regardless, he continued to massage his aching belly until the pain had subsided long enough for him to go back to chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, Kunsei chugged while Zack continued to watch and cheer his friend on.  \"Come on, you can do it, champ!  Chug-uh-lug.  Chug-uh-lug!\"  And all the while, his belly continued to inflate like a balloon slowly getting air blown into it with each mouthful of soda gulped down.  As he chugged, Kunsei rested one hand on his stomach, feeling it expand with every bit of soda consumed.  While painful for someone as immediately thin as him, at the same time, it felt kind of good, pushing his stomach to its' absolute limits, and feeling it expand little by little upon his fingertips.  His chugging became more strained as he neared end, each gulp of soda became harder and harder to keep down.  But rather than stop, Kunsei kept on chugging, much to Zack's surprise.  \"Damn, dude...\" was all Zack could say as he watched Kunsei fight through the pain and chug damn near the entire second half of soda in what looked like it would be one go.  At this point, Kunsei had himself a little balloon belly from the massive amounts of air brewing with the carbonated drink, making him uncomfortably tense, and causing him to tear up even more.  Each gulp hurt his throat and his stomach, but he kept on going, to the point where it felt like his stomach would legitimately explode.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after all that, he pulled the bottle from his lips and turned it over.  Not a single drop left.  Zack cheered him on.  \"WOO!  You did it, man!  That was freakin' awesome!\" he said to a rather dazed Kunsei.  \"So?  How do ya feel now, champ?  Kunsei didn't respond.  The amount of air in his belly was too great to allow any kind of response, so instead, he opened his mouth and expelled a massive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei let out perhaps the loudest, window rattling belch he'd ever let out in his life, carrying on for several seconds straight before it finally came to an end.  Zack laughed hysterically and said \"Damn, that was huge!\"  Kunsei smirked weakly and let rip another loud and strained belch immediately afterward, before groaning and sitting on the couch, caressing his bloated belly with both hands.  \"Man, I...*URP*...didn't think I could pull it off, but sure en-*BUUURP!*-enough, here we are.  Ugh....my stomach really, really, *urp* really hurts\" Kunsei said between burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack marveled at how bloated his friend had gotten from a mixture of pizza and an entire 2 liter bottle of soda all in one seemingly simultaneous outing.  He then poked at Kunsei's belly, feeling how stiff and immense it felt, causing Kunsei to wince.  \"Sorry about that.  I think I'm just starting to really notice how much you put away.\"  Kunsei laughed weakly and poked at Zack's much larger belly and said, \"Nothing compared to the real champ,\" responded Kunsei.  Smirking, Zack slapped his beachball sized belly for emphasis, resulting in a brief jiggle.  \"Oh don't worry, should the occasion arise, I'm sure you could give 'the champ' a run for his money,\" said Zack, but his response was drowned out by a loud gurgling emanating from Kunsei's stomach, causing the young man to groan in pain and clutch his uncomfortably distended gut with both hands.  \"Yeah, it hurts like hell at first.  But remember when we started?  Remember how you made my pain go away?  Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei didn't know what to say.  He loved Zack's touch and for it to help ease the pain would only prove to be icing on the cake.  So he nodded appreciatively, then paused for a moment.  \"Oh wait, one sec,\" he said before unbuttoning the top button to his pants.  In that instant, Zack's eyes widened as Kunsei's belly began to balloon outward over his strained pants, pushing the zipper outward in the process.  Eager to get started, Zack rubbed his hands together and then placed them both atop Kunsei's swollen stomach.  He then began to rub all over, causing his friend to coo with delight, rather than moan in pain.  Zack could hear the cauldron sounding churn ease already as his touch pressed against the tensest portions of Kunsei's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Zack's hands felt much more rough than Kunsei's, but to him, they were rough and firm in all the right places, making for efficient tension alleviation all over.  \"How's that feel?\" asked Zack as he rubbed.  Kunsei smiled and said, \"Utterly...fantastic.  Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n\"Anytime,\" responded Zack as he kissed Kunsei tenderly on the cheek, causing the young man to smile back at Zack and pull him in to kiss across the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgling subsided, as the rubbing stimulated Kunsei's abdomen, and eased a lot of the tension brewing in a stomach not used to storing so much at once.  However, in addition to which, the rubbing also worked out much of the gas that had been building up from he carbonation that hadn't initially been expelled after Kunsei finished chugging his soda.  So just before he and Zack could lock lips, Kunsei opened his mouth and, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPRRPPP !!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsei's eyes widened and his face went red as he had just accidentally burped loudly in Zack's face.  \"Excuse me!  Oh my God, I-I'm so sorry, I-I didn't mean to-\" but Zack's laughter interrupted him.  \"Hahaha!  Good one, dude!\" he said, patting Kunsei's belly.  \"You're not pissed?\"  asked a nervous Kunsei.  Zack shook his head and said, \"Why would I be?  It's only natural.  Plus, your burps are beastly.  And of course, as you know, I don't get mad,\" he said before pulling Kunsei close to his face.  \"I get even.\"  He then gulped down some air and burped as hard as he could in Kunsei's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUU UURRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's burp carried enough force to blow Kunsei's hair back, carrying with it the same BBQ Pizza scent as before.  Smacking his lips and giving his belly a hearty pat, Zack smiled back at Kunsei, who immediately locked lips with the bloated young hero, allowing the two to make out atop the couch, as both their bloated bellies continuously pushed into each other during.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so the battle reigned on and on, neither side backing down.  Zack was smashing buttons and glancing frantically as Kunsel confidently began to gain the upper hand, eventually finishing the game with his character upper cutting Zack's character out of orbit.  Victorious for the first time, Kunsel got up and did a little victory dance that went on for far too long.  Zack merely sat there, still utterly bewildered that he could ever lose in a game he'd been known to pretty much dominate all opposition in, especially against Kunsel of all people.  \"Boo-ya!  Can-you-dig-that?!\" gloated Kunsel as he can through every victory one-liner he could think up on the spot, which; sadly, was quite a few.  Zack simply sighed and rose from his seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.  Good game...\" he grumbled childishly.  He then recalled the other thing that came with defeat, as did Kunsel as he immediately trotted and handed Zack his first 2 liter bottle of soda.  \"Now remember, don't think of this as you drinking away defeat.  Think of it as you celebrating one of the few victories your dear pal Kunsel has ever got against someone,\" he said with a playful grin.  Zack smirked then nudged Kunsel's shoulder as he took the bottle from him and unscrewed the top.  Once the fizziness had settled, he held the bottle up and said, \"Cheers, dude,\" then went to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd gulped down a considerable amount with ease and with no signs of stopping.  Kunsel watched as the massive gulps of soda traveled from Zack's throat down to his ever expanding stomach.  Finally; after reaching the half-way mark of his first bottle within less than a minute, Zack removed the bottle from his lips and sighed heavily to catch his breath.  He then clutched his gut with his free hand and pushed out a bassy *BBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!* followed by a smaller burp afterward.  \"Hehe, nice one!\" complemented Kunsel with a thumbs up.  Smacking his lips, Zack gently slapped his belly and continued on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChugging more and more.  Hoping to get this first bottle out of the way as quick as possible, until finally draining the first bottle with damn near superhuman ease.  \"Ahhhhh, now that hit the spot!\" said Zack as he rubbed his bloated middle slowly.  Seeing how far distended it had grown, Kunsel got up and very gently rested his hand atop Zack's ballooned belly.  \"Jeez, looks like you swallowed a couple of friggin' watermelons, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Zack brought Kunsel in for a closer look, allowing him to rest his ear onto his belly as the gas and fizz from the drink caused his stomach to churn and bubble quite audibly.  \"Does that sound like a watermelon to you?\" asked Zack.  Kunsel smiled back and snuggled closer, hugging Zack's large belly with both hands as he pressed his ear right up against his stomach.  \"How about this...?\" followed Zack as he looked down at his friend, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPP!*-*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let rip a bassy two parter as hard as he could in Kunsel's face, causing him to laugh aloud as Zack sighed with relief.  \"Whew, that felt good,\" said Zack with relief in his voice as he reached for the second bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" asked Kunsel, both anxious and a tad nervous in case it proved to be too much for the young hero.  But Zack was all but confident as he winked at his friend and said, \"Watch and learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack grabbed the second bottle and unscrewed the cap, then took a deep breath and went right back to chugging all over again.  His eyes watered from the extra dose of carbonation being ingested all at once.  This time around, he chugged at a much slower rate, due to how full he was already feeling.  He began to wince in pain as he clutched his immensely swollen abdomen, then shortly after, forced himself to remove his lips from the bottle as he'd swallowed down just above the label near the top.  He gasped for air and breathed heavily as his stomach churned violently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel glanced at his friend with concern and asked, \"Hey, are you already, man?\"  But Zack didn't respond.  Instead he clamped his hand over his mouth, as though he were about to throw up.  Kunsel inched away, preparing for the worst.  Instead what came up was a loud closed mouth burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MMMMMMMMMMRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's cheeks inflated from the large amount of gas reverberating within his mouth, but still, he seemed green around the gills to Kunsel.  So he began to rub his friend's back gently, like that of a toddlers.  This resulted in Zack easing up slightly as a few more deep burps worked their way up, which; this time, he released proudly, each one sharper and louder than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*uuuuuuuoooooooorrrrrrrrrrppppp*  *bbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaapppp!*  *BBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, his stomach ceased its' churning.  With enough gas expelled, Zack could once again resume his chugging endeavor.  With each gulp, his belly continued to bloat outward, well past its' limits.  Kunsel simply marveled as it pushed beyond Zack's waist and road up his thighs.  The carbonated beverage did a great job of speeding the expanding process up tenfold.  He placed both hands atop his vastly distended middle and slowly rubbed gently all around.  He had to legitimately reach to get both hands all the way across this borderline globular gut.  \"Man, this is crazy...I mean I knew soda makes a person bloated, but jeez...\" responded an astounded Kunsel as he continued to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Zack once again stopped chugging almost near the halfway mark of his bottle and gasped heavily for breath once again.  Chugging so much was taking a lot of energy out of him.  His face was flush with exhaustion and wet from both sweat and tears caused from the carbonation and lack of oxygen flow from chugging so much for so long a time at a slowed down breathing rate.  Taking a deep breath, Zack sighed heartily, then opened his mouth to expel more pressure, but nothing came up but a tiny (for Zack at least) watery burp which caused Zack to break into a fit of coughing.  Kunsel laughed then said, \"It's probably best not to force them out yourself right now.  Perhaps someone who knows where to apply just the right amount of pressure onto your tummy could help?  Me?  Well, if you insist.\"  Zack rolled his eyes, too bloated to properly respond to his friends' cheesy attempt at being funny.  Instead, Kunsel moved his hands to the center of Zack's upper belly and pushed both hands just so slightly down onto it, forcing out a large rush of gas as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAPPPPPPPPP!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following eruption carried on for a few seconds straight and was loud enough to make Kunsel's ears ring.  Zack appeared surprised by the sheer volume of his sudden belch.  \"Is it strange for a person to burp better when someone else pushes them out...?\" asked Zack, half joking.  Kunsel simply laughed and shrugged.  \"Probably.  But strange or not, there's no denying the results.\"  For emphasis, he kneaded Zack's belly again, forcing out another window rattling belch from Zack's mouth, which caused both boys to laugh aloud like little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think that made enough room,\" Zack said, then resumed chugging the second half of the bottle...</span></div></div>",

Little by little, Kunsel watched as Zack's belly continued to grow yet even more than it had already grown, pushing young Zack to his absolute limits.  He placed his ear against Zack's sloshing and gurgling gut, listening as it continued to collect and expand as more soda was deposited within it, listening as it bubbled incoherently as the last drops of soda had been forced down Zack's throat, until finally, the bottle was all but empty.  Kunsel smiled then patted his friend gently, \"I can't believe it, you actually did it!  That's awesome, man!\" congratulated Kunsel, but Zack was not in the physical state to agree with the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face flush from exhaustion and covered in sweat, he plopped back onto the couch and clutched his belly hard immediately afterwards, followed by a strained groan of pain.  \"Ugh....dude.....this challenge was a mist-*MRRPPP!*...urrgh...a mistake...\" struggled Zack as he caressed his troubled gut with both hands, feeling his mouth water painfully as the bile rose up his throat.  Kunsel's expression changed to one of concern as he rubbed Zack's back gently.  \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n\"N-no, man, I feel like I'm about to throw-\" was all Zack could muster before he felt his gorge rise up his throat.  Immediately, Zack clamped his mouth shut with one hand and sprinted as best he could with such a distended middle straight towards the bathroom.  His belly wobbling with each step, increasing the intestinal discomfort that was ailing Zack.  Kunsel promptly followed him to make sure he was okay.  His face had rested towards the toilet seat as he doubled over and kept his mouth open towards it, wanting nothing but to throw up.  But that wasn't what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his belly groaned yet again, causing the young man to tear up in pain as he called out to Kunsel's name, who immediately ran to Zack's aide.  \"Zack!\" shouted Kunsel as placed his hand atop his shoulder.  Zack felt his gorge rising again, but he managed to hold it down long enough to turn to Kunsel and say, \"Hehe, guess there are some challenges we shouldn't put ourselves in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knelt before Zack and after very gently pressing his hand against Zack's protruding belly, began to rub it tenderly as always, doing his best to maintain composure.  \"Zack, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made up this whole stupid challenge.  It was selfish of me, I just really-\"<br>\r\n\"-wanted to see how big I'd get after, I know.  So did I.  Hell, why'd you think I said yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I hate seeing you in so much pain!  Look at where we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Zack jerked back as he leaned back down into the toilet bowl.  Seems Kunsel's fingers had worked up whatever was causing Zack's intestinal discomfort.  But it wasn't what either one was expecting.  Instead, Zack opened his mouth and let fly a massive, throaty belch which carried on for several seconds straight and echoed all throughout Kunsel's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it finally winded down, both Zack and Kunsel stared for a moment, before laughing with relief.  \"Whew, thank God...\" said Kunsel as he patted Zack's belly happily.  Zack meanwhile just plopped lazily into Kunsel's unexpecting arms, forcing both boys to fall onto their backs in the bathroom, making them both laugh with relief before Zack let out yet another window rattling burp immediately after.  Followed by another, and another and another after that.  Much to both their amusement, seemed the carbonation ingested from both bottles grew too much for Zack's poor tummy.  And so for the next several moments, the two just laid on the bathroom floor.  Kunsel; prodding all around Zack's massive belly, and Zack, exhausted as he continued to burp uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, how can you do that so many times in a row and not get dizzy?\" asked an admittedly impressed Kunsel as he prodded and massaged Zack's troubled gut.  Zack turned to him and muttered \"Truth be *BRRRRAAAAP!* told, I DO feel pretty *URRP* dizzy....\" said a damn near dazed Zack between burps, causing Kunsel to laugh.  Admittedly, now that the urgency had subsided, this gassy outburst proved quite comical and above all else, very impressive to Kunsel as he enjoyed how Zack's belches seemed to get louder and wetter with each one.  Zack on the other hand...was less than amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after all that was settled...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time had passed since the relatively messy conclusion of that double liter challenge Kunsel imposed on Zack, and he was all but better now, and shockingly starving as his impressive gut rumbled loudly for food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather then utilize the free meals from the grateful town, Kunsel decided to cook up a bounty of Gongaga classics.  Upon entering the kitchen, Zack was overwhelmed by the delightful aroma of Pineapple glazed Chicken, buttered rice, black pepper seasoned pasta, spicy sausage, the works.  The aroma almost immediately took Zack back to his childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells like home,\" noted Zack with a reminiscent smile on his face.  Kunsel smirked back and nodded.  \"Thought after so much local delicacies, you might like a little taste of home every now and then.  Think of it as an apology for that stupid dare,\" responded Kunsel.  Scoffing, Zack walked over to a hard at work Kunsel and patted him on the back.  \"Ah, don't even worry about all that.  Glad to at least know where my limits stand.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, Kunsel set the various platters onto his dining table for both he and Zack (mostly Zack) to dig into.  Wasting no time, Zack took that first bite of Gongaga style Chicken.  As if a million flavors had hit his tongue at once, Zack immediately began cutting up and scarfing down the chicken breast bite after bite.  Kunsel  seemed to be enjoying his peppered Steak, clearly admiring his own cooking talents.  \"Mmmm, dude, I swear, not even my mom could ever make Gongaga Chicken taste this amazing!\"  said Zack between bites.<br>\r\nKunsel smiled and said, \"Thanks, man.  Mmm, y'know, come to think of it, I should try cooking more Gongaga classics more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing his chicken, Zack immediately helped himself to a heaping bowl of the creamy peppered pasta.  The heavy meal brought a surplus of spice and zest to Zack's taste buds, as he couldn't help but simply admire the flavor before continuing to inhale the pasta.  Within no time at all, Zack had scarfed down his pasta bowl and had completely licked his bowl clean.  Letting out a deep belch immediately afterward, Zack smacked his lips and patted his immensely swollen belly in satisfaction.  \"Mmmm, spicy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel laughed as he finishes his steak and helps himself to a bit of pasta and sausage.  \"Dude, if ever I was glad to have put on so much weight, it's this meal right here.  Because now, I can appreciate so much more of my childhood favorites then I could prior.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, well, I guess that's one perk to our little endeavor.\"<br>\r\n\"One of many, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kunsel glanced back at Zack who was still stuffing his face silly, and said \"Can I ask you something?\"   Zack simply nodded as he gulped down a hearty mouthful of chicken and rice.  \"Do you ever miss home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment, Zack smirked softly and shrugged.  \"Well, yeah, sure I do.  I miss Mom and Dad, my friends, the countryside, the color.  I miss it a whole lot sometimes.\"<br>\r\n\"What made you leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SOLDIER.  Ever since I was a kid, all I ever dreamed about was being a hero.  Back home, all we ever heard about were the exciting missions the great heroes Sephiroth or Angeal had just returned from.  Saving innocents, stopping the bad guys.  That's what I wanted to do with my life.  Make a difference.  Help people.  Maybe make my folks proud and...meet someone along the way?\"  Zack added a little wink to the last part of his statement, earning a blush from Kunsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't argue with sentiment,\" noted Kunsel as he bit down on another piece of sausage.  Pausing briefly, Zack smirked reminiscently.  \"Still, nothing ever beat the days back home.  Just the little things we don't get in Midgar, like just resting under the Gongaga Palm trees.  The grass beneath your bare feet, family always there for you.  I guess that's one of the reasons I've enjoyed this little trek of ours so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel glanced curiously at Zack and asked, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Just recapturing some of that carefree lifestyle, and just, enjoying the ride with someone you care about.  It's not something a lot of guys at SOLDIER can appreciate anymore.  I'm just, glad the sentiment isn't lost on ALL of us.\"<br>\r\n'Me too, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed before Zack's stomach seemed to growl angrily, earning a chuckle from Zack.  \"Welp, that's enough mushy stuff for one dinner.  Bon appetite.\"</span></div></div>",

Kunsel smiled back and said, \"I knew you'd like a taste of home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, Zack simply nodded, whilst rubbing his sizable stomach slowly, then noted, \"For real, dude, sooner or later, you gotta open up a restaurant.\"  <br>\r\n\"Someday, maybe.  For now, it's all for the eventual hero of Midgar,\" responded Kunsel, whose plate still had most of his peppered Steak left over.  He, however, was too fixated on watching Zack eat to really focus on his own food, which Zack noticed and asked, \"Aren't you gonna finish your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, until Kunsel slyly said, \"Ummm, no no, I'm too full to finish.\"  He leaned back in his chair and patted his thin and empty stomach for emphasis, which caused Zack to smirk and raise an eyebrow skeptically.  \"Buuuuuut if you're still hungry...\" Kunsel hinted, childishly nudging his plate towards his friend.  \"I dunno, I'm pretty full myself...\" responded Zack as he slapped his larger belly for the similar emphasis as Kunsel, \"Buuuuuut I s'pose I could find my way to finishing up if a certain someone helped me finish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore then eagerly, Kunsel plopped himself next to Zack and cut a large piece of steak with his fork and knife into various pieces, then eased his fork towards Zack's awaiting mouth.  Zack took his bite and chewed the chunk of meat slowly, enjoying the zesty well seasoned flavor, before gulping it down.  \"Mmmm, now that's what I call zesty...\" responded Zack before Kunsel smiled and brought another piece to Zack's mouth.  As Zack chewed on this next chunk, Kunsel took his free hand and placed it right atop Zack's overly distended middle, simply feeling his bare, tight skin vibrate as Zack's belly began to work down the surplus of food he'd ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sounds hard at work in there, doesn't it?\" said Kunsel as he gently patted Zack's belly and fed him another piece of steak.  Zack moaned with delight as each bite began to taste zestier and tastier then the last, and as Kunsel began to gently stroke Zack's stomach slowly.  \"How's that feel?\" asked Kunsel.<br>\r\n\"Feels....*BRRRAAAAAP!*....oof...great...\" responded Zack in a strained voice, before thumping his chest and burping loudly again.  \"Ugh...talk about heartburn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed for a moment then went back to work on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after finishing up, both Zack and Kunsel had cozied up on the couch, watching TV.  Kunsel had snuggled up to Zack's slightly more extended balloon belly like that of a cushion, while Zack kept one arm wrapped around Kunsel, and the other atop his domed gut.  \"Man, oh man, thanks for that, Kunsel...\" said Zack, patting his belly and yawning audibly.  \"Haven't had a lazy kick-back day like this in a long time...\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it...\" responded Kunsel, who listened in as Zack's rounded stomach continued to digest and churn loudly.  <br>\r\n\"Seriously, thanks so much for this, man.  Means a lot to me.\" said Zack as he kissed Kunsel gently across the cheek, causing him to smile back and nudge him gently.  \"My pleasure.  Soooo, what do you wanna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Almost purring, Zack smiled with delight as he wrapped one arm around Kunsel and pulled him closer.  \"Mmm, I swear, that never doesn't feel amazing...\" said Zack, in utter bliss.  Kunsel smiled, equally enjoying the smooth feel of Zack's vast midsection beneath his fingers and said, \"You can say that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I can't believe how long it's been since I've ever just spent the days just kicking back.  Part of me feels like a little kid again!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you've always been a big kid at heart,\" responded Kunsel, reflecting on some of Zack's more adorably childish moments in the time they've known each other.  The two laughed briefly before sighing in ease.  \"Y'know, the people here in the Slums got the right idea,\" started Zack, getting Kunsel's attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marauders took everything from them and no one ever came to help because no one cared, but they didn't just lay down and die.  They rebuilt, and made the most of what they had.  They just seem so genuine...so happy...and BOY do they know how to eat up here,\" laughed Zack, slapping his belly for emphasis, causing it jiggle slightly beneath Kunsel's palm, earning a laugh from Kunsel as well, before he responded with, \"Yeah, that's one of the reasons I chose to live down here instead of central Midgar.  They're a good, honest, hard working bunch of people, kiiiiiiinda like someone else I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Kunsel, Zack smiled warmly as he pecked him across the neck, then after a moment, said, \"I've been thinking.  Neither SOLDIER nor Shinra'll ever go out of their way to help these guys in case someone like Sev or worse ever shows up.  And, well, the time we've been spending together's only gotten better and better.

Taken back slightly, Kunsel paused for a moment.  \"You wanna....move in?\"<br>\r\n\"I-I know it's all like, really sudden and all that, b-but I think it could work!  Obviously I'll pay rent and all that stuff in between, cause I'm no freeloader, but I just...\" Zack stumbled half way in, before turning to Kunsel and sincerely finish with, \"...I want to be with you, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment passed, before a smile grew over Kunsel's face.  Like a kid, he almost pounced onto Zack's belly happily, causing Zack to grunt a bit as Kunsel cheerfully and excitedly said, \"I'd love that, are you kidding me?!\"  Rubbing the back of his head, Zack smiled and said, \"You're the best, dude,\" he then hugged Kunsel tightly, while Kunsel returned the favor, and snuggled gently into Zack's stomach.  \"I honestly didn't think you'd ever ask me that,\" said Kunsel almost with relief, much to Zack's surprise.<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"Because part of me wasn't entirely convinced all this was real. Finally being with someone, being able to eat and stuff together, hanging out, and even being able to help the towns people.  Sometimes, it just feels too good to be true, like a dream.  And no matter how hard I try, I always wake up...remembering it's just fantasy...\"  Smiling, Zack raised Kunsel's head up by the chin, and slowly the two locked lips for a good moment before Zack pulleda way, leaving a fluttered and blushing Kunsel.<br>\r\n\"Trust me.  This is real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost gratefully, Kunsel hugged Zack and proceeded to rest his ear against Zack's tummy and then gently rub across it, much to Zack's delight.  The relaxing sensation eventually put Zack to sleep, and after a few more minutes of rubbing Zack's gut, Kunsel's eyes grew heavy, and he too, drifted into slumber, resting his head against Zack's large stomach.</span></div></div>",

A moment later, it slowly wandered down his stomach, which had once again deflated a good amount since last night.  However, the meals had been adding on, officially giving Zack a bit of a pot belly now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Zack patted his belly and said, \"Respectable, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" responded Kunsel as he attempted to rise from his bed, but Zack playfully snagged him back in.  \"Ahh we don't need to get up just yet, do we?\" said Zack as he gave Kunsel his infamous puppy dog eyes, causing the teen to laugh as he got back in bed and snuggled cozily with Zack.  \"Hehe, your body feels so nice and warm.  Perfect for snuggling up against the cold mornings,\" joked Kunsel.  Chuckling, Zack's arm held Kunsel tight to his chest as he said, \"Didn't think SOLDIER Third Class could double as a bedside heater.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed for a moment, still barely awake, when suddenly a loud gastric groaning emanated from Zack's gut.  Pressing his ear against Zack's stomach, Kunsel raised an eyebrow curiously.  \"Huh, doesn't sound like hunger groaning.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, I definitely don't feel hungry just yet, hehe.  Nah, my stomach's been kinda cramped since last night.  Just an occupational hazard that comes with the digestion process, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if you'd like, I know how to make it less painful.\"<br>\r\n\"Pfft, as if you even need to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kunsel's palm immediately rested against Zack's smooth, round belly.  His fingers nudged and stroked the tensed abdomen as he slowly circulated his hand all across Zack's stomach, causing the young man to coo with delight as an expression of bliss grew over his face.  As Kunsel continued to gently massage the troubled tummy, he began to feel around for areas where it felt tensest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, he felt what he suspected to be a trapped gas pocket around Zack's upper belly.  With his knuckles, he gently but firmly kneaded at this tense region of Zack's stomach, in an effort to expel the gas.  After a few moments of this, Zack let out a resounding belch, smacking his lips and sighing with relief shortly after, earning a chuckle from Kunsel as he continued to massage his friend's tummy all over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, Kunsel rubbed and massaged Zack's belly all over, and occasionally worked out any gas pockets he could find, earning some decent burps out of Zack in the process.  Finally, Kunsel found particularly present pocket around the middle of Zack's belly which he tried to knead out, but was having some difficulties.  \"Boy, that one's really stuck in there...\" said Kunsel as he continued to knead to no avail.  Smirking, Zack stopped him for a moment and said, \"Hold up, I've got an idea.  I'm gonna gulp down as much air as I can, and when I say to, I want you to press down on my belly as hard as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Kunsel agreed as Zack immediately began gulping down big mouthfuls of air.  As he did, his belly continued to bloat outward more and more from all the air being deposited into it at once.  Finally, after one last big gulp of air, Zack signaled to Kunsel, who immediately pressed down on Zack's belly as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromptly afterwards, he felt a torrent of air leaving that tense portion of Zack's stomach and immediately expel from Zack's mouth in the form of a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's booming belch lasted several seconds, and was loud enough to evoke a ringing in Kunsel's ears, not that he minded.  As it carried on, Kunsel could feel Zack's belly deflating from all the air expelling itself, until it was all but gone.  Smacking his lips, Zack patted his belly proudly and said, \"Whew, ohhh MAN that felt good!  It's like a boulder just got lifted from my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could help.  Still, even if you're all burped out, you don't mind if I keep going a little more, do you?\"  Smiling, Zack more than welcomed it.  So Kunsel continued to massage and rub Zack's belly for a few more minutes, much to both their delight, until finally...</span></div></div>",

Occasionally as he stroked the massive orb of flesh, Kunsel would warmly peck Zack on the neck while Zack wrapped his arm around Kunsel and squeezed him tightly and affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the middle of rubbing, a massive rumbling shook the bed.  Zack's face went red as his bloated belly visibly began to jiggle as it rumbled hungrily in the dead of night.  \"Damn, can't believe I'm STILL hungry after a meal like that...\" said Zack with surprise in his voice as Kunsel chuckled and playfully patted Zack's belly, feeling his flesh jiggle a bit beneath his palm.  \"Welp, you're a big, growing boy, right?\" he said teasingly, earning a nudge in the shoulder from Zack as he smirked.  \"Guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two got out of bed, both still only in their boxers and headed to the kitchen.  Zack sat down at the table, rubbing his belly in an effort to calm it down while Kunsel checked the fridge, then the oven, and pulled out an extra large BBQ Pizza out from the oven.  \"Wow, still warm!\" Kunsel said with surprise in his voice as Zack licked his lips eagerly.  Placing the box down in front of Zack, Kunsel opened it and let the aroma waft directly in front of Zack, making his mouth water as he took the first slice eagerly, but stopped before he could stuff it into his maw.  Staring for a moment, Zack turned to Kunsel and asked, \"Hey...would you mind feeding me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Zack give him his infamous puppy dog eyes, Kunsel smileld and nodded as he pulled his chair right next to Zack and stuffed the first whole slice half way into Zack's mouth.  Zack bit the slice in half in one go and savored the mass amount of pizza melting in his mouth as he chewed it and gulped it down.  He then immediately opened his mouth as Kunsel stuffed the second half completely in.  He gulped it down and sighed with relief as Kunsel already stuffed a second slice half way into his mouth.  He chewed, swallowed, and got the other half stuffed right in immediately after.  After gulping it down, Zack smiled then turned and said.  \"Hey, let's see if we can go for broke.\"<br>\r\n\"Go for broke?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, try stuffing a WHOLE slice in!  C'mon, I can take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Kunsel decided to give it a try, and cram the third slice completely into Zack's mouth.  His cheeks bulged comically as he chewed on the entire slice in one go.  Kunsel's attention went straight to Zack's immense gut as he wiped his hands with a napkin and proceeded to eagerly rub it as Zack gulped down the entire slice of pizza.  Feeling a bit of tension, Kunsel kneaded Zack's belly slightly, coaxing out a few mighty burps from the young man's mouth as he sighed with immense relief.  \"Ready for another?\" asked Kunsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on,\" said Zack as he sat up for a moment and slammed his fist into his still surprisingly tone chest a few times, forcing up yet another massive belch.  \"Ahhh, there we go.  Proceed,\" he said with an impish smirk as he opened his mouth wide to receive his fourth whole slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...</span></div></div>",

Kunsel chuckled, admittedly finding this act absolutely adorable as he sat himself next to the young SOLDIER and absent mindedly rubbed his now massive belly in slow, circular motions all over.  He rested his head against Zack's belly, listening as it worked off yet another massive meal, gurgling and rumbling audibly.  \"Mmmmm, like music to my ears...\" was all Kunsel could mutter.

Kunsei decided that instead of forcing it out the usual way, he would try something new. \"I think if you change position all the gas will be able to come right out by itself...come on, let me help you stand up.\" Zack looked a little reluctant at this suggestion, placing his hands protectively around his ridiculously swollen belly. Nonetheless, he knew that he could trust Kunsei to know whats best when it came to being burped...<br>\r\nTaking hold of Zack's hands, Kunsei heaved his friend to his feet. The sight of Zack's midsection protruding so far forwards was such an amazing sight to behold, and Kunsei had to steady him. Moving behind Zack, Kunsei put his arms around his friend so that his could stroke Zack's belly with both hands. \"Lean back into me and relax\", Kunsei commanded. Zack did as Kunsei asked, letting out a deep sigh of relief, which was immediately followed by the sound of a huge amount of air gushing up his throat and out of his mouth....<br>\r\n  \"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\" \"Ahhhhh\", sighed Zack, grinning and leaning his head back onto Kunsei's shoulder. With his hands still firmly on either side of Zack's stomach, he gave Zack a little kiss on the side of his cheek. Zack turned his head slightly to return it when another enormous belch burst out of his mouth and right into Kunsei's face.<br>\r\n \"UUUUUUUUURRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP\". Zack laughed, but before he could apologise, another burst of air rushed out of his belly and he opened his mouth wide and let the rush of relief reverberate off the walls.<br>\r\n \"BUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP\". In total awe of his friend, Kunsei slapped and squeezed Zack's belly from behind, bringing up an almost continual flow of belches for the next two minutes. <br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Zack exclaimed at the end...that really did help get them out- thanks Kunsei!!\" Zack turned around and gave his friend a hug, which wasn't easy considering the size of his belly. \"You know what?\":</span></div></div>",

Which is why there's a second one waiting in the oven!\"  Zack laughed and raised his eyebrow.  \"Haha, seriously?  How'd you figure I'd want more\"  Kunsel smiled and patted Zack's tummy playfully as he said, \"Call it a hunch.\"  Zack blushed a bit before he eagerly headed back to the kitchen and pulled out the extra large BBQ Chocobo Pizza from the oven.  Pulling the top of the box open, Zack took a big whiff and smiled with delight.  \"Mmmmm...still warm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a chair next to Zack, Kunsel eagerly awaited for Zack to take that first magical bite, when suddenly another hungry rumble filled the room.  Zack looked down and began to grin impishly when he saw Kunsel blushing with embarrassment as he covered his bare stomach trying to silence its' hungry growls.  Laughing, Zack patted his friend on the back and said, \"Hey, don't worry about it, man.  You just need to get a lil food in your belly, that's all.\"  He then took the slice he was about to eat and offered it to Kunsel, adding \"and no time better than the present, y'know?\"  Kunsel smiled and said, \"Thanks, but I'm fine just watching-\" his stomach rumbled in disagreement, cutting him off.  Zack smirked, knowing Kunsel couldn't refuse for much longer, so he added, \"Come on, dude, sharing is caring, right?  I can't enjoy this delicious meal if I know my best bud is suffering hunger pangs.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to himself, Kunsel eventually conceded, much to Zack's delight.  He took the slice of pizza from Zack and took a huge gaping bite.  He paused for a moment, then immediately took another bite bite, and another, and another, until it was reduced to crust remnants.  \"Mmm!  Wow, this really IS good!\" Kunsel exclaimed, licking his lips while Zack nodded and grabbed two slices at once.  Grinning, he said, \"Check this out.  A lil pizza eating trick my dad taught me!\"  He stacked the two slices on top of each other like two slices of bread over a sandwich and opened his mouth nice and wide as he took a huge gaping bite.  Kunsel watched in amazement as Zack chewed heartily on the comically large mouthful of pizza, then gulped it all down with a noticeable bulge traveling down his throat and disappearing into his muscular chest, and down into his ever expanding belly.  Zack licked his lips then took another huge bite of the two for one pizza slices, \"Mmm, I swear, each bite is better than the last!\" Zack exclaimed before taking another massive chomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths continued down this road for a good while, savoring the flavor of each slice of pizza and demolishing it one swift bite after another, as more and more slices of pizza began to dissipate...</span></div></div>",

Kunsel had eaten so much that his normally thin stomach looked as though he'd swallowed a greatly inflated volleyball, while Zack's belly, having already been so greatly distended, looked as if he'd consumed a medicine ball, now hanging partially onto his thighs as he spread his legs and let his gut distend freely onto his lap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...that was some damn good pizza...\" moaned Zack as he massaged his greatly distended belly with both hands.

Zack laughed and said, \"Nice one, dude.\"  Not one to be showed up, Zack leaned forward a bit and patted his own belly a few times, forcing up a much louder and longer belch.  Followed by a few shorter belches he expelled to relieve as much pressure as he could.  Content, he then rested one arm around Kunsel's shoulder and pulled him closer, causing Kunsel to lean comfortably into Zack's still muscle bound upper torso.  \"Heh, that was fun, wasn't it?\"  Kunsel nodded, nuzzling his head into Zack's chest.  \"You said it,\" responded Kunsel.  Looking up at Zack, he playfully gave him a light peck on the cheek and asked, \"So whadduya wanna do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed and slapped his immense gut firmly, causing it to jiggle a bit.   \"Well FIRST?

Zack laughed and said, \"Eh, just give yourself time, dude.  Your gut's gotta adjust if you ever wanna be able to fit in anywhere near as much as I can.\"  To emphasize, he slapped his gut, causing it to ripple a bit.  \"I'll say this much,\" Zack continued, \"there are very few feelings quite as relaxing as resting on a couch with this much food in your belly...\"  Kunsel smirked and rested his hand atop Zack's stomach and gave him a wink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" Kunsel asked before slowly beginning to rub Zack's belly soothingly, earning relaxed coos from the young hero as he smiled with delight.  \"Ohhhh man....okay...this is definitely up there too...\" said Zack both relaxed yet playfully as Kunsel continued to push his hand firmly into Zack's rounded stomach, and slowly knead it, easing much of the tension that strained it, enjoying the feel of Zack's vast midsection, soft, thick and warm, beneath his fingers and palm as he explored every inch of Zack's stomach and kneaded the pain away with a smile on his face.  \"Remember when we first?\" Kunsel asked, still rubbing Zack's belly.  Suddenly, Zack started laughing and said, \"Haha, how could I forget?  It was my second week in SOLDIER.  You'd just joined along with a bunch of other meatheads.  They were all your typical Midgar jocks, all beefy'n full of themselves.  Then there's this little guy.  So freakin' nervous and shy on his first day that he spent it hiding in one of Hojo's chambers...only to realize he was hiding in the VR training room.\"  Zack laughed heartily as Kunsel shuddered.  \"Then as a joke, one of the other guys turned it on...\" Kunsel replied, still recollecting the incident as if it were yesterday.  \"And typical of me, I forget my damn weapon and have to try and fend these virtual fiends off myself...I thought for a split second, that those things could'a actually killed me...\" Kunsel said, before smiling and looking up at his friend, \"...until someone dropped in and saved the day...\"  Zack smirked, rubbing the back of his head and said, \"Well, I had to do SOMETHING.  I could hear you screaming in terror all the way from the lounge area!  Then I found the jerk who turned it on and set it to that high level and decked him square in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel glanced at him curiously and said, \"I always wondered; why'd you do that?  It wasn't like we were friends at the time when it happened.\"  Zack shrugged and said, \"I don't like bullies.  Pure and simple, especially when we're all supposed to be a team.\"  Kunsel scoffed and said, \"And go figure, that jerk got discharged a week later after failing VR Tests that were just HALF the level he set me on!\"  Both boys laughed heartily amongst themselves, before sighing a bit, still recollecting their earlier moments together.  \"After all that, we started training together, sparring, racing, hitting weights.  I remember, you even tried giving me one of those helmets...\" Zack said, earning a laugh from Kunsel.  \"Oh yeah!  I remember that!  Hehe, it got stuck on your spiky hair the first time.  We almost had to give you a trim just to take it off.\"  Kunsel replied, causing Zack to protectively conceal his mid-length black hair and reply with, \"Never!\"  earning another laugh from Kunsel, before he glanced back at Zack and smiled warmly.  \"Y'know, in truth?  I really don't think I'd have even made it to SOLDIER Third class if I never met you, man.  You helped me train, you made me more confident, and...well...you gave a reason to keep trying at every single turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack blushed a bit and smiled back at Kunsel, then said, \"I was just grateful be your friend, dude.  Always have been, always will be.\"  The two smiled softly at each other before leaning closer and locking lips for a good moment.  The moment was quickly halted when Zack's cheeks puffed up.  Immediately he pulled his mouth away from Kunsel and turned his face away, burping loudly for a few seconds straight.  He turned to Kunsel a bit sheepishly and said, \"Sorry about that...\"  But Kunsel smiled warmly back at Zack and said, \"Don't be.  I kinda like it when you burp.\"  Zack tilted his head curiously and said \"Really?\"  Kunsel nodded 'yes.'  \"What can I say?  When you do it, it's so much sexier than when some jarhead does it at SOLDIER, or some pigheaded drunk from the streets.\"  Zack blushed and said, \"Well, I AM a pro...\" Kunsel laughed and continued massaging Zack's strained gut, nodding in agreement.  \"That you are, man.  That you are.\"  The two then resumed their kiss, uninterrupted this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of the two sharing an intimate moment...</span></div></div>",

Haha, guess all that burpin' made extra room, huh?\"  Kunsel smirked and playfully nudged Zack's tummy before rising to his feet.  He then hoisted Zack off the ground, causing his belly to bounce just slightly as he did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing I was prepared for that, cause we got another extra large Pepperoni in the oven,\" said Kunsel with a smirk.  \"How's that sound to-\"  Before Kunsel could finish his sentence, a second even louder hungry rumble filled the room.  Zack looked around curiously, then turned back to Kunsel, to see him blushing profusely as he covered his own groaning stomach with his forearm, hoping to silence the hungry noise emanating from it.  Zack grinned mischievously and said, \"Hehe, guess I'm not the only one who's ready to chomp down on some pizza.\"  Kunsel chuckled sheepishly and said, \"Ahh, it's fine.  I'll grab a bite later or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack laughed the patted his friends shoulder.  \"C'mon, don't be a baby.  A couple slices of pizza isn't gonna kill ya!  Besides, it'll be fun eating together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKunsel thought for a moment; his thin stomach still rumbling hungrily, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kunsel placed the extra-large pizza in front of his friend. Zack's belly was still so big and bloated that he had no idea how he could still have any space, but his own belly was growling repeatedly for attention. The pizza was steaming hot, so Kunsel grabbed a couple of 2 liter bottles of coke from the fridge to help it go down. Zack raised his eyebrows and smiled: \"Well this is going to be interesting. Think you can keep up with me my little friend? Let the feast begin!\"<br>\r\n       The two growing boys (literally), tore into the pizza. Slice by slice it disappeared, and Kunsel's stomach began to protrude more and more. His top was so beginning to feel so tight...\"Zack- do you mind if I ditch the t-shirt, its hard to breathe!\" Zack grinned at him. \"Only if I can ditch my shorts...look at the waistband!\" Kunsel could see that even though zack's zipper had long been undone, his belly was so big that the waistband was cutting in. \"Deal\". Both boys blushed a little as they pulled off their clothes, leaving zack in some exceedingly tight white briefs -all but invisible under his belly!) and a t-shirt that was totally riding up above the huge mound of flesh sitting on his lap. Kunsel sat next to him in his shorts, but topless, so that his belly had room to grow. Playfully, Zack slapped his friend's mid-section, which caused Kunsel to muffle an unexpected burp with his fist. \"Kunsel, buddy! Let it out!\" As if to demonstrate, Zack grabbed each side of his own belly, threw his head back and projected the most forceful burp in Kunsel's direction, before bursting out laughing. \"Come on, it feels so good!\" Kunsel blushed again \"...maybe when i've had a bit of coke....i'd rather let the pizza settle first.\"<br>\r\n       The boys tucked back in, until the pizza was all gone. They sat back on the sofa, side by side, their bellies sticking up in the air. Zack's was enormous, like a beachball, while Kunsel's was more like a watermelon, and less soft, but still impressive. Sighing, Zack put his arm around Kunsel. \"Well come on them, lets hear it\", Zack chuckled. \"I can't zack\", Kunsel replied, \"im too full, honestly. \"Man, but its so easy...\" Still lying back in almost nothing but his underwear, Zack lolled his head in his friend's direction and let out a long, low burp right into Kunsel's ear. Kunsel could feel the warm air on his face and smell the pizza as zack's burp reverberated in his ear. When he was done, zack kissed Kunsel on the cheek. \"See? Didn't you like that?\" <br>\r\n      Kunsel did like that! It was true he was so full he could hardly move, but the sight of Zack lying back in his briefs, his belly stretching out in all directions was so incredible. \"Here\", zack smiled\", lay your head on my lap and we can get the air out together. I figure that you need to relax in order for your body to release the pent up gas, and nothing relaxes you more than listened to my belly as the burps come up!\" That sounded like a pretty good idea to Kunsel...</span></div></div>",

How about we stir things up a bit?\" responded Kunsel, causing Zack to raise an eyebrow as he asked, \"Stir what up?  How?\"  As if to answer his question, Kunsel winced and rose to his feet, clutching his achingly fully abdomen as he climbed up to his feet and walked over to the kitchen.  Kunsel grabbed both the 2 liter bottles of cola and headed back to the living room, handing one of the still cool bottles to his friend.  \"Can I listen to you chug that first?  It's always incredible, listening to your tummy react to all that carbonation,\" replied Kunsel as he plopped himself back down besides Zack and leaned against his bloated gut as he rested his head atop it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked at the bottle a bit reluctantly and said, \"I dunno, man.  Last time I tried chugging one of these things, I swear, I almost threw up...remember?\"  Kunsel did in fact remember.  However, he simply chuckled a bit, patting his friends' beach ball sized gut affectionately and said, \"Heh, how can I forget?  But this time, I'll be right here to sooth your stomach so it doesn't get too tense.\"  As if to emphasize his point, he grinned and began slowly massaging Zack's bloated belly, causing his eyes to light up as a big grin grew over Zack's face.  \"Ohhh man...I-I mean, no fair, dude!\"  Zack rolled his eyes and snatched the bottle playfully then said, \"Aww, alright.  But first?\"  Zack peeled off his unfitting t-shirt, exposing his surprisingly still perfectly chiseled and muscular torso, complemented perfectly by his immensely bloated and soft belly.  \"Ahhh, now like you, I got room to breathe,\" he joked, nudging Kunsel's arm playfully, before unscrewing the top of his bottle and taking a deep breath.  \"Welp....h-here goes nothing...\"  Cola bottle at hand, the young man proceeded to bring the bottle to his lips and chug away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting right besides Zack on the sofa, Kunsel leaned against the boy, massaging his belly with the palm of his hand while his ear rested against Zack's bare gut.  Kunsel listened as the gas began to bubble and brew within Zack's overactive stomach.  The busy sounds were like music to Kunsel's ears.  All the while, as Zack chugged away, and as Kunsel massaged away, the carbonation, combined with the gasses of Zack's earlier meal had begun to combine and build up, causing his already immensely bloated belly to expand even further, from right below Kunsel, who could feel it slowly inflating.  \"Wow...\" he muttered, still rubbing Zack's tummy as Zack chugged almost nonstop.  Finally, after several moments, Zack reached the half way marker, and gasped heavily for air as the bottle left his lips.  Kunsel laughed a bit, patting Zack's belly proudly, then said, \"Nice job, buddy!\"   Zack grinned cheesily, albeit still exhausted, when suddenly, a very loud, acidic gurgling emanated from Zack's gut.  He winced.  \"Ohhh boy...you might wanna brace yourself for this one...\" Zack warned as he took a deep breath and held it for a few moments.  Looking at Kunsel and gesturing to his bloated midsection, Kunsel took the hint and pressed his hand firmly atop Zack's upper belly.  \"Ready?\" asked Kunsel.  Zack simply nodded as Kunsel then pressed firmly against Zack's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPP !!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's mouth flew open as he tilted his head up towards the ceiling and let fly a deep, explosively loud, and lengthy belch which carried on for almost 12 seconds straight.  As it expelled from Zack's mouth, Kunsel could feel the gas rushing out of Zack's belly, and even felt it deflate a considerable amount from the pure volume of air and gas being expelled.  By the time it was done, Zack groggily leaned back in the sofa, exhausted.  Kunsel laughed hysterically and said, \"Jeez, man!  That was amazing!!\"  Zack smiled weakly and muttered, \"All in the days work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally catching his breath, he wrapped his arm around Kunsel and leaned him into his muscular chest and massive belly, occasionally letting out some smaller afterburps here or there.  Until Zack held his hand up, \"Oh hold up...feel another one coming...\" Zack said as he held an expression of concentration for a moment.  He then took another big breath and sunk his head into his neck for a moment, before bobbing his head forward and letting rip another massive and loud, but much shorter belch.  \"Nice one,\" Kunsel said as he gently nuzzled against Zack's shoulder and pecked him on the cheek.  Zack smiled back and returned the favor.  \"Well?  Did the show relax you enough to start letting 'em rip yet, or what?\" Zack joked.  \"You know what?  I think so,\" Kunsel said with a smirk as he patted his own stomach confidently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and held it for a moment, then clutched his own belly with one hand and said, \"Here it comes...\"  Kunsel then opened his mouth nice and wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....*urp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pause happened, before Zack started to snicker, trying not to laugh.  Kunsel scowled and said, \"Damn it.  Hold on, one sec, one sec...\"  He took another deep breath, causing his stomach to expand just slightly, then forced out a decent but otherwise, wimpy *uuuurrrrp*.  Frowning, Kunsel rubbed his stomach and winced in discomfort.  \"Man, now I know how YOU feel when you need to let it out and it just won't,\" Kunsel complained, when suddenly, his stomach started gurgling similar to Zack's from earlier.  \"You okay, dude?\" asked Zack.  Kunsel shook his head and winced in pain, \"My stomach really hurts, Zack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack helped his friend back to the sofa as he rubbed his gurgling stomach in pain.  Until finally, Zack thought of a way to help get the gas out of Kunsel's stomach...</span></div></div>",

I had a blast!\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Anytime, my friend.\" responded Kunsei, as the two parted ways for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-After a sluggish walk home-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well into the night by the time Zack finally made it to his apartment.  Unlike Kunsei, Angeal, and many other SOLDIER members, Zack was kind of a slob, who never really cared to clean up after himself or organize his apartment since all his time was usually spent training at Shinra, or just out in the field.  Inside there were wrappers, soda cans, and dirty laundry scattered all across the place, and like any other lazy teenager, Zack just walked right past it all and headed straight to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly drained, the exhausted teen plopped face first into his bed, not even bothering to change out of his clothes for the night.  After a few seconds, he flipped back onto his back and rested one hand atop his once again thin stomach, courtesy of the long walk.  \"Man, that was one awesome buffet...\" said Zack to himself as he rubbed his belly from beneath his shirt, when suddenly he felt it rumble hungrily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGGGGUUUUUUURRRRRRGGGGGLLLLLEEEE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Zack rose slightly from his bed, and pressed against his stomach to silence the loud groaning.  \"Jeez, how the hell could I still be hungry after a meal like that?\" said Zack.  Checking the clock, Zack just sat there for a moment, unsure what to do while his stomach continued to insist on tearing his fridge apart.  \"I dunno, I REALLY shouldn't be eating this late into the night...\"  As if responding to Zack's statement, his stomach groaned louder, causing him to wince in mild discomfort.  \"Ugh, alright!  Alright!  Sheesh!\" responded a begrudging Zack as he headed to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, much of it was well past prime...and still put back in the fridge despite the vomit-inducing smells Zack forced himself to endure.  \"Ugh, c'mon, there's gotta be SOMETHING!\" thought a hungry Zack as his stomach continued to roar violently.  Luckily, Zack managed to salvage an entire drawer in his fridge loaded with still fresh leftovers from the week, consisting of BBQ Chocobo-Wings, a few cheeseburgers from his night out with Angeal and the team, some garlic fries, and half of a Deep Dish Pizza.  Glancing down at his mini-feast to be, Zack's mouth watered as he started warming up his leftovers, plate by plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited, he grabbed some milk from his fridge and started drinking from the carton, gulping down massive amounts of milk at a surprisingly quick pace.  Continuing without any breaks, Zack began to sweat as milk drizzled down his chin and spilled over his t-shirt.  He then pressed his stomach with his free hand, feeling it expand little by little as more and more milk continued to travel down into his gullet.  Finally, he crinkled the carton as he sucked it completely dry then slammed the carton onto the table, letting out a monstrously loud belch immediately afterward.  Sighing with relief, Zack then wiped the milk dribble from his mouth and patted his belly in satisfaction.  \"Whew, didn;t even know I was that thirsty,\" Zack said to himself curiously, \"wonder what that was about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand still rested on his stomach, he glanced down curiously and lifted up his shirt, exposing his still firm and muscular but now slightly expanded abdomen.  \"Man, barely even a dent!\" he gloated as he slapped his gut proudly, before letting his shirt fall back down, as the food in the microwave beeped ready.  Licking his lips with anticipation, Zack took the rest of his mini-feast out from the microwave and set it all on the table in front of him.  Despite having just downed an entire carton of milk in a single shot, Zack's stomach still groaned hungry for more.  So Zack delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Zack immediately tore into the BBQ wings, ripping the Chocobo meat clean from the bones in big, heaping mouthfuls, gulping each one down and immediately digging in for more.  \"Mmmm!  *GULLLLP!*  Man, I never noticed how great these things realy were!\" said Zack between bites.  \"And the sauce is killer!\"  Picking one wing bone clean, Zack immediately moved onto the other, repeating the same process until it was bone dry, all the while getting BBQ sauce all over his mouth and fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing the wings, Zack licked his fingers clean and wiped his mouth with a paper towel before moving onto the decent sized burgers from some unnamed restaurant Zack couldn't really remember.  He didn't really care where they were from at this moment.  All he cared about was where they were going to be as he began to chomp down on the first burger.  All the while, his stomach continued to expand little by little with every few mouthfuls swallowed, to where his shirt began to get just a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of stuffing his face, Zack began to slow down, resting one hand atop his gut as it pushed outward by two to three inches.  \"Starting to feel a little full,\" thought Zack as he massaged his stomach tenderly from beneath his shirt...</span></div></div>",

Finally, after seven of those burgers, Zack's stomach had bloated outward all in all by around five straight inches past his waistline, as though he'd swallowed a football whole.  His stomach was so full that it pushed the bottom of his shirt upward, exposing his taut tan flesh, just below the belly button.  And naturally, good ol' Zack couldn't be more pleased with himself as he just leaned back in his chair, rubbing his belly tenderly from under his shirt with a big open grin on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, now THAT one hit the spot...\" said Zack as he patted his bloated belly and sighed with satisfaction.  \"Man, I didn't think my gut could take in this much food, in truth...I don't think I've ever eaten this much before...\" he thought, simply marveling at his bloated midsection as it stuck outward before him.  Poking at it, he winced as it felt hard as stone, unlike anything Zack had ever felt before.  The prodding and thumping of his gut, however, brought forth a very familiar rush of air, causing Zack to let out a lengthy and strained belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUOOOOOOORRPRRRRRRRPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud and lasting five seconds straight, it ended as Zack caught was forced to catch his breath and laugh wearily to himself, \"Whew, that felt good,\" he said with a light hearted chuckle, gently massaging his bloated gut, and continuing to just marvel at it's current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know...this doesn't feel half bad...\" he said to himself.  \"All the time, all I'm ever doing is training or fighting or training some more and fighting some more.  It's not often I just get to kick back and indulge for my own sake.  It kinda...feels good.  What if I kept doing it...?\"  Suddenly his stomach rumbled, as if to agree with Zack, and to let hi know, that somehow, some way...he was still hungry.  Zack laughed childishly and said, \"THAT'S the spirit!\" then gave his gut a hearty slap for emphasis.  </span></div></div>",

His stomach gurgled loudly, causing a loud burp to exit Zack's mouth as he moaned groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my stomach just feels so damn bloated right now...like I could burst any *mo-ment...*\" said an utterly stuffed Zack, working his way around another burp towards the end of his sentence.  \"Man, I bet if Angeal saw this, he'd already be kicking my ass straight to the training room, working this thing off this very second.  Buuuuuut, what Angeal don't know, won't hurt me, riiiiiiight?\" he said mischievously as he thumped his belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, this actually feels...pretty damn good!  Almost, rewarding, just seeing how much my stomach can take...\" he thought as he lifted up his shirt and marveled at his firm and muscular, but still rather taut stomach.  Keeping his shirt lifted, he gently stroked his bloated abs in a slow circular motion and moaned in ecstasy.  He then pushed and prodded at it, feeling his stone cold flesh between his fingertips.  \"I don't care what Angeal or anyone at SOLDIER thinks, right now, this right here?  This is absolutely beastly, dude!\"  He said, thumping his gut before letting his shirt fall back and once again cover his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then; I got the week off, and I'm gonna live it up as hard as my stomach can take!

It was close to mating season and the Lucario had to do something to keep from force palming himself while others had time to get with someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the short trek to the lopunny's place and noticed her and some other females at a hot spring, talking and socializing as they bathed. He was a gentleman and decided to not get invasive, but as he turned, he otherheard a couple of their giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you find anyone yet?\" Said a mienshao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... not yet.

Most of the guys here are scrawny dweebs who can't handle a fight with anyone their own size. I want a bigger guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the conversation was muted to the Lucario as he thought. He wasn't the meatiest Pok\u00e9mon, but how would she know whether he could take on someone else if he didn't have the mass to prove it?

And then, he began to grow. It started out slow, his typically lithe middle starting to become softer as a thin layer of fat accumulated there. But soon, the gain sped up... That thin layer was becoming thicker now, his waistline beginning to grow as a small amount of paunch became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario let out a little gasp in surprise, stumbling back a bit as he looked down at his growing body.

His thighs grew as well, already no longer able to separate as they grew too thick to pull apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario was looking downright obese now. His belly hung well past his thighs and got close to his knees. He moaned as his stomach let out another gurgle, jiggling softly as his now large moobs jiggled in sync. His legs were having trouble supporting all his new weight, and he found himself falling backwards onto his trainer's bed, body jiggling like a bowl of jello as he let out a little whine. He was positively huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, it appeared that the growth had stopped, Lucario letting out a sigh of relief as he placed his thick chubby paws on his massive tummy. He gave his new lovehandles a squeeze feeling a sudden burst of unexpected pleasure as a blush rose to his fat cheeks. His round ass wiggled against the bed, his tail wagging slightly underneath the mountain of flab he had become... He was really starting to enjoy this, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

He started to rub little circles in the flab, his hands sinking into the softness. He couldn't help himself as he got a bit grabbier, taking handfuls of the flab and squeezing it softly, and pressing his face forward and giving the area just above Lucario's deep bellybutton a quick kiss. It seemed that he wasn't the only one enjoying this though. Lucario was still covering his face, but he seemed to be getting more flustered by the moment.

This was more the reason Bowser needed to grab whatever artifact that he can from the temple. Yet there was one problem though.

All of a sudden a strange inscription appears on the gate. Brute strength alone is futile. To gain true strength one must put aside the foolish ways of being skinny. Only one who is of proper girth may enter the temple and claim his rightful prize. This temple shall stay intact until one proves himself worthy of such a sacred honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that about?

The name of the sumo academy was Brick's Sumo Bros. academy. The very same academy that turned normal sized Koopas into Sumo Bros. Yet More than just Sumo Bros. trained there. various minions of Bowser's army would train there in order to have a fun time and also various other people who were not citizens of the Koopa Kingdom. When Bowser walked through the wide doors he couldn't believe his eyes. Of course the Sumo Bros. were normal size, but those who were not Sumo Bros. or Sumo Sis. were huge. The largest wrestler was probably a dragon who hailed from the mysterious Sarasaland that Bowser believed to not exist despite it being a large country.

The dragon was probably a 1000 lbs. and was still rejected by the Temple of Girth.

The mere smell of such a feast caused Yun-Seong's eager mouth to water.  \"Unfortunately, I kind of overdid it and well, I couldn't possibly finish this whole thing by myse-\"<br>\r\n\"Are we gonna talk are are we gonna eat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilik sighed then hoisted the basket over to a little place beneath a large shade providing tree for the two to eat in peace at.  Kilik ate modestly, only eating to get his necessary fill.  Yun-Seong however, ate as if his life depended on it.  Scarfing down various buns, tearing into whatever meat racks he could get his hands on, and all the while, his muscle bound stomach roared for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed.  Kilik had already finished and leaned against the tree satisfied, but found himself in marvel as Yun-Seong continued to stuff his face.  Finally finishing one last piece of chicken, Yun-Seong plopped onto his back, absolutely stuffed.  Much to Kilik's surprise, Yun-Seong's stomach had ballooned out to a noticeable bulge, pushing outward by at least a few inches.  Burping loudly, Yun-Seong moaned in satisfaction and rested both hands atop his belly with a smile on his face.  \"Ohhh man, that was JUST what I needed...thanks so much, Kilik...\"<br>\r\n\"My pleasure,\" responded Kilik, still in awe at the impressive bulge of flesh sticking out of the young pirate.  \"It's weird...\" Yun-Seong started, \"...but just chowing down like that, really...REALLY felt good.  I dunno, maybe I'm still adjusting to living in peace, or living with Talim around here, but, something about eating so much at once...it's like a rush, y'know?\"<br>\r\n\"I might...\" said Kilik, admittedly getting a different kind of uncertain rush.  Not from eating, but from Yun-Seong; watching him eat, watching his muscle bound gut expand.  He couldn't explain it himself, but something about it was a sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something else caught Kilik's eye, as he glanced back into the basket and; with a smile, said, \"Oh, right, how could I forget?\"<br>\r\n\"Forget what?\"<br>\r\n\"We still haven't even touched the spicy shrimp noodles.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKilik pulled out a covered tray at the bottom of the basket and out came a massive platter of delicious noodles with spicy shrimp prawns scattered all around them.  \"Well, I couldn't possibly have another bite.  Still, it'd be a shame to let this go to waste.  I mean, this plate is especially best when eaten fresh.  Do you think you could have a go at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYun-Seong considered the notion, drumming his fingers across his rock hard bloated belly in the process.  Finally, he had his answer...</span></div></div>",

Maxi approached him with a victorious grin on his face as he looked down at the 16 year old boy.  \"Thought you said you wanted to train,\" he said as he got into fighters stance.  Xiba huffed and puffed to pull himself back to his feet.  \"Come oooooon, we've been at this for six hours, and the sun is <i>just</i> coming up!  Can't we take a break?  I'm starving here!\"  complained Xiba as Maxi shook his head.  \"We'll take a break when I'm convinced you've got your parries down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiba groaned as he picked up his Kali-Yuga and got into fighters stance.  \"And once I am convinced,\" started Maxi, \"we'll go to that little all you can eat place down the mountain.  Best sticky buns in the entire region.  <i>On me.</i>\"  Once those words left Maxi's mouth, Xiba's energy was immediately rejuvenated.  \"In that case, let's do this!\" roared an excited Xiba as he and Maxi charged at one another, weapons ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later, the two had journeyed down the mountain and to the village.  Maxi looked pretty roughed up, Xiba even more so, but as soon as the they reached the outside of the buffet, Xiba's face lit up like a toddler entering a toy store.  The lifting aroma of those sticky buns Maxi mentioned emanated from within as Xiba's mouth watered with anticipation.  Smiling, Maxi ruffled the boy's hair and said, \"You've earned it, kid.  Just, do me a favor, yeah?  Don't go-\" before he could finish, Xiba stormed into the buffet, screaming with joy, \"...overboard...\" finished Maxi as he facepalmed and slowly entered the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered, Xiba was...</span></div></div>",

Patient, Maxi sat and simply watched as he went over their training plan with the distracted boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, and Maxi was just about done explaining, while Xiba was just about done stuffing his gullet.  \"And that's about it.  We'll train for a few more days, and when I think you're ready, I'll take you to the Edge Master.  How's that sound?\" asked Maxi.  Xiba meanwhile, leaned back in his chair and rested his hand atop his bare bloated stomach, as it bulged somewhat through his ruffled vest.  \"Ohhhh man, that tasted great!  Thank you so much, Maxi!\" said Xiba as he continued to massage his bloated midsection.  Maxi was still waiting for some confirmation that he heard a single world he just said however.  \"...So how does our little gameplan sound to you?\" he asked again, when suddenly both heard a loud gurgling emit from the younger boy's belly.  No sooner than when it sounded off did Xiba open his mouth and let rip a short but loud <i><b>*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPP!* </b></i> Xiba's burp was wet and heavy, carrying enough force to blow back Maxi's front bang, causing the boy to laugh childishly at his boorish lack of manners.  Maxi's patience was getting tested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he asked bluntly, \"Did you hear a word I said just now or what?\" <br>\r\nXiba simply smiled at the older man and said, \"Well sure I did!  We'll train for a few more days, and when you think I'm up for it, we go to see the Edge Master.  Sounds like a plan to me!\"  Admittedly, Maxi wasn't expecting him to have paid attention, but then again, this young man did have a tendency to surprise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs some time passes...</span></div></div>",

The more meat the boy ingested, the larger and larger his quickly expanding stomach became.  Maxi couldn't help but watch, fascinated as Xiba's belly continued to grow and grow with his gorging.  Finally, after picking his last drumstick clean, Xiba once again slouched back into his chair, both hands atop his much larger stomach, which bulged out almost a good couple inches.  \"Ahhhh, that hit the spot!\" said the boy before letting out another much larger burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!*</b></i>  \"Ohhhh, that felt good.\" said the boy, patting his belly.  Even Maxi couldn't help but smirk at the kid's brashness.  \"It's amazing how much you managed to fit into that thing,\" said Maxi.  Xiba stared back at his mentor for a moment and shook his head.  \"Oh believe me, Maxi, this is nothing!\" responded the boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and sitting next to the boy, Maxi poked and pressed on Xiba's bloated gut, feeling how hard his bloated but still muscular middle was.  \"Can I ask you something, kid?\"<br>\r\n\"Shoot, Maxi!\"<br>\r\n\"Why ARE you always hungry all the time?  Every other second, you're always going on about food, I just wanna know why.\"<br>\r\n\"Because food is life!\" responded Xiba, getting Maxi's attention.  \"Our bellies absorb that life, we taste it, we enjoy it, and after it breaks down, it gives us energy to continue onward until we are lucky enough to eat again!  And it tastes amazing most times, ESPECIALLY the sticky buns!\" he said with a smile on his face.  Maxi hadn't considered that before, but then he glanced down at the boy's bloated belly and said, \"Think you may have ingested a bit <i>too much</i> life, today?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh this?\" responded Xiba, giving his belly a hearty slap to illustrate his point.  \"I have a fast metabolism too.  So combine that with the fact that I'm always active, and I get to work this off relatively quick.  Plus it feels amazing, pushing my belly to its' limits and enjoying as much food as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi glanced at the boy and nodded, he was starting to get it.

Immediately, he looked down at the source, and gaped for a moment, dumbfounded.  \"...You've got to be kidding me...\" Maxi muttered, as Xiba laughed and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"What can I say?  Some need more life than others!\"  Xiba responded, giving his bloated belly a hearty slap before hoisting himself to his feet and eagerly heading back for more food.  Maxi shook his head, still a little bewildered at the teens almost relentless hunger, but was no less intrigued by the notion of seeing how far he could push himself to his limits.  <i>Stamina builds endurance...</i> Maxi thought to himself while Xiba continued to stuff as much food as his plate could carry.  <i>If that glutton is tough enough to wolf down that much food and not be in tears, then maybe he's tough enough to handle what the Edge Master has planned afterall...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maxi mused over the notion of seeing just how far this young man could go, Xiba returned with yet another overwhelmingly ample mountain of food atop his plate.  Various meats, rice balls, tempura, several bowls of ramen, more drumsticks, and some other delights lost amidst the seeming mountain of food Xiba had intended to consume.  The young warrior examined his massive meal to be with wonder as he licked his lips and rubbed his hands together eagerly.  Before he could dig in, Maxi held his hand out to get Xiba's attention.  \"Hold it,\" Maxi said.  Xiba pouted and said, \"Aww, c'mon!  The sign outside says all you can eat!\"  Xiba responded, earning a sigh from Maxi as he worked up a smirk and nodded.  \"Yes, I know.  My question to you is, do you really think you can eat THAT much food?  Your belly isn't exactly the most vacant place to be right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXiba laughed, patting his belly assuredly as he said, \"I already told ya, my gut's strong enough to take ANYTHING tasty!\"  Maxi shrugged and said, \"Alright then.  But I'm holding you to that then, because we're not going anywhere until that plate is bone dry.  I don't approve of wasteful behavior, and neither does the Edge Master.  So if you REALLY think you can eat all of this, then have at it.\"  No sooner than Maxi had finished his warning, has Xiba eagerly dove right into his meal.  Already, the boorish young glutton was wolfing down several egg rolls at a time, as ravenously as a man who hadn't eaten in weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi watched, both intrigued to see if Xiba could manage to eat as much food as he had intended, and mortified by the actual sight of him chomping down morsel after morsel with his bare hands, but as time went on, he didn't seem to mind it too much more.  His focus soon shifted from Xiba messily scarfing down as much as he could fit into his mouth, to Xiba's steadily swelling belly.  With every few gulps of food consumed, his bare stomach expanded outward ever so slightly, like a balloon slowly filling with water.  Yet, despite how much it had already contained, Xiba was eating away at the same abnormally fast pace as when he began.  Maxi hated to admit it, but he was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed...</span></div></div>",

As you might expect, this meant attending meetings and events. One kingdom, ruled entirely by women, had offered the Queen and Lianna the opportunity to attend one of their celebrations. They'd be gone at least all month and, with an early start too, Rowan would have the place to himself for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded him! He had also been invited to another event which, coincidently, only allowed males to attend. Apparently the King was conducting an event for the males while the Queen was conducting one for females, which neither Lianna or the Queen could attend. This meant Rowan was pretty much forced to go otherwise Aytolis would seem disrespectful. It wasn't all bad, this kingdom was nearby and the festival started in the afternoon. He hadn't really read the invitation though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled for something to eat. Back on topic, if he wanted to get big, he would need to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took of his shirt and patted his now exposed belly. He wanted to see every inch of progress he made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants, under Rowan's request, prepared a large breakfast. Their Prince's behaviour was... odd but none dared say a word for he was royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the food, Rowan looked down to his currently small belly, \"Well, here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRowan began tearing through the food, shovelling whatever he could in his mouth. Bacon, eggs, bread. All were emptied into his mouth. The empty plates began stacking up but the prince's pace was slowing down slightly as he was becoming overwhelmed by the amount of food he was trying to eat. His desires shone through and he kept pushing on. Every now and then, he'd look down to check the progress of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis small belly had began pushing out. His body was unable to digest the influx of food as fast as it was being thrust in leaving his belly looking bloated and stuffed. His flat chest curved out in an arc which ended in a gut slowly forcing its way onto the lap below. Groaning and gurgling sounds could be heard as it begged for its master to stop but he wouldn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, all the plates had emptied and Rowan leaned back in a sigh of relief and pain. He tilted his head forward and clutched his complaining stomach. While many would regret this moment, Rowan smiled through his pain, his feelings of suffering surpassed by the feelings he was getting from his remarkable gut. The only question was, where from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spied the invitation on the table and noticed something odd written on it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day at the Skyloft Academy.  Classes were in session, and today, the Junior Knights were getting another Aviation lesson from Owlan, the expert Bird Flying Instructor.  Today's session was on how every knight should keep their Loftwing on a proper diet.  Zelda, of course, was writing up a storm of notes, while Link was having somewhat of a harder time keeping up with Owlan's lesson.  Of course, Groose and his goons were far too busy talking in the back to even pay the least bit of attention, and catching that, Owlan smirked and stopped his lecture mid-sentence and called out to the pointy haired teen.  \"Don't you agree, Mr. Groose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumbling nervously upon being caught, Groose shuffled his one blank piece of paper and cleared his throat.  \"Errr, y-yes!  Absolutely!\"  Owlan raised an eyebrow and with a sly smirk, asked, \"Absolutely what?\"  Gripping his collar nervously, Groose said, \"It's important that every knight maintain a healthy...diet...potion...?\"  Owlan shook his head while Zelda and Link snickered to themselves.  Owlan was just about to scold the arrogant teen when a sudden loud rumbling filled the ears of the entire classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil was that...?\" asked Owlan, confused for a moment, and only a moment, as he knew the answer, upon seeing Link's strawberry red face and realizing that loud noise was the blond's hungry stomach.  \"I see we've skipped breakfast yet AGAIN, young man?\"  Link rubbed the back of his head sheepishly and flashed an embarrassed smile. \"Sorry, Mr. Owlan.  Was kinda running late...again...\" Link replied apologetically.  Rolling his eyes, Owlan simply chuckled to himself and said, \"Well, since we're on the subject of proper dietary maintenance, it's important not to fly your Loftwings on an empty stomach.  So I suppose this is as good a time as any to call in and get something to eat.  We'll resume the rest our lecture tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Junior Knights then took their leave from the classroom.  Groose being Groose, took the opportunity to rub Link's face in his embarrassing ordeal as always.  \"Jeez, Link, I thought Skyloft was having a skyquake for a second there!\"  Link's face grew a bit redder, but luckily Zelda intervened and said, \"For your information, I was helping him study for our Goddess Mythology test this morning.  Sorry he didn't spend all morning looking at himself in the mirror like you do every day.\"  Groose's shoulders slumped downward as Zelda smirked smugly at the pompous knight and headed to the Academy kitchen alongside Link, where they were greeted by Fledge and the Lunch Lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, guys!\" Fledge said.  \"Say, how do you guys think you did on the Goddess exam?\"  Link was about to reply, but yet again, his drained stomach let out yet another hungry growl, causing him to flush red with embarrassment as he covered his stomach with one hand.  The Lunch Lady scoffed and said, \"Hold your horses!  I'm working as fast as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she brought out a shockingly large portion of food for the young junior knight.  Link simply stared wide-eyed at what looked like a mini-hill of various entrees.  Meat, fruits, riceballs, and various other Skyloft delicacies.  \"Don't worry about the Rupees, young man.  I still owe you for helping Fledge move all those barrels.  Enjoy!\"  Link was practically salivating like a hungry puppy at the mere sight of all that food.  Zelda couldn't help but chuckle to herself at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat outside, it's a really nice day today!\" Zelda exclaimed.  Link nodded, only half paying attention, and carefully maneuvered his hill of food out to the shady falls where he and Zelda always had little picnics here and there.  Wasting no time at all, Link began scarfing down whatever he could fit into his mouth, too hungry to differentiate any of his entrees.  With two plump Stamina fruits at hand, Link gulped down an ample mouthful of food and proceeded to greedily chomp into the fruits vigorously.  Zelda couldn't help but chuckle with amusement at the sight, while she helped herself to a sandwich the Lunch Lady had prepared.  \"Wow, Link, I don't think I've ever seen you this hungry before,\" she noted with some surprise in his voice.  Gulping down one of the fruits, Link sighed with relief and said, \"Sorry...I...kinda forgot to eat yesterday, so I'm catching up now,\" Link replied before taking what was left of his second fruit and swallowing it whole.  As he continued eating, Zelda noted that Link's normally slim stomach was beginning to bulge outward slightly from all the food he'd been ingesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFInally, after a little while had passed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda couldn't believe her eyes, her reserved quiet friend had not only eaten more than his share, but he had somehow, eaten every last item on his now empty platter.  Link sighed with relief and smiled a wide smile as he leaned back in the grass, one elbow back supporting him while his free hand rested atop his slightly bloated tummy. \"Ahhh, just what the doctor ordered!\" Link exclaimed happily, patting his stomach proudly.  Unfortunately, the sudden thumping against his bloated stomach had worked up some of the air Link had swallowed with his plethora of food, causing Link to belch quite loudly on accident.  Covering his mouth immediately, Link blushed with embarrassment and yet again smiled a bit sheepishly.  \"Eh hehe...s-sorry about that,\" Link said apologetically.  Zelda simply laughed and playfully poked Link's belly as she said, \"That's alright.  It's Knight Academy!  Everyone's allowed to cut loose every now and then, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled gratefully as Zelda smiled back and rose to her feet, helping her dear friend back up on his.  The two of them simply stood in silence and marveled at the wonderful clear sky above and below them as the breeze blew ever so gently across the floating village in the sky.  \"Ahh, it really is nice and quiet up here, isn't it,\" she asked.  Link simply smiled and nodded.  \"I needed this.  These last few days have been so hectic!  It's nice to just take some time for yourself and unwind every now and then.\"  She then glanced over at Link and said, \"I'm just glad I have a friend to share that time with.\"  Before Link could reply, Zelda playfully pecked him across the cheek, causing the teen's jaw to drop slightly as he flushed red, earning a smile from Zelda, as she said, \"Well, I better get going!  I promised my father I'd help him with the upcoming festivities.  I'll see ya around, Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of a goofy smile rose over Link's face as he watched Zelda take her leave.  He was about to leave as well, when; much to his surprise, his stomach rumbled hungrily yet again.  <i>Wha-?  How could I possibly be hungry?!  I just ate more food in one go than I've eaten all year long!</i>  Link thought to himself, stunned.  As if to emphasize this point, another pocket of stale air rose up the teen's throat, causing his cheeks to puff out as he stifled another burp, causing Link to grimace with discomfort as he thumped his chest a few times, and excused himself to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he thought back to what Zelda had just finished telling him, about taking some much needed 'me-time'.  The truth was, Link had been doubly stressed himself.  Between exams and strange recurring dreams of ominous beings from a strange and distant world Link knew only from mythology, he was in knots all over, and needed to unwind.  Link always had a very big appetite, but he'd never indulged past his limits, part of what kept him in perfect figure most of his young life.  But, strange as it seemed, just kicking back and eating an obscene amount of food brought a wave of relief and jolted a much needed fire in his belly.  Especially given that this past week, Link's troubles had prevented him from eating much at all, and the truth was, he needed to get his energy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may not have been conventional, but if taking some time to just eat and re-nourish his depleted stamina could constitute as unwinding time, then Link had no choice but to indulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If just for a little bit longer...</i> he thought to himself, snickering a bit as he rubbed his stomach hungrily, deciding on how to get his next fill.  Finally, after a bit of thinking, Link decided to...</span></div></div>",

A few mere moments later, the door to Mr. Owlan's class snapped open, and out ran all the young knights to be, eager to get on with their day as they chatted and laughed amongst themselves.  Zelda; the teenaged blonde girl and bookwiz who was typically last to leave the classroom at any given day, was just about finished packing her bag, until she dropped one of her larger lecture books.  Fortunately, just before it could smash against the ground, someone caught it mid-fall.  Looking up, Zelda smiled gratefully as she saw a familiar messy blond haired young man smiling back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero...\"  Zelda remarked playfully as Link chuckled a bit and handed her the book, before grabbing his own and walking alongside her towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, before you go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Link and Zelda stopped as they turned to see Mr. Owlan; their tall, long white haired professor standing firmly behind his desk with a smirk of vague pride across his calm yet often stern face, as he said, \"I just wanted to let you know I'm very impressed by how well you did on today's exam.  In fact, I've noticed your grades have been progressing quite nicely these days.  Be sure to keep it up, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid young man rubbed the back of his head and smiled gratefully at the elder man, but before he could open his mouth to reply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, yeah, keep up the great work, nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing that smug, arrogant voice all too well, both Link and Zelda turned to see Groose snickering at his own insult as he grabbed his own book and rose from his desk.  Turning his attention to the beefy but prissy teen, Owlan's face remained neutral as he said, \"That didn't stop you from trying to cheat off his exam, now did it, Mister Groose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroose's snickering came to a screeching halt as he blinked dully and turned to his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eeeh...y-you saw that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwlan raised an eyebrow and added, \"You didn't think it was strange that your grade was 'See me after class?'\"  Groose's previously smug expression went completely blank as both Link and Zelda snickered to themselves then took their leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya next week, Mister Owlan!\"  Called out Zelda, chipper as ever as Owlan smiled at the two parting teens, then turned his attention to the cowering bully sitting alone in the back of his classroom.  \"Tell me, Groose...how do you feel about cleaning the Loftwing stables?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroose whimpered pitifully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, both Link and Zelda were still walking together through the Academy Hallway.  \"Man, I STILL can't believe I got an A on that test...I was SURE I'd get another D...\" remarked Link, more than a hint of relief present in his voice.  Zelda just smiled and playfully nudged her friend in the arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who'd have thought opening your book and READING it every once in a while would lead to that silly brain of yours actually retaining stuff?\"  joked Zelda.  Link just rolled his eyes and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardy har har...\" chimed Link, before he turned to Zelda and; with a more genuine and grateful smile, added, \"Seriously though, I really appreciate you taking the time to help me study these past few weeks.  Goddess only knows how badly I'd still be failing if it weren't for you, Zelda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda just smiled back at her friend and added, \"Hey, what're friends for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, yeah...\"  Link just chuckled and rubbed the back of his head a bit sheepishly, then added, \"...S-still, is there any way I can repay you?  A-as thanks for helping me study and all that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stopped and thought for a moment, but before she could reply, a LOUD rumble emitted throughout the hall.  From afar, one of the senior knights; Pipit, stepped out from the lobby and looked around curiously.  \"What in the name of the Goddess...?  Was that a skyquake...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from Link's flushing red face, however, the source of that rumbling was in fact, his hungry stomach.  Catching this, Zelda just laughed while Link chuckled sheepishly with embarrassment as he grabbed his midsection and turned away, hoping to stifle its' hungry musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what; how about you repay me by having lunch with me?\" offered Zelda, much to Link's relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sounds good to me, h-heh...\" replied Link, still embarrassed as he continued to try and quiet his rumbling stomach in any way he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do the two friends decide to eat at?</span></div></div>",

Sure the place was a death-trap but it was a great way to stay in shape away from prying eyes even if Pearl and Marina couldn't always feed him advice through a radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore recently, he'd been simply riding the metro as a way to relax. He could swear he could hear the Calamari Inkantation on the radio but no-one else seemed to. Maybe it really was etched into his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took at seat and watched the bright colours soar by the windows. The metro was quiet today, it was just him and the Conductor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the CQ-80 to see if he could point the train is a less... strikingly bright direction. He simply wanted to- Hello? What's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was faint but there appeared to be an additional line extending past the bottom of the hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming in, it did appear to be another line. Four stations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo mem cakes to be found here, though, which was disappointing. Of all the things Eight was able to remember during his adventure, his name was not one of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo weapons allowed in any of them. Curious. Maybe he got a selection of canned weapons inside? Memories of <i>Girl Power Station</i> caused him to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came here to relax after all, not throw himself into more challenges. Pearl and Marina weren't here to help him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked to the first and scanned over the name: <i>Gut Instinct Station ~ Heavy hitters</i>. Nothing too useful there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis finger twitched over the confirmation button. Should he? Shouldn't he?</span></div></div>",

Now it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to eat all of this food. Perhaps he shouldn't have eaten before coming down here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late to change his mind now, Eight dug into one of the three burgers that were in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were actually really good. Who knew the test chambers had good food hiding away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing all three, Eight stifled a burp. Less filling than he thought they'd be but perhaps that was for the best. There was still rather a lot to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table spun robotically and presented him another dish. Rinse and repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate though, he quickly slipped from eating vigorously to nibbling at each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only his fifth plate, he had to stop for a moment. A sensation of fullness had been building up. He'd tried his best to ignore it but it had simply become too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight groaned and clutched his stomach which had been showing the effects of his meal too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a flat stomach had bloated out into a belly. Eight pressed a finger against its surface finding it hard and taut. He stuffed it so full that it had begun forcing the zipper on his shirt up. The resisting clothing had begun to dig into his skin so he fully unzipped the piece but left it hanging on his shoulders. It wasn't much of relief, but it was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up, he was halfway through. Only 5 other things left. His stomach groaned unpleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began thinking it would've been better just to sit on the train and listen to music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his increasingly growing gut, Eight soldiered on hoping to just get finished if nothing else. </span></div></div>",

Though he was a little nervous, he wasn't sure if Josh's family kept the place stocked while they were away. Josh timidly opened the cabinets in the kitchen fearing he was going to find nothing in them. Though thankfully to his relief he saw that there was plenty of food stocked. Chris then went over to the refrigerator to check there and saw that it too was also filled with food as well. Chris guessed that Josh must have had his parents have had the cabin restocked before they headed up to the cabin, not surprised given Josh's new appetite. He grabbed some eggs, milk, and got some of the pancake mix that was in cabinet. He decided they were were going to have a breakfast for today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris started with the pancakes first, since he wanted to make sure the eggs were still warm when Josh decided to come down and eat. He prepped making the pancakes, measuring the flour, putting it in a pouring bowl and then mixing it with milk. After he gave it a hearty stir so it was mixed properly, he turned the stove on, got a frying pan hanging on the floor and poured some of the batter into the pan. He flipped it over a couple of times till that battered turned into a fluffy golden brown pancake and repeated the process a few times till he hard a large stack of pancakes. He then moved on to making the scrambled eggs. He cracked the eggs into a bowl and the beat the eggs till it was thoroughly mixed, the yolks taking on a light yellow color. Taking another frying pan he poured the eggs into the frying pan and began to slowly move the eggs around with a spatula to properly scramble them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought a smelled something good.\" A voice boomed out in the cabin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked to where the voice came from and saw Josh heading towards him. Chris noticed that Josh;s shirt looked a tight on him, he guessed from his binge from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, thought I whip up on breakfast while you were sleeping\" Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks all pretty good\" Josh said as he rubbed his hands together in anticipation to start eating. \"I'm starving\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you eat  a ton of junk food last nigh\" Chris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that was then and this is now\" Josh said as a took a seat on the table. He grabbed a pancake from the stack and began eating it without a plate or utensils just ripping it with his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Chris said annoyed. He had spent much of the morning cooking breakfast and Josh was going to eat without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Josh replied with as he chewed the pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me at least, I'm still making the eggs\". Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry bro but I'm just hungry is all, I'll wait for you\" Josh said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Chris said as he continued back on making the eggs. The two boys continued to idly chatter till the eggs were ready. Chris divided the pan into half one half for him and another half for Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Chris sat down to eat Josh then began to dig in, Chris just sighed and just started to eat. Chris was halfway done with his meal when he heard a groan come from the other side of the table. Chris took his eyes off with his food to see that Josh had already finished, not a crumb was spared. Josh was already leaning back into his chair rubbing his bloated gut. It was kinda hot to be honest. But he went back to finishing his meal, only to join in with Josh after his finished his meal as well. Chris had to admit his eyes were bigger than his stomach sometimes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had missed them when Sam kept them all underwraps and away, with good reason but nonetheless, surely there was some better way of doing it than nearly destroying one's friendship. Anyhow, it was all good now and he was excited to go back to playing ball, chatting about girls, eating, video games, and such things with his buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing that bugged him though and that was how skinny he was as a werewolf. Yes, he was a small werewolf compared to everyone else and it was almost obscene that even Jacob and Quil who had changed more than a month after him were bigger than he was. Yes compared to humans, he was pretty big but when measured against his pack, he was the runt of the litter, again. Just like when he was human. That was one of the few things he had been looking forward to as a wolf, not being smaller than everybody else but even Seth, Leah's little brother who was in the pre-phase step before phasing was bigger than him! And he was 2 years younger and not a full wolf yet! How was that even fair? The good news was that there was little to do as a Wolf. Just go around running stupid patrols finding non-existant vampires and eat and relax. Especially eat, There were definitely worse things to be doing anyhow. All the vampires seemed to have gone away and even Sam who was insanely strict, finally was convinced to loosen the patrolling schedule and it became more of a once in a while thing than something they did everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh eating. That was something they all looked forward to. The wolf spirit really ratched up the food requirements and they were all so hungry all the time. But they could eat whatever they want, however much they want, and they all got big hulking huge manly bodies without even having to do anything free of charge! However, he noticed something weird that the others haven't really seemed to notice yet. At first he thought there must have been some mistake, that he was seeing wrong or imagining. But yes, Sam's belly was beginning to bloat out a little around the edges and the abs less defined. Jacob's, Paul's, and Jared's as well. Quil never really had the same degree of definition as the others, sporting a belly with partial abs but it seemed even those were gone now and was becoming a gut which to be honest was more suiting....uh yeah. He checked himself out and he also had a bit of flab covering his abs but not so much it was noticeable unless you squeezed or felt it. It turned out there was a bit of repercussion for eating like they did, even with werewolf metabolism, and changing just once a week, sometimes even just once every two weeks if at all...Well, this wasn't much of an issue. Actually, he kind of liked it, this manly feeling and it honestly wasn't all that much. Their metabolism still ate most of it and if it was just a few pounds here and there and if he ate enough, he could catch up to the other guys and not be so small. And it wasn't like they were complaining or even seemed to notice. </span></div></div>",

He didn't look that bad, not now that he had his werewolf growth spurt, but he still looked puny compared to others in the Pack. Seth had always been on the slighter side and while the others looked like massive muscle beasts who could bench cars and bend steel like supermen (they tested and Jacob, Sam, Paul, and Quil actually could) he looked a swimmer. Admittedly a very ripped and lean one but when your friends are all easily two to three times as broad towering giants with biceps about as big or bigger than your head, it certainly does not build one's confidence. He wanted to look more like Jacob, Sam, or Paul (as much as he disliked him). Why did the spirits see it fit to give him such a small pathetic body? That was just not fair. Not to mention that everyone thought of him as a kid or pup. He was no kid! He was only two years younger and they all treated him as such a baby. He killed vampires just like they had and they still treated him as a baby. Jacob and his friends were at least nice about it, but Paul and Jared ridiculed him and made him feel very unwelcome. Paul especially liked to throw his size around. It was horrible but Seth actually was almost turned on by the feel of the bigger man against him. Not to say he was attracted to Paul, but Seth loved bigger sizes. Having been surrounded by bigger people all his life, he couldn't help but be attracted. And Paul, while not as big as Jacob or Sam, was huge and even if he was a dick Paul was hot. He'd be hot too if he was bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seth, dinner time,\" his mom called and he looked away from the mirror. He was tired of always being the smallest in the Pack. He would get big and strong, maybe even as big as Jacob whom he idolized, and would show them all. Seth Clearwater was no kid, he was just as much a wolf as those guys. Bounding into the kitchen he kissed his mom and sat down as she served him the huge portions of mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Grinning, he digs in making noises of appreciation (in contrast to most parents, Sue Clearwater actually got upset if it was just quiet and polite like they weren't enjoying their food) and does something that makes his mother and sister Leah look at him in shock. Letting out a long burp (when surrounded by a number of big overgrown immature guys, one learns things) he cleared his throat and asked-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Can I have more?\" and it just grew quiet as Leah and Sue stared at him. </span></div></div>",

Batman had tracked the Hatter down to the Doughboy Donut Packing factory in Gotham industrial district, and after solving his ever increasingly annoying rhymes and games, the Bat had him on the fence or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make this easy for yourself\" said the Bat sternly, lifting the Hatter off his feet and holding him againt the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh such fun, you following me, here there and back. But the night is young, and theres much to do, so as a reward, a special.... bat snack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Scowled Batman. But before he could ask, the Hatter forced somehting into his mouth, and while Bruce coughed in a cloud of powdered suger, he started to feel dizzy. The sweet suger shimering in the air like noxious gas fumes. The Batman fell to his knees, coughing violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what did you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a taste, a sweet one too, now whatever I say, you will do!\" sung the Hatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cough*... Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this little treat, will make you want eat, and the more you do, the more it feels so right, so good, so new. And thanks to my little sweetie, you'll soon be bigger then both tweedle dum and dee. So my dear Bat, you will love getting fat, yes, so much fatter. And its all thanks to me, your dear friend Hatter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman tried to force himself to his feet, but he fell into a stack of boxes, the Hatter gleefully laughting as he walked away. Batman wanted to chase, but he was filled with the overwhelming urge to eat. He grabed the donuts and began stuffing them into his mouth, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"more *gulp* I need... *chew* I need more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman reawoke at daybreak. Groggily he sat up. His entire body hurt, as he looked around to see a dozen or so empty boxes, each one once holding a dozen or so doughnuts.  He then looked down to see the plating on his suit was warping out of position around his stomach, his suit uncomfortablly tight around the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing that there was some truth to what the Hatter had said, he quickly did a scan for any irregularly in his phisiolagy.  Sure enough, his body had accumulated 30 pounds of fat overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn' thought the bat. He programed the suits plating to expand as much as it could to relieve some of the preasure, but even then it was still tight. And the worst part was hw was still hungry. Heading back to the Batmobile, Bruce wobbled as his center of gravity had altered. He needed to solve this fast, but a  rumble from his newly aquired gut gave a strong counter argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... find something to eat. Then fix this\"</span></div></div>",

These treasures are different from other artificial as all the collect is said to hold the power gods and goddesses of old, from Norse to Greek to Hindu to Aztec to even Abrahamic. Tonight is the last night that all the treasures will be together then they will be taken apart shipped apart back to their own country of origin. Greek artifacts will be sent back to Greece, Hindu artifacts sent back to India.<br>\r\nBatman and Zatanna have chosen to oversee the collection as that no villain will steal these priceless treasures. Zatanna is here as she is an expert on magic and with divine powers at work it good to have someone with supernatural knowledge. <br>\r\n\u201cSo how long do you think some villain with come and try to steal these artifacts?\u201d asked Zatanna as she was spinning her wand between her fingers. She and Bruce has long history. Bruce went to her father to skill and training on how to get out of locks and other tricks that stage magicians have the knowledge. She still today has feeling, but she knows that she can\u2019t keep him. It would ruin his playboy image.<br>\r\n\u201cNot long. Oracle has some intel that some villainess will ty to break in.\u201d answered Batman as he glared over the monitors that he set up overlooking the collection. Both of them sat on the roof looking in thought the huge skylight on the museum. Little did he know that ignite the flames of love and desire in many women both good and bad.<br>\r\n\u201cCareful Bruce, if any artifact gets the tiniest of cracks then the deity who owned it will get angry. My magic can match up to the power of a god. \u201cSaid Zatanna. She have read stories and heard rumors that unworthy mortal who tried to harness the power of the objects meets a bad end.<br>\r\n\u201cI never believe in magic and the power of gods\u201d stated Batman bluntly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh what about me or Doctor Fate and Wonder Women who got her powers from Greek goddesses?\u201d spat Zatanna. <br>\r\nBatman ignored her and notice there were some movement on some of the screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison ivy broke out of Arkham Asylum and heard of the collection. She wanted the scepter of Gaia. The legend goes that whoever wields the scepter will have absolute power of the plant kingdom. With the scepter she could roll over the planet with her army of plants. She could increase her love dust power and finally have Batman. She infatuated with him as he is only person to resist her seduction. She then sneak out of the women bathroom. She broke in by growing a plant that unlocked the bathroom windows from the street side.<br>\r\nCatwomen open the latch from the vent and jumped down and gracefully evade the security beams. She also heard of the collection and wanted the necklace of Bast. It would be the crown jewel of her heist and she hopes that she and Bats would clash for another time. Legends goes the wear of the necklace would talk and command any cat from house cats to lions. Also have cat like grace and would transform into a werecat form. Her clashes with Bats sparked a desire to be with forever.<br>\r\nHarley Quinn also broke in and wanted the mask of Thalia. With is she make people laugh forever and control them to release her pudding, Mister J. she can finally prove that she does love him and with this act hopefully he can return his feeling of love to her. A small part of her hope that Bats will stop her as she knows that Joker is using her for her body and is nothing more than a tool to him. She broke in a storage room and started walking to the exhibit hall holding the collection.<br>\r\nTalia al Ghul easy bypassed the security system and wanted to steel the bracelet of Tyche. With luck will always be on her side and she hopes one day Bruce will let her into his life and to see her son Damien. <br>\r\nPeyton Riley the second ventriloquist also broke in by seducing a young guard and stealing his card to bypass the security system. She is after the diadem of Delirium with it she hopes to stop hearing the voice from the puppet and she can final have a free life. She is grateful to Batman to show her how to have her own life. She would do anything Batman asks of her as she wants out of the life of the mafia.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The caller was J'onn J'onzz also known as the Martian Manhunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBatman I got reports that another thief is coming and its Phantasm. I am sending you some available league member. They are Wonder Woman, Black Canary, Fire, Ice, and Doctor Light. Some of the other members are busy. Superman is dealing Luthor, Flash is dealing his rouges, Green lantern was called back for some emergency and Aquaman is dealing with Black Manta and Oceanmaster.\u201d said the martin on the intercom that was connected to all league personal earpiece, but this is call was private and sent only to Batman ear piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the update and for the reinforcements. \u201csaid Batman as he turned to Zatanna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got some help. \u201csaid Batman as both heroes saw the flashing lights from heroines that was teleported from the watch tower. Batman and Zatanna saw Black Canary, Wonder Woman, Fire, Ice and Doctor Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Batman and Zatanna.\u201d Said Black Canary as the rest of the women nodded in acknowledgment to the mistress of magic and the dark knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you all been brief of the situation? \u201casked Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and we are at your command.\u201d said Wonder Woman as any hero knows that Gotham is under Batman\u2019s control and you need his permission to operate in his territory. Batman has great respect among the heroes and fear among many villains and they both know not to get his truly bad side. Even Superman fear what Batman will do to him if he disobeys a direct order. Not to mention that Wayne Enterprise owns the Daily Planet thus making Batman Superman\u2019s boss. Even some of the strongest heroes\u2019 fear Batman\u2019s wraith should they step out of line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. We will be in a tight space building filled with very old and fragile artifacts that we cannot afford to break or destroy. Ice your opponent will be Poison Ivy as your ice powers will be effective against her plants. Black Canary you will be after Catwoman and try not to use your Canary Cry in here. Wonder Women you will be after Talia al Ghul. Fire you will go after Harley Quinn. Doctor Light you will go after Peyton Riley and Zatanna you will go after Phantasm. Try to lead tem in the main gallery and then I can trap them\u201d said Batman as he explained his plan and how stop the villainess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman soon ran through the shadows of the museum and saw some movement and brought out her whip and she swung the whip in to the shadows and it caught a red covered leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley? What are you doing here? \u201csaid the cat thief as she released Harley from her whip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. I just want to browse here and see if anything will make Mister J happy. \u201csaid Harley Quinn as she stood leaning against her signature huge hammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do we have here. Seem that the we all want something from the collection here.\u201d said voice from the shadows. Both Catwoman and Harley Quinn looked and saw it is the Queen of plants Poison Ivy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Well I came here first. \u201csaid a female voice and all three women turned and saw it was Peyton Riley without her dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere your dummy?\u201d asked the red and black dressed jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere your boyfriend? Oh that\u2019s right locked up in Arkham.\u201d Remarked the blonde women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little blonde bi- \u201csaid Harley before she was cut off from speaking by Ivy\u2019s vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough. All of you control yourself. Get out before I make you all leave \u201csaid a female voice. All four women turned and saw Talia al Ghul the second in command of the league of assassins coming out of the shadows <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should we? We all want something from here tonight. \u201csaid Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I said so. You get out of the shadows. \u201ccommanded Ghul as a figure came out and it was Phantasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well well if it isn\u2019t the women who lives in the shadow of her father.\u201d said Phantasm. Talia ignored that comment but glared at the mercenary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody just relax. You are giving me a headache. How about we steal what we all came for and leave. We are free villainess and I suspect Batman might be on his way to catch us and take us to Arkham or worse. \u201csaid Catwoman who tried the diplomatic approach. She heard mumbles and yes\u2019s and soon each villainess would leave <br>\r\nthe main gallery to get their item of interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatwoman noticed a shadow on the wall and it was in the shape of a bat and she altered the rest of the villainess and they all saw the shadow and traced to a tall muscular figure in a black bat themed costume. It was Batman and next to him is Zatanna Wonder Women, Fire, Ice, Black Canary, and Doctor Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman then threw a batarang that emitted smoke and it was the signal for the heroines to go and attack and restrain their enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Women flew and conjured her Amazonian sword and soon got into a duel with Talia. Ice fired blast of ice at Ivy who summoned a wall of vines to shield her from the attack. Fire released balls of heat at Harley who dodged. Zatanna summed metal chains from her top hat to tangle up Phantasm who tried to slash at the chains. Black Canary got into close combat with Catwoman as she disarmed Catwoman of her whip. Doctor Light sent light blast at Peyton trying to just to confuse her. Harley found an opening and knock Fire back and saw Batman was open to an attack. \u201cThis is for Mister B. \u201cshouted the crazy clown princess she flung a big bomb filled with joker gas and a painted happy face on it. \u201cHarley no.\u201d shouted Ivy as she knew what would happen to everybody in the tight room. \u201cHsinav\u201d spoke Zatanna as the bomb glowed, but exploded releasing a huge wave of force knocking everybody back into different parts of the museum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman saw Harley trying to harm him and saw Zatanna chanted a spell to make the bomb disappear only for Talia to get thrown in Zatanna while she chanted the spell. The next thing he know he was thrown across the main gallery into a museum corridor and saw a big red ball of twine with a dog statue on it starting to fall. Batman rushed to save the artifact from falling and potentially breaking. He saved it only to fall unconscious as he felt his conscious slip. The last thing he saw before falling completely unconscious is a Scottish terrier looking at him. \u201c<i>How did a dog get in here?\u201d</i> thought Batman before he blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somebody must has interfered when I was chanting the spell.</i> \u201cthought Zatanna she thought about what happen to her spell. The spell was just to make the bomb vanish not cause a force blast. She noticed the artifacts started to glow.<i>\u201d Not good</i>.\u201d The artifacts couldn\u2019t have gotten damage. They were not in the main gallery.\u201d thought Zatanna she backed away from the glowing artifacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artifacts started to float and from their glowing came ghostly figures. The figures were dressed in ancient noble\u2019s robes and some of the figures were ancient Roman armor. Zatanna instantly recognized them as the Roman pantheon of gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew from her knowledge of supernatural and from her and Batman\u2019s mission in Rome several months ago. The world leaders were gathered Rome for a peace conference. Batman, Zatanna, and Wonder Women got a lead that Felix Faust wanted to tap into magical source of power, and kill the world leaders. The source of power was an ancient Roman temple dedicate to the gods. Zatanna saw varies statues and pictures of the roman gods.  The trio managed to defeated Felix Faust and many world leaders put more trust in the superheroes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the one known as Zatanna?\u201d asked one of the ghostly figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm yes, what do you want for me? \u201casked Zatanna is she wondered what did the Roman gods want with her. She knew that her magic is weak against divine beings like gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wanted to express our gratitude to you as you saved our temple from being used by the pitifully excess of a sorcerer. \u201csaid of the ghostly figure. Zatanna felt honored and remember that she tapped into the magical power of the temple to defeat Faust as Batman and Wonder Woman distract him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you tapped in the magical source we felt you use the power there and noticed there was a mental block on your power. Our gift is for you is the remove that mental block and have full access to your power and our blessing should give you a huge boost in your magical powers. \u201csaid one of the figures as all the gods waved their hand over Zatanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you for such a great gift. Words cannot express how grateful I am.\u201d said Zatanna as she felt a huge surge of power flow through her body. She felt a stronger connection to magic. She felt that she could do the most complex forms of magic just be doing a mere hand gesture or by a mental command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe felt that you are only one that can take care of our artifacts and we will let you take care of them. Before we go let me tell you that your mind and soul is linked to another person, but he will take of you well. A far more powerful being caused the linked.\u201d said another ghostly figure. After that the ghost images faded away and the glowing artifacts stopped floating and glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna stood in the dark museum gallery filled with ancient Roman artifacts.  She remembers about the lose villainess and the thought of her comrades and Batman might be hurt. She ran out of the gallery towards the main gallery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~<br>\r\nWonder Woman knocked back and when she gained her bearing and saw she was blasted in the ancient Greek artifacts gallery. She even saw some Amazonian pottery and jewelry. She noticed that many of the artifacts in this gallery looked like the artifacts worn by the Greek gods she has encountered.She heard a familiar laughter from coming from one of the artifacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow yourself now!\u201d called out the Amazonian princess. She looked around, but saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Dianna don\u2019t you recognized my voice. \u201csaid an echoing voice. A light appeared and it morphed into a handsome Greek man wearing ancient Greek toga with winged sandals and a caduceus. The figure is Hermes the messengers of the gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHermes, my apologies, but what are doing here?\u201d asked the brunette as she looked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to signal the rest of the family. \u201csaid Hermes as she snapped his finger and soon lights appeared and they morphed into Greek gods. Wonder Women saw she was surround the Greek gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are here to thank you from rescuing us from Granny Goodness after she held us captive and from stopping the witch Circe from trying to drain us of our divine powers. As a gift we decide to increase your powers. \u201csaid Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana remembered that Granny Goodness kidnapped the Greek gods and held them while she tried to cause the amazons to go to war with Man\u2019s world. The justice league attack Darkseid and Wonder Women and Batman freed the gods and the gods unleashed their divine vengeances of Granny Goodness.  Five months ago the witch Circe tried to drain all the gods of their power to defeat Wonder Women. Diana and Batman freed the gods and they imprisoned the witch in the underworld. When they imprisoned the witch it broke an ancient spell on some of the gods that caused them to act reckless and more aggressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Diana. For freeing us from the witch and Granny Goodness. I will enhance your endurance and strength. Now you can punch a planet and cause it to crack apart. \u201csaid the goddess Demeter as she snapped her fingers and Diana felt a surge in power. The rest of the gods soon give their gift to the Amazonia princess. Hermes gave her the ability to fly faster than light and travel in space without air to breathe. Aphrodite gave her the ability to emit a calm and loving aura to calm the mind and hearts of people. Athena gave her the gift of always having several great back up plans should her first plan fail. Apollo gave her immune to all poison, toxins, and disease always and a faster healing factor. Zeus gave her the power the channel divine lightning into her lasso. Hades gave her a pass to the underworld that she could use any time and to help souls pass on into the after side.

Poseidon gave her the ability to not needing to breath underwater and moving faster in water and being immune to water pressure. Hestia gave her the power to install hope, love, and compassion to people. Dionysus gave her ability to withstand madness and always have a level head in any situation. Artemis gave her the ability to hunt or track any being magical or mortal.  Hephaestus gave the power to see any weakness in any weapon, armor, or machine. Finally, Ares who was the most impacted god from Circe spell. After the spell broke he calmed downed and apologized to Diana and became more levelheaded. He gave Diana the power to wield any weapon as if she was a master of it and to reduce people\u2019s violent urges and to give people courage to help better society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiana another ancient being older then us linked your mind and your soul to another person. The link is immune to our powers, but you know that person well. \u201csaid Athena as each god gave their goodbyes and left or Olympus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you my lords and ladies. \u201csaid the Princess as she was soon left in a dark empty gallery filled with ancient Greek artifacts.  She then ran back towards the main gallery hoping to catch the villainess and help if any of her fellow heroines were hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that they were of Celtic origin as she was attack by an old evil Celtic spirt claim to fought her mother to reclaim her \u201cCanary Cry\u201d.  The spirit claimed that her family line was blessed by a group of banshees and the spirit wanted her Dinah powers. She went to Batman as he would help her even if the story sound silly. Together with Zatanna they would a way to send the spirit back to where it came from and seal off any way of coming back. After that a part of her wanted to know about her origins. She only found out that some of her ancestors were Irish and that they came to America. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaughter of Dinah come closer. Do you not seek knowledge about your powers?\u201d asked an echoing voice coming from the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is there show yourself. Come out you coward?\u201d spat Black Canary as she raised her guard and slowly walked around looking for the source of the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not mean harm but gratitude as you banished the tainted spirit. The spirit wanted to slowly destroy those who banished it long ago. \u201cthe echoing voice said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? My mother didn\u2019t banish anybody. \u201csaid Dinah as she looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did not, but long ago before your family came to these lands. One your ancestors was a druid priest who sang and together with other druids they banished that spirit who was destroying many villages and kill many innocent people. The druids and villages prayed to us the Celtic gods for help. I sent help and the daughter of your druid ancestor had a great gift of singing. I helped her unlock that full potential and so many generations went and only recently your mother could tap into that power, but you have greater talent and your line and will have access to it full power. \u201csaid the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Canary inspected many of the artifacts and finally came to an old metal flute.  Below the flute on a metal plaque it read. \u201cThe flue of Lugh god of skills, druids, physicians, smithing, war, magic, commerce, reincarnation, lighting, water, arts and crafts, prophecy, healing, journeys, music, poetry, and manual arts.\u201d  She knew the voice was coming from here as being close to the flute she could hear the voice getting louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want? \u201casked Black Canary with some spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple to awaken your dormant powers and to thank you for your heroic actions. I must warn you. You are linked to another person and even my power can get rid of that link. I suspect who ever put that link there is older and more powerful than even me and the rest of the Celtic gods. \u201cthe echoing voice. The flue emitted a bright burst of light and Black Canary closed her eyes as it was too bright.  She didn\u2019t feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNote to self-cut down on the night crime. I must be imagining things. \u201c</i>thought Black Canary as she remembers about her comrades and Batman. Shen then sprinted out of the gallery towards the main galley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Light was flung by the blast into a gallery containing artifacts. When she regained her stance and shock off the dizziness from the blast she noted that she was in the Japanese artifacts gallery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw various objects like samurai equipment to objects that are rumored to belong to the gods of Japan. She knew how to identify as she grew up in Japan was learned of the folklore and myths about her ancestral country.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Batman and some of the Justice League members helped stop the Injustice league from causing Mount Fuji to have a super volcanic eruption and cause a huge earthquake. The Injustice league wanted to kill all the Asian world leaders as they all gathered in Tokyo for an economic and peace summit. Kimiyo was an important factor as disarmed the bomb that would cause the eruption while the rest of team fought and distract and lured away the Injustice League. Batman talked her through the team\u2019s com link on how to disarm the bomb. The heroes won and managed to put away some of the member of the Injustice league while the rest escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimiyo admitted to Batman she was very scared as the bomb was in a dark cave and guarding it was Doctor Light the villain named Arthur Light. He attacked her and told her about how he eliminated her kids and that she will be next. Batman talked to her and with his advice Kimiyo managed to defeated Arthur and managed to disarm the bomb before it went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked Batman to help get over her fear of the dark. Batman agreed and called in the hero Obsidian to help. He had Oracle to help with the emotional support and both women had close when they visited the graves of Kimiyo kids and her father. Batman and Obsidian slowly helped Kimiyo get over her fear of the dark and Batman also contacted few martial artist teachers to help her on her hand to hand combat. After her period of recovery, she regained her confidence and self-esteem. She thanked Batman and Zatanna who used her magic to summon the spirits of her kids to say goodbye for a final time. Oracle further asked her to join the Birds of Prey. Kimiyo joined and the members of the Birds of Prey helped provide emotional support <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw two round glowing mirrors that was decorated with ancient Japanese designs. One mirror has the kanji for the word sun and the other mirror had the kanji for the world of moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun mirror glowed and the light formed into a beautiful young Japanese woman with long black hair wearing a bright sunny yellow Kimono.  The moon mirror glowed and the light formed into a handsome young Japanese man with short black hair and wearing a silver and dark blue hakama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women spoke \u201cYou are the heroine known as Doctor Light. Are you or are you not?\u201d asked the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am, but who are you?\u201d asked Kimiyo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Amaterasu and my companion is my brother Tsukuyomi \u201csaid the women as both parties bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are here to thank you for stopping Mount Fuji. On the mountain there are two ancient shrines there. One for me and one for my sister. \u201csaid Tsukuyomi as he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Japanese people for generations have coming to the shrines and praying to us. We are glad they were not destroyed. So as a gift of gratitude we will give a gift.\u201d Said Amaterasu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give you the power of healing and absorbing light from the moon. I also will help you feel at ease in being surround by darkness and the moon often is covered the shadow of the earth. \u201csaid Tsukuyomi as he waved his hand and Kimiyo glowed silver for a few seconds before fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enhance your light based powers to rival the light of a dozen suns. The is connected to your will alone. These light cannot get stolen one you have the power to turn of this light.\u201d Said Amaterasu as she also waved her hand and Kimiyo glowed golden for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you again for saving our shrines. Before we go we would like you to know that you are bonded to another person. The bond is immune to our power, something or someone more powerful and older then us must have caused the bond to appear. \u201csaid Tsukuyomi as both sibling bowed to Kimiyo and then started to glow and then disappear with a cloud of sparkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat was very usually. \u201c</i>thought Kimiyo as her logic side came and dismissed that they were gods, but another part of her did remind her that she does work with magic users and she has seen Wonder Woman fight some gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was lost in thought about the gods. As scientist she is driven by logic, but she has worked with supernatural beings like Dr. Fate, Zatanna, Phantom Stranger, and the Spector. She just remembered about Batman, her fellow heroines and the villainess. She quickly flew out of the gallery back to main gallery hoping no college would be serious hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew this because she grew up in a kingdom filled with magical ice people and her father is the king.  Growing up she learned about the Viking and their culture and the Norse gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently a mission about eight months called her back home as Killer Frost tried to freeze all over Europe and turn the land into a snow lifeless arctic tundra. She and the justice league stopped Killer Frost. Tora, Batman and Fire fought Killer Frost while the rest of the league would stop the cooling of the continent.  Ice was the one who finished of the final blow to Killer Frost\u2019s head to knock her unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora then noticed that the artifact\u2019s in the galley started to glow and hover.  She back away to be in the middle of the gallery with her arms emitting an ice cold aura. Her battle instincts kicked as she got in a fighting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaiden of Ice, do not fear we mean no harm. \u201csaid an echoing voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are what are you? Show yourself!\u201d said Ice as she looked around the gallery trying to pinpoint the location of the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing artifacts emitted a bright light and there stood these ghostly forms dressed in Viking attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are the Norse gods and goddesses. \u201csaid one of the ghostly figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d asked Tora as she wonder she would incur their wraith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe people of your kingdom once worshiped us and a few still believe in us today.  We are here to thank you as the mortal known as Killer Frost tried to use ice powers of your people. She would have turned the continent into a frozen tundra and killed your people. That power was given to your people by us long ago. We are to thank you as the people who believe us keep us kinked to your world and we can see what goes on in the world today. \u201csaid another ghostly figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a thank you gift we would like you to give full access to your powers as your royal birth allows your powers to grow and evolve. The blood of the royal family is special as your ice powers are stronger and can grow stronger. \u201csaid another ghostly figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaiden of Ice, there is a bond that connects your being to another person. I suspect an older and more powerful being put the bond in place and our powers can\u2019t break that bond. \u201csaid another ghostly figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow go and return your duties. Your comrades need you. \u201csaid the ghostly figures in one voice and they disappeared in a bright flash. Tora stood in the dark museum gallery in shock and disbelief. She never heard her father talking about the origin of her people ice powers and that she just got an upgrade in the powers department. Shen remember what the gods told her and she ran out of the gallery to the main gallery to check up on her comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatriz was blasted into a dark gallery and when she shook of the dizziness from the blast she saw it was too dark to see.  She summand a green fire ball and sent it up a few feet in the air to give off some light. Beatriz saw that the artifacts in the gallery were all pre western contact artifacts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter becoming the heroine known as Fire she started to reach about her mother and her. She found out her mother sides of the family had ancestry from all over South America. She cut of her father after turning him over to the authorities after seeing that he was terrorist. She then focused on her mother family. She read about some of ancestors on her mother\u2019s side and learn some of the other cultures in South America besides her Brazilian heritage from her father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine months ago the Justice League and the Global Guardians went to South America after a new team of the Injustice league was spotted there. The Injustice league wanted set fire to the amazon rainforest after a plant was discovered and was reported to have many medical benefits. They wanted to set off the volcanos in in the Andes Mountains. The Justice League and the Global Guardians managed to stop most volcanos from erupting and stopping the Injustice League and capture some of the members. The capture members revealed that the drug cartel and some shady drug companies wanted the plant gone as it would have hurt their money income and wanted people to buy their drugs so the cartel and companies payed the Injustice members to get rid of the plant. Doctor Fate, Aquaman, and Red Tornado help stop the lava from spreading while Fire was chosen to absorb the massive wildfires started by the lava. Fire absorbed the fires and stop the flames from spreading, but was put was exhausted. She found out that absorbing the massive amount fire caused her power to change and her powers strengthen to new heights.  She left the Global Guardians and joined the Birds of Prey to help regain control and finesse over her powers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatriz wandered around the artifacts looking at them with great fascination as she found many interesting to look at.  She noticed a spark of light behind her and spun around and she jump into the air and set herself on fire. This caused a massive amount of light to illuminate the dark gallery.  She saw that many of the artifact started to hover and glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire raised her guard as she was surround by divine godly artifacts.  She then heard echoing voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoman of the green flames calm yourself we do not mean harm.\u201d said the echoing voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Show yourself! \u201ccalled out Fire as she increased the amounts of green flames around her body making the dark gallery fill with green light coming of her green flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of bright light appeared and soon Beatriz saw dozens of ghostly figures of beings dressed in ancient South American clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would like to thank you from stopping the fires from destroying the plant. The plant is sacred to us as various shamans use that plant\u2019s root to enter a trance that allows them to communicate with us. \u201csaid one of the ghostly figures who looked like warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem I am a superheroine it is my job to protect the defenseless and innocent. \u201csaid Fire as she was on her guard but not about to throw a large fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would like give you a gift. After you and your teammates put out the fires, the shamans entered in a trance and told us about your help. We noticed that part of your fire powers are magical in nature and so we decided to unlock your magical fire powers so that your fire powers affect anything that is supernatural.We also noticed that there is a bond that ties you to another mortal man. The bond is strong and our powers can't break that bond. We can tell you that the man has a good heart. \u201csaid one of the ghostly beings who looked like a king. All the ghostly beings\u2019 eyes started to briefly glow green as Fire felt a huge surge of power going through her. It felt warm, powerful, and energetic but also kind and loving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake care Woman of the green flames \u201csaid one of the ghostly beings as they all started to fade away and the gallery started to darken to only the light given off by Beatriz\u2019s flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to stop drinking a few glasses of wine before the mission. \u201csaid Fire as she stood there trying to understand what happen.  Fire then remember her fellow heroines and Batman and fly out of the gallery o find them and stop the villainess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She noticed that she was blasted into the gallery that hosted the artifacts from Egypt. Selina smirked and soon looked all over the collection and saw her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace of Bast saw on podium with a glass case. Selina was glad that the security system was disabled also no alarms and no motion detectors system. She quickly created a hole in the glass case with her diamond sharp gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to me my pretty kitty. \u201csaid Selina as she picked up the necklace. The necklace emitted a bright glow and she looked around saw nothing happen. She heard a woman giggling echoing around the gallery. Catwoman looked around trying to find whoever is cause that laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I have here? My children have spoken of you as you have helped some of them when they are threatened by humans. They have also said that you send money to shelters that help my children find homes. \u201csaid a voice as a beautiful Egyptian woman dressed like a goddess came out of the shadows and into the light coming off from the necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you \u201csaid Selina she looked at the woman trying to see if see is a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe necklace belongs to me, but the mortal and fellow gods call me Bast cat goddess of Egypt. \u201csaid the woman as she snapped her fingers and two large tigers popped out of thin air and started to brush against her like little kittens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou a cat goddess. Right. That trick is cute, but you just might be a superpower human with magic or illusion casting. \u201csaid Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally you don\u2019t believe, the heroine known as wonder woman has fought gods and help her patron deities.

She was on mission to steal a big cat\u2019s eye diamond. While trying to find a way to steal the diamond she found out that the person who owned the diamond was an infamous big game hunter. The hunter captured dozens of rare big cats. Catwoman ran into Batman who was also trying to capture the Hunter as he was a big crime boss in the criminal underworld. Working together, Selina freed all the big cats, and Bruce capture the crime boss and sent him away for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gift of gratitude for you is that you will that cats will help should you be in a situation that needs an assistance from a friendly feline. Now go and put my necklace down. I sense a person dear to your heart is in trouble. I can see that you and that individual will have a future together linked by the highest power.\u201d said Bast as stopped petted her tiger and they were on guard and glared at Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina knowing that she was at a disadvantage put down the necklace as she did not want to fight two large tigers and woman who may have superpowers. Selina swiftly left the gallery head to main gallery trying to get out from this failed heist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she looked around she saw that she was blasted in a very small gallery.  She then saw her prize, The Scepter Of Gaia. The scepter was encased in a glass container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that going to stop me.\u201d said Pamela as she snapped her fingers and several vines erupted from her costume and wrapped around the glass to tight that the glass broke.  She grabbed the beautiful wooden scepter with a huge green emerald. She could feel the power from the emerald increasing her power over plants. She could feel the winds blowing through the bamboo forests in China. The roots of trees growing in soil in the rain forests in Brazil. The feeling on the sunlight on the leaves in gardens throughout Europe. The animals walking over the grass in Africa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this scepter. I will finally take over the world and restore the natural ecosystem before humanity walked this planet. \u201csaid Pamela as she got a rush of power and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you. My scepter does not like being used by anyone, but me. \u201csaid a woman\u2019s voicing coming from behind her. <br>\r\nPoison Ivy turned around and saw a young beautiful woman wearing a green robe with floral and animal patterns.  Pamela snapped her fingers and vines tried to attack the unknown woman only to stop around the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for summoning some of my children. \u201csaid the woman as she patted the vines and they moved in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Poison Ivy as she tried to think of a meta human who had control over plants, but came to mind about a woman wearing a green robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go by many names in history. So many cultures have given me a name. The Norse called Jord. The Celtics called me Danu. The Romans called me Terra. Today the mortals call me Mother Nature. \u201csaid the woman who looked at Pamela with a stare that looked into Poison Ivy\u2019s core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see it in your soul that while you commit many crimes against humanity, you have also helped humanity. While your action cost many people there lives, your actions also help people who are lost. The orphans and homeless people you took in when you ruled over Robinson Park. The children found nice loving homes and have a bright future and the homeless people found jobs, homes and other caring family members. \u201csaid the woman as she cared for the vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. If you are Mother Nature, then why do let humans pollute nature and kill off animals? \u201csaid Poison Ivy angrily at humanity who kill innocent plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans, plants, and animals are my children. Humanity is young and they need a person to plant the seeds of change towards a greener future. I feeling that you could be that person to ignite the spark that would cause people to make more environmentally future. \u201csaid Mother Nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know the children and homeless? Why do you care anyway? Your job sounds for a hero then me.\u201d said Poison Ivy as she was not impressed as she felt like an outcast among humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know of the children and the homeless as one of my powers is see the future of all humans. The people you rescued will help spread the word of people being more green. The plants also speak of you and I have heard the whispers from The Green. You could be my agent as The Green, The Red, The Rot, The Clear, and more fall under my domain. Beside your friend Harley cares and Selina also. Even your enemy Batman care for you as he respects you and can see the good in you. He also has helped you several times and you helped him. Said Mother Nature as she summoned a chair made of vines to sit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy felt some desire to stop being a villainess as she frown tired from running from the law and she gave up the homeless and orphans to the police in Robinson Park as she experienced that the people need more help then Pamela could offer.  She also felt some joy from helping innocent people like when she developed a cure against a form of scare toxins that Scarecrow unleashed on Earth Day. Scarecrow wanted to cause chaos on that day as Gotham Botanical gardens hosted a rare plant that could neutralize the normal scare toxins that Scarecrow uses. Poison Ivy did not want Scarecrow to kill the plant so she teamed up with Batman to defeat Scarecrow. She also liked when she Catwoman and Harley Quinn formed the team The Gotham Sirens. They did clean up some crime when they were involved.  A voice inside of her told her that she has more friends then she realizes. While another part of her told her that her past marks her and many people will leave her when she shows her true self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt not like I can become a hero, the public will not forget I have blood on my hands and there are a lot of humans who have disrespect for nature.  I am also connected to the plants I can feel their pain. I can\u2019t be good like Harley or Selina. I have green skin and my skin is toxic. I also look down on men and see how humans cause a lot of environmental damage. \u201csaid Pamela as she had very few connections to the human world and she felt that she could not give up the love for her plant children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to give a gift. Your connection to the plant world is strong but unstable. My gift for you is that because you man have help the environment, but your methods are bit violent, but the results have caused many mortals to talk about the environment and many have taken action to help the planet like replanting trees, building and investing money in clean renewable energies. Helping animals that are endangered to have a stable population\u201d Said Mother Nature as she petted the vines in the chair she sat in and voices numerous ways humans are helping the planet recover from humanity\u2019s reckless behavior in the past<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gift will enhance your powers. Your connection to the plants will stronger and you will even get to communicate and control plants that are not from this planet. Your presence alone will cause growth in plants surrounding you. You can cause a vast forest to grow in mere seconds from a barren wasteland or cause plants to mutate into monsters. Your toxins and pheromones will be stronger and you will hear the true voice of nature. Should you practice and train with your stronger power you may surpass that abilities of Swamp Thing \u201csaid Mother Nature as snapped her fingers and Poison Ivy gave off a briefly green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoison Ivy closed her eyes and felt the rush of power and felt her powers growing stronger. She stood in thought about what just happened. As a scientist she knew there were no such thing as gods and magic, but in the past she has encountered various supernatural beings. She looked around and just ask a question, but she didn\u2019t see Mother Nature. A small voice insider her mind told her that this was all just a dream, but another told to leave and return to her lair to think about what just happened as her current location is not the best place to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the specter and felt the power coming from the it was gone. To her it was nothing more than a pretty stick. She dropped the scepter and planned to go back to her lair and practice her new powers. She ran to the main gallery as it was the only path to the women bathroom and escape the way she came in. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peyton regained her balance and shook off her dizziness from the blast. She cursed the Clown Princess, Harley Quinn. She looked around and saw she was in one of the smaller galleries. The gallery housed ancient divine artifacts that belongs to ancient cultures that historians know very little about.  So far historians and archeologists only recovered some myths and little records about the long lost cultures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeyton looked around and inspected each artifact until she saw what she came for. The diadem of the mad queen. The glass case contained a jewel encrusted tiara with strange symbols on it. Archaeologists hound the diadem in an ancient tomb and with histories they managed to find some information behind it. The legend is that an ancient kingdom was strike by war and the king was killed. The queen leads the kingdom and soon grief caused her to her voices in her head. A traveling mystic heard the problem and give the queen a diadem and soon the voices went away, but then the queen went mad with power and lead her country against her enemies and caused the destruction her kingdom and diadem was lost until rediscovered in the tomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeyton looked at the diadem and took out a glass cutter and cut a hole in the glass and took the diadem and it sparkled in the moonlight from the overhead window.  <br>\r\nPeyton looked at the diadem in her hand and thought about how she got in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeyton grew up a mafia family and later was forced into a loveless abusive marriage. Her husband turned on her and her family leaving her a survivor of her mob family massacre. She later went insane and tried to kill her husband and was manipulated by the villain Hush. She wanted to get away from her past and knew the diadem would silence the voices from the puppet Scarface. Off all the people she met she noted that Bruce did care about her and tried to steer her away from life of being in the underworld. She was not well and tried to kill him. She hopes not one day that Bruce will forgive her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diadem suddenly emitted a bright flash of light. Peyton closed her eyes and when she opened her eyes nothing happened. She quickly put the diadem away and went to the entrance of the gallery as she remembered that with Zatanna here she knew she would cast a spell over other exits like windows, fire escapes and she knew that only way she could leave is the same way she came in. She was just about to exit the gallery when an echoing giggling was heard throughout the gallery. Peyton turned around and looked around to make sure that nobody saw her seal the diadem and find the origin of the giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou found me little diadem. I was looking for it. I remembered that one day it just disappeared and I had to look into the mortal realm and found some clues as some mortal queen wore it and then trail ends. Now It has been found again. \u201csaid a female voice. Peyton looked around and searched for the origin of the voice and saw a young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had long curly red hair, pale skin, eyes that seemed to stare off into space, like as if she was daydreaming. She wore a black knee length dress. She seemed to give off a feeling of delirium or not all being there.  The women then started to babble on how a platypus who is a secret agent. Peyton started walking to the exit, but she paused to remember the exact way out. She felt a tap on her shoulders and turned around and saw the women<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have diadem back, if I don\u2019t get it back my siblings will get mad and I don\u2019t want the get my older brother, Dream, upset at me.\u201d Said the women who looked at Peyton and then looked away as she was bewitched by the sparkles caused by the moonlight hitting the various gems in the display cases in the gallery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeyton thought about as a part of her is telling her that some tiara is not going to get rid of the voice in her head. Another part of her is telling to find a metahuman who has telepathy to heal her fractured mind. Peyton also thought how that she would hand off the stolen item and that she would not be chased by the cops or other heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere take the diadem. It would not do me any good. The legends surrounding it are just legends.\u201d said Peyton as she handed the strange women. She then turned around and walked to the exit as she knew this museum is not a got place to spend time foolishly as their villainess and superheroine and Batman. She was just to leave the gallery when she bumped into something that caused her to fall to the ground. She got herself up and dusted herself off. She looked to caused what caused her and saw the strange women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor helping find and giving me my jewelry I give a gift. This whisper in your mind will begone and your mind will be whole again and you will regain your lost skills. You are connected to a person who will love you and care for you, but beware trust will be hard to earn. \u201csaid the women as she blew some powder dust into Peyton. Peyton started to cough and close her eyes as they started to water. When she opened her eyes after saw that women disappeared. She looked around and still couldn\u2019t see the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her mind was nagging her just to forget about that strange women and leave before you get caught and be sent to Arkham Asylum. Peyton agreed and left the gallery went to the main gallery to exit the museum.  \u201cBesides you can figure the mystery women tomorrow when you have a good night\u2019s rest. \u201cshe said to herself as she exited the gallery towards her destination <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Andrea Beaumont regained her bearing and knocked off the dizziness from the blast from Harley Quin\u2019s explosion. She knew that the clown girl would mess up this heist. It was supposed to be a simple job to break in the museum and steal an artifact and return it to Russia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was retired and left Gotham after Batman stopped her from killing the Joker who killed her father. She thought she was done with Bruce and Batman, but a tiny spark inside her heart reignited the flames of love and passion. She fled to Europe and reached her mother side of the family and she found that her mother was from Russia and was very smart. She later found that her grandmother came from a long line of women who operated as medicine women in a tiny remote village. While her grandfather came from old Russian royalty and hid away his family wealth. She also found out that there was a family artifact that was stolen from her family. Her research came up that one her ancestors was medicine women and was entrust with an artifact that was said to have great power. She tracked the artifact to Gotham and it caused her some uneasiness about running into her old flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea looked around and saw that she was in the gallery that contain the artifacts from the Slavic pantheon. She noticed banners and so many artifacts in glass containers. Andrea knew that the security system was down as she knew that Catwoman always disables the security when she goes on a heist.  She looked around in the dark gallery only letting the moonlight coming through the windows giving her light to see.   She finally found her target a gem encrusted necklace. Looking at it alone it would worth millions, but it is billions. Her reached showed her that the ancients gods and goddess blessing the necklace with divine powers and it said to grant the wearer great wealth, power, and influence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea reached into her belt and pulled out a container of a chemical. She opened the contained poured the container to the glass and saw that glass dissolved away. She reached into the contained and grabbed the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally what has been stolen from my family will know return to its rightfully owner. \u201csaid Andrea. As she grabbed the necklace. From what her reports were after the necklace was stolen from her family they started to lose their high standing and wealth, only when her great-great grandfather locked away the remaining family wealth did they started to recover.  The family decide to try to leave Russia and go to America to escaped the bad memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho do dare hold our necklace?\u201d came a choir of voices echoing around the dark, empty, silent gallery.  Andrea looked up thinking that somebody must have sneak up on her. She looked around the gallery and saw nobody. She put away the necklace in a bag and went to the entrance of the gallery to go back the way she entered the museum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to leave the gallery when a small ball of light appeared and blocked her from leaving the gallery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where do you think you are going? \u2018said a voice. Andrea looked around and tried to pinpoint the location of the voice. She realized that the voice came from the ball of light.  The ball approached her and Andrea walked back on her guard.  Soon she was in the middle of the gallery. The ball of light suddenly shot out dozens of smaller balls of lights that floated around the gallery. The balls of light quickly morphed into ghostly like beings. Form their clothes they wore, Andrea noted that it was ancient and are dressed in the style of clothing that the early Slavs. She read about the exhibits and knew of the curse of the treasures of the gods and how these not worthy suffered wraith of the gods, but she dismissed them as superstition and fairytales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplain why do you have our blessed artifact? \u201csaid one of the ghostly figures as the necklace popped out of thin air into view where it as it floated in the air.  The figure appeared male<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMany have stolen our trinket and they suffered our divine wraith. You would be just another person on our list of those who have stolen something that does not belong to you. \u201csaid one of the ghostly beings in a feminine voice as Andrea noticed it came from a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook closely at her! Do you not see her aura it is faint, but it is there? She shares the same blood as the one who we trusted our artifact to. She may be a descendant of her, our head priestess. \u201csaid one of the ghostly beings who stared at her. Andrea felt uneasy as the male ghostly being started at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right, there it is. Our chosen bloodline has returned. The question is what shall she do with our divine artifact? Will she take it and keep it or has the chosen family cast off our pact and will fall from the grace of society? \u201csaid one of the ghostly being who appeared as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would best to observe what the young woman will do with the artifact. \u201csaid one of the ghostly figures softly so that Andrea would not hear that statement.  The other gods agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will be watching! \u201csaid one of the ghostly beings as he and the rest of ghostly beings vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea shock her head as she did not believe in magic and supernatural gods. To her running into her old flame must have caused some mental unbalance as she remembered that she felt uneasiness seeing Bruce as Batman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook off her thoughts and told her self to think about Bruce at a safe location. She ran out of the gallery toward the main gallery as that was the only exit. She knew that batman would have the other exits blocked and hopefully the other villainess would be a great distraction for her to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harley was blasted into a small closet. She got and said \u201cNow that was a blast! If only Mister J were to see it.\u201d She dusted herself off and noticed that she was thrown into a janitor closet as she saw several brooms, mops and other cleaning and maintenance equipment.  She looked around and noticed that she was in a small hallway. She was just about to leave when she slipped a small soapy puddle. She didn\u2019t realize that she fell behind some boxes blocking her from the exit of the janitor closet. She let out small groan and see a flash of red, blue and gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what is the rush?\u201d Harley muttered as she thought who could that be. She knew that it could not be any villainess or Batman as all of them didn\u2019t not wear any gold. Zatanna is in all black and same with Black Canary. She then realized that those color match Wonder Woman costume colors. Harley knew that she did not win against her in a fight and so she knew to run towards the direction that Wonder Woman fled from. Harley then ran down the hallway which led in a large gallery filled with ancient Greek artifacts. The clown girl started to walk around and look for her item of interest among the priceless artifacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley looked around until she saw a theater mask with a smile encased in a glass container. She jumped with joy and inwardly scream with the joy. \u201cThe Mask of Thalia \u201cshe whispered with barely concealed glee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a fake clown flower and squeezed it. The flower squirted out a stream of acid and it melted the glass container. She then tossed the used flower gag toy away and reach in and picked the mask. Only for it to emitted bright flash of light for a second and then it stopped flashing. Harley almost dropped the mask when she noticed the flash. Harley looked around and saw nothing changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this nobody can stop from busting out pudding from that awful jail.\u201d Said Harley as she jumped with joy.  Thinking about how she will rescue the Joker and he will treat her like a queen and love her and may even propose to her. She put the mask in a hidden pocket in her uniform and started to walk towards the exit gallery. She heard a cough and she turned around and saw a woman right in front on the form glass container which held the form mask of Thalia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had Mediterranean skin color and olive black hair. She wore a toga in the ancient style. She had a curious look on her face as she walked towards to clown princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreeze! Get your hands off my mask \u201csaid the unknown women to Harley Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mask? Finders Keepers Losers weepers.\u201d Said Harley as she stuck out her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is my mask and beside what use would you have for it?\u201d asked the unknown woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all who are you?\u201d said Harley as she didn\u2019t know if she could trust this woman. She got an uncomfortable about her. She felt danger and that is woman is very likely a metahuman with unknown powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy name is Thalia the muse of comedy and you are? \u201csaid the woman as she introduced yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley Quinn Clown Princess of Crime and so to be wife of the Joker. As soon as use this mask and I can get him out of Arkham Asylum and he may even propose to me.\u201d said Harley is a dreamily voice who mind was entertained by vision of marriage to her beloved pudding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Joker. I have heard of him and his relationship with you. The whispers and rumors of the criminal underworld have told me many tidbits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am surprised you are so loyal to him and love him. I have heard gossip of what Joker did to you. \u201csaid Thalia as she questioned Harley\u2019s relationship to the Joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe criminal underworld pities you, Harley. The whispers of you getting strapped to a rocket after the Joker realized that you were holding him back, you getting thrown from a window when you captured the hero known as Batman while the Joker didn\u2019t allow it, how you stole a lot of money and used it to build a new hideout for your lover, only for him to throw you out on the street. \u201csaid Thalia as she summoned up images about the joker\u2019s lack of respect and love to Harley.<br>\r\nHarley stood there with tears in her eyes. \u201cYou wrong he loves me, he told me that I am his most trusted friend. We told each on how we would grow old together and have kids and send them to college and have the good life together. \u201csaid the weeping blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is the case, how is that when thieves Punch and Jewelee came out of retirement, Punch did not survive a simple robbery. The rumor is that the Joker set him up as Jewelee would a nice replacement for you if Joker gets tired of your presence. Joker even made their child disappear and hired some telepath to wipe the memory from Jewelee\u2019s mind of her husband and child. \u201csaid Thalia as the images change to a scene of joker laughing and telling his dumb henchmen of his plan to get another loyal recruit and how he set up Punch\u2019s future robbery on for the items punch stole to be high level explosives to of when he stole the objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet us not forget the fact that when you busked out of Arkham asylum multiple times it was the Joker who was still imprisoned that rated you out to the authorities to gain some leniency. \u201csaid Thalia as the images changed to Joker telling the cops where to find Harley Quinn at her usual hangout when she recently busted out from Arkham Asylum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook sweetie. I am all about comedy, laughter, and mirth, but the way that Joker treats you is just sad and filled with sorrows. Many criminals are making a betting pool to see how long you last under the Joker\u2019s servitude.  Hate to say it to you, but the Joker only loves himself and cares about himself. Everybody is just a useful tool or puppet and he has got you under his control like a willing servant. If your lucky somebody might write a book about your sad, abusive life and expose the tangled relationship that you and the Joker have. \u201csaid Thalia as she changed the images to all the times where Joker just fooled her and used her. She then disappeared in the shadows of the dark museum gallery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley stood there with tears coming down her checks and the thoughts of how she just dismissed the way that the Joker treated her in the past as a product of his quirky personality. A part of her told her that these were just lies and that this woman wanted the Joker for herself. While another part of her told that this was the truth and that she became a willing pawn that the Joker will get rid of once she ends her usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley get rid of her thoughts and just wanted to return to her current hideout and get under the covers and deal with her new thoughts of doubt. She dropped the mask and ran to the exit in the main gallery as she knew Batman and the other heroes got the other exits covered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got up and told herself to hurt the crazy clown princess and that the league of assassins will not do any business with the Joker or any of his gang and perhaps eliminate some of their gang members should their paths cross<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia looked around the gallery and was alert as there are many shadows, anything could come out and try to attack her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and notice that the gallery she was blasted into held ancient middle eastern artifacts. She knew as she grew up learning and find artifacts for herself or for her father.  Her father taught her about the cultures of the middle east and the old religions as the Lazarus pits are consider as old as the old religions. He found old scrolls that mention the pits and how ancient holy men and women would use them to contact their gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia walk around the gallery on guard. She knew that it would best to grab an artifact in this gallery then the others as the other may be occupied by heroes or other villains. She did not want a confrontation with other heroines or villainess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon felt a pull and turned towards the direction it was coming from. She walked among the artifacts until she reaches an old crown covered win ancient symbols. Talia looked at the crown and noticed that the plaque on the case describes it as the head piece of the high priestess to the gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly removed the glass contain the ancient headdress without making a sound. She could break in to some of the top-level security buildings due to her assassin training. She grabbed the headdress as a symbol of her skill. She needed the headdress to show that she could lead the league of assassin if her father was unable to lead them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headdress started to quickly glow and suddenly emitted a bright golden light. Talia closed her eyes to shielded her from the bright light. She opened her eyes and saw these ghostly like beings surround her and cutting herself of any exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia looked at the ghostly beings and recognized some form from old statues are artwork which depicted gods of the ancient middle eastern cultures. Her father took her as a child to show the temples and relics of old lost civilizations to make a statement on how humans cannot be united and will always fight with each other. Her father used that teaching moment to further explain why the league of assassins need to get rid of humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe woman has the smell of the demon priest doe she not\u2019 said one of the ghostly being in feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she carries the scent of the demon priest who helped repeal invaders who wanted use the holy pits as their own.\u201d responded another ghostly being in a masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, the demon head priest did help us, but he also did us a great did steal some of our sacred artifacts, I vote we give her a blessing, but it will only help to her and her bloodline.\u201d said of the ghostly figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ghostly figures murmured and agreed. They started to chant in ancient language and soon lights started to appear around Talia. The lights started to shine brighter get brighter until Talia closed her eyes due to the sheer luminosity. She felt a strong pulse and opened her eyes and noticed that the lights and ghostly figures were gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia knew something she just experienced was supernatural and decided to escape as it was not the best of times to slow down and think f what just happened. She headed toward the entrance she as she knew it was the best way to leave as the other villainess and heroines would have blocked other exits.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Selina arrived first flowed Harley, Poison Ivy, Talia, Andrea, and lastly joined by Peyton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot out of my way! \u201csnarled Catwoman as she readied her whip. She was eager to leave before the heroes arrive and knew villains tend to fight then they meet with each other during heists.  Each villainess got out her weapon, from Poison Ivy\u2019s vines to Harley\u2019s Hammer to Talia\u2019s sword.  The scene looked like something out of an old western movie.  Selina was about to act only to notice a flash of light in one of the shadows. She jumped backed noticed that Talia also jumped out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women heard the shout of \u201cPeels.\u201d They saw Zatanna come out of the nearby shadows followed by the other women superheroes.  Harley, Ivy, Peyton, and Andrea were engulfed with a small cloud of sleeping powders. The villainesses soon got sleep and dropped to the floor. Wonder Woman tossed her lasso and tied up the sleeping villains while Black Canary got into a fighting position against Catwoman and Talia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman being the diplomatic one step in between the two parties and said.\u201d Stand down both of you. We need to find Batman. I would imagine he would like to drop off these four at Arkham.\u201d Wonder Woman hoped that both parties would stop from fighting as a fight can cause unnecessary damage to the museum and may damage some of the artifacts in the nearby galleries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll women heard a slight groan and turned to see Batman followed by Doctor Light.  Batman head his head still a little sore from his thrown from the blast and he woke up from Doctor Light helping him regain consciousness and that her medical training helped him inspect to see if Bruce got a concussion.  Her inspection revel nothing more than some slight dizziness, she knew that Batman\u2019s mental training would help shake it off in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina and Talia both knew that picking fights with Batman and six other heroes would result in a very low chance of them winning and felling is not an option so both decide to stick around until Zatanna get rid of the magic blocking all the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you, all right? \u201casked Zatanna as she readied her magic to all injuries to Batman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, nothing more than some dizziness that should wear off In a few minutes.\u201d Said Batman as he saw the villainess tied up and still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we drop these women of at Arkham? \u201casked Wonder Woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I have cells at the Batcave for these ones. Arkham was destroyed by Joker after some of the other villains doubted that he could blow it up. Joker accepted the challenge and blow up Arkham with exploding bubblegum balls. Since then other inmates at Arkham have been sent to Belle Reve, Blackgate Penitentiary, and Iron Heights Penitentiary. Arkham is being rebuilt but, it is a slow progress. The staff and inmates from Arkham have been sent to work in other holding facilities or are in the hospital being treated for injuries from the explosion. \u201csaid Batman as got out handcuffs and tied up each villainess except for Andrea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman looked at the sleeping woman and then at Zatanna who nodded and snapped her fingers. The sleeping woman woke up and get up from the ground and stretch a bit before looking around at her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea what are you doing back in Gotham? I have heard that you went clean, so why have you decided to come back.\u201d questioned Batman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did leave Gotham, but I later found out that there is an artifact the belonged to my family that was stolen and I wanted it to be in its rightful. Also, I wanted to visit my parent\u2019s graves and see you again. You are one of the very few people I trust. \u201csaid Andrea honesty as she hoped she and Bruce would rekindle their love for each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both Bruce and Andrea talked each other, woman glared as each woman was trying to win Bruce\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman nodded and then turned to the other woman and spoke \u201cI will take these to the Batcave and I have some interesting information for each of you. I trust that you would meet me in the Batcave later. Zatanna could you reverse any damage to the museum. I need get these ladies in the containment cells in the Batcave. Said Batman as he picked up the sleeping women and walked towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZatanna summoned up her magic and focus her magic to reverse and evidence that there a fight at all. Her eyes then glowed for a few seconds while she got rid of the magical barriers around the museum. She then asked if it is all right to teleport the other heroines to the Batcave and each woman nodded back to her. Zatanna teleported herself and the other heroines to Wayne Manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman turned and tilted his head to Selina and Talia who both walked with him to the Batmobile.  He pushed a button in his utility belt and out popped three seats to contain villainess Batman captured when he would drop them off at Arkham or police stations. He then strapped in Harley, Ivy, and Peyton who were still sleeping. He then bushed the same button and the seats went back into the Batmobile. He active the cockpit and it popped open. There were three seats. Batman got in the driver and Talia and Selina got in the two backseats.  Bruce then started the car and drove towards the Batcave weaving through the late-night traffic and after twenty minutes he drove into the Batcave. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pressed the button and the out popped the seats containing the sleeping villainess. Wonder Woman asked him Bruce\u2019s needs any help, but he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then unstrapped and carried each to their cells down in one of the many tunnels of the Batcave.  Harley\u2019s cell contained a bed, toilet, sink and desk.  And bullet proof glass doors that were several feet thick. Bruce kept anything out of the cell that could be used as a weapon or to escape with. He then put Ivy in her cell. Her cell contained the same things as Harley on with a small water fountain a few plants enchanted by Doctor Fate and the Swamp Thing to prevent her from growing the plants escape. He also asked Doctor Fate mages to use magic to prevent Ivy from contacting the green to help her escape from her cell. Her cell also had bullet proof cell doors that were seal to keep out her pheromones and were several feet thick. Finally, he put Peyton in her cell which contained the same things as Harley and the same features for the bullet proof doors. Finally, is that each cell has a small television set and Peyton and Ivy has a small radio as Bruce found notes from the Arkham staff that music and sooth them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked back to the waiting women and led to the main computer only to hear voice arguing with each other. They hear several male and female voices talking fast with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrayson let me out of your grasp.  I\u2019m giving three seconds until I get out of it on my own. \u201csaid a younger male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle D you didn\u2019t your daily hug today. \u201csaid and older male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRed Hood can\u2019t you do anything about those two?\u201d asked another male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo replacement, I like how they distract you from your work. \u201cresponded another older male voice full of mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOracle, should we do anything about the fighting and yelling? \u201casked another older male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Batwing, just calm down and watching the fighting. They will stop soon enough. Join me and Black Bat as we munch on popcorn.  \u201csaid a female voice with evidence that she just finished puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo they always fight with each other?\u201d asked a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much, they do when Batman is not around or Alfred scolds them. \u201csaid another male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur boss is here, and he brought guests.\u201d said an older female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women followed Bruce as she headed towards the Batcomputer and saw several of Batman\u2019s sidekicks and former ones.  There was Oracle, Black Bat, Spoiler, Red Hood and Red Robin, Flamebird, Batwing, Nightwing, and Robin all crammed around the Batcomputer.  Dick sat in the chair in front of the Batcomputer hugging Damian only for Damian trying to get out his grasp and hitting Dick with Dick\u2019s escrima sticks.  Jason watched with mirth as he knew that it annoyed Tim. Barbara and Tim were working two laptops trying to tune out the small fight. Cassandra and Stephaine were munching on popcorn watch the little show while Duke and Luke looked a bit bored after watching the Robins. Bette looked at them with a puzzled expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman cleared this throat and everybody in the Batfamily stopped what there were doing and turned to Bruce and gave him their acknowledgement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother\u201d Damian greeted his mother with reserved voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon.\u201d Talia responded and went up to her son and gave him a small hug and kiss on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is the info that us to look through. This info is going to cause a lot of people a headache. \u201csaid Barbara as she wheeled her nice antigravity wheelchair. Batman created Barbara a nice wheel where with some alien technology in to after her old wheelchair was destroyed in an attack on Gotham by the Joker.  The new wheel chair looks normal but and multiple new feature and on is antigravity to help her negative over rough terrain. The chair know can levitate several inches to feet over any terrain.  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make any progress on the last case, there are no connections we could find. \u201cadded Red Robin as he looked a bit of disappointed that he could not make any progress in the case he handed Bruce a large pile of folders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman then handed each woman, except Andrea, a file and asked to look through them. Bruce then saw the clock on the Batcompter and noticed that it was well past midnight. He ordered his current and former sidekicks to get rid for bed and get some sleep. He told them to go towards their rooms in Wayne Manor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTora yawned and then other woman started to yawn. Bruce noticed them and told them they can stay overnight at the manor if they don\u2019t cause any problems with each other. All women had a truce not to have any conflict and Bruce summoned Alfred who came down the elevator. Alfred nodded and lead the women into the elevator and towards their rooms. Batman felt exhaustion hit him. He out of the Batsuit and waited for the elevator and went in and got off in the manor. He went towards his room and took quick showered and dressed for bed.

He noticed it was morning and got out of bed and took a short shower fully awaking himself and dressed in black pants and black turtle neck. He left his large bedroom and headed towards the dining room for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard loud voices coming from the dining room and smelled the scent of fresh cooked breakfast dishes. He walked into the dinning room see his sons and members of the Batfamily have breakfast or talk to each other. He also saw the women who were also having breakfast and reading the files that the gave them last night in the Batcave. All of them were out of their costume in normal attire. Bruce would often have female company both in the crime fighting business and non-hero business. He would have clothes available for women who stayed overnight if they were active the hero community. All the women blushed a bit seeing such a handsome man. Bruce Wayne by looks would put even male supermodels to shame. There were rumors that that his looks could rival that of gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over and sat down at the head of the table. He saw that his plate is over filled with breakfast meats, hash browns, pancakes, waffles, eggs, and toast with a huge cup of coffee.  He starts to chow down on his breakfast. It is well known in Batfamily for Bruce to eat multiple high calorie meals as he often engages in combat with Gotham\u2019s scums or works to solve cases that the normal police that solve or handle.  He would often be down in the Batcave for days with no contact with the outside worlds trying to solve for clues or leads for the safety of Gotham or other superheroes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saw the Lucas Fox got up from his place at the table and thanked Bruce for breakfast and for letting him stay overnight. He also told him that his father says another shipment of crime fighting supplies just came in and would like to Bruce to come by and test them out.  He then motioned Duke to come join him as both went to have light training session with Lady Shiva and Richard Dragon. Bruce bribed Lady Shiva to teach and improve his sidekicks training abilities by granting her time with her daughter <br>\r\nCassandra. For Richard, Bruce gave him the location of a base of rouge assassins who split off from the League of assassins who tried do eliminate Richard. They failed and got Richard angry who wanted revenge on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saw Stephanie and Cassandra got up and told him that they were going shopping and later going enjoy relaxing the Manor\u2019s pool.

Damian got up and told his father that he going to go training out in the back yard with Tim and Dick as watchers. He bid his father a nod and went up to his mother for a hug and left and with a joyful Dick and weeping Tim. Jason got up and told his adapted father that he would be in the garage working on his motorcycle. Finally, Bette got up and thanked Bruce for letting her stay overnight and for breakfast. She told Bruce that she need to get back to Batwoman and don\u2019t forget that both Bruce and Kathrine need to be at the charity dinner next Friday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that your manor is larger than before, I heard that the manor and Gotham was heavily damaged by the powerful earthquake several years ago. \u201csaid Diana as she finished her breakfast of vegetarian omelet and reading the files that Bruce gave her last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes well, the manor was damage and I had it expanded with several additions put in that my mother wanted to add before that dark night. \u201csaid Bruce as he stilled ate at his mountain pile of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruce, have you made any progress on a cure from the fertility gas bomb. \u201casked Zatanna as she finished her buttered toast and her eggs and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe referred to a mad scientist fearing that overpopulation would destroy the planet and led to wars and destruction. The scientist created a formula that would reduce fertility in humans and unleashed in the sky and oceans. He was defeated and captured by the Justice league, but the formula was effective. Men and women all over the world were tested and result were that it they had low fertility. Scientists were happy the human population was large, but they had no way to restore fertility in humans, scientists suggest that over generations the gas\u2019s effect would slow disappear or weaken.  The world leaders called on the smartest people to find a way to restore humans before the gas bomb. Through science and magic no one or group of heroes and villains could reverse the bomb\u2019s effect.  Since that announcements, countries allowed for people to have polyamory marriages as it turned out less than five percent of the humans on the planet had very high fertility rates then the rest of humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I have not, I found no notes on the formulas and some of the notes were complete burned to ash. His computers were wiped so no hacker could restore information that were his computers. Telepaths could find no memory or knowledge of the formula in the scientist minds. The telepaths said that the mind of the scientist became void of thoughts or memories. \u201csaid Bruce as he finished a third of meal, his stomach started round out a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce had himself and the entire Batfamily tested. He found out that himself and the Batfamily had higher rates of fertility then the rest. The paparazzi found out Bruce\u2019s high fertility and caused multiple women to ask him to marry them. With his power, wealth, influential, and high fertility, women have been trying to find a way to marry themselves to Gotham\u2019s most eligible bachelor. Him and others with higher rates of fertility have been call the five percent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you read overs the files I gave you last night? \u201casked Bruce as resumed eat his meal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile in the Batcave, the containment cells of Ivy, Harley, and Peyton were active. Harley got angry and was yelling and demanding from someone to release her. Ivy tried to relax with the plants in her cell and the small water feature. Her radio had the soothing sound of the rainforest. Peyton was watching her T.V. to tune out the yelling of Harley. She noticed that there nobody else in cave tunnel consisting of the cells. She noticed movement in the shadows and saw Nightwing emerge from the darkness. She caught loudly and that alerted the other two villainess to stop what they\u2019re doing and be aware of Nightwing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast ladies. Hope you enjoy it \u201csaid Nightwing as he came up to a wall and pushed a button. A hole at the top of each cell opened and out fell a meal for each villainess. Peyton got a stack of pancakes with a side of bacon with fruit and some coffee. Ivy got a vegetarian egg scramble with tofu and an organic apple with a large cup of water. Harley got a stack of waffles with a side of sausage and coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we? The does not seem to be any jailhouse known to house Gotham\u2019s villains. \u201csaid Peyton as she sipped on her coffee Ivy watched silently while Harley dug into her food with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right as this a special jailcell to contain you three. Batman designed it to contain you three as there are very few places that contain you three. Ivy with her powers, Harley with her manipulation, and you Peyton with your seduction. \u201csaid Nightwing as he stepped back and started to walk into the shadows. He stopped and turned around and said. \u201cEnjoy your time here and with each other, you could have been in Arkham, if the Joker had not destroyed it and rumors are that some government officials want to villains to be a special task group to for the government doing its dirty work. They put small bombs in the heads of villains and if they step out offline then the bomb goes off. I heard Killer Croc was drafted and he has to work for the government or it off with his head.\u201d Nightwing smirked and walked into the shadow only to be swallowed up the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, its Joker\u2019s fault. It is always Joker\u2019s fault when villains must pay for his crimes. We could have been in Arkham, instead of going to other jailhouse that can contain villains and metahumans. \u201cPeyton murmured in a low voice as she has heard stories of what goes on in the jailhouse that house villains. Beatings, abuse and other horrors as many of the prison guards look the way if a villain is beaten by the guards. Arkham has at least staff that are watched closely to make sure that they don\u2019t abuse their position or power against a patient in Arkham.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey take that back. Pudding was just trying to maintain his position as the most unpredictable villain in Gotham. \u201csaid Harley trying to defend her love. Nobody understood their love that was special to them. There were just jealous that they did not have a special person in their life so they tried to destroy Harley and Joker\u2019s relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley why do you even defend him. He abuses you, multiple times. Leave him before you lose your life to that crazy clown. You are just a tool and loyal to him. Once lose your usefulness if is going to get rid of you. \u201csaid Ivy from her cell. While Catwoman and Harley are close friends to Ivy. Ivy and Catwoman have both grown tired and annoyed at Harley\u2019 romantic love for the Joker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You\u2019re wrong. He loves me and is going to free me ounce he formulates a plan to free from Batman. \u201csaid Harley in a believing voice. Harley\u2019s eyes started to water after the hurtful accusation that Ivy said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley! He threw you out a window several stories high. He strapped you to a rocket and when he told you that you are a distraction to his goals. When you are in Arkham he hired a replacement for your position. You\u2019re a tool and loyal one at that. When you lose your usefulness, he will get rid of you. I heard through the grapevine that the other villains are getting tired of his crimes as it often hurts other villains plans or get the Batman on their trail. They want to hunt down the clown and end his annoying crimes for good. \u201csaid Ivy as she heard rumors the villains in Gotham want to eliminate the clown prince of crime. She also remembers all the Harley told her the awful things that Joker has done to her during their girl bonding times. Both were drunk, but Ivy remember it all as alcohol does not impact as much as a regular human due to her powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley, your obsession blinds you towards the harsh reality of Joker\u2019s use of you.\u201d said Ivy know that the cold harsh facts could break Haley\u2019s relationship with the Joker. Harley went and curled up in a ball on the bed and tried to think about all the time she and the Joker expressed their love. Ivy felt a bit sad after seeing Harley, but she knew it was the right things to say to her. Ivy went back to eating her food and interact with the plants. The plants were raised perfectly and Ivy\u2019s option on whoever raised them skyrocketed. Her view of being locked up in another cell is better than being at Arkham as it full of vile people who try to flirt with her or don\u2019t care about her plants. In Arkham she would be watched when she would be allowed to interact with the plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Harley is loyal to the Joker is beyond me. \u201csaid Peyton as she started to eat her breakfast. The food was very good as it was better then what Peyton as most of the time. she would often eat meals prepared by some of the best cooks in the world, due to her wealth she could afford to pay them. She shortly finished eating her meal and turned on the T.V. to watch some movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alfred noticed them and greeted them with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlfred, you look well. I feared that with the rise in magical activity in Gotham would put some stress on the Batfamily.\u201d said Zatanna with a small smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you Zatanna. Master Bruce have handled the rise of magical activity well and he has the help of the other members of the Batfamily to help him. He also has called in other magical heroes like you, but under his tight strict watch. \u201csaid Alfred as stopped his dusting as he spoke and went back at dusting after he finished speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you handle clean this giant manor?\u201d asked Dinah with curiosity. Green Arrow\u2019s manor is large, but compared to Bruce\u2019s manor, it is like comparing a lake to an ocean. Oliver\u2019s manor is nice, but a bit tacky with pictures of him. Bruce\u2019s manor is larger and tasteful furnished with manicured lawns and gardens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Bruce has given some chores to his Batfamily and he has constructed robots to help with the more difficult and harder tasks. I oversee them as they also act as sensors to make sure that there is no uninvited personal in the manor or property. For example, I am dusting the portraits of Bruce\u2019s ancestors on both sides of his family. The robots are cleaning and maintain other areas in and around the manor. You may see them hovering around. \u201csaid Alfred pointed to the portraits who show that they were recently dusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of women noticed that the series of portraits of men and women showed the years of Bruce\u2019s family throughout the centuries in Gotham and before coming to Gotham.  They also noticed several of the women in the portraits looked like the very like the viewers. The men in the pictures were a mix of being fat or muscular or both. Both men and women the portraits looked happy, regal and in love with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women split up to think about how to counter the situation from what Bruce\u2019s portfolios contained. Diana, Selina, Tora, Beatriz and Kimiyo went outside to the pool to think and soak up the sun. Talia, Dinah, and Zatanna walked around for a bit and found themselves in a vast well stocked library. Andrea found a path that led into the Batcave to try to talk and reignite the love between Her and Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana, Selina, Tora, Beatriz, and Kimiyo walked around the large pool outside the manor soaking up the sunlight. For them it is nice to get out of the gloomy city known as Gotham.  They all stood in thought about their problems and soon Diana suggest they talk to each other as they may help each woman with a piece of advice. They all agreed to start trusting each and put aside their problems with each other as infighting will hinder their effectiveness. They all talk about each of their situation and together came up with a good plan on how to counter each other villains. Diana suggest that they also help each other out as the help heroines can be unknown advantage that can surprise the villains. Diana helped oversee each counter plan thanks to Athena\u2019s blessings giving Diana a mind of a great tactician. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia, Dinah, and Zatanna all walked around the vast library and thought on how to counter their enemies.  Zatanna thought perhaps Dinah could help her with her problem and maybe vice versa with Dinah problem. She soon bumped into Talia and inwardly decided to put her past problems aside and act helpful towards the skilled assassin. She also noticed that Dinah stumbled onto them. They talked civilized and Talia needs Dinah\u2019s martial arts skills to help repeal the leagues\u2019 enemies and Zatanna\u2019s occult knowledge to help decode arcane writing that the Court of Owls and the Council of Spiders used.  The women decided to help each other with each other problem while putting their difficulties aside to start to trust each other to solve their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the women thought about how to tackle their problem, Andrea was trying to find Bruce in the Batcave. She walked towards the Batcomputer and saw Bruce hard at work on a recent mystery case.  She also saw Damian fighting against training robots while Dick and Tim watched from nearby monitoring his progress. As she walked towards him silently. She saw Bruce stop and tense up as he if he could feel her presence near him.  She saw him turning away from his work towards her facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHello Bruce. It is nice to see you again. I hope we can still be close friends. \u201csaid Andrea unsure on how her former lover might react. She hoped it would not be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrea. I thought you left Gotham after the Joker incident. I heard you were living in Europe. Why return here? \u201casked Bruce in a cold voice. Andrea\u2019s presence started to bring up old love feeling. He wanted Andrea dark drive for revenge and move on from it, but it consumed her too much and she left with a piece of Bruce\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea told Bruce on what lead her to Gotham and Bruce did a quick check on the Batcomputer to verify the artifacts history with Andrea family. It turned out to be correct and both went back to talking. They continued to exchange small talk for several minutes until Andrea got fed up ask her question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we pick up from where we left off before the whole Joker situation. I still have feeling for you?\u201d asked Andrea as she has hope that she would still love him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hurt me deeply. \u201cBruce responded and less cold voice then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that what I did was unforgettable, but I could not let my family be hurt by these criminals and that after I left Gotham I started to move past it and not let it hold me back. I hope we can still have a relationship in the future.\u201d Said Andrea as she had some lingering regrets of what she did, but she has moved past that.  Leaving Gotham hurt her as she left her lover and a large part of her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will forgive, but it will take time to regain my trust and affection. I thought long and hard about what you did and I can relate to what you did to the Joker. \u201csaid Bruce as he recalled Alfred giving him a talk about his parents would make up after a fight and it tests that made their love for each other grow stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I hope to regain your trust and love again. \u201csaid Andrea as she felt hope rise in her with purpose of regaining Bruce\u2019s\u2019 love and trust.  She gave Bruce a smile and told him that she would be back in the manor if he needs her. She turned and left the Batcave via an elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He swerved his chair and saw his guests wanting to speak with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made your plans to help with your situations already? \u201casked Bruce with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe superheroines nodded and felt a light blush as they saw how handsome Bruce is by the computer light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we did, but on the way down during the elevator ride, Diana help create a great plan to defeat each of our situation\u2019s villains.  She reasoned that we all help each other as each heroine and villains adds new elements to the plans. For example, Zatanna\u2019s situations would benefit from other heroines helping her while she fights Brother Night and the Demon Three. \u201csaid Dinah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZatanna, Diana. Since you two have a connect to the supernatural world. Last night, I had a wired dream that two gods came to me and give me a blessing to increase my powers and told me I am bound to a man to will love me and take of me. \u201csaid Kimiyo as she thought last night experience was caused by a lack of sleep or stress. Other women started to voice that they too had otherworldly encounters and their blessings given to them by these divine beings, and them fated soulmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell last night, my gods came to me and gave be a blessing to enhance my powers and they supported me, they also told me that I am connect to a loving man and my soulmate. \u201csaid Diana and she smiled at Bruce who felt a twinge of love at the amazon princess, but calmed his facial features to express a calm and collect man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have lots of books on supernatural entities and I did experience a divine encounter. Let me cast a spell a to reveal this soulmate bond. \u201csaid Zatanna. She summoned her magic and her eyes glowed an ethereal purple for a few seconds and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell to revealed to me that each of us had a divine encounter and that includes three ladies that Bruce locked up in their prison cells. The spell also reveals that our bond is connect to Bruce and that also the ladies locked up are also connected to Bruce. \u201csaid Zatanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a way to break this bound? I love Bruce, but I feel that this bound is forced. \u201csaid Selina as she sauntered and put her arms around Bruce\u2019s large powerful muscular arms and chest. She could feel how strong and thick with power his muscles gave off. While she did this each woman felt a spark of jealousy as they wanted to feel Bruce\u2019s physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSorry Selina, but if divine beings can\u2019t break that bond then I doubt even my magic or other magical superheroes could break that bound. Perhaps the Spector and the Phantom Stranger could together try to break the bond, but I feel that a higher force would order them not to. \u201cZatanna as she and Selina fixed their relationship after Gotham Sirens incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest that we talk about this problem later.  I could get some research about this bond and ask my gods on why they can\u2019t they break it.\u201d said Diana as she besides Zatanna have the most experience with the supernatural world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we can talk about it later after we research more about this bond. \u201csaid Talia as she knew that the occult can be very tricky. She and her father have used the occult in the past, and often it would backfire on the demon head and his assassin daughter. Her father has respect for the supernatural, but is very cautious around it. He rarely works with supernatural villains as their magic is often unstable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruce what are look at?\u201d said Beatriz as she looked at the computer screen on the Bat computer. The screen displayed various crimes scenes and disappearances of people. Her training as an investigator kicked as she tried to make connection with all the information on the computer screen. She did train under Bruce and her training did make her one of the top female investigator in the superhero community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am investigating a string of disappearances. All the victims are young rising stars in the culinary world. Most of them are bakers or candy makers or ice cream makers. At the crimes scenes, that is no evidence of a forced break in and no money theft was reported. All the victims were last seen by their coworkers as that they stayed behind at their respective business to close for the night. It is if that disappeared into thin air. I scanned for any usual energy residue or any out of the ordinary. Nothing. Even the surveillance cameras recorded nothing as they were offline during these abductions. \u201csaid Bruce as he pulled up files with names, information, pictures of the victims and their crime scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard about this people disappearing. Most of them won money on those baking competitions shows and they set up shop in rough neighborhoods. I also heard that some of their shops were destroyed between the ongoing feuds between Gotham\u2019s supervillains, like some being set on fire by Firefly, getting gassed by Scarecrow or being smashed by Bane. \u201csaid Selina as she read it in the newspaper or saw it on the news and through her criminal contacts. Selina herself was confused as all the villains she knows about in Gotham, none of them have a hatred against the bakers and their shops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have an idea of what is going on with these people disappearing. Due to recent spike in magical activity in Gotham. There is a thriving black market on magic and mystical objects. Doctor Fate and the Spector have been banishing the big players in this black market, but there have been shipments of powerful magical objects that got lost and scattered throughout Gotham. With black market going into panic mode the venders to hide among the populations here. \u201csaid Zatanna as she heard from other magical heroes had a hard time of reducing the magical activity here in Gotham. She consulted Madam Xanadu and she told her that Gotham is a beacon of magic and that it attracts the supernatural to that city making it a haven for the otherworldly, but Gotham has this anomaly that twist any magical being in the city towards mental instability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is possible that there is a person who may have unleashed a powerful magical artifact or the less likely chance there is a new villain in Gotham. \" said Diana as she inspected the clues on the Bat computer's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the group heard a growl and became on alert. Talia saw not movement and saw Bruce put a hand on his stomach. She raised an eyebrow. The women saw a rare moment when a small shade of blush of embarrassment came and went on Bruce face.  Zatanna then saw two tiny little holes on Bruce\u2019s neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBruce are those the bite marks of a vampire?\u201d asked Zatanna as she know from some of her supernatural contacts that vampires avoid Gotham as they feel that there is darkness that they love, but it is tainted and twisted. There was also a rumor that a witch fell in love with a vampire, but the vampire left her and she cursed the city so that vampires can never enter city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce opened his mouth to respond, but the group heard a voice coming from\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His shirt was pulled so tightly against his gut that the buttons were straining, and looked as if they could burst if he so much as sat down too fast. His belly protruded out as much as a pregnant lady approaching her third trimester, only Clark's belly hung over his waistband and jiggled with every movement. Above was a pair of man-boobs, which were starting to resemble a woman's as they were in full c-cup territory. His hips were starting to flair out giving his ass more room to grow out into a full bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois hadn't seen Clark in a couple of weeks, she had no idea how he could have gained such a huge amount of weight since she last saw him. After what must have been a minute of awkward silence, Lois tried to initiate some small talk. \"It's been a while since we last met up, what have you been up to?\" She said and she took another not-so-subtle glance at his belly. \"Oh you know, I've just- I've been- um...\" Clark fumbled trying to find an excuse for his new girth before Lois graciously interjected, \"well it looks like you've been enjoying yourself anyway\" she said as she gently patted his gut, sending soft ripples through it and making Clark grunt quietly. Lois heard and felt herself getting aroused at Clarks discomfort as he blushed and tried to play it off as nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator jolted softly as it reached ground floor, sending another ripple through Clarks gut. \"Oh my God! He hasn't even moved and his belly is jiggling!\" The elevator doors opened, Clark took Lois\u2019 hand but as they walked through the lobby, Lois could feel Clarks hips bump against her, she realized he had a sway in his hips that showed just how large his ass had gotten. After Clark had bumped into Lois a couple of times, he realized and moved away from her slightly, so he wouldn\u2019t keep doing it. Clark blushed again, but Lois couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Clarks new badonkadonk. When Lois finally looked up, they had already walked outside and were approaching an alley. It was only Dusk, but due to the lack of super powered vigilante activity recently, Clark noticed that there were two thieves trying to break into a parked car in the alleyway. Clark saw this as the perfect opportunity to regain his masculinity in front of Lois\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello, my name is Damian Wayne, the Boy Wonder, Grandson of the Demon's Head, Heir to the Cowl, &amp; the only blood-son of Batman &amp; Talia Al Ghul. We've had a relatively quiet week here in Gotham, even at night when criminal elements should be taking advantage of our weakness. Regardless, with times this quiet &amp; uneventful, I've been thinking about my well, feelings about other people in my life. I know what you're thinking, \"What Damian Wayne thinking about other people or his feelings? What is this world coming to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I don't need anyone commenting on this but the point is that talking about other people or my feelings is very, difficult for me. I was raised to be a leader first, and an assassin second by my grandfather's cult, the League of Assassins, so what I was thinking was completely out-of-character from what I've been taught. Here is where my troubles began. I was coming home from patrol with Grayson as Batman, when we hit a speed bump. As we were about to go over it towards one of the many entrances to the Batcave, the speed bump somehow grabbed the bottom of the Batmobile &amp; suspended it 20 ft. in the air over the street. I hit my head hard even though I was wearing my seatbelt &amp; tried to reach my sword. As Grayson tried to activate the weapons system &amp; prepare for a battle, the assailant was discovered to be a series of vines &amp; roots that were smothering the car &amp; ripping out the tires. This could be the work of only one villainess, Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Jungle Batman &amp; Robin\" Poison Ivy declared with menace while she was glowing in the aura of her victory, and the radiance of glowing moss which she was wearing like makeup. The glowing moss's scents seemed to permeate the car's ventilation system. Damian knew something was wrong, Ivy may be a violent criminally insane metahuman, but she usually plays out her attacks with more subtlety, &amp; grace. This time she's gone bat shit crazier than usual &amp; was illuminating the city with her prehistoric super plants &amp; it looked like her weapons &amp; army were built to last a 1,000 years. To top it off, all of the super plants had a strange glowing moss oozing near the base of the stem like blood from an open wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem stronger ivy, but a direct assault isn't usually your thing. What's your plan this time?\" Dick inquired in his best Batman impression, as he cautiously put his hand near the trigger of a non-lethal cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see somebody's being a smarty pants. Well to put it simply, I needed you out of the way so I could reclaim Gotham, &amp; before you use any of your bat-gadgets in that super fast car of yours, I have an ace up my sleeve.\" Ivy waved her hand, and coming out of a conjured plant pod was Batgirl, or at least what looked like Batgirl. The current Batgirl is Cassandra Cain, and It seems that Ivy has enthralled Cassandra to her side, bu there was one problem, there was no utility belt. I sighed in relief, it appears that Ivy created a plant-based clone of Batgirl with almost everything, except a copy of her utility belt. You remember Batgirl don't you boys, because I made sure she remembers you. &amp; before you say 'That can't be Batgirl. Where's her utility belt?' Well this isn't the original batgirl but she has her real D.N.A., life-force, &amp; her utility right here\". This here is the real batgirl's tool belt, &amp; it will work  with my clone's D.N.A. Plus if you try to destroy my army of Batgirls, they psychic backlash will kill the real Batgirl, whose secrets will be revealed to the world. So I'm leaving you with an ultimatum, relinquish yourselves to me right now, &amp; I will be merciful, only doing what I've done to your bat-brat, to everyone else. If you don't surrender, or try anything remotely sneaky, then I'll have the entire city blanketed in toxins of which there will be no curing, as well as end Batgirl's life &amp; reveal her secrets to the world. So what will it be Batman? Your sidekick &amp; the city, for the world, you have until dawn to decide what to do. Goodbye Batman, I hope you make the right choice.\" Ivy concluded her monologue, then jumped off onto another flower that seemed to radiate a rainforest vibe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were already looking bleak, but as I stared dumbfounded at Ivy's threat, Grayson analyzed everything, the clone of Batgirl, as well as the army had been infused with her life-force, &amp; it turns out that Ivy wasn't kidding. The clones had similar enough D.N.A. in order to fool the biometric scanners on the utility belt, the copy of the utility belt that the prime clone used was the real deal, &amp; Cassandra is still unaccounted for as of a few days ago on a mission to Guatemala. This meant if we kill the clones, Cassandra will die, &amp; her secrets, or rather ours, would be exposed. But before we could do anything else, we glowing moss created nasty smelling tendrils which wrapped themselves around me &amp; yanked my body out of the car &amp; into a plant pod which was burrowing itself underground. I tried to scream, but I was gagged by leaves emitted a sickly sweet scent of incense which put mmy mind in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin no!!!!\" Grayson screamed as he too was dragged underground. Despite the terror I felt, i was strangely relaxed, &amp; I heard two new voices calling out to us, voices that Grayson seemed to recognize. I tried to squint closer at him, but all I got was him mouthing \"Not Ivy\". The next thing I knew everything went black... Who do Batman &amp; Robin meet next since it's not ivy pulling them underground</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sirens roared in the distance, as crime erupted in every dark corner of this rotten cesspool of a city.  Just another night in Gotham...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the nonstop madness, a raven haired eighteen year old runs for dear life as a ravenous pair of thugs chase him down the mean streets of the Bowery.  \"Come on!  We just wanna talk!\" laughed one of the almost deranged thugs as he and his partner picked up speed.  Chase, the teenager in question, caught on and sprinted as hard as he possibly could.  His athletic build was made doubly apparent as he gained speed and managed to break the line of sight between his pursuers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two crazed criminals tore through the alley, searching high and low as Chase fearfully hid behind a dumpster, praying to whatever God was listening that he'd survive the night.  One of them laughed maniacally and hollered, \"C'mon, little lady!  Don'tcha know it's rude to steal things that don't belong to ya?!  Now come on out and face your punishment like a man!\"  Chase's heart was beating faster than ever when the lunatic decided; just for fun, to add, \"come out now, and we might even let you live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was on the verge of exploding in his chest when the sound of footsteps in the distance grew nearer to his dumpster.  He was dead.  He knew it.  They'd find him and do God only knows what to him when they did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But as luck would have it, there was a manhole just past the dumpster.  Not his first option, but if it got him away from the psychopaths pursuing him, then who was he to complain?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking carefully to ensure neither one was nearby, young Chase quietly slid the manhole cover open and entered the sewer, closing the lid above him as he descended deeper and deeper into the damp, putrid abyss beneath Gotham City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ergh, nnngg oh my God....that smell...\" Chase complained, covering his nose as he stepped on the concrete walkway, avoiding the raw sewage just nearby, stepping as far away from the manhole as possible, hoping to uncover a separate manhole ladder to another block, far away from the madmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chase walked down the walkway, another more horrifying thought crept into his mind, as he recollected the urban legends he'd heard over the last few years.  Of a terrible creature lurking beneath Gotham.  A beast of immeasurable power, and a ravenous appetite for flesh...the Killer Croc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one truly knows how this beast man came to be, or what made him the way he was, but besides a few crazed sightings and folk tale, no one had ever seen the beast.  Or at least, seen him...and lived...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some crazy rumors, that's all!\" Chase told himself, as he laughed nervously.  \"I mean come on, a giant man-eating crocodile man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a cold, booming laughter stopped Chase mid sentence.  \"Yeah...wouldn't that just be crazy...?\" echoed a deep, growling voice, closer than Chase wanted to admit.  Frozen stiff with fear, Chase; despite every fiber against his better judgement, slowly turned his head around to confirm his fears.  And as his face went white, his fears were confirmed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering over him, stood a terror at least nine feet tall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was immense.  In place of skin, was nothing but green scales from head to toe, and white scales over the beasts pecs and belly.  His body was thick with muscle.  He wore only a raggedy pair of filthy pants, and as his yellow eyes pierced down at tiny Chase, his salivating, razor sharp teeth bared out for Chase to see and know...that this monstrosity was none other, than Killer Croc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase couldn't move.  It was too unreal, too terrifying.  His lower lip trembled as he tried to call for help, but was simply too petrified to even whimper.  Getting a big whiff of the teenagers terror, Croc grinned toothily and said, \"So...just what's a tasty morsel like yourself, doing in my neck of the woods, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't answer.  Those horrible, hungry eyes pierced right into Chase's soul, letting him know exactly how sealed his fate was.  Nevertheless, Chase mustered what little courage he had left in him and said, \"Well....mister Croc, sir, I'm...lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc snarled in agreement.  \"You certainly are...\" he replied, licking his scaly lips.  As if things weren't bad enough, a loud rumbling echoed throughout the sewers.  Chase looked up, knowing exactly where the source lied.  Croc snickered sickly as he rubbed his hungry stomach and replied, \"Good thing you happened to stumble upon my lair...I haven't eaten in quite a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Chase blurted out, nearly on the verge of crying.  \"Please d-don't do it!  I-I...\" His train of thought was stumped as he tried to talk his way out of a grim situation.  Suddenly, an idea emerged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two guys, see, they chased me!  Forced me down here!\"  Croc snarled with disinterest, but Chase continued anyway, \"They wanted to kill me, because there's a warehouse!  Not far from here!  And I...kinda tried to steal what was inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, before Croc inquired, \"What was inside?\"  As if to foreshadow his answer, Chase's own stomach roared hungrily, catching Croc's attention.  \"Food.  Tons of it.  These guys just knocked off a grocery shipping truck, stuffed with an entire shipment of all kinds of food, snacks, meat, drinks, the whole nine yards!  I guess they were probably gonna sell it off, or send it for their whole gang.\"  Croc's  intimidating stance eased slightly as he folded his arms and looked down at the teenager with some mild interest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he pondered, his own stomach reminded him that he was still incredibly hungry, but Chase caught on and interjected with, \"You really think I'm gonna satisfy your hunger?  Look at me!  I'm nothing but skin and bones!\"  Obviously, Chase was exaggerating.  He was slim, but rather toned and athletically built for a young man of his size.  \"And think about it!  All that food just there for the taking?  That'll fill you up well past the day!  And you don't have to hunt it or wait for it to come to you!  Cause it's all just right there in that warehouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this warehouse?\" Croc demanded.  \"Nearby,\" Chase reluctantly replied.  \"Where specifically?\"  Croc retorted, a bit impatiently, which made Chase nervous, but he did his best to keep his cool, remembering what was at stake, as he said, \"If I tell you, there's nothing to stop you from just eating me and going to the warehouse.\"  Croc growled angrily, as if to remind Chase who he was talking to, but Chase continued.  \"I can take you to the warehouse, and I can show you exactly where they're hiding the stolen truck!  All I ask, is that you don't...eat me.  Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a new one alright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiller Croc was used to hearing his food beg for their lives, but never before had he ever heard a deal that was as tempting as this one.  And it's not like eating Chase would sate his hunger.  It could be days or weeks before another helpless soul decided to crawl down into his sewers, and with GCPD under new management, and the dreaded Batman ruling over the surface, hunting his own food could have been harder than he realized.  So, against his immediate wishes, Croc grunted in annoyance and muttered, \"Deal.\"  He then looked down more fiercely at Chase and said, \"But you BETTER find the warehouse, and it BETTER still have food inside...or I'll pick my teeth with your bones!  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, Chase went white, nodding ever so slightly, acknowledging Croc's demands.  \"Good.  Now, get a move on!\"  Chase wasted no time climbing back up to the surface.  He had been so terrified that he'd practically forgotten the whole reason he was even down in the sewers.  Luckily, those psychotic criminals were nowhere to be seen.  Croc, despite his better judgement, was too hungry to swim to shore and back, so he punched the manhole open and made more than enough room for him to emerge up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase led Croc back to the very warehouse that got Chase into this mess to begin with, unimpeded by any gang members this time.  Croc tore the door open as both he and Chase entered the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were at least ten different trucks, each one covered by dusty tarps.  Croc looked around and turned to Chase.  \"Now, make with the food, or else, you know what...\"  Chase gulped nervously, and approached the grocery truck...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh thank you, sweet, merciful God...\" Chase said as he wiped the sweat from his forehead.  With a smile of relief, he pulled the back door of the truck up and then stepped aside for the large Croc man to investigate personally.  Immediately, the scent of non-spoiled goods filled Croc's highly sensitive nose.  As if acting on reflex, he licked his scaly lips, and bared his razor sharp teeth happily as he stepped towards the back of the truck, and proceeded to grab whatever he could fit in his large, muscular arms, which; suffice to say, was a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out various meats, boxes of snacks, drinks, and virtually anything that resembled food, Croc glanced down at his appetizer to be, salivating.  He still preferred the taste of terrified, sewer dwellers over anything else, but it had been so long since he'd eaten anything besides rats, and the occasional poor soul, that he'd almost forgotten what real people food tasted like.  Grabbing one of the rotisserie chickens, he pulled the plastic top off and opened his mouth nice and wide, swallowing the chicken whole.  Chase watched the large beast extend his jaws a bit as he took several ample gulps to work the chicken into his mouth.  Within an instant, Croc slammed his jaws shut, and chewed the entire chicken viciously, savoring the long since forgotten taste.  \"Mmm, juicy,\" Croc muttered, mouth still full of chicken, before he took a thick gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase watched, mystified, as the ample mouthful of chicken meat...and bones...traveled from Croc's jaws, down his throat.  It was like watching something out of National Wildlife as a very noticeable bulge traveled down the front of Croc's throat, and disappeared into his toned chest.  \"Wow, that was...impressive...\" Chase said, almost forgetting that same mouthful of chicken could have very easily been him had this truck not been here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Croc grinned toothily as he rubbed his stomach in satisfaction.  \"Tasty,\" he exclaimed as he proceeded to grab another chicken, more than eager to sink his teeth into it.  As he ripped the plastic top off with ease, he looked down at Chase and sharply said, \"Alright, you're off the hook, Tiny.  Now scram before I change my mind!\"  Ordinarily, Chase would have been more than happy to take his leave from the terrifying Croc man about to eat an entire truckload of groceries and miscellaneous goods, unfortunately, the young blond's situation didn't fare any better outside the warehouse.  Croc was about to toss the chicken into his mouth, but he noticed Chase shiftily still standing around with an uncertain look on his face.  \"Are you deaf?\" Croc barked in annoyance.  \"I said get lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase tugged nervously at the top of his shirt.  \"I-I know, sir, but...well, those guys are still out there, looking for me, and if they find me-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my problem,\" Croc said coldly.  \"Maybe you can go ask the Batman to help you,\" he added almost sarcastically.  He was just about to shove the next chicken into his mouth, when Chase responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that, well, sir, I-I know if I'm at least here with you, I'm safe from those lunatics.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc immediately stopped, and looked back down at Chase, almost astonished by that last part.  Immediately, he snorted and raised what would be his eyebrow if he had any.  \"You realize if I'm still hungry after this, I'll probably just eat YOU, right?\"  He asked, still a little baffled.  Chase nodded nervously, then; much to Croc's surprise, said, \"I'm willing to take that chance, Mister Killer Croc...sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed as Croc almost laughed to himself.  This was definitely a first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Croc rolled his eyes and said, \"If you insist.\"  He was about to once again shove the chicken into his cavernous jaw, when the teens' stomach once again proceeded to growl audibly.  Chase's face went red a bit as he laughed nervously and said, \"Sorry, guess I'm still pretty hungry.  I mean that is what got me in this mess in the first place.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed grunt, Croc shook his head and, much to Chase's surprise, pointed towards the other items up for grabs and said, \"Have at it.\"  Chase looked up at Croc in surprise.  \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty to go around, it's not like you humans eat that much anyway.  Besides, if I AM still hungry, I want my dinner nice and bloated, not skin and bone.\"  Chase went wide eyed as Croc looked down at him almost menacingly, but nonetheless, Chase nodded and grabbed whatever looked appetizing from the truck.  As he set his food down, he watched Croc slide his second whole chicken into his mouth, and once again, proceeded to chew voraciously.  As Croc proceeded to gulp down the second chicken, Chase looked almost impressed.  On one hand, it was horrifying to think what else he could put away, but on the other hand, it was pretty damn cool.  Watching Croc eat was like watching a Boa swallow a Boar whole, he gulped down what could feed an entire family of five for dinner, in one go, as if it were a piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Croc savored the flavor, Chase decided to try and sate his own hunger.  He grabbed a frozen family serving of Chicken Alfredo Pasta.  He would have happily eaten it cold, but that probably wouldn't have tasted too great.  So he got up and checked the lounge room, where he; to his relief, discovered a microwave.  Unplugging it, he carried it off near the truck where Croc was now shoving handfuls of raw meat into his mouth, and plugged it in.  \"Figured you'd prefer this over the cold stuff,\" Chase noted.  Croc shook his head.  \"Food is food.  Unlike you humans, I'm not picky.\"  As if to emphasize his point, Croc a 9 pound frozen salmon, and slid the whole thing into his mouth, where he proceeded to greedily chew away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the concept of eating frozen fish was morbidly horrible to Chase and any rational person, it was still a side to behold, watching Croc put away 9 whole pounds of fish and still eat at the same pace he was already eating.  He then proceeded to warm up his own meal, and continued to watch Croc eat and eat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Croc continued to consume ample amounts of food with no stop in sight, Chase's eyes soon wandered down to Croc's stomach.  Any ordinary person's stomach would be blimping out right about now, but a giant beast like Croc?  He had eaten well over 30 pounds of food at this point, and his stomach only now just began to slightly push outward, and Croc was still eating like he hadn't eaten in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase was so mesmerized by the sight, he had forgotten about his own meal, until Croc gulped down a mouthful of raw sausages, and turned his attention towards Chase, looking mildly annoyed as the microwave continued beeping off.  \"Either take the damn pasta outta the microwave, or I'm chucking it against a wall,\" he threatened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase snapped back to reality, and promptly took the still piping hot pasta from the microwave.  Blowing on it, he grabbed a fork and wasted no time hungrily digging into the whole thing.  Croc saw the sight and smirked to himself before turning his attention back to his feast.  The two ravenously ate as time went on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chase loaded his plastic fork with as much pasta and chicken as he could fit and stuffed that fork into his mouth with haste.  He had told Croc that the whole reason he was in this mess with the crazed gangsters was because he tried to steal food from them.  What he hadn't told Croc was that; like him, he too hadn't eaten in over a few days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the young man had literally been dying of starvation and thirst before making his way to this warehouse and getting just enough sustenance to run for his life when they found him.  He had recently been one of the few surviving victims of a series of bombings committed by the Calender Man just a few days prior; <i>the Fourth of July</i>...in which Calender Man decided to rig an entire neighborhood to blow.  Chase's apartment had been bombed to cinder, leaving him with absolutely nothing, and no friends or family to turn to, as his own parents had long since abandoned him as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't one for begging, especially in a city this rotten, and since GCPD was so tied up trying to apprehend Calender Man to do anything for his victims, Chase had to make do.  And this is where that got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at this moment in time, he could care less.  That immediate satisfaction of filling his dangerously empty stomach with anything made his problems all but fade away, if at least for now.  And so, he stuffed one bite after another into his mouth, chewing rapidly, gulping quickly and going right back for more.  Not unlike how Croc was faring with much larger servings of food all at once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Chase would glance over to see how the big reptilian man was doing, and like before, he found himself enticed watching him continue to put away so much so ravenously.  Again, his eyes wandered down to Croc's belly, which had begun to push outward more noticeably over the tried waistband of the beasts old, raggedy pants.  But it hadn't slowed him down in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Chase had reached the halfway point of his Chicken Alfredo Pasta.  Starving or not, it was quite a heavy meal, clearly not meant for just one person, as Chase's stomach was already feeling uncomfortably bloated.  He lowered his fork and rested a hand atop his stomach to inspect the damage.  It was pushing outward by about an inch or two more than it would under normal circumstances, and there was a tightness brewing, which caused him some mild discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching on an entire box of cookies, (literally, he just stuffed the actual unopened box into his mouth) Croc looked down at Chase and, with his mouthful, muttered, \"What's the matter?  Full already?\"  For some reason, Chase didn't want to look weak around Croc.  He couldn't explain it, but despite how much he feared him, he sought Croc's approval.  And seeing how Croc's own stomach began to noticeably bulge, more so than his own, he decided to lie and said, \"Err, nope.  Just, savoring the flavor.  Like I said, it's been a while.\"  Croc shrugged to himself and gulped down his mouthful of cookies (and cardboard), then grabbed more miscellaneous goods which he promptly stuffed into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase grabbed his fork yet again, and; despite his fullness, resumed stuffing more pasta into his mouth, determined to finish the entire thing.  His stomach continued to push further, growing ever more uncomfortable the more bloated it became as it pushed against his shirt.  Finally, somehow, Chase managed to swallow the last bit of pasta from the tin tray.  Leaning back, he rubbed his bulging belly and burped loudly, covering his mouth immediately, in fear of annoying Croc.  \"Sorry!\" Chase said apologetically as he stifled a second burp and muttered another apology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc chuckled to himself and shook his head.  \"Hey, your stomach's gotta make room somehow, right?\"  As if to prove his point, Croc thumped his belly and let out easily the loudest belch Chase had ever heard.  He then smacked his lips and continued to stuff his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase couldn't help but smile at the display of piggishness.  Perhaps, because it made Croc seem less intimidating than before, or because Croc was seeming and acting less hostile, and thus, made it seem less likely he would devour Chase.  But whatever the reason, Chase was undeniably fascinated by the creature, and especially with watching him eat.  For some reason, Chase didn't want this little feeding frenzy to come to a close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to see how much this beast could truly put away, and how big his stomach could possibly get.  And if that meant stuffing his own face beyond his limited means, so be it.  Even if those thugs outside weren't about to brutally murder Chase the second he saw them, he still didn't want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after coaxing out a few more rather loud burps to clear up as much space in his stomach as he could, Chase grabbed a frozen BBQ Pizza and warmed it up.  After letting it cool off, he proceeded to stuff one of his eight slices into his mouth, taking a large bite and chewing voraciously, before gulping it down and biting again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne down, seven more to go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chase chomped away, one slice of pizza after another.  Each bite already well past his capacity, but he intended to see how far he could go to keep up with Croc, who was still tearing into the trucks supplies rapidly.  Occasionally, Chase would glance back at the monstrous reptile swallowing entire items whole, watching them create a large bulge down his throat, and disappear into his toned chest, and eventually, drop right into Croc's quickly growing belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chase's eyes wandered down to the beasts' incredibly bloated stomach, he would then stop eating and just, gaze at the appendage in awe.  The scaly stomach looked as though it were a rapidly growing balloon, bloating outward past the waistband of Croc's rags as he began to hunch over from its steadily overwhelming size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't think I've ever seen anything eat that much before...\" muttered Chase, impressed and in awe.  Hearing that, Croc turned his attention to Chase and grinned wickedly as he said, \"You ain't seen nothing yet,\" and proceeded to stuff an entire frozen ham down his throat, gulping it down in mere seconds, before smacking his lips and grabbing another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his example, Chase continued to stuff his face with more pizza, taking larger bites, as though inspired by Croc's gluttonous display.  As Chase continued, his own belly began to peak outward from the bottom of his shirt, exposing some of his normally trim stomach, now painfully bloated by a good few inches.  Almost on reflex, Chase started rubbing his stomach gingerly in an effort to ease the strain while he continued to slowly put away more and more pizza, until; at long last, the BBQ pizza box was all but completely emptied out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing from exhaustion, Chase leaned back and ran his against against his aching belly.  To his surprise, he heard an audible groaning from Croc, who also; had sat down and began running his clawed hand around his ridiculously swollen belly, licking his scaly lips as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, y'know something?  It's been a looooong time since I've eaten this good,\" Croc muttered happily, enjoying the satisfied feeling of vague fullness.  Chase simply nodded with agreement and said, \"You said it, Mister Croc!  I literally haven't eaten in days!  I can't even begin to tell you how much I needed this!\"  Earning Croc's attention, Croc raised what would be his eyebrow at Chase's progress, as though he were semi impressed with the young human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, didn't think a scrawny little twig like you could actually keep up with me,\" Croc said, pleasantly surprised.  Chase rubbed the back of his head bashfully and said, \"To be perfectly fair though, I probably couldn't have if I weren't so incredibly hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a loud, sudden gurgle rumbled out from Croc's bulbous belly.  Chase glanced up as Croc proceeded to pound his fist against his toned chest a few times, and then let out a huge, thundering belch, reverberating loudly all around the walls of the warehouse.  Croc smacked his lips and gave his belly a good, proud slap as his tongue hung out from the side of his mouth.  Chase, much to his own surprise, began to laugh heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\" he exclaimed happily at Croc, who glanced back at the younger man and said, \"That was nothing.  Just making a little bit of room before I feed some more.\"  And as if following by Croc's example, Chase thumped a fist against his bloated stomach and immediately let out a huge burp after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the lengthy eruption ended, Chase sighed with relief as Croc glanced over at him and chuckled, in a surprisingly not-cold tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, not bad, little guy,\" Croc exclaimed, almost impressed with the younger man.  Letting out a smaller burp, Chase smiled almost proudly and shrugged.  \"Like you said, gotta make room somehow, right?\" Chase exclaimed, patting his belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something, kid?  For a pitiful little human morsel, you're alright...\" said the monster, almost sounding pleasantly surprised when he did.  Shocked to hear any kind of praise from the beast, Chase smiled and said, \"T-thanks!\"  And despite his better judgement, he himself continued to say, \"And, f-for a frightening, man eating Crocodile Man, y-you're really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Chase's relief, Croc actually chuckled at the remark, almost appreciative, rather than malicious sounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chase watched as Croc rested his clawed hand against his bloated stomach, rubbing it firmly in an effort to coax away whatever tension had built up within it since his gluttonous escapades had begun.  His curiosity was already beyond peaked, and so; despite his better judgement, he still cautiously approached the scaly beast of a man and asked, \"Say, Mister Croc...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc looked down at Chase and grunted, \"Just Croc.  None of this 'Mister' crap, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Chase nodded.  \"Y-yes, sir!  Err, well, Croc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kind of look like you're suffering from something of a bellyache, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc again grunted as he glanced down at his bloated abdomen and replied, \"Nothin' I ain't gotten over before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want, I could, maybe, make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" demanded Croc.  To which, Chase said nothing, but instead, walked over to the still kneeling monster and, pressed both his hands gently atop Croc's bloated stomach.  Part of Chase was terrified, only imagining how many times this dreadful somach had digested something more than just raw meat and groceries.  But he forced himself to push those thoughts out from his mind, and instead, began to rub all against Croc's scaly belly, slowly and soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc's eyelids immediately widened as he hung his head back and smiled an almost goofy smile as he did so.  \"Ohhh yeah, there we go...\" muttered a blissful Croc as Chase smiled semi-nervously and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nervousness soon faded as he too, began to smile as he gingerly rubbed the croc man's stomach with both hands, enjoying the coolness emanating from the monsters scaly belly, and the tightness of his currently rounded stomach.  He couldn't fathom how large the beast had become, and how much was currently being packed away within his troubled gullet.  All Chase knew, was that he wanted to see more in this Croc's belly.  He wanted to see it get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc; on the other hand, was in heaven.  His salivating tongue stuck out from the side of his crooked jaw as he leaned back on his elbows, letting his belly stick upward for Chase to continue to gently massage all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to which, Chase's gentle massaging had unknotted a lot of Croc's stomach muscles, and in the process, stirred up a lot of the pent up gas resonating within his gullet.  Feeling it rising to the surface, Chase proceeded to take a hold of Croc's belly from both sides and gently but firmly push down on Croc's stomach, forcing up a huge, lengthy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit nervously, Chase glanced up at Croc and said, \"Eh, sorry, didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroc shook his head and smiled himself.  \"You kidding?  That felt great!  Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Chase nonetheless smiled and more than willingly complied.  He rubbed around Croc's belly a little more firmly until he felt some gas tensing up Croc's stomach, and once again, pushed, forcing up another massive belch from the beast.  Without even needing to be asked, Chase pressed his hands up against the front of Croc's belly, just above his belly button and a bit more firmly than before, shoved deep against Croc's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting belch was so fierce that it nearly blew Chase away as it blasted the air for several seconds straight before coming to an end.  Immediately, Chase burst into a fit of laughter.  \"Holy crap, that was awesome!\" he exclaimed almost gleefully.  Croc grinned proudly and said, \"Like that, eh, little guy?\"  Chase immediately nodded, still laughing and said, \"Seriously, man, those were amazing!  I didn't think ANYONE could ever burp like that!\"  Croc simply shrugged humbly and replied, \"How many people you know who can eat anywhere near as much as I can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point, fair point,\" Chase added, patting Croc's belly in agreement.  Suddenly, both their bloated stomachs rumbled.  In that instant, the two resumed stuffing their faces...</span></div></div>",

He was the last member of the team to arrive: Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Thor, The Hulk, Falcon (Sam Wilson), Logan Howlett (Wolverine) and the newest recruit Peter Parker (Spider-Man), were all gathered around the circular table.  Each had a few doughnuts of their own, save for Thor and The Hulk, who had couple dozen all to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So,\" Tony said before biting into a glazed doughnut, \"Wat's da pwobwem?\"  Tony asked as he chewed, swallowing before speaking again, \"Is Dr. Doom building a new doomsday weapon in the Latverian Embassy or do we need to help Spider-Kid over here find a date to the prom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other Avengers chuckles but the frown on Peter's lower face, which was exposed to scarf down a few doughnuts, was clearly not happy; and neither was Cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Were here,\" Captain America started, \"Because theres a new supervillain in town and so far law enforcement hasn't been able to stop him.\"  Steve pressed a button on the table, activating the holographic display device in the middle, which displayed security footage from a bank.  \"So far all of his robberies have been monetary - banks, jewelry stores, pawn shops, etc, but the security cameras always cut out right before he uses his powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Avengers all watched as the video displayed security footage of a quiet bank, a few seconds went by, and then the criminal stepped into view and then the cameras cut out.  Steve hit fast-forward and then play once the security feed kicked back in; the villain gone and every male on screen, including the security guards and bank tellers, had huge, swollen, bloated bellies.  Steve hit a few more buttons, which brought up the same footage from a different camera, and paused just as the man walked in.  His costume was red and skin tight, showing off his cut, muscular body, with a big white F on his chest.  His boots and gloves were white, his mask covering his whole head with a white streak down the middle, and he has multiple small spikes along the shoulders and on the toes of the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the F stand for?  Freak?\"  Clint asked as he scarfed down another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No clue yet.  All we know about him is that he causes no damage, he always makes a clean getaway, and he leaves those in the building completely stuffed.\"  Cap replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not everyone; just the men.\" Sam pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So then why call a meeting of the boy's club?\"  Tony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I agree with the Man of Iron,\" Thor exclaimed, \"Surely out female companions would fair better against this Red-Man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All of the female Avengers are already on missions,\" Cap explained, \"So it's just us.  If any of you run into him while on patrol be careful - we don't know the extent of his powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After that Steve dismissed the meeting and all the Avengers went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two-and-a-half hours later Hawkeye was out in Manhattan on his patrol shift.  The blonde archer had picked some lunch, four hot dogs from the best street vendor in town, load with the works, a bag of chips, and a large soda.  Hawkeye shoved the last bite of his fourth hot dog into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully before swallowing and washing it down with what remained of his soda.  The hero set the trash next to him and patted his belly, letting out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oof... over did it a bit.\"  Clint said, patting his slightly bloated belly, which stretched the fabric of his skin tight uniform slightly.  \"Ah, well, no biggie.  I'm parked in front of the only bank this F guy hasn't hit in Manhattan yet.  If he strikes here I'll be ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About twenty minutes went by when Clint finally spotted the man clad in red enter the bank.  The archer stood up, his belly still bloated from his lunch, and launched a rope-arrow above the doorway.  Hawkeye swung down, kicking open the door as he entered, and did a roll before landing square on his feet, an arrow aimed right at the man's back, \"Okay, stop sign, hands up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mysterious villain stood there, silent, but it was what was happening around him that made Clint double take.  The female bank tellers were loading up bags full of money, the female customers were all off to the side silently watching, but this superpowered criminal was using his powers on the men.  Every man in the room; the manager, bank tellers, the male customers, and the security guards, were all stuffing their faces with food that had been piled around them.  Soda poured out from multiple kegs, splitting off into thinner streams and flowing right down the men's throats, while doughnuts flew directly to the other men's mouths, being gobbled with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the...,\" Hawkeye said, distracted, before turning back to the villain, who had turned around to face Hawkeye, \"Alright, who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was wondering how long it would take for The Avengers to notice me.  I was hoping to run into Thor first but you'll do.\"  The villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who.  Are.  You.\"  Hawkeye repeated, arrow at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can call me The Feeder.\"  The man said, and though his face was covered, Clint could tell he was smirking.  \"I can tell by that bloated belly of yours you just had lunch,\"  The Feeder sniffed the air and chuckled, \"Four hot dogs, the works, some chips and a soda.  Sounds tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did yo-\" Hawkeye shook his head, focusing, and furrowed his brow, \"Listen, you can either go down the easy way or the hard way, food boy.  Which will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The easy way wouldn't be any fun, would it?\"  The Feeder asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without a second thought Hawkeye fired his arrow, and in a split second, had re-loaded and fired two more.  As the arrows whizzed towards The Feeder he waved his arm in front of him and the 3 arrows stuck into the wall - a jelly filled doughnut on each tip.  Hawkeye soon found himself being pelted by pastries.  The hero ran to the side, dodging a wall of bear claws that flew towards him, only to be hit on the side by a wave of apple fritters.  The hero hit the wall near the door entrance, buried in sticky, glazed confections, and before he could do anything to get up, he found an apple fritter being forced into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The feeder approached him, various doughnuts floating above one hand, and as the last bit of apple fritter was forced down Hawkeye's throat, a raspberry filled jelly doughnut followed.  Hawkeye tried to fight it but the doughnuts kept coming, one after another being forced into his belly, until they suddenly stopped after six.  Hawkeye, despite the heavy weight in his stomach, broke his arms free and tried to reach an arrow, but both muscular arms became pinned to the wall under the weight of a dozens of doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the matter, Hawkeye,\" The Feeder said as he lifted up his mask to just under his nose, \"You can't be full yet?  Why don't you relax and have a bite to eat?\"  The Feeder's voice reverberated through the air, echoing off the ways in an almost melodic way.  Hawkeye's eyes flashed red for a brief second, and as the pastries pinning his arms to the walls fell to the floor, the archer grabbed the first doughnut he could and shoved it into his mouth.  The Feeder grinned, lowering his mask over his face again before turning around and walking towards the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is all the money in the truck?\"  The Feeder asked a female employee who unlocked the security doors for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, sir.\"  The hypnotized bank teller replied, and The Feeder smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect.  I'll be on my way; you can reactivate the security cameras once all the food is gone and you've disposed of the containers.\"  The Feeder was then escorted out the back to the armored truck that was waiting for him.  He changed from his costume to that of a security guard, placed a hat over his mohawk, and grinned as he loaded into the truck's cab, \"Eat up, Hawkeye.  There's be plenty more where that came from.\"  He said before driving off - blending into New York traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back inside the bank the men were stuffing themselves, though several had stopped once reaching their limit.  Doughnuts and soda flowed down their throats and Hawkeye was shoving as many as he could into his belly, before finally swallowing the last glazed doughnut that was part of the pile he was trapped under.  Hawkeye groaned, 5 dozen doughnuts crammed into his tight belly - his abs stretched tight along on the pale sphere that had broken through the fabric of his costume.  The archer's eyes flashed red once more before he laid his head back and passed out against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The room was cleared of all food evidence, the cameras turned back on, and everyone who wasn't out like a light realized they had all lost a half-hour and none of them could remember a thing.</span></div></div>",

Nodes were attached to him with wires leading to various computers and machines making beeps while lights flashed.  He was pretty sure Tony hooked him up to stuff that didn't even do diagnostics just because he could.  The guys were all silent, not really sure what to say.  They were really just waiting for Tony to say that he was okay and going to be fine in a day or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's fine,\" Tony started.  Everyone's eyes went to the man as he sat at a screen, scanning his eyes across readings.  \"But he's not going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Clint yelled, trying to bolt upright but Steve pushed him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce shook his head at Tony, \"What do you mean he's not going to be fine?  All those readings I saw said he wasn't in any danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony flipped his screen around and tapped a pen to a few numbers.  It all looked like nonsense but he was pretty confident about what he was about to say so everyone went quiet again to listen.  Clint did look to be in perfect health other than some recent weight gain.  In fact, he seemed like he was back to full strength.  He was eating more than when he first arrived and his vitals were back to normal, too.  There was no way he was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is his weight here,\" Tony said, pointing to a chart with a red line ticking upward.  \"Compared to his metabolism.\"  He pointed to a blue section that was rather erratic.  \"He's gaining weight like crazy.  He came in with that food baby but after digesting it his body converted it to fat and mass.  And it's not just from what that weirdo fed him either.  It's all food.  I had Jarvis make up a special liquid diet for out buddy here that only contained the calories and nutrients vital to keep him alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" Hawkeye mumbled, everyone glaring at him to shut up as they were rapt with attention to Tony's assessment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronman gave Clint a look before looking back to the group, \"He still gained weight.  I don't know how, hell, Jarvis doesn't know how!  Something's going on in his body and I have no idea how to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor looked around the room and then to their workout area a few floors below, \"He can do those work outs you humans are so very fond of, could he not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony shook his head, tapping the screen again, \"Jarvis ran some simulations.  Based on his body's current state, the rate of growth, and the fact that he's not losing muscle mass as he gets fatter we came to the conclusion that he'll just continue growing no matter how much he tries to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what do you mean?  That I'm stuck like this?\" Clint asked, craning his neck a bit to look at Tony who had turned the screen back around and was tapping away at a second screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, maybe.  Though, to be honest, Jarvis' simulations concluded you could probably get up over a thousand pounds and still be totally mobile as your muscle mass is growing, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter finally piped up, shaking his head, \"Wait, that doesn't make sense.\"  Everyone turned to the kid who blinked and refocused.  It was weird seeing all the adults looking to him.  \"What I mean is, if this guy is fattening guys up wouldn't he also want to get rid of their strength?  You know, make us unable to go after him?  Seems like he either didn't think this through or is toying with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one way to-\" started Tony, cut off by all his screens going red and a few switching over to a map.  \"Fun.  He's back.  Security cameras caught him downtown at that big jewelry store.  Let's send a small team out this time to see if we can overpower him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the team sent out...</span></div></div>",

The once lean-but-toned Archer was lying on the bed, stripped down to his purple, arrow patterned briefs, and was doing his best not to move so the tests would work.  He had already gained about 75 pounds and his weight was slowly increasing.  His once defined pecs and arms were now thicker and softer, their definition slowly vanishing under layers of fat, and his once cut abs had ben replaced with a doughy ball of pale flesh.  His briefs were digging into his fleshier hips just slightly and his beefy thighs were growing along with the rest of his now chubbier body.  Despite all the fat Clint had gained the archer did seem more muscular - his torso was wider, his arms bigger, he had a thicker neck and more defined traps, and his thighs seemed stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we have any idea of this guy's powers are?\"  Sam asked, turning to Tony and Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Bruce stated, \"We know that he somehow altered Clint's body so that his metabolism would go wack.  His body is digesting food at an alarming rate but it's converting everything he eats into fat and mass.  Clint, are you sure you don't remember what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's all a blur...\"  Clint replied, squinting into the distance, \"WAIT!  No, I'm starting to remember... I entered the bank and there doughnuts... everywhere; big kegs of soda, too.  All the men were stuffing their faces it was like... like they wanted to keep eating.  None of them were resisting.  He.. he calls himself The Feeder.  He can manipulate food; he used doughnuts to deflect my arrows and pin me to the wall.  It's... it's all fuzzy after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Clint, it's not your fault.\"  Sam said, reassuring his fellow Avenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but until we can stop your weight gain you can't eat any actual food.\" Tony said, \"The liquid diet Jarvis created for you will still make you gain weight but not as rapidly.  You're gonna keep getting bigger until we stop him or whatever it is he's doing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sounds like a mutant to me.\" Wolverine chimed in, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Bruce and Tony said simultaneously.  Bruce turned back to Clint, who already seemed have gained another 5 pounds, \"At any rate, try and get some rest, Clint.  Tony and I'll stay up all night if we have to cure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys.\" The expanding archer said as he felt his body growing fatter by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene inside of the jewelry store was exactly like the bank - the female employees at the store were putting every piece of jewelry they had into bags while the men were all shoving as much food into their mouths as they could.  Buttons on dress shirt had popped off and seams had torn but the men kept filling their guts with doughnuts and soda.  The Feeder stood there, arms crossed as he watched happily as his heist unfolded perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you brought enough for the entire class.\"  A voice said behind him.  The Feeder turned around just in time to receive a hard punch to his face, sending him flying back into a pile of cream filled doughnuts.  The villain shook his head, rubbing his jaw as he looked up to see the red-and-blue wall-crawler standing near the entrance of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spider-Man,\"  The Feeder said in a cheerful tone, \"I'm surprised they sent the new guy in to fight me.  What, was Captain America busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he's on his way.\"  Spidey said in his usual, sarcastic tone, \"but I'm afraid the all-you-can-steal jewelry buffet is closed for you.\"  Spidey launched several webs at the villain, who quickly backflipped out of the pile and landed near a display case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, web-head.  In fact, I'm just getting STARTED!\"  With a wave of his hand a few dozen doughnuts flew across the room directly at Spidey.  Thanks to his Spidey-sense the wall-crawler was able to dodge several wave of doughnuts using a combination of flips and quick web-shots, but it was landing on a cream-filled doughnut that caused him to slip and land flat on his back that was his downfall.  The Feeder piled on dozens of doughnuts onto Spider-Man's body, pinning him down to the floor.  Spidey struggled to get free but it was no use - The Feeder's ability to manipulate food was what was really holding the teen hero does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, Spidey, I always did think you were far too skinny for your own good.\"  The Feeder said as he approached Spider-Man, kneeling down and reaching for his mask.  Spidey pulled away and The Feeder chuckled, \"OH, don't worry, web-head.  I'm not interested in your secret identity - I just wanna plump you up like I did your archer buddy.\"  After lifting up Spider-Man's mask so his mouth was free, The Feeder did the same to his own mask.  A glazed doughnut hovered just above Spidey's mouth and a wicked smirk spread across The Feeder's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, eat up.\"  The Feeder said, his voice echoing off the walls in an almost hypnotic way.  Spidey's eyes flashed red for a brief second behind his mask just as the doughnut was crammed down his throat.  The Feeder stood up, moving the pile of doughnuts off of Spidey's body and watched with a smug sense of satisfaction as the web-slinger got to his knees and started shoving the fattening pastries down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Load up the truck!\"  The Feeder said to the female employees under his trance, \"Once I deal with Cap I'm out of here.\"  As if on cue the sound of a motorcycle's engine roared as Cap's bike burst through the double doors and skidded into place fifteen feet from The Feeder's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCap assessed the situation quickly; Spider-Man had already been taken down, the store had been picked clean, and the man responsible for it all was right in front of him.  Without a word Cap leapt from his bike and tossed his shield before sprinting at the man.  The Feeder dodged the super solider's signature shield and only had a second before he found himself in hand-to-hand combat with the famous hero.  Both Cap and The Feeder dodged, ducked, and deflected each other's kicks and punches; Cap catching his shield all in the middle of it.  The Feeder deflected a hit and used that as an opportunity to get some distance between him and the solider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to Spider-Man and Hawkeye!\"  Captain America shouted, using the small break to try and get some info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you too, Cap.\"  The Feeder said sarcastically, his mask still lifted up to reveal his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to them?\"  Cap repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  Not much, all I did was suggest they have a snack.\"  The Feeder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypnotism?\"  Cap asked, never breaking eye contact with the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just very... <i>persuasive</i>.\"  The red and white villain said before a wave of Boston Cream Doughnuts flew directly at Cap.  Cap used his shield to protect himself, the confections splattering against the vibranium shield on impact.  The soldier held his ground, but the force soon picked up and knocked him back.  3 doughnuts crammed themselves into Cap's mouth, forcing their way down his throat before another 3 took their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your lunch.\"  The Feeder said as he walked towards the back of the store where his truck was waiting.  The villain's melodic voice echoed off the walls, penetrating Cap's ears and causing him to grow insatiably hungry.  His eye flashed red for a brief second and, just like Spider-Man, the patriotic superhero found himself eating as much food as he possibly could fit into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the store had already passed out, bellies swollen and stuffed with food, but Spider-Man and Cap continued to eat - their bellies bloating with each bite and stretching the fabric of their suits to their limits.  Once The Feeder had made his escape the female employees cleared out the mess, save for the doughnuts Cap and Spidey were still eating, and the security cameras were back online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cameras are back on!\"  Sam said, poking his head into the medical, \"and it isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  Thor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got to Cap and Spidey.\"  Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony pulled up the security feed on one of his holographic screens and the team watched as Spidey fell to his back, his suit torn open and 6 dozen doughnuts crammed into his gut, while Cap kept sat on the other end of the screen, still stuffing his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're... willing eating?\"  Wolverine asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks that way.  Maybe that's why you ate so much, Clint; You couldn't stop yourself.\"  Bruce mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, The Feeder escaped again and we've got two more teammates we need to go pick up.\"  Tony said to the team.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later a couple more beds were added to the room next to Clint.  They held Peter and Steve who were in much the same position as the archer.  Both lay there with their bodies rapidly digesting and converting the food into fat and mass while Tony tried to slow it down with the liquid diet he had given Clint.  Sam and Thor stood off to the side feeling a little worried.  This new villain had come from nowhere and had taken out three of their teammates without even trying.  From what they could gather, the guys WANTED to eat.  That lead to a new thought: what if they couldn't stop this guy?  If what Tony said was true, they could end up fatter than the Guinness World Record fat men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's slower.  But they're still growing.  We're going to have to do this some other way.  Brute force isn't going to work but we don't know where this guy is!  And the two best suited to stealth are...\" Tony said, looking at those lying on the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this man has some sort of powerful magic.  Have you considered that, Man of Iron?\" Thor said, thick arms crossed across his big chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony rolled his eyes and sat back down at the computers, Bruce looking over his shoulder.  \"If it is magic then you should be able to stop it by hitting it with a hammer, right?\" he said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be possible.  It is possibly simple mortal magic that cannot compare to that of me and my kin!\" Thor grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugged his shoulders, looking from Thor to the scientists, \"Worth a shot, right?  If he is using magic it's none of the alien stuff we know of.  Maybe it's just simple hypnotism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" Jarvis chimed in, making everyone turn to look at Tony's screen.  \"I believe I have found something of interest to you and the gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, what is it Jarvis?!\" Tony said, urging the AI to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The armored truck from the bank and the one from the jewelry store.  They have been spotted.  Warehouse 12, Pier 45.  Police reports say there is motion inside but they cannot get in without a warrant.  Reports also list that the landlord says only that the tenant currently utilizing the space paid for the entire year up front.  Perhaps it would be good to begin there, sir?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded and looked over at Thor.  They agreed he would be the next one to try and take this guy on.  If it was magic, he would know best how to counter it.  If not, he had the strength to fight it and the Feeder.  Though based on their previous encounters they knew to be careful.  They ensured he had a communication device on him along with a personal camera affixed to his chest piece so they could get footage of every moment of the fight.  Even if Thor fell they'd at least have some evidence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the slowly fattening Clint, Peter, and Steve all got some much needed rest, the rest of the Avengers watched a monitor as Thor made his way across the city to the pier.  When the god of thunder landed he saw that police cars had surrounded the warehouse but law enforcement had yet to make a move.  Thor approached the nearest officer, looking down at the much shorter man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anything changed?\"  The Asgardian asked, but the officer simple shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've detected movement inside through thermal imaging but we can't tell for sure if it's him or somebody else.  We've tried talking to whoever is inside but no response.  The person inside hasn't moved in a few minutes and there's also two large heat sources inside that we can't identify.\"  The officer informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, if it is this fiend he shall not escape this day!\"  Thor said, approaching the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde god approached the large steel door and gripped his hammer tight.  He raised it, ready to smash the door inward, but remembered that the person inside might not be The Feeder.  Thor lowered his weapon and placed his hand at the bottom of the door, lifting open the heavy steel with one hand before entering the dark warehouse.  Thor took several steps inside, looking around the pitch black room, before stopping when he realized he had snagged a trip wire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steel door slammed down and all of the lights flicked on at once revealing that the warehouse was empty save for two massive piles of doughnuts on either sides of the room, a huge monitor hanging from the ceiling, and a stuffed police officer who was resting against one of the piles; his belly bloated and huge from overeating.  Thor eyebrows furrowed and he gritted his teeth, angry at himself for having walked into such an obvious trap.  The god gripped his hammer tightly, ready for whatever was thrown his way, when Tony spoke to him through his ear piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor, get out of there!\"  Tony yelled to the God, but Thor's attention was brought to the monitor as it turned on - The Feeder's half-masked face on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't the God of Thunder himself!  Y'know, I didn't know who would show up but it's a pleasure to finally meet you, Thor.  Though I'm sorry it had to be digitally.\"  The Feeder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What business do you have with us, villain!\"  Thor asked, his pointed directly at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I don't really feel like discussing that just yet,\"  The Feeder replied, a grin on his face, \"Unfortunately, I have to cut our little talk short; two robberies <i>and</i> a trap in one day??  I'm pretty tried, to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face me, you coward!!\"  Thor demanded but the Feeder simply scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time; but for now, <i>why don't you enjoy some of my delicious cooking?</i>\"  The Feeder said, his voice seeping out through the speakers and borrowing it's way into Thor's ears.  The God's eyes flashed red and he grimaced, placing his hand over his eyes and trying to fight back his sudden urge to eat.  The Feeder watched eagerly as Thor gave in to his desire and made a bee-line to the closest pile, dropping Mj\u00f6lnir next to him and shoving doughnut after doughnut into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around, Thor!  Hopefully the next time we meet you'll have a body worthy of a god.\"  The Feeder said before lowering his mask and shutting off the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Tony exclaimed, slamming his hands down onto the table as he rose from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp,\" Wolverine said, his beefy arms crossing his massive chest, \"Somebody better go get him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well over four hours later when Thor was finally plugged into the machines at the tower to monitor his condition.  Thor had refused to leave the warehouse until every last pasty had been shoved into his gut, which was only possible thanks to his already enormous Asgardian appetite.  Monitors and charts beeped, blipped, and blooped as he, Clint, Steve, and Peter all slept on their examination tables - Tony and Bruce watching over their condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is odd.\"  Bruce said, getting Tony's attention.  The scientist flipped the hologram scream around so Tony could see and pointed at Thor's chart.  \"His metabolism has been altered like the others but he's digesting his food at a much faster rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that with Cap's chart as well,\" Tony replied, \"Clint and Peter's are both similar but Cap seems to be digesting faster as well.  Though, based on these charts it looks like Thor's digestion is faster than Steve's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's because Thor is an Asgardian and Steve's a Super Solider,\" Bruce explained, \"They already had increased metabolisms to be begin with.  I'm fairly certain this means they'll end up gaining weight the fastest as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably the case,\" Tony said, looking to his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClint had put on the most fat thus far, being the first to be hit, but the liquid diet that was being pumped into him was slowing down the process.  The once toned, 195-pound archer now weighed a hefty 300 pounds; having already gained 105 pounds to his slowly fattening body.  If it weren't for the liquid food being pumped into him Tony theorized that Clint would probably have already hit 450 by now.  Clint had already developed a double chin, his pecs were slowly becoming larger and puffier and his now fat, jiggly belly rose and fell as he slept.  He had developed lovehandles, his thighs had expanded even more, and his waistline and ass had clearly grown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's lithe frame had fattened up as well; though nowhere near Clint's size having only gained 50 pounds so far.  The now 210-pound wall-crawler's muscles had grown in size, giving him a similar build to what Clint had before The Feeder had attacked, but he was much softer all over.  His face had rounded out, his pecs were beginning to softer, and he a very noticeable pot-belly.  His waist, lovehandles, thighs, and butt had grown as well, but he was still the smallest of the four heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was already much larger than both Clint and Peter to begin with, and while Clint had gained the most body fat out of all of them, Steve actually weighed more than archer.  The Captain was a hefty 335 pounds, having already gained 70 pounds since falling under the villain's effects.  The fat was mostly concentrated on Steve's stomach, his once rock hard abs having been replaced with large, fat gut, but he was clearly bigger all over.  His muscles had grown some and he had lost very little definition outside of his stomach, but the effects of his slowly increasing weight gain were clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor was the heaviest of all four, however, though he was always the heaviest member of the team to begin with; The Hulk withstanding.  The God's body had already digested the dozens of doughnuts he had eaten in the warehouse but the effects had only just begun to kick in.  The 340-pound Asgardian had only gained 25 pounds so far - enough to clear away some of the definition on his abs and give his midsection a slight curve but not enough to make the thunder god seem more than simply bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could...,\" Tony sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose as he thought, \"I don't know...  I was already tired this morning when we started all this nonsense and now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're running on fumes?\"  Bruce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The empty lights been on for hours.\"  Tony admitted, \"I don't want to stop until we figure out how to stop this but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need rest.\"  Cap said, startling both the scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you were up.\"  Tony said, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just happened.  Listen, Tony,\" Cap started, sitting up, his belly spilling over his star-spangled briefs, \"There's no point in working this hard if you're so exhausted you can't even think.  A solider needs his rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, Tony,\" Bruce added, \"The Feeder even said he's done for the night, and if that's a lie, we have Falcon and Wolverine out there on patrol.\"  Tony looked at Steve, then to Bruce, then back to Steve, and chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Tony added, \"I'm gonna hit the hay for a bit; Wake me if anything happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" Bruce said as he watched the billionaire shuffle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night-</span></div></div>",

That and the snoring from the four large men laying across the tables.  Jarvis continued to monitor their vitals, marking off the numbers every hour for a report that would be generated for Tony once he woke up.  Though things seemed to be no different than earlier.  Vitals were fine, weight was climbing.  Even the AI was stumped as to what could be going on.  Even brain patterns seemed to be normal.  A bit more stimulation from the stress of the event but nothing too far out of the ordinary to be alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, one of them began to wake.  Thor opened his eyes and looked up at the ceiling, sighing.  His belly rumbled hungrily in the quiet, audible to anyone who hadn't been passed out.  Between him and Steve, he had the crazier metabolism and digestion.  By now, all of those doughnuts he'd eaten were nothing more than calories floating in him to become fat and he was hungry for more.  The liquid diet was keeping his body stable but it wasn't food or filling.  That was where the scientists had gone a bit wrong.  Thor and Steve would need something more in order to actually feel fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god grunted again as he got up, feeling his belly sag over his waist.  His eyes roamed his body in the dim light and he could see that he wasn't too bad off compared to the others.  Clint looked downright fat now while Thor looked simply a little out of shape in the tummy.  Reaching back he felt that that also applied to his butt.  Nothing he couldn't fix though, right?  Plus the effects weren't as bad on him so maybe he'd be okay for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his stomach rumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up out of \"bed\", tugged the electrodes off his body, and started to plod toward the hallway.  The kitchen was nearby and there was likely something left over from everyone else's dinners.  Though as he made his way down the hall, Jarvis followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I recommend you return to bed and return the monitors to your body,\" the AI said like a parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor waved a thick hand, \"I will, I will.  I simply need real nourishment.  The man of iron and the doctor have done well to craft their potion but it is not a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we do not know exactly what food will do to your body and we cannot take the risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor stopped at the doors to the kitchen, letting them slide open and walked inside without another word.  Sighing, he looked around the room at the bare center island and counters.  Nothing had been left out.  Now he was getting really hungry.  He started to walk toward the refrigerator, feeling an intense hunger for... something... anything!  He could remember eating all of those doughnuts now.  He could remember how each one tasted and how good they were.  When he arrived back at the tower he couldn't remember anything after the Feeder appeared on the screen but now he was getting flashes of the joy he felt when gorging.  What was a bit troublesome was that he enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was the Feeder's magic,\" Thor mumbled as he put his hand on the handle of the fridge door.  \"Though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he wanted to eat them.  Seeing the piles had made him hungry.  He had wanted to try them.  See what they were like since the others had seemed to like them so much.  It was as if the Feeder had... His thought trailed off as he opened the fridge and was met with the bright light and tons of food.  The god was all but drooling now!  Thick hands reached inside and started to pull containers out while tearing tops off of tupperware.  Thor tilted the tubs to his mouth and swallowed things down, barely chewing.  He guzzled the drinks, chomped through the veggies, ate sandwich fixings without bothering to actually make the sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Jarvis uttered, making sure to note this down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor panted and continued gorging.  It was like some sort of gate had been unlocked.  Like the part of him that restrained himself from gorging like a god at a victory feast was blasted apart to allow the glutton in him free.  It was so intense he didn't even realize the floor around him was littered with empty containers and torn wrappers.  His hand groped inside the fridge for more, finding only a bottle of salad dressing.  With a shrug, he tore the top off and chugged back the bottle of ranch like it was water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... bbbbbuuuUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPP!\" bellowed the god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled back against the center island and saw his gut was rounded out even further from all the food he'd crammed into it.  A hand went to the side and rubbed it as he groaned from how full he felt now.  He also felt a heavy feeling inside of him.  Whatever was going on was working to digest his mini-feast.  Though it was just one feast... How bad could it really be, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I have... overdone it... as they say,\" he mumbled as he started back for bed, shutting the door but leaving the mess.</span></div></div>",

I had suggested against it but he insisted he was fine. I would have cleaned it up but I thought you should see this.\" Jarvis's voice echoed.

In fact, none of this is,\" Tony said. \"Where is Thor now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is safely back in his room although at a bigger size than he was before,\" Jarvis said. \"The meal last night seemed to trigger something.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can get that out of my head. That was disturbing to say the least.\" Tony headed to the room where Clint, Steve, Peter, and Thor were being monitored. All of them were still asleep somehow and Tony headed over to Thor's bed. Honestly, Tony had no idea how the others were still asleep. Thor's snoring was monstrously loud and Tony had to fight the urge to cover his ears. Perhaps it was part of whatever the Feeder had done to them to be able to sleep like the deaf. No wonder they didn't notice Thor getting up and sneaking out. Steve especially would have at least been aware under normal circumstances. None of this was normal however. Gripping the bed covers, Tony tried to carefully slide them down to see but all of a sudden, Thor's eyes snapped wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iron Man, what are you doing?\" Thor asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Were you up out of bed last night?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I got hungry. Your potion, as acceptable as it is, was not enough to quell my hunger. I had to go and find actual nourishment.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, that wasn't a very good idea. We don't know what it could do. Until we find a way to fix this, I seriously don't think you should eat actual food. Also, you left a mess in my kitchen and chugged Salad Dressing of all things, that's just gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry for making a mess. I will go clean it up. I don't know what came over me but I had to have something to eat.\" Thor pushed the blanket aside and got up. Tony stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the matter?\" Thor asked confused.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think your 'meal' had a bit more impact than expected,\" Tony said pointing to Thor's midsection. He still had the definition of abs but his stomach was rounded out instead of flat and looked like Thor swallowed a barrel. It was pretty impressive actually how Thor still had a thick solid muscle gut with not much bounce unlike Steve, Peter, and Clint who definitely had more flab. Tony checked the scans. \"It looks like you've put on about 80 pounds overnight, Thor\" Tony said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel no different and 80 pounds? That's not so unreasonable,\" Thor said, going to put his armor on. He winced a little as he snapped it on. \"It is an inconvenience at best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where are you going?\" Tony asked.<br>\r\n\"To find this Feeder and give him a piece of my mind about what I think of his methods.\"<br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" Tony said, grabbing Thor's bicep. <br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we have no idea where he is, who he is, and what he's doing. He's already infected Steve, Peter, you, and Clint. We can't risk anybody else going after him without some sort of plan and knowing how it is that he is messing with your minds. He's been picking us off one by one and I don't like that whatever he is doing has affected even you and Captain America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Then can I have breakfast?\"<br>\r\n\"What? You already ate everything in the fridge last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did what?!\" screamed Clint who had woken up as soon as Tony had said that. \"You're saying Thor ate everything?\"<br>\r\n\"Everything that was stored in the refrigerator, yes. However, it would have definitely been a bad idea for you though Hawkeye as you would have blown up even further like Thor and Steve and unlike them you don't already have a super metabolism and will just get fatter than you already are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClint groaned as his stomach let out a very loud audible growl. \"But I'm hungry,\" he groaned. <br>\r\n\"He certainly is,\" said Thor. \"I was like that last night.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that is not good..hey Bruce?\" he tapped on his communicator. \"Do you have any more of the liquid supplement? I think the hunger is even worse than yesterday. Thor ate everything in the fridge and Hawkeye sounds like his stomach is going to swallow itself if it doesn't have something soon. It's rather loud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way,\" and in a rather very brief period of time, Dr. Banner came in with more vials of the liquid and handed them to Hawkeye and Thor. \"Here you go.\" Thor immediately chugged it then sighed sadly. \"I mean no offense good doctor but the potion isn't working to get rid of the hunger. If anything,\" Thor winced. \"I think it made it worse.\" Now it seemed like Thor's stomach was calling loudly, even louder than Clint's if that was possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not good,\" Bruce said. <br>\r\n\"Ya think?\" Tony said sarcastically as Thor started to bellow about how hungry he was. \"It doesn't seem to be working anymore.\" The racket had finally woken up Steve and Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" The Captain asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, except that the solution has seemed to stop working for the moment somehow. In fact, it somehow made it worse for Thor.\" Hawkeye grabbed a vial from Bruce's pocket and chugged it before letting out a sigh of relief.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels better,\" Clint groaned.<br>\r\n\"Did it really work on you?\" Tony asked. <br>\r\n\"Well a little. I don't feel like I'm being stabbed apart from the inside any longer in hunger,\" Clint said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it worked for Clint and not Thor, that's interesting,\" Tony mused. <br>\r\nSuddenly Thor bolted up and started marching out. \"I cannot take it any longer. I need food now!\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, Thor, no...\" Tony started but Thor was already swinging his hammer around and lifting off to go.<br>\r\n\"They never listen do they? Well, as long as its to get food I guess and not to try to go another round with the Feeder, he will be alright. Just...bigger. <br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of...have to agree with Thor Tony,\" Steve said.<br>\r\n\"Come on not you too!\" Tony said exasperated. Steve gave him a salute and was off, running at a speed that was actually kind of surprising given how much he had grown from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there were two,\" said Spiderman, Peter Parker.<br>\r\n\"What, you don't want actual food?\"<br>\r\n\"No, trust me, I do, I really do but I can't exactly risk adding that much weight yet unlike Thor and Captain America. This is awkward enough as it is,\" he said, looking at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do about the Feeder?\" Sam Wilson asked walking in. \"He's no ordinary villain or supervillain and has been beating us at every turn.\"<br>\r\n\"Well for now, he has only been committing small type robberies on banks and jewelry stores. It's annoying but at least he hasn't gone after anything like a science lab or military base yet. I mean, until we figure out a way to protect ourselves from whatever he's doing, I think we could leave him alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what if he doesn't leave us alone? He knows that we can be affected by him and that the Avengers are vulnerable. It is also known he already humiliated four of us, including Thor and Captain America. That is terrifying actually, that he was even able to affect an Asgardian and a Supersoldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I don't know. We better get back to work finding a cure for whatever he's doing and seeing if there is a way to undo whatever he has done and to get rid of that extra weight if possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor landed in front of a bakery and inhaled the scents. His stomach rumbled approvingly and he actually found himself drooling. The smells, they were so good. He walked inside and the place fell silent as everybody stared in awe and whispers of \"Thor!\" and \"Thor's here went throughout the room. There were even humans taking pictures. Thor walked up to the counter and put on his best smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...Puck,\" he said to the cashier standing there, scanning his name tag. \"I'd like all of your finest donuts please.\" Puck looked at Thor.<br>\r\n\"All of them?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, all of them. I'm feeling mighty famished and I need their sweet sugary substance.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" he smiled. \"I can't believe I got to serve the Thunder God Thor himself. It is an honor to meet you in person.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, well, it is an honor to meet you too, purveryor of breakfast miracles. People like you are very valuable in having the goods that provide energy. How much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay. You can have them all on me,\" Puck smiled. \"You've saved the world how many times over now? I think you deserve all you can handle for that.\" <br>\r\n\"Then I thank you again fair Puck.\" Thor looked over at the fourteen boxes Puck pulled out. He licked his lips, eager to bite into the delicacies. <br>\r\n\"I hope you come again,\" Puck said.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I will,\" Thor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. They will be, I promise you that.\" Puck grinned and waved as Thor exited. Thor waved back and went to the park so he could dig into his prize in peace. This was going to be messy and he didn't want to terrify anybody in the bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve went towards a pancake house. If he was going to put on weight, he figured he might as well eat the good stuff since the formula not only for whatever reason didn't work today, it made things so much worse. Only bottomless pancakes would fill the bottomless pit that seemed to have opened up in his stomach, despite the excess flesh that shouldn't be there. He had to mull on that. He had never really been fat before since the first part of his life he had been a skinny kid with no muscle but a lot of heart, and a well built perfect specimen after that with perfect defined muscles. Having a gut was quite unusual for him and as soon as he sat down at a booth and the menu placed in front of him, he had to feel for himself. It didn't actually feel too bad but that wasn't good either. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve stopped playing with his now fleshier middle, grabbing the hem of his white, skin tight underarmor shirt and tugging down over his chunky belly.  Steve had gained a good 15 pounds overnight - putting his weight at an even 350, and it really showed.  The formerly-fit super solider now sported a a hefty, fat gut that spilled over his waistline and stretched his shirt tight; the fabric kept riding up over and exposing Steve's gut and growing love handles.  His pecs and pecs has grown as well, larger and beefier, but more rounded and puffy than defined like before.  Steve's thighs and ass had doubled in size also, his exercise pants clinging to his beef and his ass bouncing with each step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain pushed opened the door to the pancake house he'd found and finding himself tugging down the hem of his shirt once more.  From the looks of it the place had just opened for the day and he was their first customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Steve said, \"Table for one, please.\"  The employee showed Steve to an empty table and Steve lowered his heft down at his usual pace, which was apparently too fast for the chair as it creaked under his still slowly increasing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came in at a good time!\"  The waiter said, \"We're running a special today; dollar double stacks!  Our normal stacks are 3 buttermilk pancakes but the double stacks are 6 and today they're all-you-can-eat for a dollar a stack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great, I'll take that and some milk.  Start me off with 10 stacks.\"  Steve said, handing the employee back the menu that he hadn't opened.  Steve sat back in his chair, his hands resting on the shelf that was his belly, as we relaxed and waited for his meal.  As irritating as this whole situation was with The Feeder, he had to admit his new, fleshier frame was... nice.  Comfortable, even.  A good 15 minutes went by before the waiter returned, carrying two big trays with 5 double stacks each and began to set them down in front of the fat superhero.  Once done, the waiter placed Steve's milk, along with a big, ice cold pitcher of the drink, down on the table and hurried off to continue his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sat forward and licked his lips, rubbing his hands together before grabbing a bottle of blueberry syrup and smothering the first stack with it.  Without a second thought, Steve grabbed his fork and knife and dug in, cutting out a good chunk of the fluffy cakes and stuffing them into his mouth.  The second they hit his tongue Steve's eyes shot open and his stomach growled loudly and the american-hero found himself  shoveling in the food as fast as he could.  It was as if he'd never eaten a day in his life - devouring his plate in less than a minute before grabbing the next one and scarfing it down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve ate a lightning fast pace, plate after plate quickly sliding down his throat and piling up in his gut.  The waiter took notice of this and approached Steve, \"Everything okay, sir?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Steve said between bites, \"Just... double my order...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. sure!\"  The employee said before turning around.  He didn't go far as Steve grabbed his shirt sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\"  Steve said, \"Bacon and eggs - a lot of it... I can afford it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  The man said before heading into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Steve had finished off his last bite of pancakes the waiter returned, along with another waiter who was on staff, carrying a total of 20 double stacks.  As soon as the first plate was set down Steve dug in, scarfing it down as quickly as he could.  As Steve devoured plate after plate another waiter returned, setting down a massive plate of bacon and a huge plate of scrambled eggs.  Steve ate and ate at lightning speed, pausing every now and then to chug some milk or gobble down bacon and eggs, his gut expanding with each bite as food filled it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's under armor slowly creeped it's way up Steve's growing gut as he packed in more and more food, the button on his pants popping off mid way through.  Steve was finally starting to slow down, only a few bites left, and once he finished off the last plate the waiter returned, another 20 stacks on his tray, and set them down in front of Steve.  Steve looked at the stacks and then down at his gut - which took up his entire lap, had doubled in size, and was rock solid and stuffed tight.  Steve wanted to stop, already stuffed to his limit, but his hunger demanded more and he dug in, devouring the last 20 plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final piece of food slid down Steve's throat as he sat back in his chair, which groaned under his weight, and The Captain grunted - bloated and stuff beyond belief.  His gut was massive and tight as drum, and the blonde beefcake did all he could to soother his now painfully bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"  The waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... no.  Thank you, though, and... sorry about how rough I was with you.\"  Steve apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" the waiter said, \"Here's you're bill, $79.40.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve reached into his wallet and produced a one-hundred dollar bill, \"Here,\" He said, \"Keep the change.\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't surprised to see Steve like this after being affected by the Feeder, but he was shocked to see how big he was now. Steve looked like he probably ate the restaurant out.\"I'd ask what happened here, but I think I already know,\" Sam said edging his way in. \"Come on Cap, time to go.\" He moved over to where the Captain was sitting for the moment after being unsteady on his feet and tried pulling him up. \"Uh, Steve, help me a bit. You're really heavy.\" Steve nodded and when Falcon pulled, Steve unsteadily got up, his massively bloated belly slamming against Sam and almost knocking him down from the weight of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Steve said blushing.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, let's just go before something else happens,\" Sam said as he pulled Steve along behind him with an unsteady gait, not used to this weight distribution. Getting into the limo, Falcon pulled Steve in behind him. \"So uh, what happened in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate pancakes, eggs, and bacon. It was delicious,\" Steve said, licking his lips which still had a sticky spot from Maple Syrup. <br>\r\n\"How much?\" Falcon asked. <br>\r\n\"Let's see, I think like 50 stacks of pancakes and platter of eggs and bacon.\"<br>\r\n\"How many are in a stack?\" Falcon asked.<br>\r\n\"There were about six in each so apparently approximately 300 fluffy golden wonders.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a miracle you don't explode,\" Sam said. \"I want to see what effect it has had on your body and metabolism.\"<br>\r\n\"The Feeder is a dangerous threat like nothing we have ever seen before,\" Steve said.<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah he is. I have never seen anything quite like this,\" Sam said staring at Steve's body. \"Honestly, I am wondering if I can figure out a way to stop him.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Falcon. If anyone can, you will\" Steve said, then let out a massive burp. \"Ooof, excuse me,\" Steven blushed.<br>\r\n\"Um, it's okay. I really hope so,\" Falcon said. \"As of now, I don't have much to go on other than that his power lingers and he is really good at persuading people and infected our best heroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are important Sam,\" Steve argued. <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah I know but just from power levels overall, the Feeder has certainly knocked you guys down.\" When they reach Avengers Tower, Sam pulled Steve inside. \"I want to conduct some more tests on you. You've grown again from today and really, 300 pancakes?\" <br>\r\n\"They were light, comparatively speaking.\" Steve said.<br>\r\n\"Well still, I want to do some more tests on you.\" Walking Steve to the Testing Room took a lot longer than usual what with Steve's huge bloated gut swaying back and forth every step. Eventually they reached inside and he had Steve get onto the scale first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"378 pounds a gain of 28 from this morning after only one meal. Still, not really a big surprise considering the breakfast you had. I was worried it was going to be higher somehow. I guess at least a part of your metabolism still works to digest the food somewhat properly? Anyways...\" he put Steve on the table. \"It looks like your clothes are ruined,\" Falcon said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" <br>\r\n\"Want me to make new ones that will be able to stretch and accomodate any size you wear in case you get bigger? Not that I want you to get bigger or anything but this is a challenge I have always wanted to do. What was that movie again, the Incredibles? Totally designing a super suit for you Captain. Also going to work on one for Hawkeye, Thor, and Spiderman. I especially don't want to see Hawkeye or Spiderman without one.\" Sam shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're okay with Thor?\" Steve asked amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No comment,\" Sam said. \"Now let's see here...\" he started squeezing and feeling around Steve's body, feeling it with the stethoscope. \"Everything seems normal, breathing a little heavier but that's not surprising as your body is bigger and needs more oxygen, but vitals are all good, if not better. It's amazing but other than the whole food eating thing, the Feeder has actually made your body more healthy and able to convert into energy than before. I mean, even more super than your super enhanced status.\" He took of the stethoscope and removed the other wires of electrodes he attached. As he did so, Falcon rubbed his hands over Steve's chest, squeezing the thick sagging but still strong pecs which were still solid as a rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Steve said as Falcon went lower and rubbed his still aching belly that still bothered Steve. There was a quiver to it and it jiggled a bit more than he liked but it wasn't bad. \"What are you doing?\" Steve asked. Falcon continued to explore, his hands feeling out Steve's newly developed love handles and rounded out paunch. Steve coughed again. \"Falcon, what are you doing?\" Falcon looked up for a minute and blinked. \"Um what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Steve asked a third time. <br>\r\n\"I'm checking to make sure everything's okay.\"<br>\r\n\"By squeezing and rubbing it?\" Steve asked. There was a moment of blank uncertainty for a moment before Sam nodded yes. <br>\r\n\"That's right. Squeezing and rubbing to make sure everything's okay.\" Falcon said. Steve narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. There was something going on here, he just didn't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the park, Thor was celebrating his acquisition of the donuts, reverently opening up the first box. \"Oh mighty and wondrous sugary substance, may your energy lift my hammer on this fine day...\" before immediately shoving the first one into his mouth. He moaned in ecstasy at the taste. These were the best donuts he ever had! With a cry of excitement, Thor started bringing as much donuts to his face as possible, filling his mouth up with sugar, jelly, cream, on the inside donuts. There seemed to be something familiar about this motion and he had a brief flash to when he had first run into the Feeder. The feeder had him eat donuts like these to free Mjolinir and then somehow the memories were scattered in his mind. For a second though, Thor was sure he had it before the smell and taste of the donuts wafted over and scattered Thor's thoughts all over again. Swallowing heavy, he sighed and licked his lips and teeth of donut innards before grinning and opening the new box, stuffing as many donuts as he could at one time into his mouth. It was about four but he kept going. Driven by compulsion and the taste of the donuts, Thor continued to eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround box 8, Thor had to pause as he was feeling lightheaded and squished. It took him a bit of digging before he figured out what was wrong. His armor was too tight! With only a vague misgiving, Thor undid the armor straps and took the metal off, freeing his bloated gut that had been trapped, push against the sides. He let out a sigh of relief as his stomach spilled out to fill the open space now  that it wasn't pushed in. It drooped a little over Thor's belt but he was still mighty hungry so he resumed eating the donuts. Going from box to box, he consumed donut after donut, not noticing or caring how his stomach expanded out further and further. Soon all the boxes were gone and Thor pawed the bottom of the last box and was disappointed to find it empty. Shaking his head, Thor broke whatever trance he was in while eating the donuts was gone. Thor already looked bigger and heavier, especially with his bloated stomach protruding. Thor pounded his gut and let out a long massive burp. Getting up, he looked around. Fortunately there was still nobody to see his embarassment. Picking up the pieces of his old armor, Thor flies off to Avenger's Tower and when he landed, the earth around his landing shook a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor tried sneaking in but he was caught by Dr. Banner. <br>\r\n\"Ah Thor, I wanted to see you.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes doctor? <br>\r\n\"I was just curious and wanted to see first hand when you got back what was going on.<br>\r\n\"Nothing is going on. Other than that,\" said Thor. <br>\r\n\"Shut up. get ready/\"<br>\r\n\"Freddy in what way?\"<br>\r\n\"No ready,\"</span></div></div>",

He typed a few things in to set up some tests and stood back as they ran.  Brow furrowed, he shook his head at the results that were coming up.  Every model that was being displayed to predict the outcome of what was going on showed Thor swelling bigger and bigger.  The best possible scenario would be that he'd stop around 800 pounds in a few months but even that had a low percentage rate of happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears his midnight snack and his breakfast are activating whatever it is in his mind that controls this... change...\" Jarvis said to Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor nodded, \"Yeah, I see that.

I require true food.  I must eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll just be another day or two.  Tony and I can figure this out,\" Bruce sighed, rubbing his eyes and hoping that Thor would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I will eat food,\" Thor said, starting to get a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thor!\" shouted Bruce, stopping himself and trying to hold back.  \"Thor.  I told you.  You cannot eat real food until we figure this out.  You're only activating what The Feeder did to you and if you do that...

Thor ate the first donut and was in the same trance as before with the food. Thor started shoving food in his mouth as much as he could. Thor always had a huge appetite, but now with an enormous gut, he ate more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thor only had a box or 2 left from his 14 boxes, the feeder was on his way to his next crime scene. He swiftly walked and saw Thor stuffing himself on the bench that seemed like it was about to break.<br>\r\n\"I see Thor is still under my trance, why not help him a bit?\" The Feeder asked himself. He quietly approached the hungry superhero and took his empty boxes and filled them with donuts. The Feeder also gave Thor more boxes, triple his original amount, and filled those too. Thor sat in front of 42 full boxes of dozens of donuts and he continued eating without noticing The Feeder. Thor ate faster and faster after each bite, and before Th Feeder could go along with his plans, Thor had eaten 10 boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Feeder considered sticking around to refull Thor, and decided he would. The Feeder refilled the empty boxes. The Feeder wanted to fill Thor so much so by the time he noticed him, he wouldn't be able to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor ate and ate, donut after donut. Although he was eating at lightning speed, he devoured each donut and admired the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boxes got empty and refilled Thor's shirt was starting to rip. Before his eating spree of donuts Thor couldn't get his shirt to cover his belly button, but now Thor sat in a shirt with holes, filled with fat bulging out. Most of Thor's fat went to his belly, growing more and more. After Thor finished his 72nd box, his shirt completely ripped off exposing his huge enormous belly. After finishing his 95th box the bench fell under Thor's weight, and he began to slow down. Th Feedef fled, and Thor was left unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good.\" he said, content. \"Where did these extra boxes come from? - I guess I ordered more than I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later the mobile avengers reported to the scene, seeing everything from the cameras back at the Tower.<br>\r\n\"Thor the Feeder filled you up again!\" Bruce said worried. \"What will happen to your metabolism now?!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night Wolverine and Falcon were out on patrol. The two heroes each went to a different part of the city. Falcon was paroling the suburbs while Wolverine would patrol downtown. As Wolverine drove his motorcycle he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary yet. Several night owls were having the time of their life as they partied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is peaceful. A little too peaceful. I think I may have to do a thorough investigation. I swear the Feeder is here. I can smell the faint odor of a mutant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine then parks his motorcycle in the parking lot of a fairly new club called Delectable Delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delectable Delights? I've heard rumors of this place. It seemingly opened the same night the Feeder made his mark. Might as well see if he's here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine enters through the clubs double doors. Once inside he sees several fat men chowing down on burgers and drinking their fill of exotic drinks that were being blended by the female bartender. He also noticed that on the center stage several dancers were dressed in food themed clothing which were designed to provoke one's own desires to gorge himself if he watched their seemingly hypnotic dance. He then approaches the counter to ask the bartender if she noticed anything unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me tuts, but have you seen an alleged criminal dressed in red and white who calls himself the Feeder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't. It's my first night working here. I'll go get the owner. I'm sure he might be able to answer your question sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender quickly excuses herself as she enters the kitchen which led to her boss's office. It was shortly after that the performers started to leave the stage as they danced toward Wolverine carrying trays of the different types of food that they were dressed after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a free sample mister?\" A woman wearing a fastfood uniform and a burger styled hat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mister! We won't get paid if our customers don't try a free sample!\" A woman dressed as a chocolate bunny pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no. If you don't pestering me then I might pin you to a wall. I'm on an important job right now trying to catch a nutcase who calls himself the Feeder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nutcase? It's not polite to insult someone who you haven't met, especially if he happens to own this place.\" Came a new masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wolverine turned around he saw none other than the Feeder himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You're the Feeder! You're going to pay for what you did to my friends!\" Wolverine growled as he extended his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Wolverine. It would be easy to hypnotize you, but not until my minions have some fun. Feedettes, feed him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning the women dressed in food themed clothing begin attacking Wolverine by attempting to use magic to shove their respective dish down his throat. Wolverine quickly sliced up the food before it could reach his face. The Feedettes then  use their special food based powers to summon the food they were dressed as in order to forcefeed Wolverine. Wolverine quickly dodges the assaults and begins slashing the Feedetes with his claws. This however is where he made his mistake. The Feedettes begin their mesmerizing dance to create food barriers to protect themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Wolverine? Can't handle my Feedettes?\" The Feeder scoffed as he began to lift up his mask to reveal his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will put an end to you and your minions if it's the last thing I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Why don't you just sit back relax and gorge on all of this delicious food. Let the Feedettes stuff you with their delicious treats.\" The Feeder said in a hypnotically soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Never!\" Wolverine yelled as his eyes glowed red for a brief period while trying to fight off the hypnotism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard Wolverine struggle the hypnotism finally took full control as a Feedette stuffed a chocolate bunny into his mouth. As soon as he ate the chocolate bunny Wolverine started devouring anything piece of food the Feedettes offered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would stay and watch, but I have other business to attend to. The next time we meet I'm sure my Feedettes will have more fun stuffing full of delicious treats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Feeder then makes his exit by walking out the backdoor. It wasn't until early in the morning that Falcon discovered that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The night's over and still word from Logan. Something tells me that a certain someone ran into Wolverine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcon then flies downtown to find Wolverine. As he is flying he catches a glimpse of Wolverine's motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Wolverine, he decided to get personal and ask people if they spotted the Feeder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcon then lands and walks into Delectable Delights. To his horror he saw Wolverine out cold in a food coma. It seemed that the mutant put on at least 40 pounds of fat and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ironman, we have an issue. The Feeder has infected Wolverine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Not again! We'll be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sam contacted Tony Logan's gut bulged as his body converted his late night feast into five more pounds of fat. It was thirty minutes later that Wolverine was brought to the tower and hooked up. Unfortunately he gained another five pounds bring him to 350 pounds. As Sam was catching up on some sleep Bruce and Tony were arguing on how to stop the Feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hulk! We can't charge in and take the Feeder head on! We don't know what he's capable of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take him if we call my agents of S.M.A.S.H. I know enough that with my cousin's help and two other Hulks and yourself we can definitely smash him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting the point! Just calm down and we can work on a strategy together with your agents of S.M.A.S.H. and some of our female Avengers! I know that Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne should be returning from there missions. We also have Captain Marvel returning from her missions as well. Just hear me out Bruce! I know this whole Feeder issue has gotten on your nerves. He's driving me crazy as well.

As the two heroes arrived on the scene cop cars were already parked outside. Unfortunately the male officers were gorging themselves on fastfood, sweets, and soda. Meanwhile the female guards were standing guard at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What matter of nonsense is this? The men gorge themselves on earthly delicacies while the women do nothing. Some foul magic is at play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells like a demon to me and maybe mutant as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you arrive Wolverine? I thought you would be with the others. With your help we can bring this Feeder of men to Justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be too sure about that. In fact there is no way you'll stop me!\" The Feeder exclaimed as he and a lady dressed in business attire stood at the doorway to the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare to be vanquished Feeder of men foe your time has come! Wolverine, see that his hostage is escorted to safety while I vanquish this fiend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thor engages the Feeder in combat Wolverine tries to save the woman standing in the doorway. The woman's black hair almost covered her eyes and her fair complexion glistened in the sun. Unfortunately for Wolverine the hypnotized female officers started to fire their guns at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Argh!!! What is up with these women?! Could the Feeder be controlling them too?</i> Wolverine thought as he was being pelted with bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine knocks the female officers unconscious and removes the bullets in his body using his claws. Once removed Wolverine's wounds heal as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming with me! The sooner we get you out of her the sooner you'll be free of the Feeder's control!\" Wolverine said as he took the woman by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm here on my own accord. I was just here to discuss the new dance club my tenant wanted to purchase!\" The woman responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen lady, but your tenant is an alleged criminal. I don't know what damn lies he told you, but you must not stay here!\" Wolverine argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm fine. More than fine. I actually feel quite wicked right now.\" The landlady responded as her skin began turning mint green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wolverine's eyes the seemingly innocent, but stubborn landlady transformed into what one would say a witch wearing a black motorcycling outfit adorned with a black hat usually worn by magicians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're working with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Wolvie boy. The Feeder has a revolutionary plan for reforming the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds insane! So you're just going to help him commit crimes and fatten men up like whales. That sounds sick if you ask me!\" Wolverine said as he extended his claws in order to attack the wicked landlady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine then jumped at the landlady, but the landlady used her magic to dodge the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Wolvie? Can't hit me?\" The landlady scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine responds by lunging at the landlady and slicing her with his claws. However, this caused her to split into five more duplicates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell! You got to be kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was kidding you then I wouldn't be the Wicked Witch of the West Coast now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you're calling yourself! It sounds like it was taken out of a children's book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Thor was dealing with the Feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeder of men you are no match for Mjolnir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor throws his hammer at the Feeder, but the Feeder dodges it and then uses his powers to pin it to the ground with doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What matter of trickery is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's magic. The men and women you see can't resist my alluring voice. Whenever I speak women usually make out with me on the spot.\" The Feeder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What matter of creature are you? I have not seen magic of such potency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm demon. An Incubus to be exact, well half incubus and half human. Before my new powers manifested I could only control women, but when a great mist rolled on the earth I became a bit more than half incubus and half human per se.\" The Feeder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters not for I Thor Odinson will vanquish you today fiend! Mjolnir to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thor tried calling his hammer it was stuck under an evergrowing pile of food. The feeder then pins Thor to the ground with licorice and stuffs a chocolate bar into the Norse god's mouth. The Feeder lifts his mask to reveal his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want your toy then you're going to to have to eat that pile of food for it. After that you can eat these other piles of food. What's this? A camera hidden in your breastplate? I'll take that if you don't mind. My partner will have to alter the contents of this before I can let you have it back. Now go get your hammer.\" The Feeder said in a melodic, but hypnotic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor's eyes glow red briefly before he eats the licorice pinning him down and the pile of food that is burying his trusted hammer. As Thor was gorging himself Wolverine tried slashing the Wicked Witch of the West Coast, but no matter how hard he tried she kept replicating herself with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you give up yet Wolvie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never give up to a witch like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad Wolvie boy. This had been such a fun fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch of the West Coast converts her duplicates into electricity and shocks Wolverine. Wolverine was temporarily stunned, but it gave the Feeder enough time to put the mutant under his spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you met my landlady, but we have to go now. Why don't you sit back, relax and help yourself to some burgers, desserts and soda.\" The Feeder said in the same hypnotically soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine's eyes turn red before he starts eating from a pile of burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I found my lovely dear. The Avengers tagged Thor with a pesky camera. If you would do the honors of altering this footage so we can continue to work in the shadows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Feeder hands the camera over to the Wicked Witch of the West Coast, who uses her magic to alter the contents of the camera to a surprise party at the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it. Now they won't know a thing. I also cast a strong memory alteration spell so they remember you breaking into the supposed surprise party. That should be enough to keep them off our tail for now.\" The Wicked Witch of the West Coast said as she pooffed the camera back onto Thor's breastplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then poofs away by using her magic while the Feeder uses his armored truck to drive to his secret hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later Wasp and Captain Marvel arrived at the scene. The two ladies quickly noticed how Thor, Wolverine and the male officers were in food comas while the female officers just recovered from their hypnotism and being knocked out by Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but we need to contact Tony and the others.\" Captain Marvel responded as she took Thor's communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony, it's me Captain Marvel. We were just returning from our missions when we encountered both Wolverine and Thor in food comas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Carol, well be right there.\" Tony replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough an Avengejet came and picked up the four heroes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the tower Tony and Bruce were looking at the charts of their fallen comrades. Clint, the Feeder's first victim was 300 pounds. His form though doughy and pudgy and donning a double chin had layers of developing muscle underneath. Peter Parker, the smallest of those afflicted added 40 pounds to his frame and it was obvious that despite the new flab that he was also getting slightly buff. Captain America, Thor, and Wolverine were different stories. Due to their unique predicaments they were digesting faster and growing more quickly. Steve who was already heavier than Clint and was now 325 pounds. A fifty pound gain from his previous weight. Thor already being one of the heaviest, sans Hulk, only gained a mere twenty-five pounds bring him to 350 pounds. All of which made the Norse God look bloated. It was Logan that was the most complicated one. Despite originally slightly heavier than Steve by 10 pounds or so, thanks to his adamantium skeleton. It was his regenerative healing factor that he gained 35 pounds bringing the mutant up to the same weight as Captain America. After reviewing the chart they noticed Carol Danvers and Hop van Dyane standing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony, what do you guys know about this Feeder?\" Carol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that he can hypnotize men, and is possibly some kind of mutant magic user. We sent Thor to confront him, but as he and Wolverine arrived we lost contact with them and the audio and visuals on our systems went haywire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So some strange guy is running around robbing banks and fattening men? Have Wolverine and Thor remembered anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem. All they remember was the Feeder wrecking a surprise party for a police officer, but given the evidence prior I suspect that their memories have been altered.\" Bruce replied while trying not to lose his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there Bruce, you almost punched a hole in the wall trying to fix the malfunction in our equipment.\" Sam said trying to reassure the scientist before he Hulks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. A few hours ago I left to see if anyone one we know could be working with guy. In the end I did manage to stop the Leader from trying to gamafy everyone for the umpteenth time. By the time S.H.E.I.L.D. picked him up and after I returned that's when everything started working again and by then the Feeder already got away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there may someone helping the Feeder?\" Hope asked in a surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our new theory for the time being. With Bruce's escapade and the disturbance that caused our systems to go haywire there has to be more than meets the eye.\" Tony said as he brings up a screen showing places that the Feeder has been spotted. \"As you can see ladies the the areas marked in red is where we encountered the Feeder. The places in blue was before news was out of his minor burglaries. The places in green are the next targets that he may strike next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a well thought out diagram. It seems like there's a trend though. It seems like he's been making his way up to other heists. If he can hypnotize men then I'm sure he's making the women do the stealing for him. He may not have an interest in making the women stuff themselves, but I doubt he is beneath making them steal valuables and possibly cramming handfuls of food down the men's throats.\" Carol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol you're a genius! Jarvis compile a list of women at every crime scene. If we can ask these women we may be able to learn some more about this Feeder. In the meantime Bruce is working on a memory manipulation device that will help restore memories of his victims no matter how altered they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Scott Lang and my cousin. We could use the backup just in case the Feeder rears his red masked face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the Avengers started to lay down a plan to stop the Feeder once and for all. After their discussion they decided to retire for the night. Falcon and Captain Marvel  went out to patrol the city.</span></div></div>",

You're a fraud!\" Quicksilver yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quick intellect is amusing. You're right about that. I'm really\", The Leader starts changing forms. A green light envelopes his body. Once the light fades it is revealed that the Wicked Witch of the West Coast had been posing as the Leader. \"... the Wicked Witch of the West Coast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have Quicksilver.\" The Feeder said as he emerged from the armored truck with his mask above his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Feeder tries to pin Quicksilver down with some doughnuts, but Quicksilver proved too fast. The Feeder turns his attention to Captain Marvel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need a way to slow that guy down and I think it's time to show the Avengers that my powers are effective on women.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marvel charges at the Feeder. Unfortunately the Feeder pins her down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Captain Marvel. I have plans for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any part of your twisted scheme!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. I'm sure a clever woman like you has deduced that I can make women fall under my charm. Now Captain Marvel, I want you to feed Quicksilver for me. Force him to eat all these yummy treats so I may be able to work my magic on him.\" The Feeder said in a hypnotic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carol's eyes glowed red the Feeder kissed her on the lips. As he kissed her a strange energy surrounded the Feeder's body, making him stronger as his muscles bulged with new found strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Captain Marvel! Snap out of it!\" Quicksilver yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Carol has completely under the Feeder's control. Without a word she used her powers on Quicksilver and begun flinging food into his mouth. Quicksilver tried to fight off the brainwashed Captain Marvel, but she kept on blasting him with energy every time he would try to punch the Feeder. As Pietro tried to get up Carol forced a doughnut into his mouth. The Feeder then tries to hypnotize Quicksilver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quicksilver give up while you can. You can't stop me. Let Captain Marvel feed you all this yummy food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicksilver struggles to fight off the brainwashing, but with each new food item crammed into his mouth he felt his willpower weakening. It was after 30 doughnuts that the brainwashing took full control of Quicksilver. He then began eating everything that Captain Marvel gave him. By then the Feeder and his partnered loaded the truck with abandoned S.H.E.I.L.D technology and the Scarlet Witch. It wasn't until morning that some agents discovered the two superheroes passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Director Coulson, we found Captain Marvel and Quicksilver at the scene of the incident. Our plan to capture the Feeder failed. What should we do sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call the Avengers. Maybe we get them to help us with this guy. He's been a pain since we first encountered him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that.\"</span></div></div>",

Some might think him a bit arrogant, and he certainly could be, but he really had talent. Or at least had. The season had started off well but then a new team from a rivaling school had come and it wasn't pretty. To everyone's utter surprise and horror, the opposing Sentinels had utterly thrashed the Reindeer in what could only be described as a massacre. They hadn't scored a single goal. Then it happened again and again. The Sentinels might as well have been unstoppable and the entire team was despondent, Kristoff especially. This was personal as he had never before failed so bad, especially as team captain, and it was a horrible feeling. The Sentinels were well deserving of the title as they were such tall giant muscle behemoths that it seemed dubious that any of them were actually in college. It turned out they were but it still reeked of legal loop-holing but nobody could or wanted to prove anything. The co-captains of the opposing team were Snow and Thor who were some of the largest people he had ever seen and while most of the Sentinels were giant, they might as well have been gods. Kristoff had always thought he was tall but considering everybody on the Sentinels were over 6 feet, he was a shorty. No one could ever mistake Thor and Snow though as Thor was 6'4-6'5 or something and Snow was a ridiculous 6'7 and both were linebacker broad since they also played football and had muscles on their muscles. Kristoff was pretty big himself but compared to them, well, there was no contest really. Never in his life had Kristoff ever been so jealous even as he was angry they were ruining everything for him and his team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fourth loss in a row, they all just about had it. Kristoff as team captain had to suffer the heat and get a tongue lashing from their desperate coach. It was clear that unless something changed, the Sentinels were going to win every game and were pretty much an unstoppable force. Strategy didn't really work, not because it was bad and they did score a few points, but it had just become clear that it came down to physical size differences. The Sentinels were just plain bigger but other than their new players this year Snow and Thor, were just average. Had the two blonde hulks not decided to play this year or that they liked it, the team would have been only decent at best and while not entirely un-noteworthy, still minor overall. But the introduction of their new muscle turned them into an elite fighting force. You wouldn't have thought that people so big could move quick but they surprisingly did but colliding them was like running into a steel wall. It doesn't budge and they just bodily knocked people down left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they needed was essentially size. Strategy was almost entirely irrelevant as they were both decently fast on the ice but had such extreme length of reach and mass, it was just hard to get anything past them. More importantly, it would stop leaving people knocked to the floor every time they got slammed. They had quite a few people injured, people that would have been valuable, because they hadn't gotten out of the way fast enough and just got barreled into. And as team captain, the duty fell to Kristoff to inspire and lead the troops though he wasn't keen on getting slammed by either Snow or Thor either. It happened a couple of times which had left him dizzy and grounded for a time, but thankfully they never hit him together. He doubted that most anyone could withstand a coordinated hit and they had to send three over to the hospital that had the misfortune to being slammed by both at once. All had been laid out for the season with broken bones and one had a concussion but since it was legal, they couldn't really have Snow and Thor evicted unfortunately though they had tried. It really was unfair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristoff!\" Coach yelled loudly and he could tell he was angry. Bracing himself, Kristoff swallowed and headed to coach's office. He was in for it, he could tell. But even he was surprised when he got delivered an ultimatum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those blasted Sentinels....Snow and Thor! If I could have them banned from the hockey league I would and there is something fishy going on there because no way are they rookies but anyways...we have a big problem. I say a BIG problem. Those guys are behemoths and though you are the biggest guy on the team, they still outweigh by probably at least 120 or even more lbs. They're utter monsters and I have no idea how they got that way since steroid tests amazingly turned up negative, but for now the only thing to do to win is match them and you're going to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kristoff asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. You and the rest of the guys are going to do whatever it takes to become heavy enough that the terror duo Snow and Thor will have a much harder time of knocking you down. I also had considered breaking their legs but unfortunately that idea was nixed.\" Kristoff hoped Coach was joking but he had sounded serious and Kristoff himself entertained ideas such as that briefly after the humiliating first loss and the second loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying?\" Kristoff asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"I'm saying you and the rest of the team are going to all put on at least 100 lbs before the finals in a couple of months each and anyone who doesn't is off the team.\" Kristoff stared at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100 lbs in only 4 months! You can't be serious!\" Coach stared at him levelly. <br>\r\n\"Of course I can. It's entirely possible and only 25 pounds a months at minimum. Surely that's not hard for you to understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Well no, but that's extreme!\"<br>\r\n\"No, what's extreme is those Sentinel bastards having Snow and Thor to steamroll over everyone. We'll just send them a bit of their own medicine as other than those two, the rest of the team isn't that great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Kristoff agreed. \"But 100 pounds?\" The coach nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right. Since you're the star lets put you at least 150 pounds minimum.\" Kristoff stared in horror.<br>\r\n\"Umm...that's not what I meant.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but I'm telling you. 150 pounds for you as leader and our weapon against Snow or Thor, and 100 pounds everyone else minimum.\"<br>\r\nKristoff shook his head. \"But...\" he started and Coach glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impress me or you're off the team and you won't be considered for pro-league.\" Kristoff shuddered. Hockey was his life. He had always wanted to be a Pro Hockey player forever and he couldn't afford to lose his spot. But 150 or more pounds...this was starting to sound impossible. He was about to say so again but the look Coach sent him made it very clear that if he voiced anymore objections then Kristoff was canned. \"Tell the rest of those losers!\" Coach called as Kristoff left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh guys, it uh looks like we're going to be growing.\" Kristoff said. \"Everybody has to put on at least 100 pounds if not more by the start of the championship game against the Sentinels.\" They looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100 pounds?\" Jack asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Yes, 100 pounds everybody or they're off the team.\" Kristoff shuddered before adding, \"and for me that's 150.\" Everybody gasped. <br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" one asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't know yet,\" Kristoff answered. He was getting asked the impossible and even though Kristoff was big and excellent at working out, he wasn't sure how he was going to get everybody to gain that weight in the time they had left. At least, weight that would be functional and not a hindrance. He changed into his normal everyday clothes as he got ready to leave for work, still wondering what he was going to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to Oaken Ice's Ice Cream Parlor, Kristoff felt distraught as he had no idea what he was going to do and people could tell when he started scooping the ice cream. Usually he was a lot more cheerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" his friend Sven asked him, munching on a carrot. Sven was one of his best friends and had a thing for carrots, which made it kind of funny that he hung out at an ice cream store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know those two Sentinels Snow and Thor?\" Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"Who doesn't? Also, you complain about them all the time,\" Sven reminded. <br>\r\n\"Well, yes but anyways we lost again.\" Sven winced. <br>\r\n\"Ooh bummer. But not unexpected.\" Sven ducked when Kristoff flicked ice cream at him. <br>\r\n\"Jerk-off. Anyhow, yeah Coach has gone out of his mind.\"<br>\r\n\"In what way?\" Sven asked. <br>\r\n\"He's demanding everybody put on at least 100 pounds before the championship game in four months.\"<br>\r\n\"Those guys would still be bigger than you, they're monsters.\" Sven said. <br>\r\n\"Yes, well that is true but it would make getting smacked by them not as crippling and a couple of people might then actually be able to take out one or the other. It's not like the Sentinels are any good other than Thor or Snow.\"<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Sven said, taking another bite of carrot.<br>\r\n\"Well for me its 150 pounds,\" Kristoff muttered. Sven stared before giggling a bit.<br>\r\n\"Why are you laughing? This is not funny!\" Kristoff growled.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it kind of is. I'm just thinking of how big you're going to be. Man you're going to be fat,\" Sven poked Kristoff's gut. \"Say goodbye to those perfect abs haha.\" Sven laughed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know sometimes I really hate you,\" Kristoff said. He also shuddered too. He'd always been big but not like fat but getting that weight in such a short time would definitely result in a rather large beefy stomach. Snow had one too and sure knew how to throw it around but Kristoff hadn't seen that many hockey players with one and here he was trying to match with two behemoths. He was so totally screwed and he also had no idea how he was going to put on the weight in only a couple of months. He might as well resign now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't feel bad,\" Sven said. \"I think I know someone who can help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, you do?\" Kristoff said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah his name is Hans. He is a feeder and has experience with this.\"<br>\r\n\"Lets give it a try.</span></div></div>",

I contacted him but he charges way too much.  Besides,\" Sven said, pointing at the pudgy belly he sported, \"I think I did a pretty a good job on my own.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats true.\"  Kristoff said, \"I did offer to help you work out, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wanted fat - not muscle.\"  Sven corrected, \"Besides, you DID help me out.  All those cartons of ice cream you got me with your employee discount packed on the pounds quick.\"<br>\r\n\"How much did you gain again?\"  Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"A hundred pounds.\"  Sven said, \"Brought me up to 270.\"  He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sven stepped outside for a bit while he made the call which gave Kristoff some time to think.  He didn't WANT to put on 150 pounds - and coach said that was the MINIMUM.  What if he was forced to gain more?  No matter what, though, he had no other choice.  It was either gain weight or quit the team.<br>\r\nSven came in a few minutes later, \"Good news, buddie!!  Hans picked up and we're meeting him tonight at his house.\"<br>\r\n\"What about the price?  You said he was expensive.\"  Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"He is but I also called your coach.  He said the school will personally pay for Hans' expenses if it means getting their star player to fatten up.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting fat.\"  Kristoff said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are.\"  Sven replied, \"Its gonna happen.  You'll gain a LOT of muscle too but you're gonna also get fat.\"<br>\r\nKristoff sighed, \"Do you have his address?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~+~+~+~+~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff slowly pulled his car up to the gates of the giant mansion before him.  An enormous three story building with more rooms than Kristoff has ever seen for a house.  He rolled the window down and pressed the button on the intercom.  The speaker before him crackled before a voice came through, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm... hi.  My name is Kristoff Bjorgman and I'm here to see Hans?  A friend of mine called earlier a-\" Kristoff was cut off by the sound of the heavy metal gate sliding over.  He thanked the intercom and pulled up to the front door.  Kristoff adjusted his black and roodie hoodie to make sure it wasn't wrinkled, though the sleeves were strained because of his huge biceps, and walked up to the door.  He knocked and a butler opened the door, \"Follow me, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff followed the butler through the mansion and on his way through he several rooms with open doors.  Kristoff noticed about 12 other men in the house all doing various things ranging: watching tv, playing video games, reading, doing homework, working out, and eating.  One thing Kristoff noticed was how BIG they all were; from body builder sized muscles to sumo sized fat bodies and everything in between; all 12 of these guys were massive in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The butler opened the door and lead Kristoff in, \"Sir, a Mr. Kristoff Bjorgman is here to see you.\"<br>\r\nThe young man who was sitting at a desk on his laptop turned around in his chair, \"That'll be all.\"  he said.<br>\r\nAs the butler left the room Kristoff watched as the man stood and walked over to him; he was taller than Kristoff but not by much and unlike the other 12 men in the house he was lean; toned, but lean.  He was wearing a very expensive looking shirt with equally expensive looking designer jeans and boots.  He was defiantly handsome and his red mutton chops framed his face nicely, \"Sven called and told me everything, Kristoff.  The school has already paid for this so theres no turning back.\"<br>\r\nThe man held out his hand and smiled, \"I'm Hans Westergaurd.  Its nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff shook his hand, \"Nice to meet you too.\" Kristoff said, a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n\"SO,\" Hans started, \"To start this off you're gonna have to strip down to at least your underwear.  I need an accurate weight to begin.\"<br>\r\nKristoff's face turned red but sighed and stripped down until he was in just the jockstrap he had been wearing all day.  Hans smirked, \"Y'know, you're VERY attractive, Kristoff.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Kristoff said, his face turning a darker shade of red.<br>\r\n\"And you'll be ever sexier once you've put on weight.  Follow me.\"  Hans said as he lead Kristoff to the scale in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff stepped onto the scale and Hans grabbed his tablet, \"Whats that for?\"  Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"My dad's company helped me develop an app for tracking weight gain.\"  Hans said as he punched in Kristoff's current weight, \"You weight about 240 right now, all muscle.  You're coach wants you to gain 150 pounds so by the end of these four months you'll weight 390.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats... a lot.\"  Kristoff murmured.<br>\r\n\"It sure is.  BUT We'll add an extra 10 pounds on to put you at an even 400.\"  Hans said, \"You can get dressed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff started to get dressed when he decided to ask Hans a question, \"So... those guys in the house?\"<br>\r\n\"My brothers.\"  Hans said, \"Gaining runs in the family; four of them gain only muscle, four of them only fat, and the last four do both.  I'm the only encourager.  You can leave your shirt off, by the way.\"<br>\r\nOnce dressed, minus his shirt, Hans smiled and patted a spot on the bed next to him, \"Lets get started.\"  As if on cue a chef entered the room with an XXL pepperoni pizza, a pile of bread sticks, 10 chicken wings, and a gallon of root beer.<br>\r\n\"You... expect me to eat ALL that?\"  Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"I sure do.\"  Hans said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't know...\" Kristoff said looking at the table laden with food. \"Doesn't this seem a bit much?\" Hans looked at him. <br>\r\n\"You want to get bigger right? Enough to not get kicked off the team?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kristoff said.<br>\r\n\"Then yes, this is just fine. We'll see how much you can handle and go from there.\" Kristoff sighed, as he nodded. <br>\r\n\"Fine. Let's just get this over with.\" Kristoff had eaten some of this just fine individually. He could easily eat those ten wings and breadsticks for sure. It was the pizza that he wasn't confident that he'd be able to follow with nor the root beer. He didn't usually drink sodas so this was going to be an experience. It was also incredibly awkward sitting there shirtless with Han's eying him. Kristoff was proud of his buff muscular trained body but the way Hans was staring at him so fixedly was really weird and distracting. Trying to ignore the sense of being under a microscope, Kristoff picked up the wings and started eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings were actually quite good and the sauce was phenomenal. Sucking the juicy chicken down, Kristoff tried to focus on the positives. For example, he was going to be able to eat a bunch of really good food and in any amount and quantity he wanted. The downside was that he was going to get fat. He had never had a belly before but during this adventure he was going to have to put on quite a bit of weight. He'll lose his famous muscle abs that everyone wanted beneath a layer of jiggly pudge and it was going to blow his mind. At least he had a fat friend so he wouldn't be alone, and he was not the only one who was going to have to put on weight for the team. They all did but it was unfair that he had to put on the most. He was curious how the others were going to do it. A positive was that he got to actually taste delicious food since it wasn't like he needed to worry about the fat content now. The downside was he was going to get fat. Ugh this was awful. At least Sven wasn't going to mind. If anything, he seemed a bit too interested as well in seeing Kristoff gain weight. Sven sure was a mix of contradictions: both smart but dumb, muscular but fat, lover of carrots and lover of junk food. He had to remember to take a picture because he wanted to see Kristoff before and after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDripping some sauce, Kristoff moved to clean it but Hans shook his head. \"You can do that later. Please continue.\" So Kristoff did, licking his lips as he finished the last wing. Next, Kristoff moved onto the pile of breadsticks. This was going to be a lot of bread but the breadsticks sure were good. Ripping off pieces, Kristoff stuffed them into his mouth and chewed. The breadsticks were the easy part but Kristoff was beginning to feel a bit full. Unfortunately he had a lot more to go before stopping. With a smile Kristoff finished the breadsticks before turning to the pizza. He cringed, thinking especially of how much calories from the bread and cheese would stick around but the goal was to gain weight. He just had to keep that in mind but it was hard since this new quest went against everything he had ever done. Trying not to cringe, Kristoff took a slice and sniffed it. It smelled delicious but also turned his stomach in knots since he rarely had pizza and he was feeling satisfied from the wings and breadsticks. He looked at Hans who smiled encouragingly and Kristoff was shocked by one of the most beautiful smiles he had ever seen. Hans motioned to the pizza and Kristoff swallowed. All of a sudden he didn't want to disappoint Hans so he took the bite of the first slice and moaned in delight. As sickening as it was, it was just as delicious and tempting and now that he had taken a bit, it was much easier to eat it. Chewing and swallowing, he moved his way through the thick cheesy pizza, unknowingly making the most amazing keening and sounds of pleasure noise. Hans had to shift legs a couple times and work hard to maintain his brilliant encouraging face when all he wanted to do was have Kristoff above or below him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kristoff first came in for his session there were a couple distinct emotions Hans had felt. One was approval of the client. Kristoff had an amazing body and face and although he hadn't mentioned yet, Hans really was a big fan of the golden blonde wonder on the hockey field. He looked to have great potential as a client as well. The other feeling was wanting to strip off all Kristoff's clothes and fuck him hard. It wouldn't have particularly mattered who was on top first, whether it was Kristoff or him, both would be amazing. Finally, the fantasy and soon to be reality of Kristoff with extra weight was utterly phenomenal and it was all Hans could do not to freak out in front of him. Shaking his head, Hans tried to focus on Kristoff then almost lost control again. Kristoff's belly was bloated out, the abs stretched around his rounded out stomach. Kristoff was on his fifth piece and there were splatters of cheese and sauce that had unknowingly fallen from his mouth and landed on his thick beefy chest with perk nipples. Hans wanted to lean over, lick it off, and then latch onto and suck that delicious chest. Sure he had brothers that had bigger but that would be kind of weird if he did that to them, but there was something about Kristoff's that was just especially appealing. He even liked the thin delicate golden chest hairs and usually Hans liked them smooth-shaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow he avoided doing anything and as Kristoff slowed down, Hans kept a straight face as he gave encouragement. \"Just a little more,\" \"almost finished,\" that's great,\" \"you're going to get big in no time!\" Kristoff had almost given in a few times but with the encouragement and belly rubs that almost made Hans crack, Kristoff was poked, prodded, cajoled, and soothed into somehow finishing the pizza to both their surprise since Kristoff only rarely ate pizza as a treat. Leaning back, Kristoff rubbed his bloated stomach and let out a loud burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP, that was....that was...I don't even know,\" Kristoff groaned. \"Am I dead?\"<br>\r\n\"No, you're still alive.\" Hans said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah-uuuuuuurrrrrpppp-should have figured. I'm in pain.\" Kristoff drummed his fingers against his bloated stomach that was rounded farther than it had ever been before that the abs were not visible then. The bloated ball sat in his lap and looked pretty darn solid. Hans was eager to touch it. With a nod from Kristoff, Hans eagerly grabbed it feeling the heft. For a moment his mask slipped and Kristoff saw just how into it Hans was. That would have ordinarily freaked him out but he was kind of out of it and Han's rubbing and soothing circular motions eased the utter distended pain of his stomach so he was cool with Hans touching him. Kristoff was relieved when Hans touched a couple of spots and allowed to relieve the pressure in his stomach. Eventually the pain faded and was replaced by erogenous pleasure from the feel of Hans's smooth fingers rubbing it and Kristoff enjoyed the massage. This wasn't so bad now. This actually felt quite good and he loved the feel of Hans's long slender fingers touching him. Hans sure knew his stuff. Leaning back he let Hans take care of him, occasionally burping as pressure was released and Kristoff was feeling better than he had in a long time. Who knew he was under so much stress? Losing to those Sentinels, being embarrassed, strict workouts and panic, he could finally relax. This was weird yes. But who knows, maybe he could learn to like it? Especially with Hans helping him. Finding his eyes closing, they snapped open when he felt Hans let go and Kristoff struggled to sit up to see what he was doing, his belly slapping against his legs. Hans was bringing out the soda and all of a sudden Kristoff was in a panic again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really necessary?\" he asked Hans. \"I mean I'm pretty full now, I might pop if I drink all that.\" Hans looked at him with a friendly expression.<br>\r\n\"No you won't. And don't worry. I won't make you drink all of it.\"<br>\r\n\"You won't?\" <br>\r\n\"No, you did a good job. Even better than I thought you would for your first time and being an obsessive nutritionist.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...thanks?\" Kristoff said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are going to drink some,\" Hans sighed as he grabbed Kristoff's chin and tilted his head up as he poured root beer into Kristoff's mouth. Kristoff was surprised by the move and he missed some, sticky rivulets traveling down his chest. Kristoff tried to struggle but Hans was stronger than he looked and Kristoff was too stuffed and laden with food to put up much of a protest as Hans continued pouring root beer down Kristoff's throat. It was either swallow or choke and Kristoff quickly got used to the rhythm, shooting daggers at Hans from his eyes for the unexpected surprise. It was fascinating, watching Kristoff's thick throat move as he swallowed and Hans marveled at the beauty. Usually his sessions weren't so erotic feeling but then, he never had anyone so gorgeous and perfect. Kristoff had the perfect body for all sorts of gaining be it extreme muscle, fat, or the muscular-fat they were doing. He would look good in every variant and there was just something about him. As it was though, Hans imagined Kristoff with that built padded chest, even huger biceps and triceps, huge pecs and thighs with a big solid gut. His abs were a thing of the past and Kristoff's large tank needed constant fueling to stay in it's perfect rounded solid shape. Hans would feed him rubbing that sexy massive body and feel all over while Kristoff ate and smiled at him, saying wonderful things of how much he likes and desires Hans. Then after the feeding was done, they'd lay together and Hans would play with the massive gut and they'd make sweet love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoff's choking noises interrupted Han's fantasy. Looking down he saw Kristoff's wet face where he spilled root beer and that sensuous mouth twisted in a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Kristoff demanded of Hans. Hans shrugged helplessly, embarrassed. <br>\r\n\"Oops?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristoff stood and examined himself. He hadn\u2019t had to go to work for the last week but he was finally assigned a shift again with Sven. \u2018Sven isn\u2019t going to be able to recognize me,\u2019 Kristoff mused, running his fingers up and down his stomach. Okay, that was pushing it and he hadn\u2019t changed that much yet but he certainly looked and felt different. Two weeks of meeting with Hans for daily stuffing sessions had already make a mark on his body. Kristoff still kind of felt conflicted but he wanted to win and make people proud and if this is what it took, then so be it. In just two weeks time his sculpted abs had been submerged under the onslaught of fattening things Hans obtained or cooked up each day and replaced by a pudgy layer that protruded a little more each day and now sucking in, he could no longer find a hint of abs even on an empty stomach. In fact, Kristoff was now sporting a little belly marking the beginnings of a gut which stuck out a few inches. He found his pants harder to zip up but after sucking in and bouncing a little, he managed to get them on and zipped close. His stomach only hung out over a little and getting his shirt on, it still fit but was snugger than he was used to and emphasized his little belly more than he liked. When he stretched, the very bottom of his belly briefly peeked out from underneath before he dropped his hands. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, time to go to work.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure how to react, being surrounded by icecream. He had found he was beginning to get hungrier and crave more food to fill his stomach after only a few sessions with Hans and his stomach capacity had certainly jumped. Hans was impressed by how much Kristoff had improved in only a few days and upped the ante a couple times to make sure Kristoff wouldn\u2019t leave without being so stuffed full he literally couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Hans definitely was serious about his job and Kristoff tried to match and so far with Hans\u2019s help he had. As he had spent so much time with Hans, he hadn\u2019t been out so much in public so no one had seen the newer bigger Kristoff  yet. He wondered if anyone would notice? He certainly felt noticeable. Walking in, he got behind the counter where Egbert Weselton stood waiting. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back Kristoff!\u201d He said excitedly. \u201cGood to have you working again, we always get more customers when you\u2019re in.\u201d For an icecream guy, Egbert was surprisingly skinny. Then again, he was more of an accountant for the store. When Kristoff moved to the back, Egbert followed instead of going off to do whatever he does when Kristoff and Sven were out front. Kristoff guessed when it wasn't playing with money,  he played computer games or read and only pretended to be working when they came in but he wasn\u2019t going to question as they were paid reasonably well for a low-wage paying job and Egbert was very easy-going except when they were full of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hold up a moment,\u201d Egbert said. Kristoff turned to face him. <br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSomething is different about you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think that was there before,\u201d Egbert said pointing to the noticeable curve of Kristoff\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so either,\u201d Kristoff said. He stood still as Egbert came and poked it. <br>\r\n\u201cWell I never thought I\u2019d see the day. Is something going on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe hockey team is bulking up a little to beat the Sentinels.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I thought something was going on. No wonder I\u2019ve been seeing more of you guys around, even with you on break. I see you\u2019ve been doing some yourself but I got to say that seeing the size of those monsters, especially the dynamic duo of Snow and Thor, you and the rest have a ways to go.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know,\u201d Kristoff groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they came from but they\u2019ve made this a real pain.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say. I hope you guys succeed though.\u201d Egbert winked. Kristoff smiled back as Egbert went to his office. All of a sudden Sven came bounding in. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, sorry I\u2019m\u2026late.\u201d Sven said as he moved behind the counter towards Kristoff and his voice trailed off as he stared. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Sven said. <br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that noticeable already?\u201d Kristoff asked. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been eating with Hans for the last couple weeks as you know. As you can see, I\u2019ve already been making some progress.\u201d Sven laid his hand on Kristoff\u2019s stomach and rubbed it. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAww yeah man I say you have. I can\u2019t believe you have a bonifide belly already, well I knew it was going to happen, but not so soon. This is just so weird.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know that I am on a very strict nearly impossible timeline right? I have less than six months to gain at least 150 lbs. I\u2019m going to be freaking huge.\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say, that\u2019s um\u2026wait wasn\u2019t it four?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cCoach was exaggerating. The real date isn\u2019t for six months and he misspoke when he said four as he told Hans. Either way though, it is still going to be a pain. Especially practicing and playing games in the meanwhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven paused and did the calculation in his head. \u201c25 pounds a month which definitely is going to be tricky, especially when you plateau and it becomes a real struggle to gain anymore. That\u2019s a little more reasonable than 37.5 but still going to be difficult. But how much have you gained so far since I\u2019ve last seen you?\u201d <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI think like 17-18 pounds or something, possibly 20. You can\u2019t believe what my appetite is now.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, as an athlete I totally get that but you know I still out eat you anyday of the week,\u201d Sven smirked. He patted his larger stomach and grinned.<br>\r\n\u201cOne day soon I\u2019ll actually beat you and be bigger than that little stomach you call a gut.\u201d Kristoff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for a while yet.\" They got into business mode as the first trickle of customers came in for the afternoon shift and word had gotten out Kristoff was in. Nobody else really seemed to notice anything was that much different or they just weren't saying. A number of other team members came in throughout the day ordering large orders which Kristoff and Sven gnerously scooped out extra for. They saw Flynn, Hiccup, Jack, Phoebus, Guy, Nod, and Sully that day and they smacktalked and goofed around a bit with Kristoff and Sven. Some of them were sporting growing bellies of their own since they kind of all were under the same requirements, though not as bad as Kristoff's which he unfortunately had talked himself into. At least some people were taking this seriously and used the intervening weeks to gain some weight because Sully was definitely thicker and Phoebus who closest to Kristoff's size was tigher in that shirt he often wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they left and Sven and Kristoff could lock up. Egbert came out from the back then.<br>\r\n\"Hey, we got a problem with one of the cooling units which has unexpectedly broken. A bunch of icecream is going to go bad and melt which is a huge waste as well a pain to clean among the expense of fixing the refrigeration. We can't keep the icecream but I was just thinking you guys could eat it and solve at least that problem until it could be fixed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sir, leave it to us,\" Sven said smiling as he nudged Kristoff. \"It'll be cleared in a jiffy.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah,\" Kristoff said. Egbert smiled delightedly. <br>\r\n\"Oh good wonderful. I'll let you to at it and lock up when you're done. See you later.\" He walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the back where the room temperature was normal which wouldn't keep the icecream. Most of the stock had been sold but there were still at least 12 gallon containers of various flavors. Sven went out and got them actual spoons and smiled. \"Free icecream, my favorite. Bottoms up my friend. I can't wait to see your new appetite in action, if you're not exaggerating. I've never seen you eat that much icecream so this is going to be interesting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I can do this,\" Kristoff said. They each grabbed a container and started shoveling in. Kristoff had gotten chocolate chip cookie dough and Sven the Rocky Road. They went silent for a bit as they steadfastly began eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKritsoff had to admit he had been missing out as icecream was amazing. Okay it wasn't like he had never had it, but now that he was no longer inhibiting himself and allowed himself to revel in the taste, it tasted amazing. He understood how Sven got fat off this stuff, this stuff was great! He had to gain weight anyhow and this was a nice way of doing it. He was going to have to reccomend Hans getting icecream some time but for now he just had to live in the moment. Focusing on the zone, Kristoff turned his thoughts inward and just allowed the sensation of taste. Sven having more experience was faster but it wasn't officially a contest and he was actually keeping up as his spoon scooped the bottom just a minute later than Sven finished the first and Kristoff moved onto the second as well. Kristoff was an eating machine which while slower than Sven, kept a good consistent speed of closely finishing behind as they consumed another gallon. Kristoff felt his stomach stretch but it was still distant. He had gotten good at ignoring the sensation with Hans and how to keep going until it was literally impossible to will away. Sven didn't seem phased at all and onward they went. At around 3.5 gallons Kristoff really then started to feel the icecream stretch in him, his stomach getting tighter. His shirt had risen up, unable to keep his bloated stomach covered and his hands were too numb and awkward to undo his pants which were getting really tight on him. He could only think of a couple ways to relieve this obnoxious pressure so he took the remaining gallons which were semi-liquified and drank them down, spooning to get guzzle it down as quickly as he good before he gave out. Groaning, he tossed the fifth gallon container away and stretched. With an audible pop his pants bottom blew out and his belly splashed out as Kristoff sighed in relief.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next hockey practice was short. It wasn't an actual practice yet but a weigh-in to see if people were keeping on track with the proscribed regimen. Kristoff was nervous because while he was onboard with the whole gaining thing, it was still weird to be publicly gaining so much and showing off how fat he was getting. His clothes were definitely getting too small to cover him and barely holding together. Hans wanted Kristoff to keep wearing them until Kristoff literally burst out of them and they were getting there. Kristoff had to suck in buttoning any of his pants and some he just could not get around to hold his bigger gut. Changing into his uniform that day was a relief just to take off the pants that were deeply constricting him, especially after a lunch meal to Han's texted specifications. His team uniform which had once fit perfect, only came down part way and the bottom half of his belly stuck out over the stretchpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoff was the last to arrive and so he was nervous as he went in but he needn't have worried. The entire team was there and they certainly took advantage of coach's command to put on weight. Kristoff was up there among the  most changed, but there were some others who looked just as heavy, if not more so. Kristoff was the one under the most pressure but they were all feeling the heat in order to stay on and not disappoint their school and supporters. Everybody had a noticeablely protruding stomach, and most of the team had grown guts where there had once been rippling abs. It made Kristoff feel better since everybody was more or less in the same boat. Sully and Phoebus were the biggest after Kristoff but everyone was looking thick which gave Kristoff hope that they could do this. The room which had been buzzing with group conversation hushed when Coach entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you all know, we're bulking up to take down the enemy, mainly our rivals the Sentinels who now have the greatest challenge we have ever faced in the form of the blonde beasts Snow and Thor. Everything else was and is cake compared to those. If we can at least reasonably take them on and not have you guys trampled to the ground by a single smash, I do believe we can win the championship again this year, despite our poor record previously with them.\" He looked them over and smiled. \"Looking at you all, it looks like you guys took this seriously, as you should have. We will have to practice our manuevering and strategy at your heavier weight but first we need to check that you guys are on track because there is only a couple months left before the championship, and I refuse to hand it over because of some overgrown monsters who, let's be honest, probably aren't students but nothing can be proven against. Anyhow, let's get this show on the road. Kristoff, you head on up first.\" Coach pointed to the special scales that supposedly weighed up to a ton they had. Kristoff walked over, his belly bouncing slightly as he got on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"245,\" Coach called out. \"That is how you do it people. 30 lbs in a month is pretty impressive and hopefully you can keep about the same pace. Next we have Sully.\" Sully who had always been bigger bellywise than Kristoff ended up being 240, a solid 22 lb gain. Phoebus their solid defense was at 230 which was a decent 18 pounds. Phoebus grinned widely as he got off the scale as he patted his lightly furred stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadashi, you're up.\" Their resident nerd and intellectually smartest member got onto the scale, his face uncertain. \"225, congratulations. Second highest gain after Kristoff at with 25 lbs from an even 200. I am impressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Cass's bakery helps a lot and this way, Aunt Cass doesn't have to worry about waste or stress-eating herself. It's a win-win-win.\" Coach nodded. <br>\r\n\"Wasabi.\" Their other science jock nerd was nervous as he got on. He hadn't gained all that much and his belly compared to others was smaller. He was already fairly big so it was hard. \"Looks like 235, a 12 lb difference. I expect you to do better Wasabi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Coach,\" Wasabi said. Role call continued with Flynn, Nod, Jack, and Hiccup. Flynn weighed in at 215, putting in a 17 lb  difference from earlier. Nod who looked a lot like Flynn pulled in at 210, up 15 pounds. Jack weighed in at 200 which while tiny compared to his teammates, was actually pretty significant as it was up 24 lbs from his light-weight 176. No one had expected the lithe Jack to gain that much since he had always been thin and ripped. Hiccup also weighed in at 200 tying with Jack which surprised them both as Hiccup had always been  bulkier at 185. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in the same weight class, Jack\" Hiccup said. They listened as the next mate was called. <br>\r\n\"Jim.\" Jim got on there and it landed around 213. \"213, a 13 lb gain. Not awful but could be better.\" After the rest of the team had been called, Coach came and stood in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember we are trying to gain at least 100, or more pounds. In other words, a minimum of 17 pounds a month for all of you, preferably more. Of course Kristoff has the toughest mandate at 30 lbs a month or more which he passed admirably. We should do all we can especially to help him reach his goal. If we all do our parts, we can obtain victory. Those who haven't met their quota need to make up for it by the next weigh in or there will be trouble. There will be a practice later but for now you are dismissed those who passed. Those who haven't will go to the cafeteria to start on catching up with the rest of the group.\" Krisoff sighed in relief for having passed. Wasabi, Jim, Hiccup and others who had not passed went to the cafeteria. Of course, he might as well do the same because maintaining this relentless pace was going to get extremely difficult and Kristoff was kind of scared for what would happen when his body would adjust and make it extremely difficult. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week had passed since that first team weigh-in and a chill ran down Kristoff's spine as we down the street; the cold halloween night air making him shiver as it brushed along the underside of his slightly exposed belly.  The warm black and orange sweater the beefy blonde was wearing had fit him perfectly the previous year but this year it was much tighter and clung to his new belly, the very bottom of it showing off no matter how hard Kristoff pulled it down.  Kristoff quickly made his way inside from his parked car to Aunt Cass' diner, pushing the unlocked door open despite the 'CLOSED' sign hanging on the door.  Once inside he spotted two of his teammates, Sulley and Tadashi, in the back corner booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, guys.\"  Kristoff said, taking a seat next to Tadashi.<br>\r\n\"Hey, yourself,\" Tadashi replied, pushing a plate of leftover cookies to Kristoff, \"Eat up!  Aunt Cass needs us to get rid of the leftover halloween treats.\"<br>\r\n\"I know - Sulley wouldn't stop texting me about it.  All the texts said were 'FREE FOOD AT CASS'S FREE FOOD AT CASS'S'.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Sulley said after swallowing down his fifth coffin shaped brownie, \"In MY defense... its free food.\"<br>\r\n\"He has a point.\"  Tadashi said, which made Kristoff shrug.<br>\r\n\"But,\"  Sulley said, pointing to his right, \"The real reason we had you come over is because there is a LOT of food we need to get rid of.\"  Kristoff looked to his left and saw stacks on stacks of halloween themed pastries; cakes, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, everything.<br>\r\n\"So you need somebody to help scarf it all down?\" Kristoff asked.<br>\r\n\"Basically, yeah.\"  Tadashi responded, \"Aunt Cass hates throwing food out.\"<br>\r\nKristoff sighed, \"Might as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eagerly, Sully got up from his seat with an audible 'oof' and hurried over to the counter, carrying back all of the food in his beefy arms.<br>\r\n\"Lets make this interesting, though,\" Sully replied, setting the food on the table and dropping into his seat, \"Lets see who can eat the most?\"<br>\r\n\"An eat-off?\"  Kristoff asked, chuckling.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man, lets do it!  It'll be fun!\"  Sulley said, excitedly, before looking at Tadashi, \"Don't you agree, man?\"<br>\r\n\"No, he's right, it does sound fun.\"  Tadashi replied, leaning forward and separating the food three ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Tadashi was finished each of the guys had one full cake each (festively decorated like a graveyard), 15 cupcakes, 10 brownies, and a tray of at least 14 cookies each.  Tadashi pulled out his cellphone and set a timer, \"Whoever eats the most in 5 minutes wins.\"<br>\r\nKristoff sighed and shook his head, \"Guess I don't have a choice, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope!\"  Sully said just as Tadashi hit the button on his phone and the timer started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tadashi and Kristoff both quickly grabbed a fork from the cup of utensils and dug into the cake, the biggest things in front of them, but Sully used his big hands and just dug right in.  Sulley shoved handfuls of cake into his mouth, chewing fast and swallowing down big chunks as he did.  Kristoff kept up a good pace, already downing close to half of his cake but out of the corner of his eye he noticed something that shocked him; Tadashi was already finished with his cake and had moved on to this brownies, shoveling in two at a time.  It shocked Kristoff, which caused him to slow down, but he returned his focus to the cake and went right back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the cake finished at roughly the same time both Sulley and Kristoff moved on to the brownies, scarfing them down as quickly as he could.  The cake was already sitting heavily in Kristoff's belly, slowing him down and filling him up as he shoves brownie after brownie into his gut.  The alarm on Tadashi's phone dings and all three guys stopped just as Kristoff has swallowed the last brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like I win!\"  Tadashi said, patting his rounder belly.<br>\r\n\"How?\"  Kristoff asked, honestly shocked, \"HOW did YOU of all people manage to eat EVERY SINGLE PASTRY in 5 minutes but neither of US could finish half?\"<br>\r\n\"More than half.\"  Sulley said, licking his fingers clean, \"I got in 4 cupcakes before the alarm.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, believe it or not, I've actually got a huge appetite.\"  Tadashi said, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"I'll say...\"  Kristoff said, amazed at how much Tadashi had packed away, \"With the way you eat you could be the biggest guy on the team!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but thats your job,\" Tadashi said, poking Kristoff's belly, \"It did feel nice to let loose, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"  Sulley said, scarfing down another cupcake.<br>\r\nKristoff cracked a smile, the first time he had when it came to all this gaining stuff, but being with friends made it easier.  Sure, Hans knew what he was doing when it came to this stuff, but being with his buddies made it seem more fun.<br>\r\nThe three guys hung out there for a few hours, joking around and stuffing down more treats than he ever thought he could handle by himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After halloween, Kristoff made sure to spend a couple of times a week hanging with Tadashi and Sully in addition to meetings with Hans and Sven. Sven was still his somewhat closest friend but Kristoff had discovered a lot about some of his teammates, especially Tadashi, and he was glad to finally have the guy as his friend. They may have been teammates but prior to spending that time together on Halloween, they hadn't really been friends. He hadn't grown up with Tadashi and at practice Tadashi was entirely focused on it and Kristoff just honestly hadn't known much about him. It turns out that he is really cool and he had the thing where Kristoff just felt comfortable with him. Eating with him and Sully was fun and Kristoff was beginning to really enjoy himself with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he hung out with all of them. Hans was pleased with his progress and Kristoff's sort of change of heart regarding the situation. Kristoff was starting to enjoy being big, being the biggest on the team and kicking it with some awesome bros. He complained less to Hans and smiled more, and was even doing some things of his own initiative. There were still some slight reservations but overall, Kristoff enjoyed the feeling of big. He began to see why people sought it out, the feeling of power and placement. Once he got more used to his heavier center of gravity and acclimated to the feeling of bouncing belly rather than a muscular ripped six-pack, he actually found he played better. After all, they were skating and with heavier mass, he got more momentum and power and he was only marginally slowed down at turning. He wondered why he had never came up with this before because with only minor decreases in initial acceleration and turning, everything else went way better. He was unstoppable in the one on one scrimmages and even playing four against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHans was right that after the first thirty it got easier before getting harder again but right now, Kristoff was coasting on the easy side while he could. His appetite had dramatically increased and he spent a long time eating. Though he still simply could not out-eat Tadashi when they hung out, he kept improving as did his stomach. It was joked that he kept growing everytime he saw them which he was with all the help he was getting. Tadashi and Sully were growing too as was everyone on the team but they three were the fastest unsurprisingly. Aunt Cass was more than happy to have them around so food wouldn't go to waste and she liked feeding people. Hiro sometimes came down and kept them company, amazed by how big his brother Tadashi and his friends were getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the month, Kristoff was probably weighing at least 260-65 if not more. He was well on track as he could only imagine what the final days would bring considering it was Turkey month. While most of his old clothes no longer obviously fit, he tried to take some of the loose fitting ones that still managed to fit that had been bought for his size in the 240s. He managed to put on a nice button up as Hans requested, though it was sort of tight and clingy around his stomach. Kristoff could sort of guess what Hans had in mind and he had to admit, he was sort of curious himself to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoff was again driven over to Han's mansion and Hans was eagerly awaiting for him at the door. He smiled as he saw Kristoff in the tight clinging dress-shirt. Kristoff sure was different than how he had been almost two months ago. He was big and more proud of it with a manly gut. He was still very built in the chest and shoulders though the belly was edging past and there was a swaying motion and jiggle when he took a step. He also had a delightful butt that his slacks huggged against in the most intriguing way. Hans lead Kristoff to the set dining room on which there was a massive array for a feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, dig in and help yourself,\" Hans told Kristoff, giving him a little slap on the belly. Kristoff was used to these displays so he wasn't freaked out like the first couple times, but it was still a little too intimate for him for someone who was not on his hockey team or a close friend. He wouldn't mind Tadashi or Sully doing it but it felt weird from Hans. Kristoff liked it more when Hans gave him bellyrubs after huge meals because Hans was godly amazing at those and it helped so much, but other touches were frankly a little creepy from someone who he didn't know so well. Despite seeing Hans multiple times, Kristoff still didn't really know much about him other than his interest and talent in helping others gain. He didn't know Hans's family that well either since while he saw them occasionally, he rarely got to talk to them other than the occasional hi and it was strange. He didn't understand the dynamic or if Hans loved his family. He seemed somewhat distant and cool towards them whenever they did appear, except when it came to their growth. Kristoff didn't hear much but Hans was also his brothers' trainer for all the goals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristoff did as directed, piling his plate high with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, corn, etc. The scent of it all was delicious and his belly growled hungrily in anticipation, as it started to do whenever in the presence of food. He eagerly started eating, gasping in pleasure. It was exquisitely cooked to perfection and tasted phenomenal. A couple of Hans's brothers wandered in and filled their own plates to eat and while Kristoff was curious to see if he could finally learn something, he was much more concerned with eating and filling his hungry eager belly at the moment. It was probably similar for them as well since the only sounds that were made were the little moans, gasps, burps, grunts, groans etc from excellent food. When Kristoff finished a plate, he got up for more and the food seemed almost limitless. To drink, he drank glass after glass of delicious sparkling cider that Kristoff quickly lost count of with plate after plate of food. After 6 utterly massive plate sizes of turkey, potatoes, and everything else, Kristoff began to feel pressure reach his food focused brain. His heavily laden gut pushed strongly against the waist of his formerly loose slacks and also against his button-up, straining the fabric. It looked like he was going to burst at any moment. He didn't, though he had to relieve pressure, undoing the button of his slacks, letting his stressed gut out and burping multiple huge burps. The buttons somehow held which made Hans's eyebrows twitch a little as he was hoping to see them pop off as Kristoff's big hugely bloated beautiful belly spilled out majestically. Fortunately, there was still dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHans clapped his hands and kitchen staff appeared seemingly out of nowhere bringing in the pies. Kristoff groaned as he saw them as he knew they were going to be delicious. When the help left and Kristoff scooped out a huge slice for himself and tasted it, he knew he was right. It was, like all of Hans's meals, absolutely delicious. He tried to hurry though because if he spent to long enjoying it, he might throw up as he was stuffed like a turkey himself. He got the huge first slice and a second one almost as large before it became to much and he had to rest. As he did so however, trying to relax his belly outward, there was zing as a button popped off. Then another and another as 5 of the buttons of the button-up popped off and his belly spilled forward from its confined space. He looked and felt absolutely huge and he groaned as he touched it. It was heavy and felt like it was going to pop if Kristoff wasn't careful. Hans placed his hands on it reverently. It was one of the most perfect looking bellies he had ever seen on a really beautiful and attractive person. He had to preserve this memory. He took out his camera and photographed it in all its glory from different angles. Kristoff had looked stuffed other times but this time was just perfection. He looked massive and powerful, but also vulnerable and in need of relief. Hans reverently placed his hands on the solid mass and gently rubbed and kneaded, enjoying the orgasmic look of exhilaration on Kristoff's face as he moaned in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it...\" Kristoff groaned. Hans smiled as he did just, happily rubbing Kristoff's bulk. <br>\r\nAfter a while, Kristoff felt his phone ring. Getting it out of his pocket, he heard Sven start talking asking him what time he was going to be over for dinner. Kristoff groaned as he realized he had somehow completely forgotten he was also going to have thanskgiving with Sven. Shit, he was going to have to eat there today. He winced as he stood up awkwardly, his belly protruding in front of him even more so and feeling oh so heavy. All he wanted to do was sleep off this meal but he needed to go to Sven's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I need to go,\" Kristoff told Hans.<br>\r\n\"To where?\" Hans asked curious. <br>\r\n\"I am having thanksgiving with Sven today as well...which somehow slipped my mind,\" Kristoff groaned. Hans froze in shock and then smirked.<br>\r\n\"You're in for some trouble now.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I am. Do you have any clothes for me to wear? These obviously won't do.\" Kristoff gestured to the fact he was just in underwear and a destroyed button-up.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I have some clothes that will fit you,\" Hans said. He left and was soon back, carrying a set of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can borrow these. They're a pair of one of my brothers. He won't miss them.\" Hans had to help dress Kristoff as he couldn't really do it himself. After that, he drove Kristoff over to Sven's, smirking mischeviously as he dropped Kristoff off. \"You can do it, I believe in you! Send pictures.\" Hans drove off, wishing he could have watched in person how this was going to play out. </span></div></div>",

The shirt Kristoff had borrowed from Hans' brother would have fit perfectly under normal circumstances but Kristoff has just eaten an entire thanksgiving meal big enough to feed a family of four.  The beefy hockey player grunted as he struggled to tuck in the dress shirt but once in Kristoff noticed that a little bit of his stuffed gut was peeking through the gaps between the buttons.  Kristoff sighed - there was no was this shirt would last the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Kristoff got to the front door he winced a little - his belly was so big and packed with food that it stuck out farther than he expected and it pressed against the door unexpectedly.  Kristoff grunted as he took a step back before ringing the doorbell.  In no time at all Sven answered the door and suddenly Kristoff felt overdressed - his fat best friend was wearing a pair of work out shorts that clearly fit him 100 pounds ago and a tank top that was stretched tight across his gut, \"KRISTOFF!!  Bought time you got here, buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Sven.  Sorry I'm late; I had to go to Hans' place first.\"  Kristoff said, pointing to the massive gut his shirt could barely contain.<br>\r\n\"Hey, no worries!\"  Sven said, putting both hands on Kristoff's belly, \"Whoa - he did a number on you, Kris.  Think you can still eat?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best.,\"  Kristoff said as he made his way in, \"So, where are your folks?\"<br>\r\n\"Out of town!\" Sven replied, \"They decided to spend thanksgiving with my aunt but I told them I was staying behind to have dinner with you, big guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Sorry you missed out on the visit then.\"  Kristoff said, feeling a little bad.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, bro!   Besides, my mom made dinner her for the two of us anyway.  Let's chow down like only two bros can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kristoff followed Sven into the living where Sven had laid out all the food his mom had prepped for them.  Kristoff made an audible gulp at the sight; it was almost as much food as Hans' had cooked.  The only plus side was that it was a meal for two - not one.  Sven plopped down on the couch and Kristoff followed suit but the second he did his shirt threw in the towel as a loud <i>RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP</i> filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sven and Kristoff both looked down at Kristoff's huge gut and they were both surprised by what they say; the buttons had stayed on but the fabric right next to them has ripped and there was now a wide, vertical tear that followed along the circumference of Kristoff's gut.<br>\r\n\"Those... are some strong buttons.\"  Sven said, snapping a quick pic on his phone and uploading it to his blog.<br>\r\nKristoff unbottoned the shirt, thankful that the dress pants still fit him (though a bit tight) and tossed it aside, \"Well... guess we should eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sven logged into one of his video streaming accounts and started playing a few episodes of his and Kristoff's favorite sitcom.  The two best friends kicked back as they ate - their plates piled high with turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, candied yams, stuffing and much more.  A few hours went - every minute filled with laughs and more and more food.  By the time all the food on the table had been cleared out (save for the 10 pumpkin pies) Sven was as stuffed as Kristoff had been when he arrived and Kristoff's gut was so huge and packed with food he had to lie down, his gut so big he couldn't see past it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hockey player groaned as he rubbed his gut, the button on his pants popped long ago, and before he knew it he was passed out on the living room floor - Sven sleeping on the couch in his own stuffed bliss.  Kristoff and Sven both woke up around 8 that next morning, bellies empty but clearly much fatter than the previous day.  After the two cleaned up the living room and did dishes-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sven took a closer look at the pies they had been saving last night and swore. Kristoff came in, the borrowed dress shirt hanging off him unbuttoned. <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked worried when he heard Sven's scream. \"Is everything alright?\" <br>\r\n\"No everything's not alright. These pies...they're pumpkin, not carrot!\" Kristoff sighed in relief that there was nothing actually wrong. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you had me worried there for a second. I thought it was something serious.\" <br>\r\n\"This is serious! You know I hate pumpkin pie!\" Kristoff shrugged. It still made no sense to him why Sven hated the taste of pumpkin pie yet craved carrot pie which he personally thought was terrible but yeah, Sven was not going to eat those now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate waste too but...hey, you can eat them! You love pie, especially pumpkin!\" Kristoff preferred chocolation cream as his top pie choice but pumpkin was a somewhat close second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess...\" Kristoff rubbed his belly, an action that was becoming second nature to him, even when not ridiculously stuffed. There was something comforting about it and it was a lot of fun empty or otherwise. It was farther out than he was used to empty, past his pecs and straining out over his pants. It bounced a little as he rubbed and he made a note to up working out as well because while he was obligated to gain weight, he was not going to jiggle as much as he could prevent it when playing. At the moment though, it was kind of fun and it caught Sven's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn dude, you're getting so huge,\" Sven said placing his hand on Kristoff's gut. \"I still can't believe you're bigger than me in only a couple weeks while it took me over a year to grow this,\" Sven bumped his gut against Kristoff's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motivation, dedication, hard work...and torture were what got me this far. I do have to thank Hans though.\" Sven nodded as he rubbed Kristoff's gut. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have to thank him again too. You think he'll help me sometime?\"<br>\r\n\"Probably, the guy is certainly into his job of helping people gain. I didn't even know that was a thing, in this way.\" <br>\r\n\"It is.\" <br>\r\n\"No duh, now I know.\" Kristoff joked, poking Sven. \"You got to keep up man, it feels so weird being being chubbier than you of all things. The world is upside down.\" Sven shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I love being big but I'm no quicker hurry than what I can naturally do. I'll totally do a couple of sessions with Hans if you think he'll do it but everyday? No thank you. I like being a medium big or whatever I'm meant to be. You on the other other hand were always meant to be a large man.\" Kristoff paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is true,\" Kristoff flexed his arms causing Sven to smile and shake his head. <br>\r\n\"Jock,\" he said goodnaturedly. Kristoff tilted his head and Sven rolled his eyes. \"Okay okay,\" Sven squeezed Kristoff's huge bicep which felt like hard rock. \"You still got it.\" Kristoff sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, now let's eat this pie shall we?\" he asked, looking at Sven. Sven nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to look at these fakes any longer than necessary.\" Sven unwrapped the first one, cringing his nose against the strong smell of pumpkin. \"Ugh, it smells horrible. Kind of like you after practice or a game but worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gee, thanks. How come do you like pumpkins on Halloween then?\" Kristoff shot back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cause you carve it into fun spooky decorations and you don't have to eat it.\" Kristoff gave him another another eye-roll before looking down at the pie in front of him. It was weird despite the fact that he ate two ridiculous sized repasts the night before that he actually felt hungry now that it was in front of him. His stomach growled approvingly and he couldn't wait to dig in. As soon as Sven came back with a knife and fork, Kristoff was ready to dig in. \"Wait a moment,\" Sven said before he took out a can of whip cream and sprinkled it on top. \"You can't have pie without whip cream. I'll bring out the icecream in a bit.\" As soon as Sven stepped off, Kristoff dove right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually really good pumpkin pie, 'Sven doesn't know what he's missing,' Kristoff thought. There was no way he could have eaten it the night before, having to eat all that turkey, mashed potatoes, ham, stuffing, cornbread, and everything else at both Hans's and here but now that he wasn't stuffed like a turkey himself, he was actually excited for this. The thrill of novelty had yet to wear off and it was at times like these Kristoff was still amazed at what he had been missing out on on a strict diet. If he was to be honest with himself, he was ruined on restriction. He would never be able to go back to the bland diet previously as he'd always long for tasty treats but on the other hand, as long as he didn't let himself go and stop working out and be lazy all the time, it was okay and actually helpful. After all, his game had actually improved significantly once he got used to a larger size and gravity pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach slice was absolutely delicious with the whip cream. He finished the first pie in short time. These weren't small pies either but big ones meant for multiple people. Sven's parents knew his appetite and since he was having company, they made sure to get enough for what they thought would last for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven was impressed at the speed of which Kristoff had eaten the first and brought out the next couple so he wouldn't have to keep going back for pie. He then turned his attention to scooping out a massive serving of icecream into a big bowl while Kristoff worked on the second pie. That one also disappeared quickly and Sven was amazed. He lost track of time while he watched his buddy absolutely devour those pies. Around the 5th pie, Kristoff paused to unbuckled his once again tight pants and sighed with relief as his gut spilled forward free. Letting out a huge belch, Kristoff rubbed his gut in contentment. \"UUUUURRRPPP aw yeah, this is nice.\" Sven walked over and started pulling down Kristoff's pants. \"What are you-UUURPP-doing?\" Kristoff asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeing you even more. You don't need those and it certainly is freeing when not pushing up against pants,\" Sven also pulled off the unbuttoned dress shirt \"or this. Being in a more natural state is much better don't you think?\" Kristoff nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" he says before continuing to eat the next pie. Now free in just his underwear (and Sven had some naughty thoughts about yanking those off as well but even though they have seen each other, Kristoff was all about respect and that would be rude) he continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you should eat some icecream before it melts entirely.\" Kristoff shrugged and switched over to the half-melted icecream and scooped into his mouth. Realizing it was liquid enough by this point, he lifted the bowl up and scooped and dribbled it into his mouth. Most of it made it but there were drips that missed his mouth and trailed down his mouth and chest. Sven blushed, feeling hot. Did the temperature of the room just raise? It took all his restraint not to go over and lick Kristoff clean. Those trails were taunting him though. Such dirty, dirty trails that needed to be licked smooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning back to the pies, Kristoff ignored the mess for the moment and continued stuffing his face full of pie. Sven shifted back and forth, playing with himself so he didn't launch himself at his bro who wasn't finished yet. But ugh, this was the sexiest thing Sven ever saw and he couldn't believe he was lusting after his mate. Kristoff had always been gorgeous but now he was really turning Sven's buttons. Kristoff slowed down around the ninth pie, breathing heavily as he leaned back in is chair, hands rubbing his bloated stomach desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he groaned before releasing a long, loud, disgusting massive burp. Sven was impressed. He followed it up with a string of aftershock burps that were almost as impressive as he flailed, trying to get comfortable. Sven moved over to help him out, rubbing Kristoff's belly. It was freaking huge and solid. Sven thumped it, causing Kristoff to wince and brought out more burps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuurrrppp, don't do that,\" Kristoff complained. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, just clearing room,\" Sven said. \"You're going to need it to finish that 10th pie.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think so,\" Kristoff groaned. \"I'm too stuffed right now with all those pies and the feast I had last night. Feasts rather. I've never eaten anywhere near as much food so close together in my life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done a very good job of it too,\" Sven said. \"Crud, I forgot to be taking continuous photos but here's one now.\" Sven pulled out his phone and snapped a couple of shots. \"Yup, there we go. All set. Now you can finish off that last pie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said no,\" Kristoff muttered. Sven tutted. <br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed. Here I thought you could do everything but you can't finish a measely 10 pies.\" <br>\r\n\"Neither could you,\" Kristoff pointed out. \"Even if they were carrot. Those pies are huge. I am amazed I could even eat this many.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, you're not leaving until I get rid of this 10th one. You don't want it to go to waste do you?\"<br>\r\n\"I can take it home later,\" Kristoff pointed out.<br>\r\n\"That's no fun. I want to see you eat it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Kristoff started before Sven shoved a sliice in. Chewing quickly, Kristoff glared at Sven. \"What are you-\" Sven shoved another piece in and another as soon as Kristoff opened his mouth again. Never enough to choke him but just enough to force him to swallow or spit out, and despite protestations, Kristoff swallowed dutifully. Eventually he even opened his mouth willingly as Sven fed him piece after piece, chewing thoughtfully. Eventually he opened his mouth and nothing went it. He had finished all 10 pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\" Sven asked.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Kristoff said, but without anger and smiled slightly to let Sven know he wasn't that mad. Sven grinned as he wiped his finger around Kristoff's mouth and stuck it in, letting Kristoff suck the last bit of pie down. Sven then leaned down and licked the dried icecream trail that had been calling him with his tongue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristoff got a text to meet with the team at school for a surprise weigh-in. He was a bit shocked as he thought he didn\u2019t gain enough to meet the weigh-in goal. It\u2019s a good thing that Sven lent him some his dad\u2019s clothes as his current clothes were several sizes to small and were past being held together. Kristoff then changed into his uniform only to noticed how small and tight it is. It showed off how fat he has gotten. He felt that if he bent in any direction his uniform will tear and fall off. His hockey tee stopped at his belly button as it highlighted his large gut and his pants barely got up his thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike last time he was the last to arrive and was not so nervous as he saw Sully and Tadashi. When he entered weight room the room was buzzing with conversation and some players were telling jokes and some people were laughing at the joke, while other were comparing belly sizes. He saw the rest of the time and it looked like that Sully and Tadashi had really blown up as he noticed their physique were bigger than their chow down during Halloween.  He also noticed that Phobus came quickly behind them in terms of added size with Jack and Nod coming behind him.  He also noticed that people were a bit more relaxed with their new gain as he saw Flynn, Jack and Nod were comparing belly size. When the Coach entered the room the conversations stopped at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the drill, bulk up and eat more to take down our rival team the Sentinels and Kristoff is our weapon against the blonde beast Snow and Thor. I believe that you guys are on the track to not being smash be a single blow and we may see the winning champions at the end of this road.\u201d He then smiled at the team.\u201d Look you guy you all grew while I hope you pass the goal line only the scale will tell. Remember that we have to practice our maneuvering and strategy as you guy are still adjusting to you heavier bodies. Alright let\u2019s get the show on the road. Kristoff your up first. \u201csaid the Coach as he motioned Kristoff to get on the scale. Kristoff walked were he stood to the scale with the belly slightly jiggling with each step he took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c290\u201d Coach whistled \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect role model for you guy to follow. A 45 lbs in two months that is impressive and hopefully you will continue this gaining pace. What have you been eating?\u201d said coach he jokily poked Kristoff belly only for it to jiggle like jello. Kristoff inwardly let out a sigh as he met the weigh in goal but was a bit embarrassed that his belly jiggle like jello. Sully went up and weighed in at 267 a hefty 27 lbs gain. Sully got off and went around high fiving the team on his gain. Phobus went up after Sully and his weight went up from 230 to 250 a decent 20 lbs.  He smiled and patted his belly which a growled a bit and he went red of embarrassment as a couple players giggled at his belly response. Tadashi went up and he went up from 225 to 255 a whopping 30 lbs gain. \u201cThis is another role model for you guys to follow and look up to. \u201csaid the Coach as he jolted down the gains for the team. Tadashi went up to the Coach and whispered something in to the Coach\u2019s ear and Coach nodded back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Cass just expanded her bakery and got in two new giant industrial size ovens so her production doubled and she is try to make her second bakery cookbook and she asked me and the team would like to be the taste testers. She has a boat load full of new recipes she wants to try and experiment with them. Would you guy be interested?\u201d Tadashi asked. \u201cI\u2019m in free food.\u201d shouted Sully and he jumped up and down with glee. Soon other team player wanted in until the entire team said yes.  Coach then continued role call as Wasabi went up and he went up from 235 to 254 a large 19 lbs. \u201cSeem like you learned your lesson from last weigh-in. \u201csaid Coach as he wrote down the gain.  Flynn went up after Wasabi and he went up from 235 to 249 a small 14lbs gain. \u201cI expect you to gain at least 20lbs for our next weigh-in Flynn. \u201csaid the Coach as Flynn nodded his head as he was a bit sad that he didn\u2019t meet the goal.  Nod went after Flynn and he went up from 210 to 231 with a big 21 lbs gain. Jack went up after Nod and he went up from 200 to 222 with a 22 lbs gain. Hiccup went up after Jack and he went up from 200 to 218 with a decent 18 lbs gain. Jim went up and he went up from 213 to 228 a small 15 lbs gain. \u201cNext weigh you need to gain a least 20lbs like Flynn. \u201csaid the Coach. Soon the rest of the team members weigh in were recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep in mind that during the Winter holidays still aim for a minimum of 17 lbs per month while Kristoff needs to aim for a minimum of 30lbs per month.  I expect everybody to help each other with gains and especially Kristoff need all of our support for him to grow. If we do all of this, we can increase our chance of beating the Sentinels and winning the championship.  We will have practices later on the winter break so don\u2019t forget and don\u2019t forget your quota. Every who did not meet the quota this weigh in this is your final warning. So get to the cafeteria and start eating. \u201csaid the Coach as he demised the team. \u201cWait coach you said that you were impressed with Kristoff\u2019s gain but he didn\u2019t meet the quota?\u201d asked Wasabi as the team paused to hear the coach\u2019s answer. \u201cThat\u2019s because I got word that the Championship is post pone for a few months due to reports of referees taking bribes and that the location that the championship will be held at is being refitted with proper electrical wiring and plumbing. \u201csaid the Coach. \u201cAlso come to my office I have your uniform sizes in bigger sizes for the ones who need it\u201d said the Coach as he left to go to his office.  The team procced the information and understood that referees talking bribes is illegal and the location had bad plumbing the bathrooms would constantly flood and the power would go out randomly in the middle of games.  The team went to the coach\u2019s office and everybody got bigger uniforms and filed out once they got their bigger uniforms. Kristoff signed in relief that he had some more time to gain. He noticed that Jim, Flynn and a couple other who didn\u2019t meet the quota went to the cafeteria.  Kristoff got a text and saw it was Hans he wanted to meet up and do a routine feeding session. \u201cKristoff do you want to join us at my aunt\u2019s bakery? We are going to celebrate that we meet our quota with a feast at her bakery. \u201csaid Tadashi as noticed that everybody when meet their quota stood around Tadashi.<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The beast was transformed into his human form of a handsome prince. The staff also regained their human forms and the castle and the surrounding forest was transformed back into its beautiful state.  Adam and Belle had a grand wedding with the castle staff and the villagers. After the wedding Adam became King and Belle became Queen and Adam\u2019s parents past away when he was a young child.  Adam quickly transition into his kingship role and taught Belle about royal or noble manners and culture. Adam would host foreign kings and other important and powerful nobles. Belle quickly learned all about high class and their manners. While Adam entertained the husbands or men, Belle would host the women and there were some dignities that were unsure as Belle was not a high ranking birth, but a commoner who marred into high status. Those fears were laid to rest as Belle made her hosting an experience to be never forgotten.  Many royals and nobles were impressed by Belle and it help Adam gaining more trade, military and political agreements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that whirlwind of Adam and Belle reconnecting their kingdom to the outside and surround kingdoms. Belle knew that Adam would be very busy the kingdom and making decisions on who to improve. She also knew that her father would be very busy as that with the better trade agreements her village has expanded and got more villagers and shops, one of them a hardware and crafts store that her father loves to use in his inventions. Adam did tell her that could pass the time by learning new skills. Belle then decided to improve her handcraft skills by taking lessons with Madame Armoire who was the wardrobe for a few months. After she then went to Chef Bouche who was the former stove when the curse was in place. He is the head of the royal kitchen was ecstatic to teach Belle the culinary art. Chef Bouche told Belle that she is very talented as a cook or baker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Belle is pushing a mobile trolley filled with freshly baked croissants, pain au chocolates and madeleines with hot chocolate with cinnamon. She stops outside on her husband private study. She knocks on the closed doors. She heard her husband tell her to enter. She went in and saw her husband sitting in an elegant chair and in front on his desk filled with papers that was disorganized.  She saw her husband wearing his white tunic and black tights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello my big beast of a husband. Hungry ? I figured that you might need a snack as you are busy running this kingdom.\u201d said Belle as she used her pet name for her husband. Since the breaking of the curse Adam would sometimes have had beast like tendencies like eating food without utensil, but he had control over most of these moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks for the food, but that seems like a lot of food.\u201d said Adam as Belle moves some papers into a neat stack and moves from of the food and drink onto that part of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I notice that you didn\u2019t eat much at breakfast. \u201csaid Belle as she noticed that Adam did eat more than average man. She did sometimes wonder how he stays in shape due to the amount of food he eats, but she assumes that he exercises when she is not around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I baked these treats myself for you. Now if you need me come to the library as I found this very interesting book. \u201csaid Belle and then gave him a kiss on the check and left his study with the door closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam did look at the tray of baked good and they did smell good and his stomach let out of growl to eat the baked goods. He reached for one and bit into it and his mouth exposed and flavors and it was like eating a piece of heaven. He went back to read the papers on his desk. The papers were a mix of trade agreements and other problems when leading a kingdom. While filing and reading the papers he would subconsciously reach for the baked goods and drink the hot chocolate. He lost track of time by finishing the paperwork until he noticed that the tray of food is empty. He then heard a knock at the door and in came in\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then disappeared in a flash of rainbow sparkling dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam stood there in bewilderment and shock. Thoughts were swirling around in his head as to what just happened.

He went home (after the loss no one felt up for socializing) and called in a feast, equal parts Domino's, KFC and McDonald's. At home he went casual in a pair of Nike shorts, a compression shirt and Adidas flip flops.<br>\r\nHe finally finished the meal fit for a king. 3 Grand Macs (+ large fries on each), an original recipe bucket, a meat lovers pizza and a 2 liter of Coke later, he felt stuffed! His workout shirt rode up to reveal a massively swollen gut, and even his workout shorts felt slightly tighter. He must have had 5 pounds of food!
