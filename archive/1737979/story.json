She enjoyed her high school years and had recently left the nest to go off to college. While Trish attended high school she had been pin thin. She didn't play sports, but through nature she had been able to stay extremely thin. This ability made the girls in her social group fairly jealous, especially because Trish would pack it away when it came to food right in front of them. Trish would eat two helpings of pizza, an order of french fries, and two giant cookies nearly every day for lunch at the cafe. Her other friends would either be eating diet food or a normal portioned meal from the school. Some of the girls had problems with their weight, but Trish failed to notice their struggle to diet. She did notice how ever that no matter how much she ate she didn't gain an ounce. As time went on Trish took more and more advantage of her natural gift. She had sweets all the time and had seconds and thirds on meals if she really liked them. She enjoyed eating, especially tasty food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all in Trish's past now. She had just arrived to college where she was going to spend the next four years on her own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over time Trish had sort of started a love affair with food. She could eat all she wanted and not gain an ounce, so why not enjoy it. Where she was off to college she had an unlimited access to freshly cooked food. This took most of the work that stopped Trish to chowing 24/7 at home away. Free pizza any time of day, fresh burgers and fries all the time, breakfast, lunch, and dinner served course after course in unlimited quantities. Trish enjoyed this new found food source and took full advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks at school, stuffing her face when ever she wanted, Trish had started to form a routine. She had made lots of friends, enough to replace her high school ones. All of her girl friends took notice of how much she ate. Some thought she was doomed to gain the freshman 15, like they had started to fear for them selves. Some of her other friends were just jealous because they were on such restrictive diets. None of it phased Trish. But after a these few short weeks at college, something changed. Something deep down inside Trish was changing. She was starting to show her age, and her metabolism was starting to slow. The natural wonder that had kept her so thin during high school was now on it's last legs. Obviously Trish didn't know this and continued to eat as much as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little over a month had passed Trish's body started to show the results of a past its prime metabolism. A layer of fat started to fill in around her stomach. Trish was not one to look for these subtle changes didn't even notice. But as the weeks went on and her belly got bigger it was pretty hard not to notice. At first her friends all noticed her slight gain. They all smirked as her eating started to catch up with her. Oblivious Trish was none the wiser though. She just kept on eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks rolled on and Trish got fatter and fatter. When her clothes stopped fitting she just got new ones and didn't think anything of it. Not only did her belly grow, but so did the rest of here. The once bean poll was now a curvaceous woman. Trish had curved hips, a plump belly, a hefty rack, and other fat features like a double chin and wobbly arms. She friends stayed silent, as they knew Trish had no idea she had blown up. Trish still pranced around like she was pin thin. She even some times taunted the other girls about how much she could eat and not gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the semester she had become bigger than all of her friends. She had packed on 100 lbs and doubled her weight from when she arrived at college. During the second semester Trish was starting to eat even more. She noticed her appetite had increased and she was hungry all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Trish packed it away at the cafe she would brag to her new college friends about all of her old fat high school friends. She told them that she bet when they went off to college they got super fat and couldn't help them selves. Her friends snicked but not at the story but at the irony. Although her friends let her get this fat, they were still truly friends with Trish. They helped her up from the table when she had eaten to much to do it on her own. They would change seats with her when she had gotten to big to squeeze into a booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few month's Trish was tipping the scale at 250. She was one of the biggest girls on campus, and she was the only person that didn't know it. Her friends had all tried to get her to diet many times, but gave up instantly when Trish denied her problems. They didn't want to tell her she was as fat as a cow, but any time they danced around it their plans never worked. Some of them would confide in her that they were having weight issues, and when they asked for support, like a gym buddy, Trish always pawned them off on someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish thought very highly of her self, so it's wasn't until one of the fat computer nerds asked her out that she realized there was a problem. \"Who does he think he is asking me out? Doesn't he know I'm way out of his league?\" Trish complained to her friends. \"He told me he wanted to take me to an all-you-can-eat-buffet, and that he would let me have as much as I wanted. What a creep.\" Trish, for as oblivious as she is, felt that this guy had asked her out because the thought he actually had a shot with her. It was at this point that everything was starting to come into focus. The size 18 dresses she now had to buy instead of zero. All the attempts to get her to go to the gym, or diet with the rest of the group. All the mobility problems she was starting to have, like the showers getting way too cramped. Everything was hitting her at once. Was she actually fat? Had she gained weight for the first time in her life? She looked at her self in a mirror and saw the same thing she saw all year, herself. She didn't notice the changes but they were there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the bath room and weighted herself. The scale came up at 256. \"Holy crap, last time I stepped on a scale I was 100 lbs. I've gotten so fat.\" Trish decided she couldn't reveal this to anyone. She was going to start dieting and hitting the gym until she back down to her old size without anyone realizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld habits die hard though and Trish couldn't help but eat her fair share at the cafeteria. When ever she had a break to go to the gym she was either too tired or too hungry, and ended up at the cafeteria instead. By the end of the year Trish stepped back on the scale to she if she had lost any weight. The scale topped out at 300 lbs. \"How could this be? I'll never lose weight at this point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish couldn't get the will up to actually lose weight. Summer came and her eating continued. The whole time she wanted to lose weight but didn't do anything to make it happen. She told everyone she was on a diet, but then proceeded to eat everything on the menu.</span></div></div>",

I guess everyone knew her metabolism would catch up with her. But also Trish was very admit that she was going on a diet and was going to lose all the weight on her own. Of course we know she had no will power to do so and would eat as much as she could all day every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before all of her friends started to arrive back in town as well. Surprisingly she wasn't wrong about them though. While Trish had gone from a 100lb bean poll to a 350lbs fatty, her old friends had taken to their new college meal plans almost as well. In high school her friends weights ranged from 150 to 225, but most of them packed on at least 50lbs if not more while away. Of course they were all at first shocked when they saw Trish had gained more than 200lbs but then not at that surprised from her previous eating habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Trish was no longer near an all paid for cafeteria, she was on her own to quash her hunger. She took solace her first week when she found a Chinese buffet in town. All you can eat for $5. Trish became their number one customer. It was no surprise when Trish invited all of her friends there for lunch to meet for the first time. They all sat and ate. At first each girl was peckish (well except Trish). They were self conscious about their weight. But soon enough their cravings for food kicked in and they started to eat almost as ferociously as Trish was.</span></div></div>",

Someone made a remark about Trish's weight. \"Yeah, but not like I'm the only one who put on a few at college.\" Trish said as she pointed out the other girls waistlines. \"Any ways I'm on a diet, so I'll be back to my old self in no time.\" Her friends had a hard time believing her considering the amount she just packed away. After Trish left the rest of the girls schemed behind her back. They wanted to see how big they could make Trish. She obviously was eating just as much if not more than she did in high school. The only difference now was that she was showing the results of it all. They saw no harm in it since they knew she wasn't really going to diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey planned all sorts of ways to get the chubby even bigger. Slumber parties with tons of junk food, more trips to the buffet, endless amounts of greasy food when the local fair came to town, any many more. Their plan went into immediate action. Trish, despite her diet, was loving her summer break. Her favorite thing in life had become food, and she was continuing to eat it in spades. Her friends were always coercing her to eat more and more. The girl was never hungry. Of course she kept on about her diet day in and day out. \"All this dieting really has me famished.\" or \"I feel so much smaller every day on my new diet. I wonder how much weight I have lost.\" When she was 350lbs Trish had a hard time realizing how big she had gotten. She couldn't fathom 350lbs. She knew 200 and 250 were fat, but 350 was just unreal. Well now she was even more unreal. She tipped the scales at 400 and wasn't stopping. She out grew clothes at an alarming rate. Her friends wardrobes were no use to her since even the fattest member was only around 300. Trish didn't care, she had more delicious food than she could eat every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trish went on and on about her diet, it only fueled her friends to make her bigger. As the summer came to an end, and Trish was planning to return to school, her friends made as big as an effort as they could. They wanted to get her nice and fat and then get her on a industrial size scale. The day before summer was over Trish pigged out as much as she could. By dusk her friends had taken her somewhere to be weighed. They wanted to see how much she had \"lost\" this summer. When the digital number read 450 her friends were astonished. Of course Trish was too fat to see past her massive gut so her friends had to tell her the read out. After all the flack they got in high school they decided to lie to her. Hey it would help her self esteem right? \"250\" They told her. \"Great job, keep up the good work. You put us to shame.\" They all lied. They took Trish out for one last meal. The blubberous girl indulged her self like she had always done. It had been a great summer for all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving for the summer at just over 300 and now returning at a good 450lbs, there were some definite heads being turned when they saw the new Trish. Most of all her friends had no clue how she had gotten so big. Of course Trish put her foot in her mouth when she told everyone about her fabulous diet. \"Yeah I got really fat last year, but It's more or less a non issue. I lost so much weight over the summer. I wish I could say the same for the rest of you. Freshman 15 wasn't good enough? Had to keep it up over the summer?\" Although Trish was being as ass she was also correct. All of her friends had gained weight their freshman year (Obviously not like Trish) and had continued to put on a few more over the summer (again obviously not like Trish). \"I guess that makes me the skinny one of the group, ha.\" All of her friends scowled at her for her comments. If Trish wanted to see fat it was going to be on her. They all came together and had the same idea her high school friends had. Lets fatten this piggy up. They took her to the cafe all the time for snacks and meals, they ordered delivery all the time for Trish, they even shared their care packages from home with her. Trish was snacking and pigging out just as much as she did over the summer. Her friends kept her well fed. They even took to doing most of her work. They did her papers while she emptied take out containers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir plan worked incredibly well. The weight pilled on Trish. 475, 500, 525. Trish was by far the biggest girl in school. The cafeteria staff knew about her and prepared for her arrival every day. The delivery drivers knew her address like the back of their hand. And of course Trish loved every moment of it. She still went on and on about her diet and teased her friends for their soft sections. Since they were all so busy feeding Trish they had stopped going to the gym or working out. Being at the cafe so much they ate more than normal amounts they were used it. Calling home for care packages didn't help their waist lines either. The team of feeders were all starting to hit the high 200 mark. Trish would point out when their clothes no longer fit them. Of course nothing fit Trish either. Although they were upset with their gains they were happy to know they would never be as big as Trish. She was a complete fatty. Eating constantly was a true joy. By years end she was 550lbs. Her friends had also all hit upwards of 300lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the summer Trish and friends decided to rent an apartment for them all. They wanted to keep the feasting up for her. Trish agreed since she didn't want her little helpers to leave. Trish's old high school friends were sad to hear she wasn't coming home for the summer, so she invited them to live in the apartment with her new friends. All the 300+ fatties realized they had the same goal. With their support now combined Trish was truly taken care of. Now that her friends didn't have class to worry about they fed her all day every day. Since they didn't have distractions them selves most of them ate along side her. Every day was grocery day with all these girls eating like they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 550lbs it was taking more and more for Trish to gain any actual weight. Over the whole summer she barely gained anything. Her friends on the other hand had really upped their eating habits. Subconsciously snacking away they each gained 100lbs. The 400lb girls were starting to see the bigger side of fat. Not only did they want to feed Trish, each one wanted to feed them selves. They had been over taken with a hunger that before only Trish had. The girls started to celebrate their size, not much they could do about it now. As each one hit 400 lbs they celebrated. They shared clothes as they got bigger since each one grew at their own pace. \"Cathy can a borrow a top? I'm starting to get just as fat as you.\" \"Anyone else have any clothes for goodwill that don't fit anyone in the house anymore?\" \"Guess who finally crossed the 400 mark!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls were fat and happy. It was time for school to start again. They were then all faced with a decision. Break up the apartment and go back to school or drop out and continue to live together.</span></div></div>",

At 400 lbs they were bigger than most everyone around them, of course except Trish who was still at the top the scale near 550. Trish, still oblivious about her weight problem carried on each day like the happiest person. She loved food and had plenty of that to go around. 550 lbs was hard to notice but Trish played it off like she just had a little baby fat to lose. She, as she always had, teased her plump friends about their weight. \"Another cupcake Sherri? Isn't that your third? Keep it up and those pants will burst.\" Of course she said this while snacking on her 8th.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough school was about to start. Trish made arrangements to move back on campus. A few days before school started the girls asked Trish to meet in the kitchen. The table had a few boxes of donuts and Trish dug in to them with out even asking. \"Trish we wanted to tell you that we are all dropping out of school to continue to live here, but we also want you to leave and go back to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I stay here with you?\" Trish asked as she continued to chomp on donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a fat bitch!\" One of the girls spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Trish said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are always teasing us and constantly calling us names. You also eat all of our food without even asking. Did you buy those donuts?\" She was asked as she finished one box and was moving on to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you guys always buy me food. Ever since college you guys have always showered me with food for some reason. I love eating so I just accepted it. You guys used to never even touch sweets any ways, you always wanted me to eat them so you wouldn't and get fat. I guess that plan didn't work so well since you all are always eating them now and topping 400 lbs. You should really cut back\" she finished as almost half a box of donuts had disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See right there. You tell us we need to cut back, but you are they one who eats the most and is larger than all of us.\" Trish sat at the kitchen table that occupied one of the walls in the kitchen. Her 400lb roommates all stood or sat forming a circle in front of her. Their fat bodies took up much of the room. Their bellies bulged out in front of them, most of them touching one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter than all of you? Please. Have you seen your selves? You have all become round piggies this past year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yes you are even fatter than we are. Have you looked at yourself? You are huge. You just finished two dozen donuts, and are going for more. We have to custom order clothes for you. Your boobs are so big they can't be classifies on the traditional scale anymore. You got so fat we can't even weigh you anymore. The industrial scale only goes to 500. You never stop eating, of course you are fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looked down at her massive body. Her ass was so big she was sitting on two chairs. Her belly was so large it forced a gap between her and the table so large she could barely reach when her fat arms were stretched out. \"You guys are just jealous, I'm not 500 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, you're even bigger than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm the fat one?\" When that guy downtown yelled 'fatty' the other day he wasn't talking about you sherri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he most likely was, I'm pretty fat too.\" Sherri said as she curtsied for her friends, showing off her curves. \"But he was definitely talking to you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a problem with how fat you are, but we need you to move back to campus so they can deal with feeding you.\" Another girl chirped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to stay with you.\" Trish pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can one back any time you want, as long as you fit in the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get any fatter I just might not fit.\" Trish laughed. \"I just don't know how I got so fat to begin with, I was so scrawny before. I guess I didn't diet and exercise as much as I wanted to. All this eating had to go some where.\" Trish said as she shook her massive belly. \"At least everything tasted so good. I'm going to miss all you fatties when I'm gone. I understand now why I must go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish lived out her last week of summer with the girls before moving back to campus. They ate and were merry, but soon Trish was making the short walk to her campus dorm.</span></div></div>",

Once she had become 550 lbs she was to big to control. Her hunger was impossible to quench. All eight of them had slowly gained as well as college went on. It wasn't until this summer that they really packed the pounds on. Next to Trish they were eating reasonably, but it didn't stop the pounds from coming. Their association with food turned to passion. Now they wanted to feed Trish less and keep all the sweets route themselves. With Trish out of the picture each of them was able to be as selfish as they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they were all college drop outs they each got jobs. When it came to unskilled labor what better place to apply than food establishments. They all divided and conquered, taking up jobs at McDonald's, burger king, Wendy's, taco bell, KFC, pizza hut, dunkin donuts, and one lucky girl got a job at a local bakery. These waist line increasing jobs went right to work on these girls. The apartment was always littered with wrapers and take out containers. Sherri, who worked at the bakery, also had the hardest job of bring back as many sweets as possible. All the girls loved sweets. Sherri took anything that didn't well at the bakery, nothing went into the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this access to food the girls hunger increased. Since there were only four rooms each girl was paired with someone else. When someone got to full to keep eating her roommate would help her finish her meal. Walking through the halls of that apartment all you would see is roommates feeding each other or stuffing their own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls loved their new lives. Soon winter set in and they were confined to their apartment even more. Since so much of their money went to buying food, their tried to save on heat in the winter. After work they would all pile up in the living room, staying warm off each others body heat. Their bellies and bottoms all squished in one big eight fatty pile, while they ate their dinners or helped someone else eat theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed the girls grew even larger. Their clothes stopped fitting but buying food was more important. It was common to see boob spilling up and over the cups of bras. Or bellies that could not be contained by small tank tops. Short shorts that were so tight that they were almost a second skin. It was not uncommon for someone to look up from their food and see the epitome of beauty across the room and want nothing more than to rub her fat body all over and continue to feed her food. Roommates were constantly having relations before, after, or during meals. Their bulging bodies made for amazing sex partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeding, sex, and gorging defined these young women's lives. It wasn't until they got a call from Trish did they interrupt their routine. Trish had been busy going to school, but wanted to see her friends before she left for the summer. Her friends wanted to have her over, but their apartment was so filthy and they were finding it hard to take a break from eating or attacking one another. Someone would bend over to pick up some trash and the first person to spy that delicious booty in the air would be on top of it as fast as she could waddle. Once those soft chubby fingers were fondling that juicy butt all productivity was off almost as fast as the clothes were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish arrived the next day and the house was still in shambles. Two girls were down the hall with their door closed. One was in her room trying to find a top that would at least fit over her boobs. Three were still in the living room having lunch. And the other two were on their way back from picking up food and all of their local stops. Trish was greeted at the door by her old friend Sherri. Sherri, along with everyone else was now up to Trish size. Trish was a little shocked to see her that much bigger. \"Hey sexy lady.\" The girls had been eager for Trish to visit so they could ogle the larger girl. They had all had the rounds with each other, and they all craved fresh flesh. Sherri showed Trish in while feeding her compliments. \"Lookin good Trish honey. Look girls Trish is here. I think her belly is even bigger than before.\" Sherri said as she rubbed her old friends stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come sit next to me you pretty thing\" said another girl who was taking up half the couch. \"I'll even share my cake with you.\" Trish sat down and had some cake. She quickly noticed all the burger wrappers and things around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have been eating out a lot lately huh?\" She asked. Sherri took the time to tell her the plan they had cooked with all the local restaurants. \"Looks like some one needs to tightly up in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hard to clean.\" Her couch buddy, Martha, told her. \" it just gets messy again so quickly. Enough about us tell us about what you have been up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much just school. I'm more interested in you guys. Where is everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carey and Steph are in their room... Cleaning up.\" Martha started. Trish gave a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their having sex.\" Sherri blurted out. Trish was startled. She didn't know those two were lesbians, but she was starting to get the feeling they were not the only ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I saw Nancy she had just gotten out of a shower. And Mel and Brooke are bringing home some food.\" Martha finished. \"You better eat up or I'm going to end up having all the cake without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys look like you've had a fun year.\" Trish added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe what we get into.\" The third girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can imagine.\" Trish talked with the three girls and ate cake while waiting for the rest to join. Eventually Nancy found a top and joined them and then Carey and Steph waddeled outof their room, each with their hair a little frazzled. Finally Mel and Brooke arrived home with the food. The nine girls dug right in eating to their hearts content. Trish wasn't used to everyone else eating so much, or so vigorously. The sounds they made she had never heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone kept offering Trish more food. They rubbed her belly and paid her complements. \"You always had the sexiest tummy Trish. Your boobs look even better than I remember. I wish I had a trunk like yours, mines gotten so big.\" They stuffed her full of food until she couldn't take anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been this full in ages. You girls really know how to treat a guest, well at least a really fat guest. I'm not sure I'll be able to walk home with a belly this full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can share my bed.\" They all said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls girls, I'm big enough to go around. How about we have a slumber party in the living room so we all can sleep together. Who knows, maybe I'll be a bit more hungry once we get all the beds together.\" Trish let out a big wink, but didn't know what she was getting herself into. \"So who's jammies can I borrow?\" Trish followed Sherri to her room to change. Sherri pulled out her biggest pair of pajamas for Trish. Trish stripped down to her undies and Sherri started to get all worked up inside. Trish squeezed into her small sleep shirt and shorts. Her massive legs were not even covered by the shorts and the shirt did little to hide her mammoth belly. Sherri made sure to get a once over of Trish before letting her join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the living room all the beds were made on the floor and more treats had been taken out. the other seven fatties had changed into their overly tight pj's. When Trish entered the room they all hollered and clapped their hands. Shortly there after they all sat I'm their beds and ate. Then they started to feed each other, and then the rubbing started. Trish was going a long with it all, enjoying the food and companionship. Quickly tops started coming off and rolls started to intertwining with other rolls. Lips met lips and hands touched what ever softness they could. Eating continued and then the moaning started. Trish was overwhelmed but loving every second of the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything calmed down the massive girls just lied together, letting their fat envelop one another. It was an amazing night, and one that wouldn't be their last.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the night of passion Trish decides she needs to move back in with her friends. Her friends had all become fat lazy lesbians, and they could use a leader like Trish around. \"Alright fatties, here is the deal. I'll let you to allow me to move back in, but you bitches need to clean up your act. This house is a pig sty. Also I need more food some we are going to have to work on a schedule for that.\" Trish had the other 8 girls under her command instantly. Four of the girls started cleaning up and the other four went out for food, while Trish sat and ate what ever was left in the apartment. When the three girls got back more eating took place, but after Trish put them all on working and food shopping schedules. She made sure she maximized food gathering some everyone in the house would be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Trish didn't have a room she spent her nights room hopping and sleeping with whom ever she felt like. Everyone felt blessed when they were chosen. Everyone had taken to just sleeping with their roommates, so the sex wasn't out of control like it was before. Only on the nights when Trish visited were the three-somes allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Trish around she helped the other girls gain up to her level. At 550lbs Trish was still not gaining, but she still packed it away just as good as before. Now that all of them were 550lbs it was hard to tell them apart. Some had bigger boobs than the rest, and a few had wider asses, but at days end they were all just extremely fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths past and the girls lived in hog bliss. Not much changed, everyone just got used to the situation. Slowly though the girls started getting promotions at work. They had been working at their fast food jobs for so long they were starting to get noticed for their over year of service. At first it wasn't a big deal, they were just out of the house more often. But then one day on a lunch break Sherri met a boy, and this boy was head over heels in love with Sherri. After a month she moved out and moved in with her new boyfriend. And this just opened up with flood gates. Soon Martha, Carey, and Steph all found lovers that they wanted to move in with. Martha moved in with a college freshman that was afflicted with gaining much more than the freshman 15. Carey and Steph ended up leaving the house for customers of their restaurants. Nancy, Mel, Brooke, and the last girl no one could remember the name of, were all that were left. The moral of the apartment was kinda low after Steph moved out. The girls were feeling lonely and also missed the food the other girls brought to their pallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that there were less roommates Trish found herself alone most days while the other four worked. She was getting quite lonely. Eating only kept her so occupied. One day she decided to invite Sherri and her boyfriend over for a visit. The two arrived and Sherri's boyfriend, Dave, was stunned when he saw Trish. He knew Sherri was a goddess, but didn't know she had friends just as large as she. Trish told Dave their tale, and how there were four other girls just as large as they were still living here. Dave in turn told Trish that his best friend would love to meet them, because he was as in to larger women as he was. Dave called up his buddy Joe and Joe came over just as fast as he could. Joe was immediately drawn to Trish, paying her compliments and fawning all over her. Soon after all of the other house mates started to arrive home. Dave and Joe just watched with their jaw on the floor as 4 other 550lbs beauties walked in the door. They were in heaven, well almost. Soon the girls started feasting. With their old friend Sherri visiting they had a reason to celebrate. The boys watched as the girls feasted, each one of them feeling as though every fantasy they ever had was coming true. After wards Dave took Sherri home and Joe invited Trish back to his place. Trish went with Joe and they enjoyed an evening together. Joe was obsessed with how fat Trish was and Trish was all to willing to play it up for him. He fed her anything she wanted and she loved every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks of dating Joe he asked her to move in. Trish thought about it, and how so many others had moved out and left a hole in the house. Trish countered with asking Joe to move in with her. Joe agreed to the compromise, and packed his bags. Trish thought that if she could get Joe to move in with her, why couldn't she get everyone else to move back with their partners. Trish got in touch with her friends and everyone loved the idea. The merged their apartment with the one next door so everyone could have their own room and Sherri, Carey, Steph, and Martha all moved back in. Sherri and Dave took the room right next to Trish and Joe. Martha took her now plump freshman friend into the room at the end of the hall. Steph, who had moved in with a boy who shopped at her work took the room across from Steph, who was now living with a lovely fat girl who ate frequently at Steph's place of employment. Everyone was back together and happy. Mel and Brooke were now sharing a room after Mel asked Brooke to be her life partner. A few weeks after the transition Joe and Dave got two of their other buddies to move in with Nancy and the other girl. Now everyone had a partner and was happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish and Joe felt content. They had got the gang back together and made a happy family. Trish laid in Joe's lap while he wrapped his arms around her as far as he could. He loved holding her fat body in his hands. \"Trish I have something I want to ask you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Joe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never been more happy in my life, and I never want this happiness to end. Will you marry me?\"</span></div></div>",

She had only recently tasted McDonald's food, due to being a gymnastics master. She had quit gymnastics a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good...greasy...flavor...mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already managed to eat her way through 10 burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian decided that if she kept up this pace of eating, she'd end up a public spectacle. She definitely did not want that. But, Jillian wanted more. So, making a compromise between self-consciences and want, she approached the counter, and ordered a dozen more burgers. The cashier raised an eyebrow at the slight bulge below her shirt, but said nothing, instead, giving Jillian her order. Fortunately, Jillian's house was not that far from the McDonald's, it was a wonder she'd never found her way to eat there before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, Jillian changed into more comfortable clothes, normal sweatpants and a t-shirt. Then, she ate her meal, letting the flavor flow over her, and the grease slowly dribble onto her shirt. By the time she was done, Jillian's stomach was rather distended, and she was most assuredly full, but she still wanted more. She came to the conclusion she was addicted. And the best way, she thought, for dealing with an addiction to such wonderful food, was to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian decided to call one of her friends from the gymnastics team to go on a McDonald's run with her. Casey picked up her phone and Jillian went and picked her up. Casey noticed Jillian's new belly and the grease that was left over on her face and shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been hitting Mc Dee's a lot recently huh?\" Casey asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few times this week. I really like their burgers, I can't believe coach told us to never come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are packed with calories that's why.\" The two girls arrived at the drive threw at McDonald's and Jillian ordered a dozen burgers for them to share. \"Why did you get us so many burgers Jill, we won't be able to eat all of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll eat anything that you won't. But I know you are going to want your share after you have a bite.\" They both bit into their burgers and they both moaned in pleasure. Jillian proceeded to keep eating but Casey just marveled at the bite she had just taken. The greasy burger was the best thing that she had ever eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls ate all their food and went back for more. When they were finished both their bellies were extended and they leaned back and rubbed their full stomachs. Casey called their coach when she got home and let him know that she was quitting the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week the girls went back to McDonald's often for more and more burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while they were there they noticed a sign on their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join the McDonald's Gym team\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis message intrigued the two girls. The rest of the flyer just gave information about how to contact the coach and the fact that members could get all the free food they wanted. \"A gymnastics team that lets you eat McDonald's? That's unheard of. I wouldn't be able to do any of my old routines will on that grease in my belly.\" Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all the free food we wanted. Think about it Jill. Maybe we can just join and not go to any of the practices and just reap the rewards?\" Casey suggested. It was at this time that a group of girls Jill's and Casey's age walked through the door of the restaurant. These girls all seemed to be about 40-60 pounds heavier then them and were all wearing yellow and red tops and skirts. Their bellies all hung out from their uniforms and over the waistbands of their skirts. Their chunky arms jiggled as they walked up to the counter. Casey tried to read the wording on their shirts as they past. \"Hey Jill thats the gym team! Doesn't look like they have worked out in months. Being on that team would be so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the incentive of free McDonald's the girls decided to...</span></div></div>",

You can call her your Fat Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you my Fat Princess.\" Both girls said in cheery voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blondie you go with Fat Princess, and you twig, you stay here with me.\" Goddess said in a demanding voice.

Jill followed the captain as Casey brought her gaze back to the Fat Goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come sit with me, be comfortable.\" Casey took a seat in the booth across from Goddess. \"I talked to Fat Princess and told her we should give you two a chance. First you guys are going to have to prove your selves worthy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will do anything.\" The shortage of money in their wallets made them both very desperate to make this team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no need to rush into anything. Why don't you enjoy a burger on me?\" There we a tray of about a dozen burgers sitting in between them. \"Go ahead.\" Casey slowly took one and removed the wrapper. The Big Mac was so much bigger than she was used to. It's like these girls got custom burgers for being on the team. Casey was ecstatic and took a big first bite. She chewed quickly and took another bite. The burger was so good. Casey was so excited. She was going to join the team and get all the free food she wanted. She would eat all the time with her team mates and have the time of her life. She polished off the burger and liked the grease from her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty huh?\" Goddess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's heavenly my Fat Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Now I want you to sit there and not touch another speck of food to your lips and watch me eat the rest of these burgers.\" Casey's heart sank \"And if you could unwrap each one for me that would be great.\" Casey got a bit light headed. That burger had been so delicious, and she craved more. \"Now skinny!\" The demand woke Casey from her thoughts and she unwrapped the first burger. \"Now what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your burger my Fat Goddess.\" She handed the burger in to the girls chubby hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we change it to Big Fat Goddess. I think that has a better ring to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my Big Fat Goddess.\" Casey started unwrapping another giant Big Mac while her belly rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Jill and saw Fat Princess eating burgers while Jill unwrapped them as well. \"Eyes on me toothpick!\" Goddess demanded. Casey watched as Big Fat Goddess shoveled the grease ball in to her plump mouth. Her double chin jiggled with each bite as grease rolled from her mouth down it. Her chubby cheeks bobbed and swayed as she chewed. Casey asked her self what she had gotten her self into and was it worth it.</span></div></div>",

Six girls all in red and yellow uniforms sat at the same table that Goddess and Princess has sat yesterday. Jill spotted two paper shopping bags on the ground next to the table. \"Hello my Fat Princess.\" Jill said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually after talking to the lovely Big Fat Goddess you must now refer to me as your Big Fat Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course my Big Fat Princess.\" Jill had been quite the suck up.

She wanted to be on this team no matter what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you two go change into your introductory uniforms and meet us back out here.\" The girls each took a bag and headed off to the restroom. As they both took a stall and closed the door they opened the bags to reveal their uniforms. They ended up being less real uniforms and more the next step in the teams torment. In the bags were a red and yellow stripped bra and panties. After some debate the two decided strip and put their uniforms on. Jill was for it because she knew she would never get on the team unless she complied fully. She also didn't want Casey backing out and ruining her chances on getting on the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dawned the revealing clothes and stepped out into the restaurant. All the chubby heads from the team turned and snickered as the girls made their way across the dining room. The team has positioned them selves as six booths next to each other on the far end of the dining room. \"Well don't our toothpicks look splendid in their McDonald's colors. Your one step closer to being on the team. Now if you two could fetch us some food that would be great.\" Jill and Casey took the girls orders one at a time and delivered their food to them, some times stopping to unwrap a burger or dunk a chicken nugget in sauce. As the night went on more and more regular customers ventured into the restaurant. Most of them looked in shock at the girls running back and forth from the counter to the awaiting chubbies. Some others laughed as the girls small bellies jiggled and their boobs swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time the smell of grease floated in and out of their nostrils. Their bellies rumbled in hunger. After a while their stomachs started to hurt. She brutal team never gave the poor girls a resting minute. They would order one thing from the menu and when Jill would rush it to them they would order something else. Or while Casey was carrying a large load another girl would call out a demand. While one girl wanted her burger unwrapped another needed more sauce and ketchup. All the fatties on the team were stuffed to the max by the end of the night. They all sat and rubbed their full bellies. Jill and Casey sat down with the respective captains. They were each allowed to eat one burger. \"Oh thank you my Big Fat Princess, you are too kind.\" Jill still sucking up even after crappy night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would eat most of that myself and give you the scraps if I wasn't so full.\" Princess replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your kindness my Big Fat Princess.\" After the girls had finished their one burger and the team had let their stomachs settle Jill and Casey helped each girl up one at a time and walked them to their car. After 5 trips the only girl left was Big Fat Goddess. They had just escorted Big Fat Princess to her car which had been quite the struggle due to the little effort that Princess had provided. The two girls put Goddess flabby arms over their shoulders and started to walk her out. She was just as heavy as Princess, and the two were worn out from carrying out all the other fatties. The three finally made it to the large SUV that Big Fat Goddess's family had given to her for her sweet sixteen. They squeezed the large girl into the drivers seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are alright\" Big Fat Goddess said as her belly pressed into the wheel. \"Keep up the good work and you will be on the team in no time.\" With that she closed the door and the two scantly clad women went back into the restaurant to fetch their clothes. They could both feel the burger in their stomachs and knew they would be part of the team soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\"></div>The girls both got phone calls the next day ordering them to meet at McDonald's at 7pm wearing their team bra and panties. They knew that more torture was in their future. They sat at the regular table in the back of the dinning area and waited for someone to arrive. The smell of the restaurant tormented them. They wanted to order food with the few bucks they had left, but they knew if they got caught by the captains there would be hell to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for an hour the two captains arrived. The two fatties walked through the door, jiggling with every step. The fabric of their uniforms was tight as can be. They waddled over to the two girls sitting, dying from starvation. \"Hey toothpicks\" Big Fat Goddess spoke down to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure my Big Fat Goddess.\" Jill spoke sweetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, yet another amendment to our titles. Big Fat Sexy Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my Big Fat Sexy Goddess.\" the two said in unison. \"A fitting title for our descriptive leaders.\" Jill added trying to suck up yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite fitting, we are very sexy, wouldn't you say Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I find you down right sexy.\" with a lustful look in her eye Princess undressed Goddess with her eyes. After a short moment of the two of them getting lost looking at the others bulging body they came back to reality and set their eyes on the two toothpicks. \"You two need to bulk up if your going to be on this team. You both need to gain 50 lbs before your allowed on the team.\" The twinkle of hope returned to their eyes. The thought of burgers was now a happy one and less painful one. \"You can now eat as much McDonald's as you please, but in order to receive free food you must be wearing your uniforms. We will leave you to your eating, but make it quick before we lose interest in you two and kick you our of here for good.\" The two captains waddled to the counter and ordered a tray of burgers each and took them to their cars and left. Once they were out of sight the two toothpicks ran as fast as they could and ordered as much food as they could. The girls were starving and ate until the placed closed for the night. Their bellies were so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ate and ate every day until they were too stuffed to move. They would stuff them selves at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Slowly the girls gained weight. The bellies were getting softer and their boobs were fuller. Their legs jiggled and their so did their chins and arms. Their uniforms were getting dirty from the grease and sauce, but they just kept on eating. They started to out grow their small confines. They realized the torturous part of this as they grew. They loved eating but it was getting hard to fasten their bra in the morning. It was getting hard to pull the greasy panties up over their thick legs. They just started keeping them on over night. Their boobs started to over flow their bras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came closer and closer to their 50 lb goals. The girls had not showered or changed in a week. Their hands and faces were sticky from grease and sauce. Finally after a full day of stuffing the two porkers were approached by their team captains. \"Looks like these two pigs have been eating well.\" Princess said as she poked Jill's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you guys out grew your uniforms\" Goddess said as she groped one of Casey's boobs. The two girls just sat there moaning from their fullness. They had eaten all day and couldn't even move. \"It seems as though they passed their challenge though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, these two porked up quite fast. We expected it to take you another week or two. We were willing to wait another month before we kicked you off the team. There is just one more thing you need to do before you can join the team and take off these ridiculous uniforms...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an extra 20 lbs the girls were getting closer to reaching their goal. At this point though, their uniforms were starting to get tight, 20 lbs is a lot of weight. They had gained 50 and kept the same uniform last time, and that was their plan again this time around. They didn't want to raise any suspicion to the current captains about their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until the captains called a meeting. Everyone met at Big fat sexy goddess' house. The 8 fatties all piled into the dining room where their was a feast to be had. Rich pasta dishes, baked goods, cooked meats, cheese filled dishes. The girls all started eating right from the platters, each one ravenous and totally pigging out. After they had all had their fill they leaned back and rubbed their bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Jill and Casey had seen the team in their street clothes and they really dress quite revealing. There were plenty of low cut shirts showing off lots of cleavage, tank tops, belly shirts, short skirts and shorts, tight fitting clothes, and anything else that would be considered scandalous on a 200+ lbs girl. Jill and Casey had dressed conservatively, but had to admit they were showing more skin then normal because they had more skin to show. Their wardrobes had become increasingly small as they grew in weight. The shirts they wore could not cover their bellies and were firm pressed against their full chests. Some of the girls started to rub the bellies of the team captains. Jill and Casey had seen this before and were not so weirded out by it anymore. Eventually Goddess called everyone's attention. She let everyone know about the yearly weigh in that was happening tonight. For club rules they need at least a yearly weigh-in to determine who is captain. As a side note weigh-in can be requested once a month by every team member. The two captains waddled up stairs and took one member at a time into the bathroom to be weighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left with one of the girls Goddess mother started clearing off the table. The girls went to help but they were too full to move and her mother told them to stay put. After a quick clean, the mother started to bring out large trays of treats. Stomachs had begun to settle and the girls were ready for round two. Roxanne requested that the girls could not eat anything until after they were weighed, in fairness to all. Their mouths salivated as they stared down the delicious looking treats. After several minutes the first girl came back down and told one of the others to go up. Having already been weighed she jumped (more like dove face first) at the chance to eat. She started to gobble down food in front of the other girls. The cycle continued until only Jill and Casey were left. After about an hour of waiting, the two were very hungry. They were called up by the last girl to come down. A change from the other weigh in, they were called up together. They made their way up stairs and to the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door to find Goddess and Princess making out. The two fat girls continued as Jill and Casey walked in. After a silent moment they stopped and told Jill to close the door. For the past hour both had wondered what was taking so long up here. A weigh in should only take a minute or two but the girls had been up there for about 15 minutes before they returned. With all four fat girls squeezed in the small bathroom there wasn't much room to move. \"Alright, which fatty is first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill and Casey looked at each other. \"Why don't we go with Jill, you looked like the fatter of the two.\" Princess said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd agree with that. She is bulging out everywhere, and look at that rack, those girls must weigh a ton.\" Goddess said as she cupped Jill ample rack and licked her lips. \"Step on up fat stuff.\" Jill made her way past the two captain to the scale, brushing against their bulging bodies as she went. 201 read the digital numbers. \"Looks like some one had been hitting the food pretty hard, she is up there with the rest of em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now strip\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Jill was shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off that tight tee and jeans so we can see the woman you are.\" Jill had to comply, they were the team captains after all. She struggled to get her shirt off. The bathroom was a little cramped and she shirt was pretty small. \"Oh boy, I don't know how you even got that over your melons in the first place.\" The shirt was stuck at her shoulders, her arms had become thick and she was having a hard time maneuvering the shirt over her head. A second later she felt two bellies pressed against hers and two pairs of boobs on her sides. Princess and Goddess had come to assist in the shirt removal, but just created a blubber fest instead. Finally the shirt was removed and order was restored. Now it was time for the pants. As she bent over all of her rolls creased and she yanked the pants down. \"Need some butter for those rolls?!\" The two captains erupted in laughter. \"Make sure to bring butter for the next weigh in so we can lather Jill up. Oh girl look at you. Look how big you have gotten. I could just eat off those pillows on your chest.\" Princess took a turn at cupping Jill's rack. \"Almost as big as yours Goddess.\" The girls looked at Goddess rack which was indeed the biggest of the bunch. Goddess was wearing a tank top that only came up to her bra line so almost all of her chest was exposed. Casey and Jill was in awe of how big her chest was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Casey see for your self.\" Casey fondled her captains boobs getting a feel for the girth that they possessed. \"Now see how they compare.\" Casey looked at Jill. After some hesitation she grabbed her friends rack. Jill's boobs were definitely not as big as Goddesses but they were still amazing. Casey fondled them profusely until she snapped back to reality and quickly withdrew her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jill standing there in her undies, Princess took out a tape measure. \"Alright you hefty bitch, try not to squirm too much.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess started to wrap the extra large tape measure around the tubby Jill, remarking at every reading. Princess stopped from time to time to poke and prod at Jill's fleshy body which caused her to squirm. \"Stop jumping lardo, it's just a little love squeeze.\" Jill would say. Soon enough the measuring was done and it  was now Casey's turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright porky, strip.\" Goddess demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't I need to be weighted first?\" Casey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't resist not seeing all those womanly curves. Now take it all off!\" Casey took her top off with a bit more ease than Jill. Casey's wasn't as heavy in the chest department as Jill was, it seemed that Casey was storing all those burgers in her belly and behind. \"Hot dog, that's one plump belly.\" Goddess remarked. \"Now let's see how fat you've become. Step up.\" Casey complied and squeezed past all the other fat bodies towards the scale at the other side of the room. She felt a few belly pinches and could only assume they came from Goddess and Princess. Her blubber shook and she placed each foot on the scale. After a second the screen read out 205. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, looks like someone has been taking to the burgers pretty well.\" Princess exclaimed. This was a shock to both Jill and Casey. Yes they had both been trying to gain, but Jill was the one putting more effort into it, yet Casey was currently weighing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite chubby indeed. I think she is the biggest of the bunch. And to imagine she was only just a twig not that long ago.\" Goddess went on. \"I think this deserves recognition.\" Goddess placed her chubby hand on Casey and went in for a kiss. At first Casey resisted, but she was pinned in the back of the bathroom and was soon embracing the kiss. Goddess's large warm body smothered hers, enveloping her in a warm embrace. Jill looked on as Casey wasn't backing down from the long kiss being placed on her. Eventually Goddess backed off and have off a shiver from the thrill. \"Fat girls kiss so much better than boys.\" Is all Goddess said before sicking Princess and her measuring tape on her. Princess took her measurements. Her belly was of course her most impressive asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ordeal the two of them went sent back down stairs. Both of them were eager to get their hands on the treats the other girls had already been pigging out on. Sadly when they arrived back in the dining room there were no more treats and no more team members. Goddess' mom came in and told them to wait while the two captains finished up stairs. It wasn't long before the two fat captains came jiggling down stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as we suspected we still weight the same and the more so we are still reigning captains.\" Goddess told the two hungry girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations my big fat sexy Goddess and my big fat sexy Princess.\" Both girls said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to celebrate, lets have some desert.\" Goddess' mother started to bring out treats again. All four girls started to eat them up, smearing chocolate and sugar everywhere. They ate for a bit, but soon Goddess and Princess started to unbutton their shorts and take their tops off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casey come feed me.\" Goddess demanded of her team member. Casey had to comply and grabbed a cake off the table and took it over to where Goddess was lounging. She tore off a chunk with her hand and started to feed it to Goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that my Big Fat Sexy Goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, I want more bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my Big Fat Sexy Goddess.\" Casey kept shoveling cake into her awaiting mouth. In the process crumbs and frosting were falling all over the place. As Goddess got fuller, Casey started to rub her massive belly with her spare hand while still feeding her with the other. Of course Jill was doing the same to Princess on the other side of the table. After the cake Casey grabbed what ever was within reach to feed to her captain. A plate of brownies and donuts disappeared quickly. Between bites Casey made sure to eat her fair share as well. Goddess didn't mind watching the fat girl eat as long as her mouth was full. Casey's caressing hand started to move around more than just her belly. Her boobs which were overflowing the cups of her bra also got a much needed massage. Casey's bulging belly collided with Goddess every time she reached in to feed her even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the fat captains were full and just wanted to rest. Their stomachs were covered in frosting and other sugars from all the rubbing, and the remains of the meal could be seen on their faces and in their cleavage. Princess even pulled out a chunk of donut that had gotten lost between her boobs during the feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill and Casey went home as they let their bloated team captains rest for the night. Outside they discussed their continuing plan for becoming team captains. \"Can you imagine, soon that is going to be us. We will be the ones being fed and rubbed on when ever we want.\" Jill told Casey as they stood in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never thought I'd want this so badly, but I really do. But these girls are going to be hard to topple, it seems like they are getting fatter every day. We are going to have to gain at least 50 pounds before we pass them, I'm not sure 30 more is going to cut it. I'm not sure how our uniforms are going to fit when they were made for us at 70 lbs lighter, mines already getting a little tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Casey. We made it through the ordeal to join these ranks, gaining all this weight will be a walk in the park compared to that.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of months later Jill and Casey's race to captain ship was going well. They were both about 240lbs, a weight that at one time would have secured them a captains title. But now Goddess and Princess were pushing at least 250. Jill and Casey were within spitting distance of their goal though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like everyday they walked into McDonald's first thing in the morning. Of course they dawned their team uniforms like they were required to. They had stuck to their plan to not ask the captains for a larger size. They didn't want to give the captains any concern that they were encroaching on their titles. Jill and Casey had been given these uniforms 60 lbs ago, and needless to say, but they were not fitting so well anymore. Jill's massive bust stretched the fabric to the limit. Her girls stretched the neck line out so much that a tasty amount of cleavage was on display as well as her belly rolls. Casey on the other hand couldn't get the top to cover any of her massive stomach. The bottoms on both girls gave their skirts quite the challenge to cover up their large rumps. Yes their clothes were tight but it was the cost they were willing to pay for what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ordered their food and jiggled over to a booth to scarf it all down. They ate for hours, trying to gain as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day they were joined by Goddess and Princess. They saw Goddess' SUV pull into the the closest spot to the door, and the two large girls waddle inside. Both of them had let them selves go as well, and not enlarged their uniforms at the same time. The two fat captains loved to see their bellies hang free and their large asses barely covered by the thin skirt. Their flesh jiggled with each footfall as their massive exposed rolls quaked. They took their massive orders over to Jill and Casey and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are here again?\" Exclaimed Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my Big Fat Sexy Princess, we can't get enough.\" Jill responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like no matter when we come here, you two are always here.\" Goddess said \"And I come here almost every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, it must be a coincidence.\" replied Casey \"I must say My Big Fat Sexy Goddess, you are looking ever so big and sexy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you my pupil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tipping the scales at like 250, right?\" Casey was trying to be subtle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I usually only find out at the weigh-ins. But 250 sounds about right, 250 lbs of pure sexy fat.\" Goddess said as she bit into a greasy burger. \"Why are you asking anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\" Casey tried to play it off. \"I was just so awestruck at how stunning and large you are. I just can't resit you when I lay my eyes on you.\" Casey reached over the table and fondled her captains large boobs. Goddess moaned in pleasure. She loved being complemented on her good looks. Looked like Casey had dodged a bullet as all the girls resumed their eating. Goddess and Princess went at it for a few rounds before heading out. Jill and Casey continued their feasting until close like usual. They needed all the calories they could get. 10+ pounds was all they needed. </span></div></div>",

Not only did they have to catch up to their captains, they had to keep up with their growing waistlines too. All that hard work was about to pay off though. In a snapchat tobthw whole team Jill called for a weigh in that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gathered at Goddesses house again, but things were a little different this time, not only were Jill and Casey the size of goddess and princess now, but they were also just as bossy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's get that scale out here!\" Jill demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this all about Jill?\" Goddess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two fat bitches have been running this team long enough, I think it's time for a new leader.\" With that Jill took off her tight tank top in front of all the other girls in the dining room. She squirmed out of the tight ass shorts she had on and hopped on the scale. All of Jill's fat shook, and the soft recently acquired flesh settled. Casey went over the read the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"263 pounds!\" Jill threw her flabby arms up in celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo hoo\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast fatty we still need to weight in.\" Princess retorted, but she was biteing her lip in nervousness. Both princess and goddess took off their ill fitting clothes and each got on the scale. \"252 and 257, looks like neither of you made the cut.\" Casey said after reading the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have a new queen hog in town bitches. And before we go much further, if my lovely here would also stwp on the scale.\" Casey shifted on to the scale next. \"What do you know, 263 lbs as well. Looks like we are co captains sexy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess and goddess both looked on in horrorbas their titles had been strippes from them. \"Oh and by the way, your names are no longer princess and goddess, you will now be known as skinny bitch, and skinny slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain.\" The two girls growned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who's hungry?\" Skinny sluts mom started to bring out the big feast as before and Jill and Casey ate their fill, relishing in their new roles. They made the girls hand feed them, do embaraaing things, especially bitch and slut. They even made the two former captains degrade each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slut is a fitting name, you really are a slut, you can't get enough of this juicy fat can you.\" With that Jill made skinny slut make out with her, feed her, and rub her all over. Jill loves her new role, and could see Casey was having fun too. As long as they kept their weight up they could reign for ever.</span></div></div>",

The former captains gained ten pounds to catch up, but Jill and Casey were already ten pounds further at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fat off to see who could last the longest. Pound by pound the girls grew, just engulfing as much McDonald's as they could. Soon they all reached just around 300lbs. The other four girls on the squad still remained on the low two hundreds, totally avoiding the race that was happening with the captains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinny bitch and skinny slut may not be such fitting names any more, as the 300+ lb \"gymnasts\" waddled into McDonald's day after day. They were fairly confident that their new captains still out weighed them, and their hope was staring to wain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you skinny's\" Jill said as she plopped down a large tray of greasy fried food across from the old captains. Jill's body had ballooned in size. She had two gaint fat melons in front of her, blocking her view of the rest of her fleshy body. The two former captains looked on at Jill, the sexy round fatty that was their captain. They envied her job title, which they once held, but also envied her body. She was drop dead sexy and they both wanted a piece of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with that burger my dear captain?\" Bitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I grab you another round.\" Slut told her. Jill enjoyed the servitued of the other girls, and gladly soaked in the praise. The girls ate their fill and then parted ways. Bitch and slut just watched in enjoyment as Jill waddled out to her car, her whole body jiggling all the way.</span></div></div>",

Since Jill wasn't out stuffing her face with McDonald's, she was lounging in her comfy clothes. She had a pair of sleep shorts that didn't quite contain her large booty anymore, and allowed her legs to breathe in the warm summer night time air. Her top was a slinky sweater that kept her warm, but still showed plenty of skin and cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thunderous foot falls could be felt as she stomped her way to the door, her flab bouncing and jiggling as she went. Opening the door she found round little slut on the other side. \"Slut bag, I wasn't expecting you at the late hour.\" Jill demand her former captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't stop thinking about you. Your curves are just so gorgeous, I couldn't stand the thought of not seeing them continue to grow, I just had to see them for myself.\" Slut made an advance on Jill that she could not, but also really didn't want to avoid. Sluts plump hands found their way to her captains ample bosom, Jill instantly relishing in the attraction to her blown out curvacious form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way inside, away from public sight in the doorway, slut unable to take her hands off her captains rolls. \"God you are so fat and sexy!\" The fat slut moaned. Jill just shivered and moaned as the ferocious girl touched her all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of foreplay the girls allowed themselves to cool down.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our heroin of the story is Claire. She is a teenage girl living with her mother and father and attending high school. Pretty normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Claire's diet has changed, unbeknownst to her. Her parents have started buying snacks that are high in fat and other fatty foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Claire didn't really notice the change. After the change in food all over the house, Claire's parents started encouraging her to eat more. \"Hey hon, take this box of Twinkies up to your room with you.\" \"The rest of the donuts are your dear, your father and I have had enough.\" \"Why don't you go get seconds of desert?\" Claire always followed with what they said. As her parents encouraged her to eat more and more, and as she ate more sweets, her appetite grew. Soon she was polishing off the box of donuts before her parents even noticed. And she would have thirds for desert with out anyone saying a word. Claire was plumping up quite nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, originally 130lbs, was now nearing 160lbs. She had gotten soft all over her body. She had developed a second chin and chubby cheeks. Her perky breasts had become fuller and rounder. They strained her bras and tops. Her mother and refitted her whole wardrobe when Claire had first out grown her clothes, and now it was happening again. Her soft belly hung slightly over her pants. Her bellies roundness lead to some plump love handles on her sides. And then her butt had grown and was now quite the bubble behind her. Claire didn't notice the 30lb gain, for it was very gradual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning Claire was asleep and her parents came and woke her up. \"Good morning dear. It's time to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Dad? Why are you waking me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have something we want to talk to you about.\" Claire stretched as she sat up in bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so important that you had to wake me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see dear, you have been gaining some weight as of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have? It doesn't feel like I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have put on about 30lbs in the past year honey.\" Her father said plainly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! How did I gain weight? We have always had such regular eating habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey we are not here to put you on a diet. We have something to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's not that I gained weight what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want you to gain more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Why? You want me to be fat? Am I not your real daughter? Whats wrong with you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing wrong with us dear, and there is no shame in being fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother was quite large when we met, and she is the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your not fat now mom, why do I have to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was never meant to be fat, but you, you have a real chance of being the family pride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to be fat to be the pride of the family? Maybe I'm not meant to be fat either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust us dear, you are meant to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Claire was getting a bit depressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every generation of my family has plumped up their young girls when they are your age. It's how you become a woman in this family. And it is time you became a woman.\" Her mother explained. \"Your cousin Diane is going through the same thing you are. By the end of high school you need to be bigger than her in order to fill the shoes of all the women before you. You will become the next reigning family member, just like I am, and just like my mother was. You uncle is dead set on Diane winning this challenge, so your father and I need you on our side if we are going to win. Are you with us?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire didn't hate the way her eating habits had been in past year, so she decided to go with her parents crazy tradition. \"If this is going to make you guys happy, I guess I'll be on your side.\" Little did Claire know what she was getting herself into. What she did know is that she could use dome more curves. When she was 130lbs she was rail thin and noticed that all the hot popular guys were going after the girls with big boobs, even if they had a small stomach. Claire's boobs had already swelled up and were rivaling the size of the popular skinny girls. But where the skinny girls were pretty toned everywhere else, Claire was now a bit pudgy everywhere else. Anymore weight and the popular boys would but her in the fatty category. Claire being somewhat naive of the weight she had gained didn't see the harm in keeping an indulged diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's dad left her bed room and her mother came and sat on the edge of her bed. \"You don't know how proud you are going to make your father and me. Now why don't you get dressed and come down for breakfast.\" Claire's mother left her to change and Claire made her way down in due time. The smells coming from the kitchen were heavenly. She walked in to see a huge spread on the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we having guests over for breakfast?\" Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no honey, this is for you.\" her father replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For me?' Claire thought. 'I'll be a blimp if I eat all of this'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry hun, you don't have to eat it all, your father just over did it.\" her mother reassured her. The three of them sat at the table and Claire put a few pancakes on her plate and then lightly butter and syruped them. \"Honey there is plenty of syrup to go around, take some more if you want to.\" her mother encouraged. They knew Claire wasn't going to go all out and the still need to be encouraged. They still had a long time to plump up their little girl. Claire's parents ate a little bit each, and just watched and talked to Claire as she ate. Claire was easily putting away the food and was not filling up. She thought after the pancakes and a little sausage she would be done, but she want back for some eggs and toast, and then even some hash browns. Her parents forced a few more pancakes on her before she threw in the towel. Claire was quite stuffed and relaxed at the table while her parents cleaned up from the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went on and Claire steadily gained weight. She was always snacking on something, and her parents made sure that it was something sweet. The meals they made were hardy and rich. Claire loved everything her parents cooked, it was all very tasty. She wasn't minding the additional weight either. Her bust had filled out more, which she loved. She had also developed quite the stomach. The round little thing hung in front of her and jiggled slightly. The jocks who once looked at her now passed her over for skinner girls. She hadn't noticed that she was getting less and less attention from the males of her school. She assumed that her body was just what they all wanted. At 180lbs she was a bit bigger than most boys wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had been spending a lot of nights and weekends home with her parents. They always said they wanted to spend more time with her. What they really wanted was to keep her well fed throughout the day. On the days she did go out, she would hang out with her best friend Jennifer. Jen had noticed her weight gain at first but never said anything about, she didn't want to hurt Claire's feelings, and maybe it was just some winter weight. But now that Claire had put on 20 more pounds and didn't seem to be trying to lose any weight, Jen didn't know what to do. Jen just let her friend keep on eating to her hearts content, it was not really her place to tell her she was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's appetite was really starting to get the best of her. When she was out with Jen she would always complain that she was hungry and they would always go out to eat. Claire hung out more and more with Jen, and Jen just kept bringing her around to restaurants and what not. Jen started to really like hanging with Claire. Now that she was getting tubby, all the guys that used to check her out now had their eyes on Jen. All the restaurant eating helped Jen fill out in all the right places. Her ass grew into her tight jeans and her boobs filled her top. Her legs and stomach remained toned and slim, and next to Claire she looked even better. Jen would bring Claire out to the food court at the mall just so she could see how many stares she could get while her friend tended to her growing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire hit the 200lb mark she realized she had gone from twig, passed sexy, right to fatty. Claire was none to happy about this. Her friend Jen was getting looks from every guy they passes but not one had made a move on her in the past year. She knew her weight was to blame. What was Claire to do?</span></div></div>",

At 200lbs she sported a bulging belly that was hard to contain. It seeped over her waistbands and out from under her shirts. It also jiggled as she walked. Claire found her self repulsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there.\" Her mom tried to calm her down. \"There is nothing to be upset about. Weight doesn't have to be an indicator of attractiveness. High school boys are stupid, and don't know yet how attractive a full figured woman is. In the real world you are a knockout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that?\" Claire sniffled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your buns I do. Look at Queen Latifah or Oprah, both strong sexy bigger women, adorned by many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I should grow up to be a big black woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an example darling. But this in no way should hold you back from what your doing, helping out the family, making us proud, continuing to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm just going to get even fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there is nothing wrong with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued to eat and gain after getting a little pep talk from her mom. </span></div></div>",

Can I come over and talk to you?\" Jen was supportive and told her it was fine to come over, She could tell something was up, Claire had a concerned tone. When Claire arrived Jen was sitting in the kitchen sipping hot cocoa. She handed a cup to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire. I grabbed us some donuts. Sit down and have one.\" This was pretty usual for Jen, she was trying to get Claire to eat at ever occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm actually gonna cut back on eating sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I got your favorite for you.\" Jen opened the box and showed her plump friend the dozen delicious donuts. Claire's mouth watered and her stomached clenched telling her to have one, but yet she still resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jen I can't. I have been getting fat, and it's from eating crap like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not fat. Your not fat at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Because I feel fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear, you are just curvy. All these sweets have given your body some definition. You now have hips that drive men crazy. And look at that rack! I'm so jealous I don't have a chest like yours. Don't you see the stares you get at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I ever see is men staring at you and hitting on you. Not one guy has hit on my this whole year.\" Claire's voice started to sound like her feelings were coming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men are to nervous to talk to you. Your like a goddess. How do you expect men to talk to a goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right. I have been filling out in all the right places.\" With Claire's mind back in the right place, her hand slid over to the box of fresh donuts and she chewed through each one as the two girls talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we hit the mall tomorrow and you can see all the attention that you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great. Thanks for talking to me, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time dear\"</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Claire had headed home to another box of her favorite doughnuts and a lazy day of watching tv. Her parents kept her well fed and finished off the day with a hearty dinner. Claire went up to her room early to find something to wear tomorrow. All of her outfits were outgrown so everything she put on was tight and showed her new rolls. She finally settled on a top that showed her generous cleavage and a skirt that hid her chunky legs. Her mother brought her desert up to her and also a few snacks. Claire enjoyed every last sugary bite.</span></div></div>",

She knew Steve was going to meet them there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a first, usually I'm the one who wants to go to the food court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm just famished.\" She lied. They both grabbed some lunch. Claire tried not to get too much. She knew if she got bigger then the men were really not going to find her attractive. But Jen had her convinced that at her whopping 200lbs that she was plenty sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve spotted the pair from across the food court. He waited for them to sit before he went in for the kill. As they sat down at a table he was starting to have second thoughts. He could see all of her rolls through her tight clothes, and her wide hips. She was the total opposite of what he was looking for in a woman. Then he saw Jen. She had a perfect body in his eyes. She had a huge perky rack, and a nice ass. Also her legs were so long and sexy. He knew what he had to do in order to hit that. Steve went and sat at the table next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Claire's table Jen was being pretty quite, giving Steve as much time as he need to break into their conversation. When Claire sat down she was holding onto her wallet. She started to eat but held onto the wallet. Steve sat waiting, eying their table, waiting for Jen to make a move. After a while Claire finally moved the hand her wallet was in. But instead on leaving it on the table she put the wallet in her lap. 'Crap' Jen thought to herself. Then Jen decided to do something to get the ball rolling. She put her wallet up on the table and then after a few seconds, knocked it off with her tray. Steve immediately went to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did one of you ladies drop this?\" Steve used the most charming voice he had. As he said it he looked Claire right in the eyes and smiled. She blushed and looked at Jen as if to say 'you were totally right'. Jen remained silent allowing Claire to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, y-yes. It's my friend Jen's here.\" Jen turned and took her wallet from Steve. The whole time Steve kept his eyes on Claire's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you two ladies to the mall on this fine Sunday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Jen stayed silent allowing Claire to hold the conversation. \"Oh were just hanging out. I wanted to go to the music store to see if they had anything new this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I was just headed over there what a coincidence.\" Steve flashed Claire another smile. Claire was swooning over Steve so bad. He was the first boy to pay attention to her in a full year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't you join us then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen decided to use this opportunity to speak up. \"Well actually I was going to go clothes shopping. Why don't you two go to the music store together and we can meet up later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled \"Sounds great.\" Steve said. Steve stood up and held his hand out and helped Claire up. Steve was playing the part of the gentleman, but Claire could always use a hand now when it came to standing, she wasn't used to her new weight yet. The two of them sauntered off down the hallway leaving Jen at the table. Jen leaned back and smiled. She felt good about what she was doing for her friend. She also felt like quite the matchmaker. Steve had put on quite a convincing show, it almost fooled Jen for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two 'love birds' went all over the mall together that day. They started at the music store and then hit each store front from one side of the mall to the other. Eventually it was time for the mall to close. Both parties were ecstatic. Claire had an amazing day with an amazing guy, and Steve's day from hell was finally over. Steve was so embarrassed to be seen at the mall with the heifer Claire, but it was just one day, as long as it didn't happen again he could smooth over his image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had seen Jen do this a million times, but she was so nervous to do it her self. She wanted to give Steve her number so she could see him again. \"Well I guess the mall is closing.\" Claire started awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a bummer. I had such a great day with you Claire.\" Steve played it up still for this final moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about you call me sometime?\" Claire reached into her purse and grabbed the first piece of paper she could. She was so nervous she struggled to rip it. Steve sat there with a smile, thinking in his head there was no way he was going to call her, but he had to take her number anyways. Finally she freed a piece of paper and found a pen. She scrawled down her number and gave it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks darling\" He said as she turned and walked away. Claire was giddy. When he was out of ear shot she let out a little squeal. Claire found her way back to the food court, with a smile on her face and a hop in her step the whole way. She found Jen and told her all about her day on the ride home. Jen just listened and nodded. Self-esteem, check!</span></div></div>",

After her dinner feast and mountain of desert that followed her parents really laid on the calories in the following weeks. She ballooned from 200lbs up to 250 in mere months. It didn't help that Jen was also stopping at every fast food stand for a \"small\" bite with Claire when ever they were out. Jen had been having less and less random hook-ups with hot guys and she didn't know why. Her rational was that Claire needed to plump up more so she could seem more attractive, even more so than she did now, she really wanted to stand out next to her fat friend. A more rational reason might have been no one wanted to approach her while Claire was pigging out two feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter months and 50 new pounds Claire started to realized the reality of her new situation. She tried to remember what her mother had told her about not associating weight with beauty. Although she was 50 lbs heavier then when she had that date with Steve, she was not less attractive. Either way, Claire felt big. In two and a half years she had doubled in size. She now slightly waddled when she walked, and her whole form jiggled at the slightest motion. Her huge melons blocked her view of the rest of her large posterior. But day in and day out she ate without abandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter months of not hearing from Steve, Claire was tempted to give up on trying to look good when she went out. Maybe she was fat and gross and shouldn't even try to look good anymore. She sat in her room in a sweat shirt and sweat pants. 'I guess this is my lot in life.' She thought to her self. Just then, she she ate the last twinkie in the box she was holding, she got a call of Jen. \"Get dressed sweetie, lets go to the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen I don't really feel like it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in five to pick you up. Wear that new sexy top you got. I'm so jealous you can pull it off, it looks so hot on you.\" *Click.* Jen had hung up and Claire wiped the remains of twinkie from her lip. After she reluctantly put on her sexy top and some tight jeans she made her way down stairs to wait for Jen. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire bobbed and jiggled in her sexy tight clothes as she made her way down the stairs. The sexy top she was wearing had been purchased a few pounds ago and was starting to get pretty tight. It clung snugly to her ample bosom. Her jeans had never been tighter and created quite the muffin top out of her soft mid section. Very little was left to the imagination when it came to Claire and her outfit. She had done her hair and make-up, but nothing as nice as she had been doing for the past few months to attract all the boys, and not nearly as nice as she knew Jen was going to be gussied up. She found solace in a box of snack cakes in the kitchen as she waited for Jen's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was prompt as usual. She walked into Claire's house finishing what looked like a Big Mac and crinkling up the wrapper. In the time Claire went from bountiful curvy girl to hog heaven, Jen had found her own curves. She used her perfect hourglass figure to hook and boy she wanted. In the past several months that Claire had packed on 50 new pounds, it was partly due to Jen's constant snack breaks. Jen thought that Claire's extra snacking would help her chances with the boys, but so far it had not paid off for her. She kept the plan in motion until she could discover the crux of its failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crux was right in front of her, but she just couldn't see it. It didn't help that she had a set of two giant melons blocking her view. All the stops for Claire were also stops for Jen. Jen never ate as much as Claire at every fast food joint on the strip, but she still ate at all of them. She had built up quite the appetite beside Claire over the past year, and that had transformed her perfect hourglass figure into more of a pear. Her rack had expanded, but more so had her backside. Her newly thickened legs lead up to a booty that rivaled Claire's. Jen had not developed the overly inflated spare tire that Claire sported, but she was far from the toned stomach she used to have. A soft roll of flesh could be seen often due to all the lift her chest gave to her tops. The more often jeggings she sported showed off every bit of new weight added to her legs and butt. Jeans had been out sourced when they became to difficult and ridged to pull up her meaty legs, let a lone her derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had noticed her larger friend but still thought she looked like the prom queen, especially next to Claire. It didn't help that Jen always dressed to impress and had and air of confidence around her that Claire lacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two larger ladies got in Jen's car and headed to the mall. They made their typical stops for donuts, coffee, burgers, ice cream, and what ever else their stomachs rumbled for. Their routine had become so second nature by the time they had gotten to the mall they still both had room for more food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two immediately head to the food court. Jen and Claire seemed like the definition of mall rats. I'm pretty sure most of the full time mall food court staff knew them. As the two of them started their first course they started to chat. Of course it had to be about boys. \"Jen, I saw the pizza place's owners son eye balling you just now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Claire replied \"I wish I could get stare that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl you turn tons of heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh, I haven't been on a date or anything since that one with Steve. And then he never called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't been so lucky either, I feel like it's been weeks since I've been hit on.\" Jen said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's this mall. This place is pretty run down and boring. And the food could be better.\" Claire placed down the rest of her taco while giving it a weird look of disgust. Just as the conversation was getting good Jen's old friend Steve turns the corner. \"OMG Jen it's Steve. I haven't seen him in months. Should I go talk to him? Maybe he just lost my number? He had such a good time with me, he would have called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno girly...\" But before Jen could talk her out of it Steve was passing by and Claire was waving him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Steve! It's me Claire, remember? Come join us.\" Steve's eyes almost burst out of his head when he saw Claire. She was 50 lbs heavier and wearing tighter clothes than she was last time. This girl really was a tubbo. He noticed Jen at the table so felt obligated to come say hi. They hadn't talked since the few she threw he way after his date with Claire. All summer Jen had been more occupied with Claire than hooking up with boys from her black book. \"You remember my friend Jen right?\" Steve nodded and waved. He wanted to get this over with as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Claire I totally wanted to call you after our amazing date,\" Now that Steve was sitting right next to Claire he could see all her rolls and newly added pounds. It made him choke up a bit. \"But I lost your number some where between here and my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was the case. I was hoping to see you at the mall one of these days so we could reconnect. Who would have thought it would be months later.\" This made Steve smirk. He had been actively avoiding the mall because he knew it was Claire's stopping ground. After that date he had with her he had a hell of a time convincing his bros that it was just a charity thing. He was not risking coming back here to rekindle what they had. So much time had gone by it slipped his mind that he could run into her here. \"Why don't I get your number this time, because I'm not going to lose it.\" Claire said with a slight chuckle as she grabbed a receipt from her bag and a pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve tried to be quick on his toes. He didn't want to give his number to this chick. He wouldn't be able to get rid of her. \"I... um... that's not really going to work, because...ah I've been working a lot so I won't ever really pick up, so just give me yours again and I'll call you when I'm not working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm sure.\" Claire said not thinking too much about it. She wrote down her number and handed it to Steve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I'll give you a call real soon. Speaking of work though I really got to go. Great seeing you Claire, and you too Jen.\" Before he left Steve gave a look to Jen. Jen stared at him with fiery eyeballs, as to say you better not break her heart again. As he left Jen whipped out her phone and started to text him. 'Meet me at the McDonalds near your house tonight at 6'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Around 6:30 Steve strolled into the McDonalds by his house. Jen was sitting in a booth chomping on a burger. Steve joined her on the other side of her booth. \"Way to be late.\" Jen exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I was busy. Looks like you made your self at home.\" Steve retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll cut straight to the chase, you need to call Claire and go on a date with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why in the hell would I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you broke her heart last time, and the I lost your phone number line isn't going to work a second time.\" As a silence began it was over shadowed by the clerk at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number 87, your order is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Jen said as she left the booth to go pick up her obviously second or third order of the night. Steve took in the full view that Jen was displaying as she walked up to the counter. The once toned girl had totally filled out. Her rump sat tightly packed in the back on the pink dress she wore. Her thick legs trailed below, touching generously. As she sauntered back to the booth with a large tray of fast food her ample bosom could be seen through the low cut of the dress, not that he hadn't noticed the girls when Jen was sitting across from him earlier. He could also see the round belly she was not sporting as a result of her continued friendship with Claire. \"So your going to call her right?\" Jen spoke as she unwrapped her first big mac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a shit if tubbo is heart broken that I didn't call. I got a hard enough time from the guys last time I was scene with the school blimp, now that she is a whale what are people going to say about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about if you do this for me I'll be yours when ever you want. Think of it as a personal booty call. Call me when ever and I'll come over. But your going to have to go on some serious dates if you want this deal to last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew gross, that's like picking garbage off the ground and then having to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your telling me you don't want unlimited chances to hit this in return for a few crummy dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen I wouldn't want to hit that if you paid me.\" Steve replied. \"Have you seen your self lately? You have become Claire 2.0. Your still a Titanic vessel of big macs away from matching that whale, but I'm pretty sure I see the ship pulling into the harbor. I'm glad I could be here to see you sink the rest of your life away for a sandwich with special sauce because it was a pleasure. I hope you and tubbs stay real close friends because that's all you have going for you now.\" And with that Steve got up and left the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was in complete shock. She even dropped her burger to the tray as her mouth hung wide open. After Steve was out of the restaurant and driving away Jen was able to regain her composure. She looked down and pressed her hands into her soft midsection. Her stomach used to be completely flat and toned and now there was inches of soft flesh covering the whole thing. She looked at her fingers and puffy arms and realized there was fat everywhere on her. Her arms jiggled, her love handles popped out at her sides, and her butt was so fleshy is oozed out as she sat on it. She took her tray of food straight to the trash and left the restaurant. She called the only person she could. Claire.</span></div></div>",

Claire had found confidence within her recent conversation with Steve and was now apt to eat what ever she desired. Jen on the other hand wanted nothing to do with brownies. She had to tread lightly though as to not spoil the secret she was keeping about Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great I love brownies.\" Jen felt pressured to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I'll make you a plate. Do you prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream with your brownies?\" The question made Jen sick to her stomach, she could just see the fat being piled on her by her large friend. She imagined herself as large if not larger than Claire with only the desire to eat sweets. The thought of being that fat grossed her out, but the idea of eating more sweets was one that she was ok with. Jen wasn't getting fatter for no reason, she was actually enjoying all the food she ate with Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla is fine.\" Jen finally responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Topped with fudge?\" Claire just had to keep piling it on. After a short silence \"Of course you want fudge, who eats brownies not covered in delicious hot fudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds amazing.\" Jen lied. \"I'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yuck' She thought as she hung up the phone. Deep inside her this dessert sounded delicious after the greasy dinner she had just enjoyed, but right now all she could think about is how fat it was going to make her. Jen quickly approached Claire's house and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jen settled in at Claire's house the two of them went up to her room with their desserts. Jen nibbled at hers while Claire went full pelt. \"Claire do you think I have gotten fat?\" Jen might have just realized the severity of her situation, but Claire still looked up to Jen as amazingly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think your fat? Because I'm fat. And if I'm fat then that means your like the stereotypical head cheerleader. Your thin and beautiful. Your boobs look amazing and you have an ass that is mesmerizing. I know I'm sexy in my own way and I'm going to totally rock Steve's world when we have our first real date, but you could get any guy you wanted with your body. Why do you think your fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was at McDonald's having a salad and this jock comes over and calls me fat for no reason.\" Jen was usually quick witted, but today was not her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is awful, and not just because their salads are the least appetizing thing on the menu. I bet he is just a jerk and knows he can't land a hottie like you because he is such a meat head.\" Claire was actually a pretty great friend. \"This is the same talk you had with me months ago. Just because you haven't hooked up a few weeks doesn't mean anything. I mean I thought like that and then I met Steve, and look he tracked me down at the mall because he lost my number.\" Although Jen knew Claire's confidence was all fake because Jen had force Steve to pick up Claire, her tale was really lifting her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right Claire, maybe I just need to look at my situation a little differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that's the Jen I know. Now finish your brownies, your ice cream is almost fully melted.\" Jen indeed finished her plate of brownies and ice cream, and the two spent the rest of the night hanging out and having a girl night. Claire's mom made sure to keep them well fed and baked all sorts of treats of the two growing teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few months Claire's gaining continued. She went from a plump 250 to tipping the scale at 300 lbs. Her parents could not have been prouder. Steve never called, but boys had taken a back seat to food recently. Eating made Claire happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was not the only making changes in her junior year at high school. Jen had also filled out since her encounter with Steve. Even though she had bulged out to 180 lbs when Steve had told her off she continued her eating patterns with Claire. Jen didn't have the encouraging parents that Claire did. She was envious when Claire's parents would buy her new clothes because she had jumped a size up. As Jen filled out she used her allowance to clothe her expanded body. She was forced to wear the same gray leggings to school almost everyday because it was all that would fit. A tight mini skirt and old tee shirt where the other accoutrements to her wardrobe. Jen had gained 30 lbs taking her over 200 lbs to the 210 mark. She also had left boys in the dust for the time being and used the past few months to get closer with Claire. At first Claire was a means to and end as she tried to pick up boys. But after the night that Claire brought Jen's spirits back up Jen looked to Claire as more of a best friend now more than ever. She no longer force fed Claire for personal gain, she used their dining out to chat and be best friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter break of their junior year was approaching and nothing was slowing down.</span></div></div>",

Everyone around them was curious as to why they ate without abandon day in and day out, but no one really cared enough to intervene. Claire's parents were just as supportive as always. They quickly realized that having Jen around was a great help to Claire. It not only kept her belly full it also gave Claire someone to be close with. With all the ups and downs at the start of Claire's journey her parents very nervous that Claire was going to up and quit when the road got too tough. But now with Jen in the picture Claire was happier than ever. This meant they had too keep Jen's tummy full too, but it was a small consolation. The girls constantly pigged out over at Claire's house where the treats were never ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of Claire's mind she knew she was doing all this eating for a reason, family tradition and competition and all, but mainly her appetite and sweet tooth had grown so large she just loved to eat. Claire's passion had soon become Jen's as well. Jen loved eating almost as much as Claire did and it really showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter break came and the girls were out of school for a whole week. Of course the only thing on the agenda was food. You would think that the two of them would get bored of eating all the time, but they really didn't. Christmas turned into a new year, and the girls sat around thinking of some new year resolutions. \"Jen what do you want out of this coming year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing on my list is another slice of this delicious cake your mom made us.\" Jen rolled off her pudgy back where she was laying on the floor of Claire's bedroom. She proceeded to cut a big slice of the triple layer cake that was on a cake stand next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah my mom really knows her way around the kitchen. Maybe that can be my new years resolution, learn how to cook and bake. I mean we only have three more semesters until we graduate. What are you going to do when that happens? A lot of our class mates are doing college visits this spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really thought about it. Never really pictured myself not going to college. Seems like the next step. What about you, do you want to go to college?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire answered \"I'm not sure. My mom told me that all I had to do was win this family contest and my life would be on track after that. I wonder what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happens if you lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was stumped and took a moment to answer. \"I never thought of that. I guess I always thought winning was a the only option. And I mean how can I not win, I'm almost 300 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you can't be that big.\" Jen's mouth was agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, I weighted myself the other day. 297. I'm the biggest girl in the school. There is no way my cousin Diane is bigger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't believe you can be 300 lbs. You look like your 225, 250 max.\" Obviously Jen didn't know what 225 looked like considering she was nearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll prove it to you, come to the bathroom.\" The two proceeded to the bathroom where the scale confirmed that Claire was 297 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look damn good for 297 lbs dear. I know I'll never be that big, but you look better than me and I'm only 165.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't put your self down. Your wicked hot for 165. It's not the number that matters it's how you feel about your self. And even if you were ever to hit 300 I bet you would be just as beautiful as you are now. But your not 300 lbs your still 165, and what is 165 lb Jen going to be doing in a year and a half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen demolished her cake as she thought, cutting off another piece when she was done. \"Well I want to go where you go. If your not going to college then I'm not either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty short sighted don't you think.\" Claire replied with a heaping full of cake attached to her fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's true. I don't want to go off to college without you. Who is going to come to the cafeteria with me for all my meals, and explore all the restaurants the town has to offer. Also if your not there I won't be able to mooch off the amazing care package your mother would most certainly send.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen you don't need me there to enjoy all those new experiences, you will meet new people and have tons of new friends. And I'll still be here for when you come home and want to have a slumber party away from your vegetable eating parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right. Maybe we should start cutting down on your sweets so you end up bombing this competition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grabbed the cake stand that was holding her cake that was previously resting on her night stand. \"Don't even think about messing with my sweets. I'll stab you.\" Claire started jabbing her fork in Jen's direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clam down, no one is taking your sweets away. Speaking of, looks like mine is all gone. Looks like your the loser that goes down stairs for the next round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine, just let me finish.\" Claire retorted. Surprising how long these two could go on about food. The future was still up in the air. Would Claire win the crown in the family when all was said and done? How big was her cousin Diane? What did winning entail anyways? And what was Jen going to do with out Claire? Jen's parents would surely kick her out of the house after graduation. Would she go on to college or find a job? Maybe the girls stick it out together, at college or other wise. Only time would tell. One thing was for sure though, their obsession with food would not falter.</span></div></div>",

Claire quickly hopped over the 300 mark and her parents had a party to celebrate. Of course Jen was invited and the two girls ate without abandon until they were both ready to explode. Claire's parents could not be happier. Their little girl had embraced their family's tradition, albeit hesitantly at first. Now it seemed nothing would slow down her gain. Their eyes glowed all night as they watched the two girls eat away at an entire table of sweets. Claire had indeed become the big beautiful woman that they wanted her to be. She was top heavy like her mom was, sporting a large bosom and full round belly. The double chin and plump arms helped define Claire's other chunky features. Jen on the other hand had kept her hourglass figure, it just happened to be quite the round hourglass. She had an ample chest like Claire but also had a huge ass that tapered into some chunky legs. She had a flabby spare tire around her middle, but it wasn't anything near Claire's. The two girls did still have a 90 pound weight difference. We could only imagine what Jen would look like with another 90 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir spring semester wasn't very eventful. The two girls went to class, waited for lunch all day, enjoyed a rich lunch provided by Claire's mom, then finished the rest of their classes excited to go home and eat what ever was waiting at Claire's house. As the school year was ending the rest of their class mates were getting ready for the junior prom. This event got Claire and Jen nervous. They had spent the last 7 months not even thinking about boy or anything that wasn't food. Jen was having a hard time denying that she was almost 250lbs. And while Claire was ok with her large body she thought that no one would want to take her to the junior prom which left her a little sad on the inside. Neither one of them spoke of their insecurities about the prom until about a week before it was scheduled to happen. Claire decided to break the ice \"So Junior Prom is like in a week huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess...\" Jen said as she thought about how she really didn't want to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone ask you to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. And I'm not surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" Claire was startled by her friends negativity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would anyone ask me out? All I've done this year is stuff my face and get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your the hottest girl in school. Just because you have some curves now doesn't mean your still not number one out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have more than just curves, these are rolls. Giant fat rolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your only 165 lbs, no girl that size could be considered fat. Come on be real, how many guys have asked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. I'm serious.\" Jen was starting to get upset<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no one asked me either. I wasn't planning on going. But I feel like I'd be missing out on one of the big high school moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to miss out on. People get dressed up and then all the sexually charged teens try and find someone to get with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard there is a pretty good spread in the atrium...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I'm not going to go just because there is good food. I don't have anyone to go with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard it catered by Jumpin' Jack's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No way. They make the best food. Remember that office party your mom brought us to? I don't think I have been more full in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your in?\" Claire tried to entice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not going alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then come with me. I'll get all gussied up, squeeze this big bod into a hot dress and the two of us can go and have a good time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course hun. Also I heard a lot of guys are going stag anyways so maybe we can meet a few 'sexually charged teens' while we are there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I won't hold my breath for that, but I can't turn down an invite for all I can eat Jumpin' Jack's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I can't wait.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night of the prom quickly came and Jen was on her way to Claire's to pick her up. Jen was pretty hesitant about the whole night, it was only her new found fondness for food that was making her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen had lied about only being 165 lbs back when the turn of the year came, because she was actually 210 at that point. As the spring rolled on and so did the pounds she was having a harder time denying that she was big. By the time the prom hit Jen was a whopping 250. Jen had never felt bigger. She wasn't nearly the 320ish that Claire was, but Jen was still one of the bigger girls at the school. The extra weight had at least been nice to her, giving her a mammoth chest and shapely rear. She was able to stay stylish and sexy, especially with the help of Claire's family. Jen's parents were no help when it came to coping with their daughters new weight. If Jen wanted stylish clothes their thought process was that she could lose the weight and wear what she already owned. But there was no way Jen was going to start dieting now. She loved food no matter how large it made her. She just had to deal with the repercussions a little bit more than Claire did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen pulled up to Claire's house and walked inside. Meanwhile Claire was up in her room getting ready.Claire and her mom had spent all week trying to find a dress for her. It had been awhile since Claire had worn a dress and especially a prom worthy dress. The last time she had gotten this dressed up she was a third of her size. Her mom told her this was good practice for her graduation. She was surely going to be larger then and was not only going to need a dress for her schools graduation but also one for the big family get together. The two of them finally found a dress they liked but that was also able to be let out enough to fit Claire in it. So they had it tailored, and the night of the prom her mother helped her get into it. It took quite a bit of effort, but in the end it fit... snugly. The tight dress did wonders for Claire's figure. Her ample bosom was on display and the tight blue fabric hung nicely around her bulging belly. Claire twirled around in her room watching the bottom on the dress flow while at the same time watching her soft body jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she heard some ruckus downstairs and knew that Jen must have arrived. Downstairs as Claire's parents and Jen heard heavy footfalls headed towards the stairs the all stopped and turned their attention to the stair case. Claire emerged with a big smile on her face as she walked slowly down the short stair case. Everyone watched as each step sent ripples through the massive teens body. Claire looked down to see Jen all gussied up herself wearing a tight pink number that hugged her curves equally well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun you look amazing.\" the first thing Jen said to Claire as she joined them downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking pretty good yourself there. Where did you get that cute number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom helped me pick it out, thanks again Mrs. J.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you two better be on your way, you don't want to be late.\" Claire's mom insisted. The two blubberous teens agreed and headed out to the car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen drove as Claire's thoughts drifted off unto food. This was not unusual for her, I mean she was actively trying to get as fat as possible for her family's respect. But right now the thoughts about food were warranted for out 320lb prom goer. Claire has just spent the last few hours getting her self ready for the big night she had no time to eat. Not only had she passed on having a snack or two at home as to not ruin her dress or makeup, but she also wanted as much room in her belly so she could eat more at the prom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we are the only two people going to this prom strictly for the food?\" Claire formed her thoughts out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. But is that so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! I have been looking forward to this all week. I just hope I fit into my dress after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, me too. It's already tight as it is. But at least it shows off the girls nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do look hot in that dress. Your not going to leave with some guy tonight are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just mean if I were a guy I'd find you irresistible so I was just wondering if you were going to be on the prowl tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going for the food, and only going because your my date. I would never leave without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm glad you said that.\" With Claire's nerves abated the two girls pulled up to the school building. They were quite prompt considering the prom started at 8 o'clock and it was 8:01. Never the less the two hulking teens waddled up to the atrium. The crowd there seemed small and the two of them took their time dipping their toes in the water so to say, just like everyone does at the start of a school dance. After a minute or two the girls noticed where the food was being set up in the back of the atrium. Several long table covered in table cloths, maned by folks wearing cartering clothes was the tip off. While trying not to look like a lion chasing down a sickly gazell, the two made their way in that direction as fast as they could. As they got there they noticed all the serving dishes were empty. The pans had been set out and the little fire canisters were being placed under things that needed to stay warm, but there was not food. Jen caught the attention of one of the caterers and asked \"Where is all the food?\" The man must have been caught off gaurd since most people don't ask where the food is they just politely wait, but as he turned and saw the buxom girl with the fat ass and her rotund friend whom were asking he quickly put two and two together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food won't be ready for awhile it just arrived. Sorry.\" He didn't look sorry. Claire's stomach clenched as she expect food when she got here and was now going to have to wait to subside her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to do something to distract our selves. I'm so hungry I can't just sit here and wait, my stomach would eat it self. Let's go dance.\" Claire grabbed Jen by the hand and started in towards the gymnasium, not giving Jen a chance to object. Jen was at least giving a face of distaste. She really had no interest in dancing she was really here just for the food. She didn't even care about the social obligation like Claire did. She could care less about missing her junior prom. If she had been invited to a different party tonight catered by the same people she would have gone there. Claire would have too if the prom wasn't catered by them, but Claire was quite happy that she could dress up and attend her junior prom. It made her feel normal. Claire's high school life had not been what most would call normal. Over the past three years she has gone from an athletic 130lb teen to a enormous 320lbs girl. She was the largest girl in the school and her world had totally flipped around because of it. Eating and gaining weight was not what most high school girls prioritized. So Claire was excited that she got to live a bit or normalcy tonight, even thought she was totally going to stuff her face once the food was put out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on Claire and Jen had made their way down the short hallway into the gymnasium. The room was full of their fellow classmates moshed in the center of the room dancing with one another while many students hung around the edge of the room either to shy to dance or waiting for someone to dance with. Jen would much rather be on the edge of room than in the middle of all that chaos, but Claire had the opposite mind set. Claire dragged Jen into the middle of the fray against her will. Jen's attitude was quite odd for her. A year ago she would have totally been in the middle of the crowd getting her dance on, but as this past year had carried on Jen had lost some of her confidence. It was of course due to her new found weight. Jen had doubled in size over the course of high school and didn't feel great about it. She didn't hate herself, but she felt that the weight made her an outcast. Her only friend was Claire and we all know how that friendship played out. She also didn't feel sexy inside her skin like Claire did. Although Jen had a kickin curvy body, she was still without the stereotypical hot body she once had. She had given up the notion of having that body long ago but it didn't make her feel great knowing how fat she had become. So with her confidence lacking slightly she was in no mood to dance, especially with how jiggly she had been getting recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jen wasn't thrilled, Claire was having a great time. Here she was at her junior prom in a sexy dress in front of all her class mates living it up. Claire threw caution to the wind and was dancing her heart out to her favorite music. Jen soon got into it with her best friend and started to have a good time after a song or two. The girls were having fun but they were also creating quite the scene. As their class mates danced around them the two of them got quite the many stares from all around. Claire and Jen were two of the biggest girls in the school, let alone the junior class. Classmates watched on as these two plump girls jiggled and waddled around on the dance floor. Both their dresses were so tight that the full extent of their rolls were on display for the whole student body. Also their dresses were so low cut that their massive boobs could be easily seen bouncing to the beat. Claire and Jen were oblivious to the stares and were just enjoying the music and excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly, to Jen's enjoyment, Claire was exhausted. She pulled Jen from the dancing masses and told her she needed a break. Although Jen was having a little fun she would rather be else where. As the two walked out to possible fetch some water, they both remembered why they were here in the first place, food. They rushed, albeit slower after all that dancing, to the food tables. As the approached they saw the enormous spread that had finally been laid out. They both squealed with glee on the inside, and found a place in line. Claire's feet were killing her and she could have really used a glass of water, but her hunger was more important than all of that. Claire and Jen both loaded up plates with as much as they could. There were plenty of options, and they both wanted a little of everything. Once fully loaded up they found an empty table and plopped down. The excitement in their eyes could not be matched. They ate as the music continued to play down the hall. Song after song played as the girls ate plate after plate full of food. Other students drifted in and out of the atrium, but Claire and Jen stayed, even as the biggest radio hit played that cause everyone in the atrium into the gym. The two of them were loving the food. The caterers were starting to take notice of the two large girls, they didn't really care about their feasting, they just hoped that they wouldn't run out of food. Either way it made for a great story back home, two large prom goers eat a whole catered meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough their thoughts became a reality when the food pans started to go dry. The manager had been smart enough to call in more food when he noticed everything getting low, mostly from Claire and Jen's extreme hunger. So as Claire and Jen finished their plates and went back for more they were met by the manager telling them there was no more to be had. The two stuffed girls were not satisfied. They went back and sat at their table for a little digesting time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about this time that two scrawny boys approached the girls. \"How does a catering company run out of food?\" Said the shorter of the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, did they not expect people to eat.\" Claire emotionally responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls look like your still hungry.\" The short boy said again. By this time they had the girls attention and Jen and Claire were looking right at them as they stood next to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we sit?\" He asked. Both boys looked like they had to be freshman, and didn't belong at the junior prom. Claire motioned for them to sit and the shorter one set next to Claire while the taller one sat next to Jen. \"Well you might not believe it but my parents are chefs and their food is way better then this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than Jumpin' Jacks? Impossible.\" Jen blurted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. We can show you if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you do that?\" Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditch this soup kitchen and come over to my place. My parents made bunch of food for a party that was cancelled so it's just all sitting at my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Claire was intrigued, but then realized that she had only just met these boys. \"What do you think Jen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen always in the mood for delicious food was also curious \"Well if they say it's better than Jumpin' Jacks, I say we can't believe it until we try it ourselves. Not like this place has any more grub anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire still on the fence, comes to a decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire decides to take the boys up on their offer. The two well fed ladies followed the boys out to the short ones car. Along the way Claire and Jen could be seen tugging on their dresses. After their feasting their expanded bodies were not fitting so well into their tight dresses. As they got into the car Claire started to think about why these guy would be doing this. Was it all really just to prove his parents cooking was good? Were these guys attracted to them? The questions would have to go unansered for now because they were quickly swept away to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you boys don't look like juniors, what were you doing at our prom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we are only freshman. We wanted to see how easy it would be to sneak into the prom. Result: not very hard. So by the way the name is Kenny and that is Jake.\" Said the shorter boy. Kenny had strategically placed Claire in the front seat with him leaving Jake to take up the back seat with Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you guys. I'm Claire and this is my best friend Jen. We were not going to go to the prom but when we heard it was being catered by Jumpin' Jacks we decided to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you not going to go? It's your junior prom, big high school moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked us. So we ended up going together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked pretty girls like you two, boy must be a lot of dumb guys your age.\" Kenny replied back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told Jen. I mean she is a bombshell, and not a single guy asked her. I guess we're just lucky you two snuck into the prom then, huh?\" Claire's newfound confidence was surprising even herself. She was being a total flirt. Kenny must not have lived far from the school because within minutes they were at his house. They welcomed the girls inside and walked them into the living room. \"Parents not home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Since they got the night off they went out. You two must be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we ere promised food\" Claire retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before we drop the bomb on you why don't we get started with a few drinks and some munchies.\" Kenny and Jake disapeared into the kitchen only to return with two bowls of chips and some sodas. The girls quickly started in on the chips while the four of them talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chips are lovely, but I thought we came here for some real food.\" Jen said as she took the last chip from her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. No need to get antcy. We will be right back.\" Kenny and Jake left again, and this time when they returned they had with them two large plates of pasta. The girls started to dig into the pasta covered in Alfredo sauce. As they ate they quickly came to the conclusion that this food was not better than Jumpin' Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Kenny, but this is no where as good as Jumpin' Jacks. It's almost not as good as my mom makes. Didn't you say your parents were chefs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on ladies we are just getting started. I'm sure you have plenty of more room in there. There is plenty more to be had, this is just the start. We have to ease into it.\" With that Kenny left to only return with a large cake. \"Alright you girls want good, try this cake.\" The girls finished with their pasta, leaned in and started ripping off chunks of cake with their forks. Mouthful after mouthful was plucked off the tall standing triple layer cake but after a few bites the girls had more complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, but I think I have had better. Your not living up to your promise Kenny. What else do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you once you finish your cake.\" Kenny replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, the whole cake, you can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No next course until the whole thing is gone!\" Claire didn't even have a response she just started back in on the cake. It was pretty good she she didn't mind having more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kenny we finished the whole cake. Now you promised us amazing food, what are you hiding in that kitchen?\" Claire tried to stand up from the couch but was met with restraint from Kenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Stay here Claire I'll bring the next dish out. I swear you will love it.\" Claire was starting to get a little annoyed, but still had hope that Kenny would deliver on his promise. Next Kenny brought out meatloaf. Each plate had a heaping pile of it, along with a side of buttery mashed potatoes. Claire was curious as to how meatloaf was supposed to top the cake they just had but I guess it was some pretty damn good meatloaf. Both her and Jen started eating, and this time they were surprised how good it was. Maybe not the best, but not bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating half her plate Claire was ready for something else. \"That was pretty good Jake, maybe your not full of it. What else do you have? There has to be more back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, not until you finish your meatloaf Claire.\" Again Kenny made Claire finish before moving on. When they were both done Kenny and Jake brought out more. By now the girls were getting a bit full. The next course though was more sweets. Each girl was given a plate of brownies, cookies, tarts, and chocolates among other thing. Sweets being their favorite they dug right in. The plates were towered high but they ate each morsel one by one. As the plates neared completion their belly were really starting to feel full. Their dresses were noticeably tighter, but it didn't stop them from continuing on. The boys looked on with lustful eyes as each girl put away the pile of treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finished they were forced to lean back and rub their full bellies. Kenny and Jake watched as the two girl digested the large meals with pleasure. \"Pretty good spread Kenny but I don't think it lives up to the hype you gave it.\" Claire finally spit out after allowing her mouth to rest for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? That wasn't the best food you had ever eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as good as what Jumpin' Jacks brings to the table.\" Jen added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess I'll just have to keep trying to convince you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free tomorrow if you want to convince me then.\" Claire said she chuckled sending a small ripple through her fleshy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this isn't over, I think it's time you came into the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenny I'm not sure I can handle any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. After the appitiser you had at school and this little snack you must still have plenty of room in that big fat belly of your.\" Kenny was getting worked up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where do you get off calling me fat? The only reason we came here is because you said the food was to die for and it isn't. No amount of it is going to change our mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny tired to lay the charm on \"Aww come on Claire. Just come into the kitchen and you will see. One bite of what's in there and your whole opinion of this night will have changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll give you one more chance, but only because you are cute. But could you bring it in here, I don't think I can get up right now, this dress is a little restrictive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to but you girls really need to come into the kitchen to try it. Here I'll help you up.\" Kenny reached out and grabbed Claire by her puffy hands and Jake did the same for Jen. The two girls waddled quite slowly followed by the boys towards the kitchen. As they pushed past the double doors they realized the extent that Kenny was going through to feed them. There was food everywhere. On every surface there was a plate of something or a tray of something else, and Kenny's kitchen wasn't small, it was quite large. \"Well what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of food. Quite the party that got caned huh?\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Party? Oh yea. Well what ever you want it's your. I'm sure after you have everything you will be in love with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenny, we are so full. I thought we were just coming in here for a small bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's all this is. I know you girls can handle it.\" Kenny handed Claire a clean fork and sent her off. Claire and Jen started eating but wanted dearly to leave. Kenny and Jake were starting to be weird. \"Here sit in this comfy chair.\" Kenny sat her down in a lounge chair in the middle of the kitchen that had a tray table attached. \"Get off those feet of yours, let me serve you.\" Kenny started bringing plates over to her and Claire felt obligated to eat them. The more he brought the faster she ate. She just wanted it to all be over. If that meant eating this feast, then that's what she was going to do. But quickly Claire and Jen hit capacity and were unable to each more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenny stop. This is too much. I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be. Look at all the food that's left. Isn't there more room in that big belly of your?\" Kenny grabbed Claire's defensless belly and gave it a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kenny. We are full. If I eat another bite I'm going to burst out of this dress.\" Jen said as she came to Claire's defence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to see that!\" Jake said \"Here have another slice of cheesecake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No get that away from me!\" Jen said as she pushed the cheesecake away while trying to stand up. \"Come on Claire we are out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you two going? You can't leave yet.\" Kenny pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything Kenny, but we have had enough.\" Claire said as she followed in her friends foot steps. Claire rose from the chair taking a second to gain her composure. Wiping the crumbs off her pretty prom dress, that was almost ripping at the seams, she made her way towards the front of the house.</span></div></div>",

Let go of me!\" Claire used her massive weight to pull back but Kenny held on. The two started to pull back and forth. When Kenny would yank, Claire would yank back. Claire's body shook violently and the two of them struggled. When it seemed that Kenny was starting to lose the battle, they were both pulling as hard as they could, out of know where a loud rip was heard coming from Claire's dress. Claire's dress had completely rip down one side and fallen off leaving her bulging pink flesh only covered by her bra and panties. She quickly scooped up the dress and used the rag to cover herself. Kenny had long since let go of his grip on her. \"Kenny! Look what you have done! Leave us alone!\" As the two of them started out the door Kenny said one last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going to go? You didn't drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned back around with a face mad as can be \"Can you please give us a ride back to the high school?\" Claire said as she gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, but do you really want to go back only covered by shreds of dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but what choice do I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here a minute and let me see if my mom has anything you can borrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but then we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just follow me upstairs.\" Claire followed Kenny upstairs, leaving Jen and Jake down in the hallway. Her whole body was free to jiggle and wobble as she walked. Kenny must have been kicking himself for going up the stairs first, he got to miss a great site. He lead her into his parents bedroom where she sat on the bed as Kenny rummaged through his parents closet. \"So you and Jen are pretty good friend huh?\" Kenny tried to spark a little conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we hang out like everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be nice to have someone like her to share good times with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It truly is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your cup size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm trying to find clothes that fit you, it would be helpful to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bra fits just fine and it's also none of your business, just find what ever is largest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least tell me your measurements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Measurements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know 36-24-36? Bust, waist, hips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Don't you want clothes that fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all I don't even know them, secondly I'm not going to tell you if I did. A woman keeps her secrets safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know your measurements? What kind of woman are you? I thought you all needed to know so you can buy proper clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mom buys all my clothes, I don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is the best I have.\" Kenny said as her appeared out of the closet holding a tee and a pair of pants. The clothes were so small Jen wouln't be able to wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mom isn't very fat is she...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are actually her old fat pants. I guess they are a little too small for you huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we do this. I'll wrap this old sheet around you and I can pin it in the back. It will be like a long flowing dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go back to school dressed in a sheet. Everyone will see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't want to but just lay low here for a few hours and then I will drive you back. No one will be the wiser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pondered the offer for a minute, and decided there was no better solution. Without Kenny's help she would have been walking back to the school in her underwear. \"Fine. Well let's go downstairs and tell Jen. I'm sure she is worried about what's going on.\" Kenny fits Claire with the sheet toga and the two of them head downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Kenny and Claire started to search for them but quickly heard giggles coming from down one hallway. As they approached the door they noticed a quickly drawn up 'Do Not Disturb' sign hanging from the door. There were more giggles that were obviously Jen's. As Claire went to go open the door Kenny stopped her. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking up on my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure she is just fine. Let's leave them be, we are not leaving this second anyways.\" Kenny lead Claire back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do to pass the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shot him a menacing look. \"Don't get started bub. Food is what put you in the dog house. Why don't we just watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll put one on in the living room.\" Claire and Kenny took up spots in the living room. Claire made sure to sit a bit back from Kenny a bit, didn't want to give him any ideas. The movie played and all was well until Kenny got a message on his phone. \"I'll be right back.\" He said as to quickly left the room and went into the kitchen. I moment or so later he reemerged and looked to be holding a tray of some sort. Claire couldn't see because Kenny's back was to her. Kenny took the tray down the hall where Jen and Jake were, and then returned a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived back Claire asked \"What was that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just a special delivery. Where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Claire thought this guy had an obsession about her eating she was starting to get kind of hungry. \"Well I was hoping to have a little snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny's eyes lit up \"But of course, why don't we go into the kitchen and grab something.\" Kenny again helped Claire up, the seats were just so deep once you sat in them. They once again found them selves in Kenny's kitchen, surrounded by food. Claire went and set in the chair she had before and allowed Kenny to serve her a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire ate Kenny warmed up another. \"What else would you like my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one!\" Claire said as she pointed across the room. Kenny complied and started heating up and serving any dish she wanted. Claire chewed and chewed and finished plate after plate. The big girl had made substantial room in her gut after a bit of resting and was looking to eat a whole lot. Claire kept pointing out plates and Kenny loaded them on her tray. After a while he was just grabbing what ever was left because the plates had become so few. Even after getting so cleaned up she was making a total mess of herself. Kenny looked on in wonderment. Sadly she wasn't wearing the same skin tight dress as before, which Kenny could see every bulge that existed, but he had wrapped her sheet dress tight enough to see some definition on her. Claire was totally in her natural eating frenzy. Maybe it was the newfound freedom her belly had? Maybe it was the fact that Jen wasn't around and Jake wasn't watching? Or maybe it was the fact that our tubby teen was just down right hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire finished off plate after plate until there were no more plates to be had. \"I was wrong about you Kenny. Your parents cooking is good. I could eat like this any day of the week.\" Claire licked her lips and brushed a few crumbs off the sheet where her boobs had caught some. She proceeded to rub her massive belly as she usually did after such a big meal. \"This is how a girl is supposed to eat. Nothing beats feeling full after a hearty meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a seven layer chocolate trifle?\" Kenny made a delicious trifle appear before her very eyes. It was layered with cake and pudding and heavy creme and looked to die for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire snatched it out of Kenny's hand \"Ooo, tasty.\" and started to dig in with a large spoon. Now this desert look like the size you would bring to a family outing and share with all the relatives along side an apple pie, not something you keep to your self and eat the whole thing. Now I'm sure Claire wouldn't turn down a whole apple pie as a precursor to this trifle, but right now she was going to town on this bad boy. Large spoon fulls of cake and pudding topped with creme and what ever other secret ingredients were in there ladled one after another into Claire's wanting mouth. She kept sticking her spoon in until it finally hit glass. The whole thing was now in her belly, well except for the bits that got smeared on her face and the gloops that fell on her chest and slipped under the sheet into her cleavage. \"Boy was that good. Please tell me you have another!\" Even after all that eating and a giant trifle Claire wanted more. Her capacity and hunger were off the charts. She had just eaten a weeks worth of food and still wanted more. Sadly there were no more trifle's to be had. Upon hearing the bad news she started to lick the glass container from which it came to get any last bits possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire sat there stuffed, Kenny was at her side in utter amazement at what just happened. Never in his wildest dreams did he think this possible. Claire was the living manifestation of all of his fantasies. He didn't want to overstep his bounds, but now that she was full up he wanted to have a little fun with her. Nervous to make a move, he was interpreted by the kitchen door opening.</span></div></div>",

Jen was wearing a sheet toga now just like Claire was. Both parties stared at one another. Jen and Jake look at Claire as she was now covered with crumbs and had chocolate covering her mouth. Claire and Kenny stared at Jen as she had changed out of her dress into something more breathable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen broke the silence. \"Looks like you two have been busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just grabbing a snack for the movie we were watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a snack huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have gotten a little carried away. But Kenny gave me this trifle that was to die for. I sorta ate it all so there is none for you, sorry. Looks like we arn't the only ones who have been busy. What have you two been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\" Jen said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we all retire to the living room and finish the movie.\" Kenny recommended. The two large girls slowly made their way back to the living room, and started watching the movie. Of course the movie watching experience wouldn't be complete without a little more snacking. A few minutes after the movie was back on Kenny and Jake snuck off and each came back holding another trifle. \"Looks like we found seconds!\" Kenny exalted. Claire's eyes lit up at the site of the large glass bowl. Each girl was given one and they both immediately went to down eating them. Jen became as infatuated with the confection as Claire was. Soon enough they were scraping the bottom of their glass bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, and after being fed so well the girls were getting tired. By the time the movie had ended Claire and Jen had passed out on the couch where they sat. Kenny and Jake covered them both with blankets and retired them selves. The next morning the girls woke up in a fog. Kenny drove them back to their car at the school and they went home from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last night?\" Jen asked Claire as they drove away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember. The last thing I remember was running out of food at the prom and those two boys offered to bring us to more. I don't know how we ended up in these togas though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So weird. I feel oddly satisfied though. Like I had a great meal.\" Jen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I guess it's just another peg in the story of our lives now. Well I'm hungry for breakfast, what about you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time had passed after the prom and summer break was approaching. It was the day before Summer break and Claire was in her room alone. She was snacking of course, but also texting Jen. Claire was planning a day of eating to kick off summer and Jen was salivating at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen you need to come over first thing in the morning. My parents are making this spread for us. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmg I\u2019m so there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be wearing the new pants I just bought; the ones will all the extra room. You should wear yours too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m going to need to.\u201d Jen replied while looking at the pile in the corner of her room that contained all the pants she had out grown over the past year. Being a bottom heavy girl pants had become a struggle for Jen as she grew into her newly formed curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long back and forth the girls called it quits for the night. Claire tossed back the last snack cake in the box that she had been munching on this whole time.  She was very eager for tomorrow and the rest of the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Claire woke up early with anticipation. She showered and what not, then donned her newest pair of loose fitting pants. She put on a top to cover her round midsection and large chest and then made her way down stairs. A breakfast feast had been cooked and her parents were placing the last few dishes on the table.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s our lovely girl.\u201d Her mother cooed as Claire made her way into the kitchen and sat in the extra sturdy chair her parents had procured for her when she started to outgrow their normal ones.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou guys have out done your selves.\u201d Claire noted<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI can take some of it to work with me if it\u2019s too much.\u201d Her father joked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDaddy, why would you do such a thing?\u201d Claire played along.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClaire\u2019s father ended up leaving for work soon thereafter and her mother retired to the study. This is when Jen arrived and knocked at the front door. Claire heaved herself up while finishing what was left of her donut.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe moment Claire opened the door Jen came lumbering in and put her arms around Claire. Jen was sobbing and muttering words that Claire couldn't understand. All she could do was hug her friend back. Their soft bodies held in an embrace for over a minute. Claire\u2019s large form, mainly her massive gut, stopped Jen from being able to reach all the way around Claire not matter how hard she tried. Also their titanic chests were squished together forcing both pairs of boobs to find room where ever possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter about a minute Jen let go of her grasp on Claire. \u201cWow, something wrong Jen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents are making me go to fat camp for the entire summer.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d But you\u2019re not even fat, I would know I\u2019m twice the size you are. 165lbs is average for girls our age, this is ridiculous.\u201d Jen, as we know, was actually pushing 250+ at this point, but was in denial about how fat she had actually gotten. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThey say I have been getting gigantic and this is how they are going to put a stop to it. I don\u2019t want to go, it\u2019s going to be all salads and working out, my two least favorite things.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be as bad as you think. I\u2019m going to miss you all summer though. I was so excited to spend all this time with you. When are you leaving?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow\u201d Jen said through the tears.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell at least we can enjoy today. Look at this spread my parents put out! Let\u2019s start before it gets cold.\u201d Jen was reluctant to eat, still very in the dumps about her predicament.  Claire wasn't eating with her normal gusto since her friend was only nibbling at her food.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nClaire wanted to cheer her friend up and get her mind off this fat camp business. \u201cHere Jen try these fried eggs, they are to die for.\u201d Claire plopped some eggs on her friend\u2019s plate and Jen tried a bite. \u201cGood right? Here have some hash browns to go with that, it really brings it all together.\u201d Claire added a heaping of hash browns to the plate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWow those are good. Can I have more?\u201d Jen said as her tears started to dry up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Claire piled more on Jen\u2019s plate, and Jen started to eat it all. Jen\u2019s tears cleared up and she started to eat at an increased pace. Claire had a smile on her face now and picked up her pace too.  Donuts, danishes, eggs, sausages, pancakes, cakes, waffles, potatoes and much more went plate for plate. The girls ate until they were stuffed. They leaned back in their chairs while the table lay as a wasteland of empty dishes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTheir full bellies were extended in front of them. Claire\u2019s was so large her shirt could only cover half of it, and it would have loved to ride all the way up to her chest if Claire had allowed it.  Jen on the other hand was in a similar predicament. Her belly was so full it was testing the strength of her new pants. The pants were already tight from having to house her plentiful rear but now her stomach was so full it was adding pressure to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took a rest in the living room, but soon Jen's mind wondered back to fat camp. Claire wipped out her secret weapon, more food. \"Here Jen have some brownies.\" Claire said as she practially shoved it in Jen's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire I'm actually pretty full from that breakfast.\" Jen said as she swallowed the brownie chuck that was forced on her. As she let the brownie settle in her stomach her mind started to change. \"But on second though, those are pretty good. Give them here.\" Claire gave Jen the whole batch of brownies and Jen started to eat them one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on Claire kept Jen completely full. When ever Jen started to think about fat camp Claire was lightning quick to feed her something. After a few hours Jen had almost completely forgotten about fat camp, and was stuffed to the gills. She was laid out on the couch, stomach high in the air full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire I'm going to miss this.\" Jen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want more cinnamon buns?\" Claire reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but really though, I have to leave tomorrow, and when I get back I'm going to be skinny and probably miserable. My eating days are over. My parents aren't going to let me ruin all the hard work from summer when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sat there thinking about the reality of the situation. Her best friend and eating companion was going away. So much joy in eating came from sharing that experience with a friend. Claire wasn't going to give up or anything, but she was losing something near and dear to her. Claire thought about the past two years. Two years ago Jen was a skinny twig with big boobs, not even 120 lbs. In two years she had over doubled in size and was now this chubby teen that laid before her. She had even larger boobs now but also a thicker torso to hold them up. Her love handles and pudgy belly told most of the story, but the rest could be seen from below the waist. Her large booty and thick legs were much bigger than two years ago. Jen had gone from a twig to a curvy BBW in these past two years. She had found a passion on eating, and loved everything about it (well maybe not the fat part, but it was a natural side effect that she could tolerate.) All of that was being taken away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as what has happened to Claire was obvious. Claire had tripled in size and was now the largest girl in school. Her eating may have started as a means to do her family proud, but Claire ended up falling in love with food and eating. She now sported a large belly and hefty rack. Before she used to be so flat. Eating had become main stay in Claire's life. She was always looking to the next meal or treat she would put in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Jen joined the picture and really started to put it away like Claire was, the changes in the girls was quite noticeable. Their freshman year Claire only gained 30 lbs. Sophomore year when Claire started trying to gain she packed on 40 pound in the school year alone and another 50 over summer. This is when Jen started to gain too. During sophomore year eating out with Claire added 20 pounds to her frame, helping her add some curves to her body. But over that summer another 30 pound gain happened as Jen started to eat more. Going into Junior year the girls really threw caution to the wind and enjoyed all the eating they could no matter what the consequences. Their first semester Claire gained 50 lbs and Jen 30. Leading up to junior prom Claire had topped out at an additional 30 lbs putting her at 330+ and Jen was catching up to Claire with a 40 lb gain bringing her to 250+ lbs by the end of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's waist really benefited from the added support that Jen brought to the table. 130 lb gain just from summer and junior year alone. Claire didn't know what the future held, but was nervous about this change. She loved eating but  loved having Jen around to share in the enjoyment. Having her parents wait on her and leaving her to eat alone wasn't the same. All she could hope for was that Jen would at least still hangout with her and encourage her eating habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still hang out though right?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can't eat, your going to have to eat double for me. We are going to feed you so well that you are going to blow your cousin out of the water with how much you weigh.\" The girls giggled<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well you're not on any diet right now. Let's enjoy this last day of feasting together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\" After that the girls ate to their hearts content. Later on Claire's father got home and cooked them both a delicious dinner. The rest of the night was dedicated to sweets. Pies, ice cream, cake, candy, baked goods, cookies, and anything else that looked good was demolished by the pair of fat teens. By the end of the day Jen's pants had burst at the waist, and Claire's shirt had become a bra. The two girls were so large and stuffed they couldn't move. Eventually Jen had to go home. They gave each other the best hug they could, and Jen departed. The summer wasn't the same without her, but it ended up being anything but boring. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They ordered from the same place they always did and within 30 minutes the pizza was delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire do you mind getting that? My hands are full.\" Her dad shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" She shouted back. Claire's laziness usually kept her from answering the door during deliveries, but dire times call for dire measures. She waddled over to the door, salivating at the thought of the pizza. She had convinced her dad to order the same amount he normally would when Jen was coming over but of course she wasn't. She was going to chomp down on pizza all night. She opened the door and then her jaw almost hit the floor. Standing there holding the large pizza order was her old flame Steve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve on the other hand almost toppled the pizza's when he saw large lady Claire standing inside. \"C-Claire?\" Steve stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Steve. It's you. You're a pizza delivery boy?\" Steve wanted to be quick on his toes. He had already blown Claire off twice and didn't want to come off as an ass, even though he had no interest in Claire, especially now she had some how gotten even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this is the job I was telling you about. It keeps me so busy. I've been meaning to call, but I just never get a night off.\" Steve looked like he could not get any more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry hun, I know how things get busy.\" Claire still thought Steve had it hot for her, so saw no reason not to be flirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I gotta run, more deliveries.\" Steve was trying to find an exit asap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you can't stay for a minute? I'm even resisting the urge to dive into these pizzas right now.\" Claire had taken the order from Steve and placed it inside. Now there was nothing between them and Steve could see just how large Claire had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe these pizza's don't stay warm forever.\" Steve said casually. Immediately his hands slapped to his mouth. 'Did I really just say that? Did I really call her babe? What was I thinking.' Steve could see Claire's eyes light up. He started to back away towards his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well I'll see you again soon!\" Claire said as Steve fled the scene back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure thing.\" Could be heard faintly from Steve as he got further and further away. Claire watched Steve has he sped away before closing the door and turning to her pizzas. She forgot how much she had ordered and her smile widened even more as she let the smell of the pizza over take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Claire enjoyed a smorgasbord of pizza, and come the next day she requested pizza again for dinner. Her dad thought it odd that she wanted pizza two nights in a row, Claire was usually begged for more variety than that. He also found it weird that she wanted to answer the door for the pizza delivery boy. She was usually complacent to sit and have it delivered to her in the living room, not having to lift a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week went on every night Claire wanted pizza for dinner. Her folks compiled since they just wanted their little girl eating up every night, but they had their suspicions. After a few days they spied on her while she answered the door for Steve, and caught her making googly eyes and flirting with him. After that night they didn't ever question Claire's decisions again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Steve was having it rough at work. The rest of the crew had found out why they kept getting an order from the same house every night that week, and taunted Steve about it. Steve pleaded with his boss to let someone else deliver that order. \"Steven, they are our very best customer. Ever since that little girl realized you're the delivery boy they have ordered every night. They used to only order once a week. I mean I'm not going to mess with the golden goose, capisci? Just suck it up.\" There wasn't much else Steve could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had started to come on to Steve the more and more she saw him. She started even getting gussied up for him. She'd put on some nice clothes, do her hair and makeup, it was like a mini date every night for her. She was also always finding reasons to keep him there longer. She'd get him into a conversation and keep it going so he wouldn't leave. This went on every night for the whole summer. As the time passed Claire got more courageous with Steve and Steve just got more put off by Claire. Claire would try and grab Steve's hand when he'd hand her the large pile of pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's boss also wanted Claire to keep ordering for as long as possible. He would send steve out with only their order so he would be in no rush to leave. Claire loved having her extra time with Steve once she found out that he had no where else to be. It was an even better excuse to keep him waiting around. Steve's boss would also always send extra food for Claire, but Claire always thought it was Steve sneaking her extra treats. She was always so appreciative. \"Steve is that an extra order of cinnamon bread for me? You are so sweet.\" Claire even got in the habit of eating some of her meal while Steve was still these. Eating was what Claire knew best, so why not share that passion with her new boyfriend. Steve was just disgusted and prayed that his phone would ring with an order from work so he could leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve felt like he could see the pizza blimping her up. The more and more slices she ate the bigger she seemed. Steve couldn't get the image out of his head of Claire eating every last slice of pizza and growing larger everyday. He didn't want to think about how long her pizza binge would go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all lead up to the last week of summer. Claire was expecting Steve to have put the moves on her by now, but he was not taking things as fast as Claire wanted to. Steve always denied Claire's dates since he was always working (at least he had a good excuse) but she thought he could at least take advantage of their mini pizza dates. He had for obvious reasons not perused anything with Claire, but she was not going to let that stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few days before summer and Claire was ready to make her move. She put on her sexiest outfit and waited at the door for Steve's arrival. He arrived at the normal time, carrying her large order. Claire opened the door for him and took all the pizza boxes, setting them aside for now. Steve was super nervous since Claire had obviously got all dressed up for him. He tried to make this his briefest trip yet. \"Thanks Claire, see you tomorrow.\" Steve turned to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Mr. Hunk.\" Steve briefly turned back allowing Claire to put a beefy hand on his shoulder and turn him. Now that she was back face to face with him she moved in close and laid a peck on his lips. Steve obviously didn't kiss back, but Claire kept making the advance kissing him for a second time and moving even closer, even though Steve was backing up as he was getting attacked. Eventually Steve put enough distance between them that Claire broke off the kiss. It all happened within a few seconds but to each of them it felt like minutes. \"Ah, I've been waiting for that all summer.\" Claire said as she donned a large grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh...\" Steve was speechless. All he could do is go back to his car and drive away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where are you going?\" Claire said as he left. \"I was just getting started.\" Steve's car was bounding down the street within seconds. \"Maybe I was too hot and heavy for him?\" She said before turning back to head inside. 'Well he will just be back tomorrow anyways.' She thought as she picked up her pizzas and took them into the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Claire was relaxing in her living room like she pretty much had done all summer. It was about midday when she heard a car pull into the driveway. Her parents were at work but she wasn't expecting them home this early. Suddenly it dawned on her that today was the day that Jen was coming home. Claire heaved herself off the couch leaving the dent that she was used to making, and rushed as fast as her thick legs would take her to the door. Jen rang the bell and Claire was right there to answer. Jen was startled that a big girl like Claire could get to the door so fast. Claire was stunned to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had envisioned what Jen would look like when she got back, but what she got was nothing that she ever pictured. Jen had left as 250lbs, fatter than she had ever been, which wasn't a hard feat since her weight had slowly been climbing for awhile now. Claire could almost not remember how chunky Jen was before, she only had mental image of what she thought she would return like. Claire's picture of the old Jen was one with the perfect hourglass figure, Big perky boobs, slim waist, and curvy ass. Claire was shocked to see the results of what had really happened at fat camp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire!\" Jen squealed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen!\" Claire squealed back \"You're fat!!\" Claire exclaimed. \"But why? What happened to fat camp?\" Jen was indeed still fat. She was all of the 250lbs that she was when she had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went but it didn't turn out like I expected.\" Jen and Claire hugged and made their way inside and sat at the kitchen table next to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me everything.\" Claire demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha well I got dropped off at fat camp. I was miserable all day. There were other fat girls everywhere. Some my size, some your size and some even bigger. I moped around until the grand assembly that evening. They stuffed all girls in this one room and this old lanky man took the podium. He told us that the camp director had passed away under mysterious circumstances. I like to think a fat chick hunted him down and did away with his evil ass, but I digress. So they had to replace the camp director and the guy they got had a very different idea of body image and acceptance. He didn't want to force us to lose weight, so instead of salads the meals were rich and hearty, and instead of waking up early to exercise we got to sleep in and relax for most of the day. They other girls were just as happy as I was. I'm sure the summer would have been better spent with you, but it ended up being way better than I had first pictured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about your parents? They must be so upset that you are still fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are, but after I told them the story and how I really felt about my body they stepped off a bit. I'm sure they still don't agree with my choice, but I don't think they are going to bother me about it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. I for one am so glad you are still fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's remark made Jen giggle a little bit. \"Well I don't think I love being fat as much as you do, but it's a side effect of eating so well so I have to take the good with the bad. And I actually weighed myself because of the whole fat camp thing, and I found out I'm 250lbs. I had no clue how huge I was, I really am a fatty huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got nothing on me Jen, I've got to be close to 350.\" Claire was indeed quite fat. Jen was round but Claire was a blimp. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that Jen had gushed about her summer, it was Claire's turn. She told Jen all about Steve and the pizza delivery, and she topped off the story with yesterday's kiss. \"Wow\" Jen said. Jen knew how Steve really felt, and that he was probably just doing his job and being polite to Claire because he had to, but she wasn't going to shatter the excitement that Claire had in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just you wait, we will order tonight and you can come and say hi with me. I'm sure he won't mind showing me off.\" Jen held her silence, but also came to think, maybe he had changed, maybe Steve was an alright guy after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to hangout as the afternoon rolled on. Soon Claire's family came home and were glad to see Jen. Claire made sure to have her dad order pizza first thing when he got home. After about 30 minutes the pizza had finally arrived. Jen looked over at Claire and saw the biggest smile on her face. She was pretty confident that she had not seen a bigger smile than that before. \"Come on Jen, thats him.\" Jen struggled to get her wide load up but soon they were both waddling over to the door. Claire opened the door ready for Steve to be on the other end. \"Ste...\" She stopped. It was not Steve standing there holding their large order of pizza, but a different delivery boy instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, hi.\" The boy said. Jen got the idea this kid knew what he was getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where is Steve, he always delivers my pizzas.\" She asked the kid like he was supposed to have all the answers for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the thing is\" The kid started to say. \"Yesterday after Steve came back from his delivery he was complaining to the boss that he didn't want to deliver anymore. He refused to keep going. The boss told him that he had too for as long as they kept ordering. Steve told the boss no and that he would quit if he made him go back, and so he quit right then and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was almost in tears. \"Wow\" was all she could muster. The silence was awkward. The boy left the food and left without another word. Jen put a hand on Claire's shoulder and closed the door with the other. \"He quit because of me?\" Claire whimpered. \"All this time I thought he enjoyed coming out to see me. That's why I kept ordering out, but all this time he hated it and only came because he was forced to. And my kiss drove him to quit.\" Claire fell silent for a moment. \"What a freakin jerk.\" A younger Claire might have been more self conscious about the situation, but this Claire had become quite confident in her body, and wasn't going to let a stupid pizza delivery boy crush her heart and soul. \"What a giant ass! And I'm not talking about mine. To lead me on like that. Well who needs him. We've got pizza, and great company, and that's all I need sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was glad to see Claire taking the news so well. Claire had really grown over the past few years, and not just in her waist line. Claire had one year left of her high school career, and before her family challenge would come to an end, and there was much more in store for her.</span></div></div>",

When she was a little small freshman she didn't know anything about this family tradition she was part of, she was just worried about what outfit to wear and how to talk to boys. Even as she became a sophomore she was oblivious to the changes happening to her, she thought she was just growing up into a woman, but she was very unaware what kind of woman she was supposed to become. Then as she became a junior she started to get an understanding about what getting fat meant, but Claire really never knew why all this was happening. Up until now she had just been getting fat to win, but she didn't know anything beyond that. Now that she was a 350lb senior it was time to learn more about what her future held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a day as normal as any, it was after school, and Claire's curiosity was getting to her. She wanted to know what was going to happen when this year ended. She wanted to know what happened when she won. Or what happened if she didn't win. Lucky for her, mom and dad were getting anxious to bring Claire in on the next steps. They had waited as long as they could but time was fleeting and tonight was a good as any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sat in the kitchen, which wasn't her usual spot, normally somewhere like the living room couch or her bedroom. But she thought the kitchen would be a good place to corner her parents. Her mom and dad came and then she decided to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, I have a few questions for you.\"</span></div></div>",

Two years ago her parents approached her and told her if by the time she graduated if she was fatter than her cousin Diane, then she would be the pride of the family, but what did that mean? \"I mean you told me that if I got fat and weighed more than Diane by the end of high school I would not only be a woman, but the reigning family member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right we want you to be our family queen.\" Her mother chimed in. \"Becoming a voluptuous attractive woman is only the start when it comes to this family tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, what does that mean? What happens once I graduate?\" Claire wanted her mom to stop dancing around these hoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see it is not just our family that is involved, it's a whole network of families with a similar mind set. Because you and your cousin are the only two girls coming of age, you're the only ones in the race for the crown. Also there is a boy, belonging to one of the other families. He is the oldest in his family and will be graduating high school this year too. They are the McShane's. Their boys are raised to adore larger voluptuous women such as yourself. Now were are not saying you have to marry this boy, but he will take care of you for the rest of your life. The McShane's are wealthy investment types and help support this foundation we are apart of. They are also incredibly nice people., and you don't have to take my word on it because we are have the final year meet and greet party this Saturday. You and Diane are invited to a party hosted by the McShane's where you will get to mingle with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's head was spinning a bit. She had to go over all the details again in her head to wrap her mind around it. There is a secret organization that hooks up their wealthy sons with plump girls to live happily ever after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait this is how you and dad got together? Hold on!...These guys aren't like my cousins are they!?!\" Claire filled in some of the missing details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not.\" Claire's father reassured her. \"You are of the Hawks and Tilton bloodlines, not the McShane's. Like your mother said there are many family involved in this. Right now the current queen is Alexandria. She has got to be about 27 now. 9 Years ago she beat out her twin sister and another girl for the crown. Now we have been waiting for you and Diane to come of age for someone new to take the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the royalty moniker around all this? Why am I going to be a queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will have certain rights and privileges not awarded to those who lose, and you will also have a say in how this little band of merry families operates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is not what I expected.\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do you feel about all this? A few years ago you were just an average teenage, and now you're on the verge of becoming the queen over a very large enterprise of families, not to mention you have transformed into a very large beautiful woman in the meantime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest I'm surprised that I'm as happy with my size that I am. It took me a long time to appreciate being a large girl, but once things started to get serious there was not turning back. And now look, I'm larger than ever and couldn't be happier. Also I'm a little nervous to meet this McShane boy, I've not had great luck with boys recently.\" Claire said as she thought about what happened with Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we've already arranged to have Jen invited to the party that way you will be a little more comfortable.\" Just hearing that allowed a wave of calm to wash over Claire. Without Jen Claire might not have been able to cope with this whole transformation as well. Although it didn't start out this way at first, Jen had become quite the confidant and best friend for Claire, and was really there to support her throughout her journey, especially right as she was starting to accept who she was. And also Jen had become quite tubby along with Claire, so that helped Claire not feel so much like a hippo around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just going to have to worry about what to do about a dress for the party. We can have your prom dress tailored, or buy a new one.\" Her mom gave her the option. </span></div></div>",

She had hid this fact from her mom all this time. The prom dress had been so nice, and her mother had gone to such lengths to get her a nice dress to fit her bulbous form. The dress was being hidden in the back of her closet underneath some clothes she had out grown awhile ago. She had almost forgotten about it, a whole summer had gone by since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be too much trouble to pick out a new dress mom?\" Claire used he innocent only child like eyes to turn off interest away from the old prom dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all. But we will have to go to the shop soon, it might take us some time to find something in your size.\" Claire and her mother were pleased. Claire's mom felt great that she was finally able to get all that information out in the air. It kind of took a chip off her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and her mom went out to the shops to look for a dress, but had to go through a few before they found any store that carried her size. Not many places kept dresses for 350lbs teens. And even some of the ones that fit were so gaudy, there was no way Claire was going to wear them. Finally they did find a upscale store that carried a line of dresses that would fit Claire. She found one that she loved and had it tailored to her curvaceous form. Claire was going to be the best looking girl at the party in this dress, and thankfully she didn't have to wait long to wear it, you never know how many pounds Claire was going to pack on at a given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home the dress hung very nicely in her closet, where it waited til Sunday for the party. Now in all this Jen wasn't forgotten either. Now that Jen was all the curvier she had a problem with clothes too. Since she wasn't the star attraction her still fitting prom dress wouldn't be proper, but she found some nice formal attire to wear. Now that the gals had their duds, they just had to wait the week out until the big night.</span></div></div>",

Claire's uncle and her rival cousin came around the corner just as they approached the door. This was the first time any of the four had seen Diane in years. They knew she had surly gotten fat, but how fat no one could have predicted. Diane even stood a few inches shorter than Claire which made her emense weight look like even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, if it isn't my younger sister Ashley.\" Claire's uncle Dylan snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan, good to see you.\" Claire's dad reached out a hand and shook one of his brother in laws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is tiny little Claire.\" Dylan went on. \"Hi Claire. Looks like some ones gotten a little chubby. You remember your cousin Diane right? I know you might not recognize her now that she's past 400 pounds, but my little snookums is just the most adorable girl don't you think? How much are you up to Claire? Can't be nearly that much, you don't look much bigger than any other barely chubby teen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire is a generous 350 pounds thank you very much.\" Ashley defended her little girl. \"But let's all be civil and go inside shall we, we have a party to attend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan pushed his way in front of the pack with Diane in hand. The blimping girl just mustered one foot in front of the other as daddy lead her into the house. Diane gave a nasty look back to Claire as she passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire just brushed it off and set her eyes back on the prize. She had to keep her composure in front of this nice wealthy family.</span></div></div>",

My name is Oliver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m the biggest girl around, there\u2019s a whole lot of me to love.\u201d Diane said with quite a cocky attitude. She knew Oliver had no choice in the matter between the two heifers, Diane was the biggest and planned on staying the biggest, and she was going to make sure her real competition, Claire, knew that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you must be Claire. It\u2019s a marvelous pleasure.\u201d He again took her hand giving her a kiss on her supple skin, staring deeply into her eyes, almost stealing her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-m-a My P-pleasure as well.\u201d Claire stammered. He was so good looking Claire was so nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver leaned in and went the extra mile to kiss Claire on the cheek and then whispered in her ear. \u201cI hope you win.\u201d He smiled a big grin as he leaned back to his normal standing position still looking deep into Claire\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s get started!\u201d Mr. McShane said. \u201cIf everyone would adjourn to the dining room.\u201d Everyone shuffled over to the large banquet room off to the left of the main foyer. They all took a seat at the large dining table, in front of elegantly decorated dishes. Claire\u2019s whole party was very impressed by the scene. Large serving trays lined the inside of the table, all with silver lids hiding what a spread lay beneath. Oliver was sitting at the head on the table, with Claire and Diane on each side of him. Claire sat next to her confidant Jen at the table, allowing her to be more comfortable in this new situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone raised a glass as Oliver gave a toast. \u201cThank you everyone for being here, I\u2019m honored to have you in my home, and a special thanks to our very lovely guests Claire and Diane, it\u2019s been an honor to finally meet you, and I\u2019m very excited to get to know you both better. So to tradition, friends, family, and best of all, food.\u201d Oliver gave a quick look to Claire after that last one, flashing her a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s dig in!\u201d Everyone clinked their glasses with their neighbors, and smiles could be seen on everyone's happy faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver lids were removed and the hot steamy dishes underneath were revealed. Tasty looking cooked meats along with steamed veggies in butter sauce piled high on each serving tray. Everyone took their fill and started in on their dinner.<br>\r\n\u201cClaire who is this lovely guest you have with you?\u201d Oliver melted Claire with his dashing jaw line and perfectly sculpted hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to snap out of her trance, before she could answer. \u201cT-this is my best friend Jen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jen it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d Oliver responded. \u201cYou and Claire must be quite close friends.\u201d Jen blushed at the comment from the highly attractive Oliver, even though she knew she didn\u2019t have a horse in this race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Claire and I have become quite close recently, she\u2019s really a spectacular friend. She\u2019s always been there for me.\u201d Jen smiled as she thought about her friendship, it really had been the best thing to happen in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a close friend like that. Diane, do you have any close friends?\u201d Oliver turned his attention to Diane, who had been digging into the feast from the second the food was available. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gulped down a big bite she responded to her hosts question. \u201cNot really. I spend too much time eating to go out much. My friends all really stopped coming over. They said all I wanted to do was eat, and not share with them. Once I was getting close to 300lbs they pretty much stop talking to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that sounds so lonely.\" Oliver said compassionately, even though he was getting the vibe that Diane was kinda cold anyway, and no wonder she drove her friends away. \"Well maybe this nice cousin reunion can reignite the spark between girls, then at least you'd have Claire to hang out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah!\" Diane spit a little food out as she was caught of guard as a chuckle was forced out of her. \"Now way am I sharing my snacking time with a wanna be like her.\" Diane went back in for another bite, filling her mouth before she could go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Oliver, Diane and I have never really been close.\" Claire glanced over in Diane's direction but she had lost all focus in the conversation and just worried about her food. \"My uncle never really made an effort when it came to family functions. Plus Jen here is a great eating partner if you couldn't tell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire!\" Jen turned the brightest shade of red. All the parents were off in their own conversation so it was just Oliver and the girls who heard Claire's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen it's fine, it's just us, nothing to be embarrassed about.\" Claire assured her. \"See Jen used to be miss perfect high school body. But as I began to 'develop' Jen was there helping beside me. Along the way she started to indulge too, and now look at her, still the most good looking girl I know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to agree, but there is one better looking girl right here.\" Oliver was again locking eyes with Claire, keeping her trapped in his gaze. Jen just went about her meal as the two of them just made googly eyes at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner continued. Most everyone just having one plate, Jen had two, but the real faceoff was with Claire and Diane. After Oliver and Claire had unlocked eyes the eating had really begun. Claire noticed she was far too much behind Diane and for pride's sake she wanted to out match her. Both girls had polished off plate three and moves on to four. Claire was feeling some fullness but wanted to soldier on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued Oliver piped in. \"Remember to save room for dessert.\" Claire's resolve was waning, she didn't think she could eat all of this. And there was still dessert to come. With still some food on her plate she threw in the towel, while Diane went on to finish every last bite on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's ego was bruised, even though she knew this little meeting meant nothing in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group retired to the study to let things settle, where they talked more and served coffee and tea. Claire learned that Oliver was going to be graduating college this year with a degree in finance, and was already on the short list to join a very reputable firm here locally. Although he was four years older than Claire he still had a younger look to him, which made her feel better about the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some pleasant conversation dessert was to be served. Everyone had just a little taste, but again it was our two blimping beauties that greedily ate their fill of all the treats. This time Claire and Diane were more evenly match. Claire had time digest a little, so she was able to eat quite a nice portion of the sweets being served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the evening both girls were stuffed and ready for bed. Their families took them home and thanked their hosts for a good time. Oliver gave each girl a kiss on the cheek and wished them good luck in the coming year.</span></div></div>",

Either she would come out victorious, weighing more than her hefty cousin, or she would fall short, leaving her with nothing, but an over fed body and ravenous appetite. Claire much preferred the winning outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the party Claire did everything she could to pack on the pounds. There was no way she was going to lose. Diane already had 50 pounds on her so she had a lot of ground to make up, which wasn't easy at her current size. She ate and ate and ate, but the pounds just were not coming. At the end of September she was only pushing the needle up to 356. 400 was a long ways off and with Diane entering the final stretch Claire could only imagine Diane getting bigger, maybe even hitting 450 or 475.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire thought about her scale, she didn't really visualize what this all meant. Her goal was set at 450-475lbs. At that weight she would be absolutely huge. She was a big girl now, but with another 100+ lbs she would be so much bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over the math with Jen, who seemed to be in her corner, rationalizing that she didn't only need to catch up to Diane, she needed to keep up with her gains and surpass them. If Claire hit her goal though she would be about the size of two Jen's, and Jen was looking pretty wide these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire ate around the clock trying just to add each additional pound to her frame. When jen was around it was more fun and didn't feel as much like work, even though it never really felt like work since she was just stuffing her face with tasty food all the time, usually watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was getting more and more used to her wide body. She was good at figuring out ways to stay fashionable. There were tons of videos online of plus size women and all sorts of style tips. She took some of their advice and added some class to her new BBW lifestyle. She had to modify some of the looks because she was sometimes 50 to 100lbs bigger than some of the girls, but even Jen agreed she looked damn good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Jen got on board helping Claire with her style and using some of the tips for herself. Jen had used to be so fashionable, but after gaining over 100lbs she had found it hard to dress up still. Now she was feeling just as girly as she did back in her thin days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of October Claire had gained a little bit more weight. The scales were reading in the 360 range. This was still not up to snuff for Claire. Doubt was starting to creep in, cracks in the armor of ever so positive Claire were starting to show. At this rate she was barely going to pass 400lbs, a milestone she knew Diane had already passed.</span></div></div>",

Jen found her to top that was just barely enough to make it over her belly. The skirt she wore also was a little too tight. Jen gave Claire's a few compliments to make her feel good even though she outfit was too tight and her fat rolls were not looking to attractive. As Jen had promised both girls went to the mall, and as always food was the only thing on Claire's mind. They stopped for donuts on the way and then parked right in front of the food court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Claire keep an eye out for guys checking you out. They are going to be too nervous to talk to you, but just watch for the stares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stares are what she got. As Claire bounced about the mall in her super tight outfit people looked on in disgust. At first it was in the food court as she pounded back a few burgers, then after her belly was full her shirt started to ride up as she walked around the rest of the mall. After a large pretzel and some ice cream later Claire was quite the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was noticing all the looks she got and was loving all the attention. Off course she thought it was all positive attention for her good looks but it was the complete opposite. As they were about to leave the mall Claire started gushing to Jen about how good she was feeling. \"I think its the outfit. Its so reveling and sexy, that must be what all the guys want.\" Jen had to hold back a laugh due to Claire's tight outrfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless Claire had her confidence back and loved going back to the mall. When ever she went out with Jen she would wear a tight revealing outfit. A small tank top that showed off her boobs and belly, shirts or shorts that were way to short or tight. Every bulge was visible either through fabric or lack there of. Even as Claire got bigger she stilled loved the attention. She had ballooned up 250 lbs with all the extra eating her self esteem allowed her. Jen was happy that her friend was busy plumping up all according to her plan. Claire was happy that she was eating what ever she desired and was as sexy as ever. </span></div></div>",

She put on a sexy little number before hopping in her car and heading over to Claire's house. Jen made her way up to Claire's room to gather her to go out. Claire was scarfing down some sweets when Jen made her presence known to Claire. Claire was barely dressed and not even close to being ready to leave. \"Gosh is it 7 o'clock already?\" Claire asked as she wiped creme filling from the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is Claire, and you told me you would be ready by now.\" Jen was a little annoyed. Claire had one train of thought and that was food. Jen bet that Claire had been pigging out since she got home from school that day and had made almost no attempt to be ready to leave. And Jen would be right. Claire had certainly been pigging out on all the treats that her parents had gotten for her. Ice cream, snack cakes, cookies, brownies, all of it was a delicious way for Claire to spend her afternoon. Jen didn't care about any of that, she wanted to hit the mall so all the boys would flock to her and shower her with affection. \"Come on Claire it's time to go.\" Claire was still very instrumental in Jen's plans, she needed her tubby friend around to make her look better. The plan was going ever so smoothly, mostly because Claire thought she looked like a bomb shell regardless of the fact that everyone at the mall actively avoided the large teen. As people looked on in shame, she just felt even better about her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire slapped on a small tee that barely met her pant line and a pair of jeans that hugged her every fold on her legs. As Jen looked on at the bulging girl before her, she thought about how her own chances of getting what she wanted tonight were ever so greater. The guys would be so repulsed by Claire that they would have to chose Jen instead. \"Jen don't I look so good in these tight clothes?\" Jen constantly held in her inner thoughts about how she really felt about Claire, but in reality she just wanted to burst out laughing and the porker that stood before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do darling. Now lets go.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire's love affair with food grew by the day, and everybody in her life only encouraged her to eat more. Her parents always had fattening treats for her to snack on, and Jen was also pushing her to eat more when they were out. Her weight skyrocketed as her appetite grew larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrips to the mall became laborious adventures for the two teens. First Jen would pick Claire up, they'd stop by the donut shop next to Claire's house. They pick up some drive thru fast food half way, then once at the mall Claire got tray after tray, usually purchased by Jen so her fat friend would continue eating. Then they would hit the convenience store at the mall exit for some candy bars and treats for the drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this resulted in a very large Claire. Until one day when Jen went to pick Claire up. Jen was carrying a few fast food burgers to get her bestie excited and moving. She busrt into Claire's room where the humungous teen was just finishing the last bite of something undoubtedly sinful. Claire was lounging in her new recliner, something her parents got for her room when she started having trouble getting out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sat there, her belly on full display. She didn't try and hide the massive thing, it was typically to hard to cover up. Her now large belly filled her lap, laying atop her thick legs that filled the seat of the recliner. Her hips and ass pushed the arms rests almost to their breaking point. Claire was getting so big she almost needed her own love seat. But she couldn't barely see any of it past her zeplin like tits. The big breasts blocked her view as the stretched out in front of her supported by her very sizeable bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I brought you before our little mall trip.\" Jen teased and she handed the porker her burgers. They were gone in moments flat and Jen helped Claire to her feet. Now it was the struggle to get the wide girl to the car. First she got stuck in the door. Jen had to squeeze her ass as hard as she could to her her fat hips through the door. And then came the agonizing stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna go.\" Claire pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you some milkshakes on the way, ok?\" Claire took a step, then before taking another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its just so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some taco bell too?\" Another step was achieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know if I can make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can get Dairy Queen blizzards after that too.\" And so on it went before Claire finally made it to the ground floor where her parents were waiting with a smattering of treats for their hungry daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Claire why don't you have some sticky buns before you go.\" Claire gladly accepted the treat. \"And of course you need some soda to wash tbag down with. And how about some cookies for the road.\" Claire had 4-5 snacks before Jen was able to get her out to the car. Now her shirt was really riding up, allowing her belly to really be on display. The jiggly mass truly showed off how fat she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for Jen to squeeze Claire into her car, the round girl just barely fit. Claire's dad even had to come out and help. Finally they were on their way, but first Jen had to stop at all the places she promised Claire. At each one Jen ordered a family size amount of food for Claire and it had pretty much all disappeared by the time they made their next stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was quite bulging by the time they finally got to the mall. Jen found a spot close to the front, it wasn't too hard because it had gotten so late. Jen zipped around the car to help Claire out since she was useless on her own. Her massive belly filled up the entirety of the passenger side of the cabin. I don't think she could even see out the windshield because her breasts were so puffed up they blocked her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen tried to help Claire maneuve her large chubby leg out of the car but she quickly realized how useless the task. Her massive belly had pinned her legs inside the cabin. She tried lifting the rolls of belly fat to get some freedom but it was so heavy she couldn't do the whole operation herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Claire started to get distressed. \"Can we just go home?\" She whined. After probably 20 minutes of struggling Jen looked at the mall. It was probably 15 minuets before closing time by this point. People were leaving the grounds faster and faster and the only action she was getting was from people watching her try to get Claire out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen gave up and started to drive home. \"Could we maybe get some McDonald's? I'm starving.\"</span></div></div>",

As her size became more of an issue Claire was becoming less and less active. She didn't want to take the effort to try and squeeze out of her room or into someone car. She's rather just eat. And having Jen's companionship helped Claire stay happy and not alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being able to trot Claire around the mall, Jen still went to visit Claire almost every night of the week. There was something habitual about hanging out with Claire and fattening her up that Jen couldn't shake off. Claire's parents welcomed the support, Jen spent a good chuck of her nights over running food up to Claire's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had just upgraded from a recliner in her bedroom to a love-seat, since she had started to outgrow the former. Now with all the extra room her extra wide rolls had a place to ooze out to. Claire still tried to dress to impress and thought very highly of her body, always fishing for complement from Jen. \"Jen, I bet the boys miss seeing this hot piece of ass at the mall, don't you think? I mean the way my rack has grown would just drive them wild, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet.\" Jen had little extra to say looking at her titanic best friend. It had been so easy to lie, but Jen was having a hard time keeping up the facade for so long, especially now that Claire was even wider, so wide she had a hard time leaving her room. But it didn't stop her from stuffing Claire full of fattening food. Tray's of lasagna, bags of take out, towers of pizza. Every night was an eating frenzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had long abandoned school, so she spent her days feasting on breakfast foods delivered by her parents, and then tons of snacks until Jen could come over after school and help her pig out on dinner and dessert for the rest of the night. </span></div></div>",

After getting Claire in, they were off for their week of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, and having polished off every crumb in the car, Claire arrived at what looked like a swanky retreat, but what she didn't know was that this place was fat farm, designed to plump of their female guests. And this week was bbw retreat week, where there would be boys, food, and fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls parked out front and made their way into the check-in desk. At the desk stood a portly girl, not quite the size of Claire, but a big girl for sure. Jen took charge and stepped right on up. \"Hi miss Claire here has a reservation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes we've been expecting you. So glad you could be here with us Claire.\" The girl beamed at our rotund protagonist. Claire just smiled back while Jen and the counter girl, Nikki, hashed out their details. \"Here's a pamphlet of activities, and you two are right around the corner, not a far walk at all.\" With that the started to roll their bags towards the main hallway and towards their room. Claire didn't notice really anyone when they first walked in, but now she was taking in her surroundings. She noticed a couple had walked in after them and was waiting for them to finish checking in so they could do so themselves. The woman was quite large, and wearing quite high end clothes, and the man she was with looked tall and slender next to his large wife. He also looked dressed very sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was starting to have curious thoughts, but that was only until they got to their room and Claire saw what was inside. It was unlike any hotel room she had seen before. First off it was much more luxurious than she had ever been in, and also the place was loaded with food. \"Wow this is like a Claire paradise. How'd you get them to stock this place up so well?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about that, just let that appetite of yours run wild, this is vacation after all!\" Claire also started to notice all the little things in the room. There was one regular bed, and another piece of furniture that looked like a bed and a couch. There was also all sorts of equipment hooked up to the walls, nobs, tubes. Claire wasn't quite she what that was all about but she made herself home quite fast and started in on some of the snacks that had been provided for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Jen recommended they order some room service. She picked up the tablet from the night stand and showed Claire all her options. They started rapidly adding items to their cart, and shortly there after a trolley had arrived at the door bursting with meals. Racks of juicy ribs, heaps of mashed potatoes, thick burgers dripping with grease. Claire dug right in, eating every last morsel. </span></div></div>",

Jen marveled at the size of her best friend, she had really gotten huge since she had started to fatten up, and Jen was determined to make her even bigger while they were here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sauntered towards the banquest hall, Jen leading the way, Jen gushed over her excitement for their little stay here. \"Claire, I'm so excited about this, you are going to love it. They literally have a buffet of every food you could think of. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner at all hours of the day, and they are open all night too. They have Italian food, Chinese, Mexican, you name it, they have it.\" Claire's mouth started to water at the food picture Jen was painting her. It was only a little bit further, and Claire did her best to waddle as fast as she could to keep up with Jen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they had arrived and Jen opened the big doors revealing the spectacle that awaited them inside. The place was bursting with people, people walking, people eating, people ordering, it was a mad house, but some how there seemed to be harmony. Jen grabbed Claire a tray and lead her to the closest line. She started grabbing treats for her friend, slices of pizza, slabs of meatloaf, heaps of tasty looking noodles. After a brief few moments Claire's tray was full and they were headed for a table. There was an open one near by and Claire plopped down her tray, as well as her booty. The chairs were very accommodating, something Claire was not very used to. She was used to the crappy mall chairs, that seemed to be getting smaller over time. This chair seemed firm, and very spacious. But Claire wasn't there to notice the chairs, she was there to fill her tummy. She went right to work digging into her plate. In the mean time Jen went to go fetch a drink, and she came back holding a pitcher of soda and no glass. Claire grabbed the pitcher and started to guzzle straight from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire's plate neared empty, Jen arrived with one of equal size to replace it, and this time had two pitchers of soda. Claire ate like there was no tomorrow. Tacos, fried chicken, beef lo mien, she ate it all up. After an hour of pigging out, Claire had filled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen this place is awesome, I can't wait for dinner!\" Claire exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get you back to the room, you look like you could use a nap.\" Claire agreed and let Jen help her up. Claire waddled back to the room, collapsing on the larger of the two beds. Jen flipped on the giant TV and grabbed Claire a few snacks. It wasn't long before she was passed out, sleeping gracefully.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few hours Claire awoke, rising from the same cushiony bed she had fallen asleep on. She felt very well rested and very hungry after having digested all the food from lunch. \"Rise and shine sleepy head.\" Jen called out to her plush friend as she rubbed her eyes with her chunky hands. \"I bet you are hungry after that long nap, here I just whipped up a large milk shake.\" Jen handed her eager friend and massive milkshake that Claire just put up to her lips and let the creamy sugary liquid slide between her lips and into her awaiting belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had polished that off she wiped her lips and started to look around for her next edible conquest. \"You know what would probably go good after that milkshake? Cookies! Hot and fresh, I just had them delivered.\" Jen presented Claire with a big tub of cookies, covered with gooey chocolate chips. \"You think that will hold you over until we can get back down to the banquet hall for some dinner?\" Claire nodded as her mouth was already full with two large cookies. Jen helped Claire and her wide ass up and lead her out of the room and on their way to dinner. Claire continued to eat cookies as she waddled down the hall towards her impending feast. By the time she was back at the large double wide doors she had finished her cookies, and was ravenous for more. Jen lead her back into the food filled domain where she was able to load up her plate with any cuisine she desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire conquered plate after plate of tasty food, going full pelt for almost two hours. When Jen wasn't running for more food she just marveled at her friends size and appetite. Claire was quickly expanding in the street clothes she had arrived to the resort in. Her baby blue tee was stretched to the max by her bluberous belly. The cloth stretched tight over her budding bulging bosom, nicely outlining her two giant melons. Constricted around her thick massive legs were some of the tightest leggings. The impressively stretchy material tried its best to cover all of the expanded girl. As Claire ate the hem of her shirt and pants continued to grow apart, like young lovers recently broken up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of dining, Jen started to break out the desserts. Claire found a new breed of gusto now that sugar was involved. Creme puffs, pies, cake, cookies, brownies, ice cream. All of it Claire ate by the tray full. By the end of another hour Claire had eaten herself into a stupor. She couldn't dare eat another bite. Jen sat there proud of her friends first day here. She was nervous Claire would reject this wondrous place, but it looked like things were going well. Hopefully Claire wouldn't freak out as things got a little bit more interesting as their time went on here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen gave her full friend a few minutes to rest before assisting her back to the room. Claire just wanted to lounge, so she hunkered back down on her bed and flipped the tv back on. Surrounded by snacks she was content for the time being.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jen let Claire relax for a bit before taking her on their next adventure. Claire sat on her large bed, her belly oozing into her lap. She was slowly eating from the stash of snacks around her as she watched TV. Chocolate donuts, corn bread, potato chips, she continually munched as she let her whole squishy body melt into the memory foam mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen started to rifle through a pile of clothes until she pulled out a large two piece bikini. \"Claire, ready to take a dip?\" Jen said, holding up the massive piece of fabric, that would really only just cover up poor Claire's fat body. Claire looked on the fence until Jen mentioned the poolside food service. Claire rolled off her bed and went into the bathroom to change. After a few minutes Jen heard her name ringing from inside the bathroom. \"Jen can you come help?\" Jen opened the door to find that the pudgy girl could not tie the bikini top behind her due to her ham sized upper arms. Jen graciously assisted and then Claire turned around to give Jen a full view of the 400+ lbs Claire. \"Lookin good girl!\" Jen hollered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then lets get to this poolside buffet!\" Claire said excitedly. Claire quickly waddled down the hall, her exposed bulk swishing and swaying as she pounded hard with each footfall. Jen easily kept up with her, watching from behind as one massive ass cheek bounced over the one next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire opened the door to the large pool area, where there were tons of people all about. There was a little hut on the side of the pool on the far left end and Claire decided thats where the food must be getting served. She cautiously waddled in that direction, maneuvering herself up to what looked like a tiki bar. The bar was filled with wide bathing suit clad women, and Claire noticed chubby women walking away with colorful drinks in large quantities. When she finally made her way to the front the bar tender asked her what she was having. \"Give me your largest drink.\" She said. The bar tender turned around and pulled out a large party cup, which looked to hold about 2 gallons of liquid. It was full of a green colored slushie. He handed it to Claire and she thanked him before turning back around to find Jen standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got something to quench your thirst I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, biggest one they had.\" Claire said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I've got us two lounge chairs over here.\" Claire followed Jen to their spot which had a few table filled with pool side snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this place thinks of everything don't they.\" Claire said as she was shocked at how hospitable this place was to a girl with needs like hers. Claire laid back and sipped on her tasty drink, and nibbled on some trays of food. She watched as people splashed around in the pool and scampered about all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire had finished her drink Jen got her up and into the pool. \"Come on girl, time to swim.\" Claire had not really been active at all at her larger state so she was not accustomed to swimming at her size. Thankfully she floated pretty well. The girls splashed about for a bit before Claire got tired and also hungry. They went back to their spot and Claire finished eating the pool side grub. Jen made sure to replace Claire's tasty drink with another, this time a purple one. Claire liked it just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire was acclimating to her surrounding now that she had been in the resort for almost a day she was starting to notice the high number of large women around her. It was as if everyone on vacation here was fat, and not just like chubby or pudgy, needing to drop a few pounds, but they were all significantly over weight. Huge racks in small bikini tops, big asses stretching out swim suit bottoms, and plenty of hanging jiggling bellies all around her. Claire started to find this weird, but then again in her own twisted version of reality it didn't have to be weird. Most of the women were being followed around by scrawny guys, but men of all shapes and sizes could be seen escorting the lovely ladies around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen this place is kinda unique huh?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jen played dumb, hoping to not startle Claire quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the people here are kinda different, like there's a lot of big girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but if you haven't noticed you are kinda a big girl too.\" Claire knew she had gotten a bit bigger, back when she had crested 200lbs she had gone through some worries, but Jen had always assured her that her body was banging, that's why all the guys at the mall looked her way. But Claire had no idea she had pudged out to 400lbs and become a total butterball.</span></div></div>",

But Claire wasn't completely sure he was talking to her so she had to ask. \"Are you talking to me or my friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh you of course, I mean it is BBW week after all. No offence to your friend here, but she just isn't BBW material. Well hopefully I'll see more of you later, much more of you.\" He flipped his hair back as he turned to leave back on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBW? Doesn't that stand for Big Beautiful Woman?\" Claire turned, asking Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen didn't know what to do, she could be open and honest, or play dumb and act like she had no clue what it meant. In a split second decision she decided to go the open and honest route, it was now or never. \"Yes Claire it does. That's why we are here. I think you've gotten a bit bigger than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Like how big?\" Claire was a little shocked, she didn't know if she should be upset or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like over 400 pounds. You are like the fattest girl in the school.\" Jen said trying to be as honest as possible so Claire could accept who she had become and not hide behind a fog of denial any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I never knew I had gotten so big.\" This was kind of the moment of truth, if Claire would freak out or be totally cool with herself. \"Well I guess I'm a BBW now then huh? I don't really even know what that term means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.\" Jen giggled in relief. \"It means you get to eat as much as you want here and make as big of a pig of yourself as you want, and it's not frowned upon, it's even encouraged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Claire was giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We are here to fatten you up even more, so we've got some work ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can even call this work.\" Claire said as she picked up a treat from her tray, plopping it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well let's get started then shall we.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Jen had said got Claire worried. She didn't want to be fat, even though she knew of her parents intentions, and had agreed to go on this fattening diet, but only until a point. \"Is this all part of my parents plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all, I just wanted us to have a girls getaway. Aren't you having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.\" Claire had to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is no problem.\" Jen smiled. \"How about I refill these plates here and get you a new drink.\" Jen did as she had promised and Claire gladly ate all the food she was served. Claire really was having a good time. She loved eating and spending time with Jen, and that's really all this vacation had been about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had enjoyed the pool enough Claire started to get sleepy, so the girls went back to the room to tuck in for the night. Claire changed into some semi fitting pajamas and pounced on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dirfted off to slumber land easily, but she was jolted awake before she knew it. \"Hey Claire.\" Jen whsipered. \"How do you feel about going for a midnight snack?\" Claire was discombobulated, but Jen was helping her out of bed so she just complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Claire asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like one o' clock. But your belly was grumbling loudly, it woke me up, so I thought you could use a little something.\" How that Claire was up and about she realized how hungry she was. She started to move a little faster towards the banquet hall where Jen had been dragging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place looked a little different now that it was the middle of the night, but Claire could see that each buffet station was still fully operational and stocked. The crowd was much lighter though, but only in volume of people, Claire still noticed that most of the women were fat. There were many tables with fat girls of various ages pigging out on massive trays of food in their pajamas. She only noticed them for a second before her hunger took over and she started to over load a tray of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was at a table wolfing down her meal, with Jen there to help, getting drinks and extra platters for Claire. Claire didn't realize how hungry she had been, and easily put away tray after tray bursting with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked up at the couple in front of her, just a couple of tables away. There was a woman who looked to be in her 30's who was the same size as Claire and a man the same age as her, but no where near her size. She viewed them in profile, and how the big woman's belly spread into her lap, and her juicy rack sat atop her blubery belly. Inches of thick creamy rolls could be seen exposed where her night shirt no longer reached her waistline. The big woman was eating food with not a care in the world. Claire never got a look at her ass because she never needed to get up thanks to her man, but she guessed she had a fat ass as well from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went back to focusing on her own food, but the thoughts of all the fat women stayed in her head. \"Here Claire, pizza, brisket, creamed corn, potaeto wedges, fried chicken, and biscuits. This looks good.\" Claire looked forward to this new plate, but continued to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents wanted her to be like that 30 something girl, little did she know she already was. And the woman looked happy, she even had a handsome man who pampered her. Maybe her parents didn't have it wrong, maybe she should give in more and be fat? Was that really OK, Claire thought. She knew she didn't have to decide now, but she had started to think about it. The only thing that mattered right this very instant was the delicious tray in front of her, and how she needed some BBQ sauce to kick it up a notch, but before Claire could even ask, Jen was handing her a giant full bottle.</span></div></div>",

Now that the rotund teen was a little more satisfied she slipped into a nice dress and followed Jen out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire slowly waddled behind Jen as they traversed the long hallway.

It looked like Jen had just lead her into the resorts spa. \"Come on girl, lets get our rub on.\" Jen hollard as she walked around Claire, who had stopped in her tracks. \"I made us each a rezzy, for a back rub. Come on it will be fun.\" Jen sauntered up to the counter and checked them both in. After only a minute of waiting they were each escorted in and given robes to change into. Claire stripped down to her bikini and put the sizable robe on over her round body. Exiting the glass door on the other side of the change room she found her self in the massage room, but it wasn't as she had pictured it from TV shows and movies before, it was a little different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome ma'am have a seat.\" the young man wearing a staff polo directed her. He was standing next to a massage bed, and Claire waddled over and laid her massive bulk on it. He instructed her to lie down with her head down at the top. Claire slowly maneuvered her self on to her belly, requiring some assistance from her masseuse. But finally she was in position and the massage could start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to help your self to any of our spa's tasty refreshments.\" He said as she could feel his hands start to grab her bulky back rolls. Claire was looking down at what looked like some type of belt, and right as he started the belt began to move. As the belt moved Claire noticed that dishes full of food started to come slowly trucking past her face. The first dish was shrimp and cocktail sauce. Claire grabbed a shrimp in both hands dunking them generously in cocktail sauce, popping them each in her mouth, before grabbing another before it had drifted away. Since Claire was eating upside down she was a little bit more clumsy than usual, and she knocked over the cocktail sauce before it got away as she tried to dunk her last shrimp in it. The masseuse didn't say anything, so Claire didn't feel too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext down the belt came a large slice of chocolate cake. The cake was moving quickly, and Claire didn't see a fork, so she picked it up with both hands and crammed as much into her mouth as she could. Big chucks of cake and frosting came spilling from her face and hands, but Claire was able to get three good bites in until the cake resembled more like crumbs in her hands. Claire was only able to lick her fingers clean before the next item arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire greedily ate from the moving belt for over an hour as her massage unfolded. As she cooed in pleasure as her back and legs felt better, she also moaned in pleasure as she ate gourmet plates of food. Escargot, mini cheesecakes, rack of ribs, a bevy of food items came Claire's away over that hour. The food and the massage didn't stop, but eventually Claire could hear someone else enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire, how's your massage going?\" She heard a familiar voice say. Soon Jen's face came popping up from under the massage table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is great, massage and a meal.\" Claire said as she swallowed what was in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't let me get in your way.\" Jen said as she removed her face to allow the next plate to make it's way under Claire's nose. Claire's massage went on for another 20 minutes as Jen watched Claire pig out. Finally when she was done her friend helped her off the table and cleaned her face.

And any newer bigger clothing is yours, just ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I'm in it to win it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Then meet us down stairs for breakfast as soon as you get dressed.\" Claire's parents left her alone to get dressed. As soon as they were gone she started to examine herself. She really had gained 30 lbs and not really noticed. She had a soft belly that jiggled and her arms and legs were softer than she had ever remembered. She wondered how big she was going to get. Was she going to get as fat as her friend Rachel? Rachel was by far her fattest friend, weighing in at 250lbs. Was she going to be the fattest girl at school? The fattest girl in her class was probably 50lbs heavier than Rachel. Or maybe she was going to be as fat as Mrs. Fletcher, the history teacher. Mrs. Fletcher was the biggest woman in the school. She had a hard time getting around, especially in and out of her class room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Claire started to smell the scents coming from the kitchen and knew that was her notification that she was needed in the kitchen. She bounced down stairs to see a feast on the table. A whole diner menu full of options. She took a seat after acknowledging her parents, and started to make a plate. While she was making a plate she stared to chew on a sticky bun. She loaded her plate up with French toast and sausage and bacon. She drenched everything in butter and syrup. \"Is this what breakfast is going to be like everyday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet honey. Your dining request is our command. If you want chocolate cake for breakfast it's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.\" The thought of sugary treats made her hungry. She scarfed down the last of the sticky bun and started in on her meal. After her first plate she went back for eggs and potatoes. After covering that in ketchup and down the hatch, she started to go after all the tasty sweets. There were donuts, danishes, cinnamon rolls, and other confections. She tried one of each, and kept moving. Claire ate until she was so full it was hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Omph. I'm so full. It was so good but I don't need to over do it like that.' Claire thought to her self. Claire's parents cleaned up while Claire sat at the table, unable to move. Claire rested the rest of the day. She sat and watched Tv, and when she was ready she started to snack again. The house was loaded more than usual with treats. She found all sorts of fruit snacks, crackers, snack cakes, cookies, pudding cups, and pretty much everything else from the grocery store. She grabbed what she wanted and then found her way back to the couch. Claire enjoyed having a nice lazy day eating and watching Tv. Little did she know that soon a lazy day was going to become a normal day for her.</span></div></div>",

One week after their big talk summer had arrived. Claire was met with a delicious meal every morning before her parents took off for work. They would call her frequently throughout the day checking up on her eating habits, reminding her of that box of double stuffed Oreos, or the left over Chinese food. They would have pizza's paid for and delivered to the house around lunch time. Claire was loving all the attention and the food. When her parents came home, it was 100% Claire time. They were at her every beck and call. For the first month or so Claire enjoyed the pampering and tried to keep gaining weight for her family. Towards the end of summer Claire started to become a bit more demanding. She would put in specific requests for her doughnut orders and get a bit moody when something was wrong. She would call her father if she wanted pizza and they had not called a delivery for that day. Although she was getting a little bratty, her results were astounding. She had gained 30 lbs during her freshman year, and now she had gained 30lbs over the summer. </span></div></div>",

Claire just continued to eat and threaten to stop and go on a major diet if her mom continued on. She even threatened to move out and disown her parents for force fattening her. Her mother could do nothing to stop her. The nearly 200 lb sophomore needed to finish three more years of high school to remain in the good graces of the rest of the family. That's when Claire's dad came up with a great idea. They could have her home schooled and she could get her GED and it would be just as acceptable as going to school. It was actually a blessing in disguise because while being home schooled, Claire could eat all she wanted. Her parents got right into interviewing for potential teachers, but most of the good ones were driven away by Claire's appetite and pigish nature. No one wanted to teach a girl who was constantly snacking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it started to become a problem Claire's mom had another talk with her. \"Honey we are interviewing another teacher for you today, but I need to ask you a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your eating had been scaring off everyone that wants to help you get your schooling done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what I don't need them, I don't need school, you guys will take care of me until I'm too big to leave the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are going to take care of you, but there will come a time when you need to leave the nest and live your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can anyone live a normal life when they are as fat as I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was your size once, I was two of you once, and I have lead a long happy life. I want that for you too. That's why your father and I are doing this for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me? Your making me fat as a house for me? I'm doing this for you. You asked and I complied, the least you can do is let me be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here missy. This family needs you and you need this family. When you win this contest in three years the rest of your life will be all set, but you have to comply. You need to finish school. If you don't finish school you are going to be nothing but a fat little girl with nothing to do, and no where to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg Fine\" Claire shouted as a ripple raced across her soft structure. </span></div></div>",

Piggy Claire topped out at 300 lbs now and was ready for summer vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Claire it's been... something all these past months.\" Stephanie was looking at quite a different Claire now. Still stuffing her face but now 100lbs heavier. \"Don't forget to bulk up over the summer piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire just sneered at her as she continued to gorge away on sweets.

She was so excited to tell her parents. On the way home she started doing the math to find out how big she would be after the next two years were over. She had just increased from 10 lbs a month to 15. With her new job she was hoping for 20 new ones every month. That would be an addition 480 after two years, putting her at 715 lbs. 'WOW! That's huge!' Claire thought to herself. 'I can't imagine how big that is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire came home and told her parents about her new job and her new goal. They were so proud of her for getting a job (and secretly excited that it was one she could put on a few at). At the same time they were amused that Claire's goal was 715 lbs. They knew that once she got bigger that her gaining would level off and there was no way she could put on that much weight each month. They even thought it was a stretch to aim for 20 lbs  at this point. Claire had become a rotund girl. She had almost doubled in size from when she started high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's parents had some news of their own. Sadly this news was not as exciting. They had received a video today from Claire's uncle. They played the video for Claire, and they all watched intently. The video was of Diane and her father. Diane was sitting at the dining room table, the table covered in decadent treats piled high in every direction. Her father narrated as Diane stuffed her face faster than Claire had ever seen someone. It looked like an eating contest with only one contestant, Diane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a sight Diane was. At the beginning of high school, while Claire clocked in at 130 lbs, Diane had always been a big chunkier and was 168. The 38 lbs difference would be subtracted in the end, but Diane's life long sweet tooth was unleashed the second she stepped foot in her high school. The girl had been straight pigging for two years now, and although Claire had almost doubled her weight, Diane had more then doubled her original 168. Tipping the scales at 340, Diane was one of the biggest girls Claire had laid eyes on. Her measly 235 frame didn't seem all that big anymore. Diane's father ended with a couple jabs at Claire's family, and before they knew it the video was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stood there with her jaw dropped. 'I need to beat that?' she thought to her self. She had 100 lbs just to catch up. The family hugged it out and proceeded with their night as usual. After dinner, during a long silence, Claire's mother got everyone attention. \"Come on 'yall, are we gonna let some silly video get us down? That no good brother of mine was just showing off. I bet he even exaggerated her weight, she didn't look 340 to me. Back when I was 340...\" She trailed off a bit. \"Claire, you know we have the utmost confidence in you. You have had better and better results every month. You are gonna knock the socks off of Diane. She is never gonna touch your size when you hit 715 lbs. You are going to be the biggest queen ever!\" Her mothers speech invigorated the whole room. \"Now who wants dessert?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME!\" Claire shouted.</span></div></div>",

With them she had some coffee, which gave her a thought. Why didn\u2019t the bakery sell drinks and have some sidewalk tables to encourage traffic? She made the suggestion to Linda, who agreed. Within a month they were serving lattes and her shift was much busier- so much so that she missed her twenty pound target by 50%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she decided to enlist her mom\u2019s help. She began bringing home treats from the bakery and insisting her mom try them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut honey, you\u2019re the one gaining \u2013 my days for that are past!\u201d she objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, if you eat along with me like Jen does at lunch its stimulating \u2013 now do you want me to win this thing or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly her mom agreed, and Claire smiled to herself. Maybe her mom would get back to her 200 pound days. She suspected hr dad would like it \u2013 which was confirmed by his encouraging both wife and daughter to enjoy. Within two weeks her mom was eating larger meals generally and Claire smiled to herself. It was turnabout for what they\u2019d done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite that small success Claire was finding it difficult to achieve even a ten pound per month gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t helping matters,\u201d she confided to Jen over a couple of big Macs apiece at McDonalds. Claire had loaned her friend the videotape and explained what was going on. Jen had agreed to be more aggressive as her eating buddy at school, much to the wonderment of Steve, who was keeping an eye on both girls. Jen was not gaining as rapidly as Claire, but was beyond a size twelve. That didn\u2019t stop them from having generous helps of dishes such as lasagna, tamale casserole, spaghetti and chicken fried steak with potatoes \u2013 always with dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is as if they\u2019re trying to gain weight,\u201d Steven observed, uncomfortably noting that the voyeur in him was enjoying the show. Steven had a secret \u2013 although a jock to his classmates he had a secret obsession with heavier women. His Uncle was a physician who had books on eating disorders and before/after pictures of about obese people \u2013the \u201cbefore\u201d shots of those in the 200-300 lb range had always fascinated him. But wanting to be popular he remained in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day he decided to approach Jen about Claire<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t take offense. But I think I\u2019ve been a jerk,\u201d he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI led Claire on for you, had a wonderful time, then ran and hid And I think you know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThick chicks really aren\u2019t your style? Hey, I\u2019m no Skinny Minnie myself and don\u2019t you know I\u2019ve suspected that\u2019s why we talk but never date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that\u2019s what I project \u2013 but it\u2019s a lie,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOther guys who are attracted to bigger girls just do it \u2013 I\u2019ve covered up. And while I\u2019ve never led you on, I did Claire. I haven\u2019t gotten that day out of my mind. What I don\u2019t understand s why she eats so much all the time when she has to know its just going to make her bigger. Is that what she wants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a sense, yes. Come to my place tonight and I\u2019ll show you something you\u2019ll need to see to understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Steve and Jen watched the video of Diane and Steve\u2019s brain nearly exploded \u2013 not from attraction or revulsion, but from a suspicion of what was really going on with Diane.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Claire\u2019s competition and I\u2019m her coach. Does that make things clearer?\u201d Jen asked at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm yes, but there is something else. That girl isn\u2019t just competing with Claire for a reward. She is obsessive to the point of eating like an automaton. You and Claire enjoy your food \u2013 did she look like she was enjoying anything&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really \u2013 what are you getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts possibly an eating disorder, called Prader-Willi syndrome. Those with it can\u2019t stop eating as long as food is available \u2013 they sometimes go into a coma from overstuffing themselves. Its so severe that those afflicted with it often have to be placed under control of a conservator and institutionalized. If its not done they will literally gorge themselves to death. My Uncle is the expert, not me, but she has all the symptoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo her parents are endangering her life by playing to her compulsive behavior?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly. The only way to find out is to have someone who knows see her up close and in person. What if we arrange a picnic where both families are present? If it is Prader-Willi I think my Uncle can get an injunction to get her help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would likely disqualify Diane \u2013 or at least guarantee that Claire wins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but right now the concern is about Diane. Can you have Claire talk with her parents but not reveal to hem what we are up o?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so \u2013 let me try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve left Jen\u2019s place with the video. He showed it the next day to his Uncle, who was shocked at Diane\u2019s display. He agreed to attend the party, warning Steve that if he was right he would have a legal obligation to initiate a competency proceeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcurrently Jen informed Claire about Steve\u2019s renewed interest in her and she was ecstatic. Then she told her about Steve\u2019s having seen the video and his concerns. At first Claire was angry at Jen, but then her anger shifted to her Uncle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat SOB is just exploiting her for money. I bet she doesn\u2019t understand or care about the challenge. I don\u2019t either - not this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve has a plan to help her \u2013 but we need your cooperation. First of all the two of you need to become an item, which I don\u2019t see as a problem. Then we need to set up a picnic with the uncles and Diane present. That way Diane can be evaluated for Prader Willi without it being obvious. Can you be a good actress for a month? And not tell your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I have to \u2013 for Diane\u2019s sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Steve called Claire and invited her to dinner at a great Mexican restaurant. Her tight dinner dress fully illustrated her most recently acquired rolls and her full arms were on display from the short sleeved top. By now over 250 pounds Claire was very much a fat girl \u2013 but Steve, thanks to having come clan through Jen, wasn\u2019t bothered at all. Claire saw his eyes on her and knew he was hooked. She felt giddy inside even as she knew they had a sting to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week Claire invited Steve to dinner at her place to meet her parents. Claire\u2019s Dad immediately detected that Steve was a fellow FA and they got along well. Claire\u2019s mom was so focused on pushing food on both the young people that it was embarrassing \u2013 but knowing why they took it in stride. They also noted that Claire\u2019s mom\u2019s clothes were getting very tight.<br>\r\nThe stage was now set for Claire to confront her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d she declared. \u201cI\u2019m just not gaining fast enough. I want to meet Diane face to face and see just what she\u2019s made of. I hope it will stimulate me! Why can\u2019t we do something like have a picnic with her and my uncle?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d her mom hesitated but her Dad jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019d want to bring along your new boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly \u2013 I have something she doesn\u2019t and it could demoralize her,\u201d Claire replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom caved to this logic as she stood and nervously pulled at her top. \u201cOK \u2013 but you\u2019ll need to extend the invitation. My brother doesn\u2019t really like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two sets of parents set up a massive spread of food. Claire nibbled modestly on the appetizers with Steve as did Jen and her date. Diane, however, barely spoke to anyone. As soon as she saw the table of food she grabbed a two liter soda bottle and began using it to wash down chips, pretzels and anything edible in sight. Then the burgers were ready from the bar-b-que. Diane grabbed two and a heaping plate of potato salad, then went back almost mechanically for seconds. Claire an=d Jen had perhaps as third as much and felt stuffed. The pattern was repeated ith the dessert offerings \u2013 Diane simply ate compulsively like a pig on autopilot as her parents looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve\u2019s Uncle took all this in and concluded that Diane was indeed a Prader-Willi case. He approached Claire\u2019s uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, I\u2019m just supposed to be here as a chauffeur/chaperone today but in reality I\u2019m also a medical professional. I can\u2019t help but notice your daughter\u2019s eating habits \u2013 they seem a bit compulsive. Are you seeing anyone about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, if its any of your business. We\u2019re proud of our daughter and if she enjoys eating and being fat we support her. Its frankly none of your business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually it may be. You don\u2019t need o come to my office \u2013 in fact I\u2019d prefer you get someone you\u2019d be comfortable with as being impartial. But she exhibits symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome and as a health professional I\u2019m obligated to notify the authorities if you don\u2019t take action yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of Claire\u2019s uncle became red. \u201dThe next thing you\u2019ll be saying is that we\u2019re unfit parents. Well, she\u2019s over 18 so we have no responsibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat s a legal matter outside my pay grade,\u201d replied Stephen\u2019s uncle. \u201cBut in addition to today I have seen the video you made. I can and will have her checked out if you don\u2019t. I expect an opinion in my office within a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the next Friday Claire\u2019s parents received word that Diane had been placed in a treatment center for eating disorders \u2013 the challenge was over with Claire the winner by default. She and Steven celebrated by joining Jen and her beau for an Italian dinner. It was one of many such foursomes they would share in years to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued working in the bakery until she married Steve after graduation. Claire\u2019s uncle never spoke to her or her parents again. Diane luckily did recover and lived by herself for several years until marrying an FA. As for Claire\u2019s parents, her mom never did lose the new weight she\u2019d gained, probably due to the increased appreciation and attention from her husband</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During her sophomore year Claire had gone on a date with this guy Steve. Her school mate Jen had set it up, but Steve hadn't seen Claire with all the extra weight. The 30 pounds from the summer was quite the shock to him. After their date Steve never called which hurt Claire's feelings, but at least she had as much food as she wanted to comfort her. As the year progressed Steve watched Claire from a distance. He noticed as she piled on 45 pounds over the course of the school year. It was easy to imagine why with all the sweets and stuff that were packed in her lunch, but Steve marveled at how much she put away and how much weight she had gained since the beginning of high school. Claire used to be such a twig. Now she was this hefty girl with a round booty, enormous stomach, and a full rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs boys do in high school, Steve was finding him self in the world. One thing that he could not describe to himself was why he thought about Claire so much. And with those thoughts came others about her weight and size and eating habits. Steve was fascinated by her, and even aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the year he knew he had to say something to her or it was going to be all summer before he got a chance to see her again, a whole summer of her stuffing and eating that he was going to miss out on. One day after school Claire was waiting for her dad to pick her up, Steve decided to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire!\" Steve tried to sound excited<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was a little bit startled, she didn't have many friends at school, she couldn't fathom who would be calling her name. She turned around to see Steve and it immediately put a sour look on her face. \"What do you want?\" She said brashly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say hi and catch up. I haven't seen you since the beginning of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, because you never called me.\" Claire said, trying not to bring up old sad feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that was awful of me. I can't believe I did that. I think I was just too nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nervous? More like scared to be seen with the class fatty. I have no problem with myself, I just don't care for others that do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, you have it all wrong.\" Steve pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your trying to tell me that Mr. perfect and handsome and personality was to nervous to call me back...? I don't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, well mostly. I think you are an amazing girl Claire, it just took me too long to figure that out. Let me prove it to you, let's go on a date right now. And... and we can go on one tomorrow too! That way you don't have to worry about me not calling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you just don't show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can pick me up at my house. I promise I'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Well then where are we going on this date of ours? It better be good, tonight's Chinese night at my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case I know just the place.\" Steve walked Claire to his car while Claire texted her dad and told him of her plans. Steve took Claire to an all-you-can eat Chinese buffet, and they both had an amazing time. Claire got to eat all the food she wanted until she was completely full, and Steve got to watch up close and personal as she put it all away. Claire rested for a few minutes after her meal and then Steve lead her to the car. Claire held her full belly all the way home. Claire was used to being full, but she pushed past her limit tonight because she was having such a good time she didn't realize she was so many plates in. After being dropped off Claire waddled inside where some desert was waiting for her. Being so full, but also after a little while in the car digesting, Claire decided to take the tray of sweets up to her room to nibble on for the rest of the night.</span></div></div>",

Steve was always at Claire's side, and aided in the eating process. If he wasn't bringing her morning donuts up to her room, he was answering the door for the pizza delivery. He refilled her empty plates, and also restocked all her sweets. Claire couldn't be happier. Steve made her happy, and also made her parents happy. Her parents had taken kindly to how rapidly Claire was gaining. They were also glad to see her happy and with come companion ship. They were worried that getting their little girl fat would ruin her high school days since all the guy were in to tiny girls now. But with the body Claire was rocking now Steve wasn't going anywhere. Claire had the biggest rack in the school and also the curves to back it up. Claire's mom kept up with her growing body in the clothing department as well, so when ever she went out she looked just as hot as the other girls from school. Claire was loving every second of life. She could eat all she wanted, she had the number one stud from school, she had the best bod in her class as far as she was concerned, and she still had two years left of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer junior year of high school rolled around and everyone at school was astonished by the weight she had gained.

Most weeks he was able to bring left overs home from class too from the other students. This excess food was great for Claire, she especially liked the baking month Steve's class had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had almost become part of the family. Although Claire's parents didn't let Steve stay in Claire's room he was allowed to stay in the guest bedroom.

Now that Claire was about her size, Rachel was one of her only friends. A lot of Claire's friends got weirded out when she started rapidly growing fatter. She was eating all the time in school like she wanted to get fat, and the rest of her girl friends judged her pretty harshly for it, but not Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachel, it's Claire. Wanna come over?\" Claire said propping the phone to her ear with her shoulder as she used her free hands to continue her daily food intake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure girl, it been forever since I've seen you. What have you been doing all summer?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you everything when you get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'll be over lickity split.\" And Rachel was over quite quick, but she had to get past Claire's parents first, and they had prepared for such an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel you look parched, have a glass of water.\" Claire's mom insisted. But what Rachel didn't know was that there was a temporary mild appetite enhancer in the drink. They had tried it earlier on Claire but it didn't have quite the effect on the strong willed Claire, but they were confident it would work on the weak Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. M, I'm gonna go see Claire now.\" Rachel said as she lumbered up stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire heard her coming and got out of bed to get the door for her. Claire's massive bulk teetered and jiggled as she waddled over to her bedroom door. Opening it she saw Rachel coming down the hall. \"Great you're here, I have so much to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, but first can I get something to eat, I'm starving.\" Rachel said as she passed Claire entering her room. Rachel spotted some snacks and just helped herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess we can eat, but I really got to tell you whats been going on.\" Claire started to yell down to her mom for food, but she didn't have to becuase she was already coming up with trays full of treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls!\" She cooed as she entered the room. \"Didn't want you two getting hungry.\" She winked at her daughter, Claire knew this was just to fatten her up even more. \"And remember to share!\" She left, and Rachel quickly went to town on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into you Rach?\" Rachel was too distracted to answer, so Claire just joined her, and Claire's mom was hasty to bring up more food as soon as she could. The girls pigged out all night, Rachel not stopping to take a break even once. By the end of the night Claire's mom was sending Rachel home stuffed before the girls could even have a conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say goodnight Claire, your friend has to leave.\" And with that she lead Rachel back down to the kitchen. She just had one more thing before she let the tubby teen go home. \"Rachel those clothes are looking the greatest anymore, let me give you some of Claire's old clothes, she doesn't fit into them anymore and you could certainly use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs M.\" and with that Rachel was sent on her way.</span></div></div>",

But Rachel was her only friend, so she continued to invite her over. Claire noticed Rachel getting bigger though. Rachel had always been fat but about the same level of fatness for years. But now it seemed that she had been growing wider. Over the course of the summer Claire had ballooned to over 300lbs, but it looked like Rachel was not far behind, tipping the scale at 275.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire realized what she was doing to her friend, she was getting fat by proxy of being around her. She had lassoed Rachel into her web here, and her friend had started to get even fatter becouse of it. She stopped inviting her over immetely for her own good, but it didn't help. Rachel had been set on a path, and was not going to stop any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks of no Rachel, Claire's mom came up to her room to ask her why. She loved Rachel coming over, because Claire was much more willing to eat along side her friend then on her own. Claire knew she couldn't turn down all the fattening food she was being served, but she didn't eat with any gusto. When Rachel was around and stuffing her face, Claire was more willing to indulge, even if it was only a little bit more than she normally would. \"Why hasn't your friend Rachel been over in awhile?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because her coming here was making her fat, and I maybe doomed to a life of being a lard ass, but I won't bring my only friend down with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, it's not you that was making her fatter, it was her own piggishness. Rachel has always been a big girl, it was only in due time that she would encounter another \"growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't belive that, she never used to eat so much before coming into this den of fatty foods.\" Claire rebutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will just have to find out.

Ok see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Rachel arrived and Claire's mom led her upstairs. \"Honey Rachel is here to see you.\" She said as the two walked into the teens room. Rachel looked bigger than ever, and in very ill fitting clothes as well. Her tee shirt could not contain her massive belly, allowing the bottom of the big roll to hang freely. Her jeans were popping at the seams, and she couldn't get the button to close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Claire. Your mom had me bring up some snacks for us to share. Also Mrs. M, do you think I could borrow some of Claire's old clothes again, for some reason I'm having a hard time with the last set you gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course honey, Claire is getting much to big for her old clothes anyway.\" She smiled at Claire before returning to the kitchen to prepare more food.</span></div></div>",

Claire thought as she watched her only friend eat like a pig right from the tray in front of her. Claire realized this could actually benefit her, as she could funnel all the junk food to her friend and that would be less for her to consume. She shouldn't be sending Rachel away, she should be inviting her over more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did, every day. Rachel was more than happy to accept the daily invitations and after a week Claire didn't even need to ask, Rachel would just show up. Rachel was a food addict and Claire's house was swimming with temptation. The best part was the hours that Rachel was over every day after school was a reprieve that Claire got to ease up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeek past like this and Claire noticed her monumental gaining starting to decrease. She was still getting flabbier, but at a much slower rate. Her best friend though could not say the same. Rachel had already gained some serious weight being around the flabby Claire, but her new appitite had kicked things up a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks rolled into months the changes we're very much apparent. Rachel grew wider and wider, very much in denial over how flabby she had gotten. She continued to out grow Claire's hand-me-downs. Her busty round chest overflowed all of her bras and her belly jiggled with every step. Her ass had continued to gain increased padding, staying very round behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came up to Claire's room, like she did everyday, getting more winded by the stairs as time went on. \"Hey bestie!\" Rachel cheered as the wide teen waddled through the door, holding a sweet in her hand already. All Claire could notice was how small her shirt was, unable to contain much of her freely hanging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's mom was not far behind was a boat load of treats. \"OMG Mrs. W thoes look so good!\" Rachel drooled as she took the platter from the family matriarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, that shirt is looking a little small.\" The mother mentioned as she noticed just how wide her daughter friend was. \"Why don't I put a few more of Claire's old shirts in your bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had already started stuffing her face as Claire looked on in disgust. \"But Mrs. W, you just gave me this shirt a couple of days ago.\" The mother locked eyes with the girls pudgy belly that was now pooling into her lap as she sat and stuffed her face. It wasn't until now that she noticed Rachel had been growing faster than Claire. How could she have not seen it? Claire had clocked in at 325lbs at her most recent weight check, and Rachel had obviously clearly passed that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Claire could do was smile as she noticed her mom realizing what had happened the past few months. </span></div></div>",

But wish as she might things were no where near normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire returned to school, her laptop and online courses we're easily rolled over to Rachel by her mother. With Rachel at home, Claire uneasily roamed the hallways of her high school as by far the biggest student. Claire's former, and now again current, classmates didn't know what to make of the massively morbidly obese teen. She had been ostracized previously when she had started to bulk up, and it was easy to tell it didn't stop when she started her home schooling. Some of the students didn't even recognize her and thought she was new to town. Yet still, no one wanted to make friends with the 350 lb junior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were not normal at home either. Claire's parents were much to focused on Rachel to have any time for their only actual daughter. Claire had fallen behind in school, practically missing a full year. She had been enrolled in online classes, but eating away her days had taken a priority under this roof. Struggling with homework she tried asking for help. \"I'm sorry sweetie, Rachel is going to be ready for dinner soon, I need to get everything ready for her.\" Her father said with half a smile and a rushed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's mom was always the better helper when it came to homework away ways. \"Mom!\" Claire shouted when she knew she was out of ear shot of her father. \"I need some help on my homework!\" Her shouting quited as she reached her old bedroom where Rachel was now occupying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rachel joined the family she was given Claire's room, as there were only two real bedrooms in the house. Claire was shuffled off to stay in the den. The family had a chair that transformed into a bed. Not really suited for big boned Claire, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Claire's hollering had still gone unanswered, although she knew her mother would be in Rachel's room, she almost always was. Claire slowly creaked open the door, getting a view of Rachel sitting up in her old bed, covered in the remains of her latest feast. Claire's mother was busy cleaning up when Rachel noticed her friend enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Claire!\" Rachel greeted her, before reaching for another treat that had been delivered to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, totally ignoring Rachel, tried to get her mother attention about her home work. \"Mom, I need help with my math homework, I just don't understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, can't you see I'm a little busy?\" Her mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will only take a few minutes, the dishes can wait a few minutes can't they?\" Claire tried to plead her case. She was sick of feeling like she was invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because it's almost Rachel's dinner time, and if I don't have everything cleaned up there will be no where to put all the platters. Rachel has been so busy today there is no way she has the energy to go downstairs to eat at the table. And if dinner gets delayed then so would dessert, and Rachel loves to eat dessert when she watches her nightly line up on Thursdays, isn't that right sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was getting excited by the idea of dinner, even though she stuffed herself like a pig every night, so tonight would be no different. Claire had to endure the sight of her whole friends body jiggling as the over joyed girl bounced in excited over the idea of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe tomorrow ok honey?\" Her mother said rushing out of the room with dirty dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not alright.\" Claire mumbled under her breath. \"It's due tomorrow...\"</span></div></div>",

Claire saw her mother become struck with sorrow as tear dripped down her somber countenance. \"Well Claire, you're mother was once very fat and happy and would want nothing more than to be fat.\" Her father said. \"Claire I'm going to explain the purpose of our family and our tradition.\" Her father said with his arms around his wife.

Her giant jugs filled the low fabric top, allowing for her gracious gut to hang loose over her miniskirt. \"Before you know it you will be just as hot as I am.\" The new members slowly start to stuff their faces just like everyone else, surly on their way to getting very plump very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle only had 8 month's until graduation and wanted to make sure her legacy stuck behind after she was gone. It was her goal to get every girl to the 200 lb mark by graduation.</span></div></div>",

The difference between the two teams was huge, the visitors were skinny, lightweight, teenage girls wearing the usual loose fitting basketball uniform and their hair in ponytails, whereas the home team was fat with tight tank tops showing cleavage and not reaching down past their belly button, their shorts were tight and barely covered anything, every girl on the team was showing off an ass crack on the top and their ass hung out from the bottom. The visitors' arms and legs were sticklike with no excessive jiggling whereas the hometeam had jiggling and fat shaking everytime a girl reached out for the ball, a visitor got a face full of arm flab by a home team girl trying to intercept a pass. Some of the home team girls wore their hair in a ponytail while others let it flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe home team was totally losing but no one was bothered by that in fact they were pleased cause it showed off the girls feminine curves and fatness.  \"Wow 80-0, our girls are so out of shape, ha I love it! Just look at them pant and waddle. And don't you just love watching their big boobs and butts jiggle as they run, oh and when they jump, boy do their tits really bounce!\" Janelle said to her members \"Yes our girls really are putting on a show jiggling for everyone, but man we're getting crushed out there, must have been that mandatory pregame pizza loading.\" one of the members said. \"Its not about who wins its about who looks good and our girls win head and toe over those...skeletons.\" Janelle said while grabbing a handful of buttery popcorn. \"By the way how much food are the female spectators buying?\" Janelle asking her club member \"Real good Janelle sales are through the roof, I mean just look around.\" Throughout the gym girls were stuffing their faces with popcorn, candy, hotdogs, nachoes, icecream. Bellies were hanging out from under the shirts, dresses were beginning to tear, tits were spilling and bursting out of tops, skirts were riding up covering less and less of the average girl's ever growing ass. Even some of the basketball players were eating, while on the court, as someone from the stands shouted \"Is that player eating a hotdog?\" The girls on the sidelines were really pigging out, stuffing their faces with burgers, fattening up on cake, and washing it down with milkshakes while the visitors looked at them in disbelief. \"And look at our cheerleaders, so feminine and curvy, body fat jiggling and bouncing with every movement, plus their uniforms look much nicer on them than before. Now their boobs have grown and now their short shirt covers as much as a bikini does\" Janelle said \"Unlike those sicklooking visitors, man if I could only get 1 week with them I could really butter those girls up.\" \"Yes you sure know what you're doing, I was worried the baskeball players might lose weight after the game but with how much food you make sure is available I think the girls are actually gaining.\" said one of her members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the game with home girls losing 106-0, Janelle had a victory(for jiggling) feast waiting for the girls but then looked at how skinny the other team was and out of good sportsmanship ordered more food and invited them. The visitors were resistive but Janelle convinced them to come and eat, even though she practically had the fatgirl club drag their scrawny asses. The home girls feasted and indulged but the visitors were meekly tasting so Janelle had thehome girls feed them. Some held them while others shoved cake in their mouths. An hour later the visitors left with bulging stomachs but also strangely satisfied. \"Hopefully this feast set those girls on the right path.\"Janelle said while eating a huge slice of cake. \"But theres still work that needs to be done here,right girls?\" Janelle said arousing weight gaining enthusiasim among the girls. \"Yeah!\" they all said throwing their arms in the air swaying their fat arms.

The Cheerleaders and preps were all fat asses, wearing their designers clothes that hugged their curves so tightly. All the sports teams were over weight. All the calorie pumping had them barely fitting in their uniforms and taking advantage of all the team snacks. The goth's were hard, but they had also been conquered. Once their queen fell to the ways of the fat all of her minions joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only group she had been unable to break was the geeks in the AV club. For some reason they had been resilient to all of Janelle's tactics. Fast food-a-fy the lunches, and they just skip it and stay in the computer rooms. Saturate sporting events with calorie rich concession and they don't attend the events. But now that the rest of the school was already take care of she could really focus on these girls in the AV club. She decided to join the club to gain their trust and work them from the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with inviting the female members over to her place for a slumber party. There was lots of food and they all left with full bellies. Then she convinced them to start having catered meetings. She had strings she could pull, and from then on the computer room was always stocked with treats. Her final step was to convince all the guys who had crushes on the girls that they were going to be more attractive with some more pounds. The boys in turn helped progress the girls up to a healthy weight. After not very long Janelle had them right where she wanted them, fat and happy. They did have to order a few more sturdy chairs for the computer room, but that was a small concession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally every girl at school had been admitted into the fat girl club. Janelle held a special meeting to celebrate. All the girls almost couldn't fit in the gymnasium. She congratulated everyone one their acceptance, but really they were all here to do one thing, eat.</span></div></div>",

The sheer notion of ignoring her natural appetite and missing out on sumptuous meals and decadent sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia loved her soft bouncy body. Her wide butt, her soft prominent belly, her floppy arms, the flowing crevices between her folds, and of course her gorgeous big boobs. She took pride in her corpulence. Fat was nothing to be ashamed of. Fat was soft. Supple. Feminine. Curves were what truly made a woman distinguished. A woman's curves made her unique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia proudly advocated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what led Julia to create the Fat Girl's club. Her school pressured it's students to be active in projects and join clubs. Julia took their advice and proposed her club. Despite the encouraging attitude of the school, Julia's idea was met with skepticism but ultimately was approved as she managed to acquire enough members, all fat girls.

The club had made some alterations in the school's guidelines as requested by its president, Julia. As a result, the school had become more accommodating for girls of size. There were chairs custom made to be wide and sturdy to service big buttocks. An elevator was installed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia even managed to snag a few perks granted only to club members. Members were exempt from gym class. They were allowed to bring and consume snacks during class. Uniform regulations were diminished permitting Fat Girl club members to wear theirs shirts unbuttoned which had previously confining their big boobs. Members were even allowed to be expose their bellies and wear their skirts as short as desired/necessary. Members were also protected by tardiness, excusing their slow speed. Of course came the Fat Girl's club membership discount in the cafeteria.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these perks enticed the female student body, prompting many to join. However, few could as Julia imposed a STRICT weight requirement. All members must weigh at least 160 pounds. Given that the average weight of the school girl there was 115 pounds, barely anyone joined, and more disappointingly hardly any girl was willing to gain for membership. No privilege was worth their figure thought the students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the low turnout, Julia was pleased to see some interest.</span></div></div>",

She was a naturally slender girl who could indulge in any food she wanted. However, the process of puberty had transformed Becky's metabolism. No longer would the fat she ingested be burned but aggressively stored. Her body suddenly refused to lose any fat. As a result her body ballooned. The trim body she so reveled in grew slow and smothered itself in layers of soft flab. None of her small clothes could fit, simple actions became arduous, and public opinion of her changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached 130 pounds, it was obvious to all that she was the heaviest of her friends. Upon this realization, Becky began dieting. She miserably declined food and ate unsavory meals. Despite her sacrifice, she continued to gain weight. Becoming the butt of some jokes, Becky resorted to drastic measures, that which she so detested, exercise. All was futile. Becky tried and tried, torturing herself. Before getting too big, her weight stopped growing at a plump 160. It wasn't massive but it wasn't disappearing. Becky's obstinate body refused to weigh an ounce less than 160. No amount of exercising or starving would change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the thing is...\" Becky gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia leaned in.

But nothing has worked.\" Becky confessed \"I used to be so thin..\"she said giving her belly a squeeze. \"Everyone looks at me now and school's only getting harder, harassing me for uniform violations. I can't help it that me belly pops out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky than stared at the fellow members stuffing their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I first heard of the Fat Girl's club, I thought it was stupid. 'What dignified girl would join that? Just lose weight.' I said to myself. But as I faced the reality that I wasn't dropping weight and saw the benefits that the Fat Girl club members got, I realized I had to join. Not because I wanted to but because I need the benefits. The exemptions, privileges, and I need credit for extra curricular activities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia stared at Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wha!\" Becky bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia had just grabbed Becky's boobs and juggled them in her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Becky squealed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, being fat isn't bad.

The school was full of girls resisting their innate appetite, missing out on delicious but necessary nutrients. It was self-abuse.

The girls of our school are suffering. They believe that there is no other option for them then being dangerously thin. The school needs a program to remind the girls that enjoying food isn't bad. A program that warns them of the hazards of exercise. Someone to tell them that curves are beautiful.

The girls are healthy and are in no need of 'support.'\" MaryAnne coldly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm not so sure of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone than turned their heads to the source of the reproach. It was the voice of the school's psychiatrist Melanie Burrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Julia is on to something.\" Melanie shakingly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was a rail-thin woman in her late 20's. With bright red hair that resembled her bright personality, Melanie was a very down to Earth woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I constantly talk with young girls who brag about under eating. These girls are clearly not eating enough or getting the support they need. I think a new class is exactly what our school needs.\" Melanie bolstered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And WHERE exactly are we going to get the resources for this class?\" an irked MaryAnne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some suggestions.\" Julia answered. \"We could raise money by installing more vending machines in the halls and the Fat Girl club could raise money by hosting events.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who'll teach this compulsory class?\" a tired MaryAnne inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteer!\" Melanie quickly answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student council than conversed amongst each other. Shortly they reached a conclusion. They...   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an all too brief discussion, Mary Anne turns to face Julia with a happy grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The council has decided that a new health class for the female students is unnecessary.\" Mary Anne's sneer was paired with her index finger lifting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia wasn't surprised. The insistence on girls to be slender was too deeply ingrained in the school to suggest such a brave move. Before she could attempt anything too audacious, she'd require more support, more sympathy, more fat girls. If freeing girls from their diets meant sabotaging them one by one, Julia was willing to do it. A woman could never truly be happy rejecting their inner foodee, she was meant to eat and revel in the flesh she grew from it.  How could a woman convince herself she liked her body when she was frantically trying to shrink it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia unwrapped a candy bar to snack on while she calculated her next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia..\" Melanie distracted Julia from her candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ms Melanie Burrows.\" Julia addressed still continuing tearing her candy wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a real shame about your new class. I thought it was a great idea. You really do seemed concerned with the well-being of the girls.\" Melanie complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, much respect for volunteering to teach the class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after making such convincing points, how could I just sit by and do nothing?\" Melanie placed her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea flickered in Julia's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you really want to help, there are ways.\" Julia began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Intrigued, Melanie leaned in closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the school's psychiatrist, you have quite a bit of clout upon the girls.\" Julia teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why indeed I do. I have a very hands on interaction with many girls.\" Melanie informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going good, Julia was leading the school very own psychiatrist into her agenda. If she pulled this off, she'd be able to confront the students about their weights in an inconspicuous manner. She could even reach their parents. Despite Melanie's devotion, Julia didn't want her fattening agenda to be too evident. Like it or not, girls still thought it was good to be thin, Julia was just using the guise of girls being over-pressured to be thin, to start the process. Currently, her vision of girls waddling 300pound bodies down the halls was unacceptable to common ears. But a vision of wellfed girls wouldn't raise too many eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you encourage them to eat different foods rather than just follow boring and unsatisfying diets. Especially foods that they wouldn't normally eat because there were too many calories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would definitely break down some walls.\" Melanie agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could spare the girls from the anguish of addictive exercise by suggesting other activities like going out for ice cream rather than going to the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is brilliant!\" Melanie praised Julia's innovated ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to prove to the girls that gaining weight isn't a bad thing. That seeing the numbers on the scale go up only means that you've eaten good meals and certainly isn't the end of the world.\" Julia coerced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Yes! We could help so many girls doing this.\" rejoiced the psychiatrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia pulled out 2 more candy bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's celebrate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a rail thin woman, it was clear that Melanie didn't partake of such foods. Her apprehension of accepting the candy proved it. However, she couldn't refuse it after praising such ambitions. The sweetness was unfamiliar to Melanie, overwhelming in fact, but yearning to support Julia, the slender psychiatrist forced it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's to new beginnings.\" Julia cheered. </span></div></div>",

Now with a club of her own, Julia's appetite now heavily influenced her inner circle. This meant activities involving food. When she heard Gwen talk about a new burger at a burger joint, Julia suggested they go together. Gwen was more than happy to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia and Gwen were walking to the burger joint, chatting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say this burger is great eh?\" Julia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"munch munch yea its good.\" muffled Gwen chewing on chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were going to eat burgers, Gwen was already eating. In fact, it seemed Gwen was always eating. Whether it was sweet, salty, or something spicy, Gwen at all times was stuffing herself. Now Julia only knew Gwen after she joined the Fat Girls club, so she didn't know what she was like before. Julia took a thorough look at Gwen. Dirty blonde hair kept unkempt, green eyes, full round breasts happily resting around an equally round tummy, thick thighs, and swollen buttocks. Julia estimated her weight at around 175 pounds. Noticing how much this girl ate, Julia foresaw weight gain in Gwen's future, which made her curious about the stuffer's past. Gwen would be much larger if she had eaten like this before, so there must've been a change. Julia had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Gwen, I'm dying to know. How much did you weigh before the Fat Girl club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulp. Believe it or not, I used to be pretty slim.\" Gwen paused her snacking to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do tell.\" a perplexed Julia leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, ever since I was young, my parents pushed me into sports. I had some fun but didn't really care if I played or not. But as I got older the sports became more demanding and as I exerted myself to meet those demands, I developed a hunger to qualm the fatigue. But it seemed that the harder I went, the stronger my hunger grew.\" Gwen stopped to pop some chips in her mouth \"I reached a point were I couldn't keep up with the physical expectations so I cut back on the exercise. However, my hunger still existed and as furious as ever. I couldn't stop eating. I tried cutting back but all that exercise had permanently altered my appetite.\" Gwen paused again to pour the remaining crumbs in her mouth before crinkling up the bag. \"I didn't mind it at first, I mean I loved food so having an insatiable appetite didn't bother me. But when I started to gain weight, people began commenting and judging me. After I had gained ten pounds, I started to exercise again trying to be thin, but I could no longer stand it, it was so exhausting. But I kept torturing myself. But when I heard you were starting a club for fat girls, I instantly decided to join and rid myself of the torments of training. I dropped my exercise routine, quickly packed on the pounds, and easily met the club's weight requirements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so you were an athlete. Are you still interested in sports?\" Julia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Honestly I could care less.\" the candor in Gwen's answer apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia and Gwen arrived at the burger joint, entering the establishment. A strong greasy musk greeted the girls activating their hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNIFF \"Boy that smells good.\" Gwen proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" Julia concurred rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm powerless against this smell.\" Gwen drooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerless eh?\" Julia than pulled out her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing?\" Gwen inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Givin Becky a call. I'm gonna invite her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool.\" replied a supportive Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Becky's having trouble coming to accept herself. Introducing her to irresistible food will totally break her free of social pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.....    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was standing on the scale in nothing but a tank top and panties to minimize the weight, disappointed that she had gained another two pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmmph. Guess I can't be surprised after joining a club literally called 'the Fat Girl club'\" Becky grumbled lifting up her shirt to stare at her belly in discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her phone went off. Becky answered. It was Julia inviting her to eat burgers with Gwen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't know, I'm kind of busy...\" Becky lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of eating burgers with friends appealed to the 162 pound girl, but she yearned to return to her former thin self. Consuming greasy burgers sure wouldn't slim her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's stomach growled. Burgers sounded so good. She was growing hungrier. Becky imagined eating with club members without a care, having fun. Growing with one another. Becky than snapped out of it, reminding herself that she only joined the club because of the benefits. She hated to admit it but she was fat and society looked down on her. She needed allies in this curvophobic society which meant the Fat Girls club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another insistent growl, her nagging stomach coerced Becky into going. Dressing herself in baggy clothes, Becky heading off join Julia and Becky for burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm really close with my group of friends. We all hangout all the time, almost inseparable. One day my buddy David bring a friend a long to our hangout, he says her name is Kelly and she is cool. Cool doesn't begin to describe Kelly, she is a goddess. I pegged her weight at 250lbs at least, mostly up in her knockers. She had a belly to match, and rounded out with a plump butt and nice thick legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately found myself wanting this girl, she was so hot. I made sure David hooked me up and after a few days I took her out on a date. We went out for dinner, a nice Italian place, and then she invited me back to her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at her place she wanted to show me pictures of her from earlier in her life. She dug out a photo album and started showing me pictures of her from middle school. To my surprise she was quite thin back then. I had just assumed she had always been chunky. After the middle school pictures came high school. This is when she really grew into her good looks, beautiful long hair, nice milky completion. It seemed like it was at this point she started to grow that generous chest she was gifted. We then flipped into college pictures. She started college just as thin as high school, but I could tell by the end she had put on a few college pounds. No where near where she was now, but a healthy 140 or so. So she must have gained all this weight recently. She looked to only be a few years out of college if that. After college there were only a few more pictures. \"And I have't been out of college too long, so there isn't much more, there are all from the past year.\" as she turned the pages for more and more photos she was slowly getting bigger. She went from 140 at her graduation to the 250+ now before me today in these pictures. \"Not as many pictures after college as I would have liked, but I guess that happens.\" She closed the album and scampered off to the kitchen. \"Anything to eat?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you.\" I replied. This girl had gotten huge this past year, I was so turned on. She came back around the corner holding a slice of chocolate cake scooping forkfuls into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I just needed a little treat.\" I was so shocked at what was happening in front of me. \"Big girls like me never skip desert.\" I was stunned silent. \"What happened mister talkative, cat got your tongue?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cough* \"No, I, I, I just. Tickle in my throat.\" I stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're funny.\" She said. \"So did you like my photos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very much so.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe how small I was back in school? It's so weird to think about how tiny I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stuck in between a rock and a hard place. How was I supposed to answer that? \"Yeah, school was so long ago.\" I guess that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been out for a year! I think I weighted like 142 when I graduated. Last week I clocked in at 260. Pretty impressive huh?\" Was she really asking me this? \"All the take-out really thickens the waistline. I can only imagine a year from now. Speaking of take-out I could really go for some chicken wings. Want to order some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all set, but please go ahead if you want.\" Right the and there she called in an order for chicken. After Italian for dinner and then that large slice of cake, she was ordering out chicken. This girl meant business, no wonder she was so big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must look like such a pig, ordering out chicken like that, do you think I'm a pig?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I don't want you to think poorly of me, I'm just a hungry girl. Maybe I'll have another slice of cake while I wait for the chicken. Are you sure you don't want one?\" I told her I was still all set and she set off for another slice of cake. In my eyes I could see this girl getting bigger before my eyes. She came back with a slice bigger than her first. \"You should really try a bite of this sometime, this bakery down the street make them, they are to die for. I must pick one up once a week.\" Kelly's shirt looked to be getting tight from all her eating, if it wasn't already tight to start off the night. Her stomach looked to be more puffed out than it was at the start of the night. I couldn't help be feel more arousal as she ate and ate, and told me more about her eating habits. \"You're going to love the delivery guy who drops off the chicken, Darrel, he is so funny, always has a new joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know it will be Darrel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he is the only one who delivers on Fridays. Knows right where my apartment is too, so the food usually arrives pretty quick.\" We sat in silence for a moment, I could kind of feel my own tension filling the room, I think Kelly was smiling at how the conversation was making me feel, but I couldn't be sure. \"Well I'm going to go change into something more comfortable, if the food comes can you answer the door?\" I assured her I would. I didn't know why Kelly needed to change, she had only worn out a v-cut shirt that showed off her lovely rack and some tight jeans. But when she came back she was quite dressed down for a first date. She wore a ill fitting tank top, which had trouble covering her massive chest. She also had on some cotton capri pants that looked quite comfortable. Her large belly could be seen quite well through her light tank top, giving me quite the better view of it. \"That's better.\" She said as she sat back down. \"I had the darnedest time getting those jeans on tonight, I guess I out grew another pair. Too much late night ice cream must be the culprit. But I still can't figure out what caused me to snap my other bra. Now I'm only down to one.\" She said as she held up her massive melons. \"Do you know how hard it is to find adequate support for these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never had to, sorry.\" I joked as I still didn't know how to approach her conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These massive things cost me a ton in custom fittings. It doesn't help either that as soon as my new bra's come in I've outgrown them. Such is life I guess. I can't complain too much about them though, they are quite the show stopper.\" She could stop holding or jiggling her boobs in my direction. She didn't know how much of a hard on I was getting. \"At least I'm well endowed, my friend, Cathy, big as a house and no tits to show for it. The lord at least gave me good proportions. Enough about me tell me more about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" I stammered. I sat there and thought about what to say about myself.   </span></div></div>",

Like many other towns, diets and misguided health advice plagued the women, insisting that they be skinny at the cost of their happiness. However one woman was about to stand up against this corruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie Winters was sitting in the doctor's office having her regular checkup. \"Hmm let's see, Julie Winters.. Caucasian, Blonde hair, 5ft 5in, 157pounds. Yes you are perfectly healthy except for your weight.\" \"What's wrong with my weight?\" Julie curiously inquired. \"You've gained 30 pounds.\" stated the doctor. \"Well I am a mother of two.\" rebutted Julie. \"It's too high.\" replied the doctor. \"So, I feel better than ever.\" Julie replied. \"No you're not you're only lying to yourself. Being overweight is very dangerous to women like you. You need to diet.\" stated the doctor handing Julie a sheet of instructions.  \"Whats this!? No sweets! This is crazy I have no problems! I'm not dieting.\" Julie barked. \"Mrs Winters you're unhealthy its all the dangerous fat that's making you think this way.\" yelled the doctor as Julie stormed out the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie got in her car still livid from her little venture. \"The nerve of that quack telling me i'm unhappy. I've literally  never felt better.\" Julie thought back to her earlier youth were she deprived herself to be thin. Missing out on tasty foods, being self-conscious on her looks, looking withered and feeling bad. \"Being thin sucked as a fat girl I get to eat delicious foods, live carefree, not having to bust my butt off at the gym when I could play with my kids. And who says fat is unattractive my boobs are huge, my ass is plump, my thighs are voluptuous and I don't care what you say my belly is cute. My husband sure can't get enough of my curves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie ranted she pulled into a fastfood drive thru and angrily ordered a huge amount of food. If there was one thing that could sooth her fury it'd be lots of greasy food. The unset woman swiftly pulled over to eat. Julie scarfed down fries, crammed burgers in her mouth, guzzled shakes, devoured chicken fingers, and inhaled onion rings. Upon finishing, Julie felt heavy and full, yet happily content. Letting out a sigh, Julie caressed her stuffed belly. \"That hit the spot! Those doctors and dietitians don't know what they're talking about.

You seem to be cooking more than usual.\"  asked her husband, Craig, walking through the kitchen. \"Nope but I do have an important announcement to make.\" answered Julie continuing to concoct the massive meal. \"Well I'll leave you to it then.\" said her husband going off to the other room were the kids were playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a half hour, Julie called out to her family \"Dinner time!\" The kids rushed to the table followed by their father. Everything seemed normal, their servings were the same as always.  Craig wondered what happened to the huge meal his wife was cooking. Then they looked at Julie's place. To their shock Julie had a huge pile of food in front of her. \"Honey what are you doing?\" questioned her husband. \"Family I have an announcement. I'm going to get fat. Really really fat.\" Julie proudly announced. \"Honey why? Wait what happened at the doctor today?\" Craig asked. \"He said I was healthy and had no problems but that I had to lose weight.\" Julie informed. \"Well why would he tell you to lose weight if you're healthy? If anything you're better with the extra weight.\" Craig said giving his honest opinion. \"Yes! I feel way better fat than I ever did thin.\" Julie said popping food in her mouth. \"It's the diet industry they're taking advantage of women. And I'm gonna stop them.\" Julie declared still cramming food in her mouth. \"I support you dear, afterall I always thought you looked cute fat.\" Craig confessed walking behind Julie and hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Katie is surprising her family. \"Katie I've never seen you eat so much.\" stated Katie's husband. \"Nom nom yep I'm giving up on these stupid diets and giving up being thin.\" Katie mumbled through a stuffed mouth. \"But you were always obsessed with a slim waist and being healthy.\" her husband expressed his confusion. \"Julie came by today and showed me that women are better off being fat.\" Katie told her husband of her enlightenment. \"That's terrific! I've been hoping you'd drop your health obsession and gain weight.\" admitted the husband pushing more food towards his gorging wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Julie who has just finished her huge meal. \"Ahhh that was good.\" she said caressing her swollen gut. \"Yeah mommy's getting fat.\" shouted her daughter. Her son saw Julie rub her belly and provoked him to ask \"Mommy can I see your tummy?\" \"Sure sweety.\" Julie said taking off her shirt and showing her bare belly hanging over her crotch. \"Wowwww\" both her kids said simultaneously. \"And it's gonna get even bigger.\" Julie said. \"Ooooh\" the kids oohed in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie experienced so much support from her family for getting fat that her confidence skyrocketed. In public, Julie wore skimpy outfits, proudly wore bikinis at the pool, and at home was very amorous with her husband. Her enthusiaism grew, furthering her devotion to spread her fat women movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Julie was encouraging female obesity at...</span></div></div>",

Walking throughout the town, Julie flaunted her expanding body, dressed in very short jeans shorts with her exposed plump cellulite laden buttocks jiggling with each step. Wearing a taut tank top that rode up liberating her hanging belly while her big titties spilled out. Bereft of sleeves, her flabby arms jiggled for all to see. Everywhere she went people starred at her audacity. \"Look at her.\" \"She's so brave.\" women uttered. Julie noticed and responded by waving and smiling \"Be proud of your curves.\" she shouted to the glancing ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was lunch time and Julie was going all out. She parked her car in a fastfood restaurant. She was eating in to give a demonstration of female confidence. Julie entered, her thick legs wobbling as she stepped. There was a thin self conscious woman ahead of her. \"Um I'll just take a small, with a salad ,and a diet soda.\" the slender woman ordered. Julie chuckled as she stepped up to give her order. \"Watch this\" she quickly said to the skinny woman. \"I'll take 10 burgers, seven large fries, onion rings, chicken fingers, and several large milkshakes.\" The woman at the cash register was shocked and also impressed while the skinny woman was stunned. Julie gave a confident grin at her. \"Why did you order all that? You already fat and gonna get fatter.\" said the thin woman. \"And what's wrong with that?\" retorted Julie. \"W-well fats bad.\" answered the stick woman. \"What makes you so sure, the fatter I get the better I feel.\" Julie rebutted. \"But the media says fat women are unattractive.\" \"What do they know? I think I look gorgeous. And you wouldn't believe how many guys stare at me and compliment my fat body.\" Julie informed. \"Do you really feel good?\" asked the skinny woman. \"Do you?\" replied Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orders were ready, Julie's dwarfs the frail woman's who was thinking to herself that she doesn't feel all that good nor does she particularly like seeing her flat curveless body in the mirror. Julie's influence made the woman cave in \"Excuse me can I get another order.\" She ordered a much larger meal. Other women had watched what had transpired and repeated Julie's actions. \"I want a large!\" \"Give me several orders!\" were phrases shouted amongst the skinny women. There were even some fat ladies there who got a boost in their confidence. \"Yeah I'm fat and I love it.\" \"Finally, we can stop pretending to hate our wonderful fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julie scarfed down her order, the scrawny woman from earlier approached her holding a full tray. \"Now that's more like it!\" Julie exclaimed. \"Mind if I sit here?\" asked the underweight lady. \"Have a seat just try and keep up.\" Julie welcomed. Thanks to Julie the fastfood joint was filled with gorging ladies no longer ashamed of their gluttonous nature.</span></div></div>",

Having to modestly eat small unsatisfying meals in guilt became a thing of the past. Now women were unchained by dietary tyranny and ate hearty proportions in a supportive environment. A woman could stuff herself to the brim in public and face no criticism even when she unbuttoned her taut pants. Furthering Julie's confidence was that no of the women experienced health issues as they gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that week, Julie took her kids to the pool, accompanied by Katie, who has really piled on the pounds. Julie herself was rocking a 185 pound body, much more plumper and flabby since her life changing doctor visit. \"Are you ready Katie?\" Julie suggestively asked. \"Sure am.\" Katie answered picking up a cooler as the kids run to the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite liberating women from the taxing strains of diets, some ladies still possessed apprehension of exposing their flesh. Julie, accompanied by Katie aimed to remedy that. Wearing tiny bikinis, Julie and Katie proudly sauntered across the grounds. Their thick thighs wobbled, their hanging bellies bounced, their huge breasts jiggled nearly spilling out of the flimsy tops, flab sagged from their upper arms, rolls cascaded down their backs, and ripples quaked throughout their buttocks. No one could resist staring at the audacious bbws. Women looked onwards in envy as men gazed in lust especially the teenage boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids jumped in the pool as the women set up a place for their towels and cooler. Katie opened up the cooler and pulled out popsicles. Julie and Katie began licking their treats. Whenever people walked by they would catch a glance at the fatties who in response smiled and waved. This stirred up the fat girls' spirits. Girls who were wearing shirts took them off, displaying their fat guts, sarongs were tossed aside and meaty asses were exposed. Fat women started complimenting one another, even comparing each other. The skinny women who had once reigned supremely were now looking plain.</span></div></div>",

She always had to diet strictly and now she had an opportunity to freely eat and relax. It was 3:00pm and normally Sara would walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes but not today. Sara got in the car and went to the nearest fastfood restaurant. Sara ordered a huge meal she never would have dreamed of eating before today. Sara pickedup the giant loaded burger oozing sauce and thought to herself \"Am I really gonna do this?\" then she thought of her husband leaving her for a fatty and aggressively ate the burger and then the rest of her meal.

No longer did she have to limit herself to one donut she'd eat as many as she'd want. No longer would she have to be so strict with her diet she could whatever she'd want, whenever she'd want, and however much she'd want. She could catch up with her T.V. shows, establish a presence in the social network, and eat an entire pizza, all while only having to worry about picking up her kids from school and whether she was fattening up sufficiently for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new laid-back lifestyle, Sara did find herself to be a bit larger and rounder than usual. Constant snacking left Sara's belly in a bloated state more often than not, and those instances in which it was at its natural size revealed a newly acquired layer of fat bulging forth from its formerly toned self. It was getting quite difficult for Sara to put on her jeans, so sweat pants were her primary form of leg-wear. Having a preference for long shirts, Sara found that they were gradually cutting off higher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week of this diet eventually got Sara on a scale. Before her decision to remove all dietary inhibitions, Sara was about 5'8\" and 130 pounds. She was still 5'8\", but the scale revealed her to have gained eight pounds.

It did not take him much effort to notice that his wife's behavior had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara seemed to have reduced her exercise routine to her yoga class and chasing around the kids. That, combined with a diet consisting of larger portions of fattier food and constant snacking, was starting to show on her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had a secret preference towards women on the meatier side of the spectrum. He loved his wife dearly, and did find her beautiful, but he would be lying if he said that he didn't want her to get fat. He didn't want to force that on her, so he satisfied his desire with the Internet. He felt guilty about it, though, so he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, Sara seemed to be going out of her way to gain weight, always stuffing herself at the dinner table and never attempting to work it off. Her clothes seemed to be shrinking on her frame, growing tighter with every passing day, until, eventually, they fit her no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one such day when Jack finally mustered the courage to ask Sara about her weight. Red hair unkempt with bedhead, Sara stood in the closet, trying to button a pair of black jeans around her waist. Impeding her ability to accomplish this task was a layer of fat, bulging forth and keeping the button from the loop. Sara was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, think you should try a different pair, Sara,\" Jack stammered, hiding his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara turned to face Jack, her smile growing wider. \"Yeah, you're right.

I knew she was searching my history that day.</i> \"B-B-But, Sara'what about your class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara immediately dropped into a forearm stand. \"I just need to adjust my center of balance.\" She stood up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swallowed again, taking deep but quiet breaths. \"Do you' do you really want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara walked over to Jack, sitting beside her husband. \"It has its benefits.

Her daughter had returned to the table with a plate about half as full as her mother's. \"Have as much as you would like, that's why they call it 'all you can eat'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter seemed hesitant. \"Mom, it's just I'm trying to watch what I eat. I don't want to have too much.\" She replied sheepishly. It was at this point that you dropped off their two very large sodas. Your establishment didn't scrimp when it came to serving sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense.\" You could her the mother saying as you walked away, but still within ear shot. \"You're a young growing girl, you should be filling your plate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter clearly knew just how overly obese she was, but her mother's opinion seemed hard to change. \"Mom, the only way I'm growing is fatter. And it's places like this that are contributing to that. You know I have a hard time controlling my appitite, I don't know why you insist on bringing me places like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarabelle, I don't know how many times I've told you, you don't have an eating problem. You're a healthy young woman. I insist on bringing you here to show you that you have nothing to worry about. Now eat up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarabelle reluctantly started in on her plate, but as she ate it was evident that she couldn't help but enjoy herself. You knew the food here was good, which was why customer routinely over did themselves here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her first small plate was gone, she headed up for another, which was noticeably more packed than before. Her mother gave her a smile that she ignored, and just started to eat what was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was really eating with ferocity. Half way through the plate she felt compelled to remove her jeans jacket which hid most of her upper half, now leaving it covered only by a tight white tank top. Now the whole world could see just how chunky her arms were, and how well balanced her chest was compared to her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished off her second plate her mother was just getting started with hers. \"Going to have one more dear?\" Her mother asked, knowing the pace that her daughter was going at that she still had plenty of room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a response, Clarabelle just heaved herself up from the table, using the arms of her chair for support. You were bringing a refill on the sodas over as Clarabelle had started to head off for the buffet once more. You were privy to the display of her ass as it jiggled away from you, one tightly packed ass cheek squeezed to make room for the other. Also now without her jacket on, you could see how much of a muffin top her tight leggings created, with quite the round pair of love handles sticking out on each side of her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of a sudden a plate plopped down hard on the table. Clarabelle had returned, and brought quite a load of food with her. Slowly lowering herself into her seat, making sure she didn't clip one of the arms of her chair with her wide hips. Meanwhile her hearty mother glanced at what delights her daughter had returned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate rivaled her mother's normal portions, even casting a shadow on her previous two plates. The plate had been meticulously constructed for maximum capacity. Mashed potatoes glued down a foundation of fried chicken, all of which was covered in a thick gravy. A couple other meats lay carved atop the heap, and all the nooks and crannies had been filled in with corn that shimmered from all the butter it had absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fork in hand, Clarabelle started in on her third and biggest plate of the night. Her mother said nothing, and just enjoyed her own filling meal from the other side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarabelle ate like she was the only one in the restaurant, focusing solely on her food. She was almost in a trance. For someone so reluctant at first, she sure had an appitite. It was easy to see what had lead to such an expansion such as hers. At this point her mother only acted as a reflection of who she would soon become, and most likely surpass in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her plate emptying, she didn't even notice when her mother left to go restock. You don't think she even notices you as you bring over another large cup of soda to replace hers when it inevitibly runs dry. The one thing that does seem to get her out of her trance though is an empty plate. Scooping the last of the gravy mixed potatoes up with a fork, Clarabelle took a moment to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back a bit, balancing out her hunched over nature during her meal. Rubbing her bloated gut, she could only be internally thinking about what a mistake it was to come here, and how all the calories will only keep increasing her waistline. Her stomach felt tauter then when she arrived, but she wasn't completely full. Full enough though that she didn't want to heave herself up to go back in line for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky, or maybe unlucky for her, her mother was on her way back with two full plates. Clarabelle didn't notice her mother's return until she was coming around the backside of the table to her seat. Then all of a sudden she placed a plate down in front of her more than satisfied daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go sweetie, I decided to get you a little something while I was up. I knew you couldn't be full yet.\" Clarabelle shot a dagger filled look at her mother, as they both knew what was going on here. But just a moment later Clarabelle pushed those feelings aside as she knew she couldn't resist the tempting plate in front of her. Although her stomach was satisfied, her appitite was not, and as long as she still had room she would continue to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she stuck a fork in the cheese covered noodles, excited for the flavor that was about to be in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Good thing this place was all you could eat, or she would have racked up quite the bill. Clarabelle sat in her chair, feeling shameful of everything she had eaten. Her stomach pushed further than ever into her lap and had started to lose a battle with the bottom hem of her tank top. The separation from her tight black leggings, revealed an expanding sliver of the soft pale white skin that lie underneath. Clarabelle felt like such a glutton, but still she could not stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why her heart sank as she looked back towards the bustling buffet, only to see her mother waddling back to the table carrying two plates of dessert. She noticed how big her own mother's stomach had gotten, and the tension is was putting on the middle of her sun dress. This caused her knockers to be even more revealed, jiggling with each footfall. She wore a big smile, and she approached her daughter, who could only cringe as the two sweet filled plates landed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarabelle had had enough. \"Mom!\" She whined. \"What are you doing to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll have none of that.\" Her mother retorted. \"We've had a lovely dinner, and no dinner would be complete without a little dessert.\" Little was an understatement. The two plates had just about every dessert the establishment offered. Slices of cakes, several brownies, various cookies and puddings, along with slices of each flavored pie and assorted pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, I've had four plates of food, I don't need anymore.\" Clarabelle didn't want to roll over as easily as she normally would, even though she had to admit the desserts we're looking pretty good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four plates is nothing. Don't you remember Christmas? You ate plenty more than this. But I guess if you're so full, then you won't be temped by any of this.\" She gestured to the sugar bombs in front of her. \"We will just wait her for our check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the waiting didn't last very long. Clarabelle started to squirm in her seat, unable to take her eyes off the bevy of desserts. Very quickly her resolve broke and she grabbed a brownie and shoved it in her mouth. The smile returned to her mother's face, as she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" The matriarch called out, getting your attention. \"Can my daughter get a large vanilla milkshake to wash all this down with?\" You nodded but before you could leave she continued. \"And how about a chocolate one for me?\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You replied before heading to the milkshake station behind the counter.</span></div></div>",

At the end she had two eclairs and a cannoli left. Feeling completely full, she bit off half of one of the eclairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the table her mother was signing the credit card receipt that you had dropped off. \"Just a few more bites honey and we can head home.\" The words sounded encouraging, but to Clarabelle they felt antagonizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Clarabelle was fully leaned back in her seat, giving her belly as much room to breathe as possible. The battle of the bulge was very much lost. Her tank top was riding up by inches as her stomach only continued to swell as she filled it. It had even gotten so big it had pushed down the waistband of her leggings. There was no hiding her pale white belly now. She continued to rub it, trying to make room for these few last treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the rest of the eclairs past her lips she was one step closer to finishing. Fetching the cannoli in her hand as her mouth continued to finish the eclairs, she was ready for this night to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarabelle had been pushing herself to the limit more and more recently. If it wasn't an all you can eat place like this, it was usually at home, where the pantry over run with bad decision. She had also started to use family holidays as an excuse to let her appitite wild and stuff herself so much she could barely move, much like she had recently done at Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving picked up this habit last year during the holidays, she had proceeded to pack on some serious weight in the past year. Having graduated high school, feeling almost direction less, eating was at least something she could distract herself with. But now with hips that grazed both sides of her chair, a stomach that spilled into her lap while sitting, and a chest that felt a double F sized water bed, she knew her eating was out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flakey cannoli with it's signature creamy middle was nothing but a sinful reminder of her behavior. As much as she wanted to fight it, she felt compelled to give in, and with one last plop the cannoli disappeared between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne eclair left. And while she held it, for some reason she felt a sense of pride that she had finished this massive meal. She was one eclair away from what could be perceived as a victory. She took a big bite, and from the other end shot a dollop of cream, right on to her belly. Not letting a calorie go undevoured, she scooped up that cream with her finger and right in her mouth it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few bites later it was done. She had finally finished, and she was officially stuffed. Needing some assistance from her mother, she slowly rose for her seat. Her belly came to a rest once she was standing. Since it had pushed past her leggings earlier, it now hung over her waistband, and a bit out in front of her due to how full it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother grabbed her jacked, as they both slowly made their way to the door. Clarabelle clutched her full stomach with both arms, trying not to jostle it as much as possible. The older of the pair waved goodbye to all the staff she had come to know, and said a hearty goodbye to you as they passed. Clarabelle just ignored everything going on around her and focused on putting one foot in front of the other, while stifling her groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again!\" The hostess said as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you next week!\" Clarabelle's mother replied gleefully.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re poor? All you can eat for eight dollars a person. You\u2019re rich? All you can eat for <i>dirt friggin\u2019 cheap</i>, saving some of that money so you can\u2026 roll around in it. Whatever rich people do. Invest. You\u2019re somewhere in the middle, with just enough money to afford the luxury of gas? You can see where I\u2019m going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are all-you-can-eat restaurants within a stone\u2019s throw of just about everywhere stateside. From luxurious corrals of gold to simple buffets in your home town, anyone whose anyone can waltz in and grab whatever they want. So long as it\u2019s on the serving line, and doesn\u2019t interfere with the strict schedule of \u201clunch-slash-dinner.\u201d Because apparently you can\u2019t eat those cute little hamburger sliders after eight\u2019o\u2019clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular buffet manages to stay pretty crowded this time of day, having become pretty much a staple in the lives of its patrons. Whether it be because of the good food, the quaint atmosphere, or even just the familiarity, there are people here who wouldn\u2019t dream of eating anywhere else on a Tuesday afternoon\u2026<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026</div><br>\r\n\u201cWaitress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby hand sausaged into a fingerless red-and-black glove is raised high into the air off in the corner of section 3, the thick arm it\u2019s attached to threatening to tear the seams on her newest purchase from Hot Topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an arm belongs to Cassidy Wilkes, a particularly young and particularly plump patron of this simple establishment. She was still in high school and had attended this place a few times with her parents. Apparently this was the first place she headed to once she got her driver\u2019s license some months ago. She had always been pretty big, but it was getting hard to deny that young Cass was developing a dangerous love affair with food\u2014Buffet becoming her mistress as the stress of highschool life became her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sandwiched into the booth, her globular gullet pressed deeply into the table before her. One large role sat atop the polished wooden surface while the other managed to make due underneath. The creamy corpulence was completely visible underneath her too-tight tee, having apparently untucked her lowermost belly-roll from the confines of her not-so-skinny jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you wouldn\u2019t have to do this every time if you\u2019d just sit your fat ass at a table.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated across from her was Sabrina Miles, a buxom blonde with a bit of a belly. She had been here a few times with Cass, the two seemed to be good friends. Though lately the frequency of her attendance had improved, and her BMI was probably shooting up right beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Sabrina.\u201d Cassidy snipped as she whipped back around to her friend, an action that caused her black hair and double chin to sway fluidly, \u201cI like the booth. It\u2019s not my fault that they don\u2019t have anything bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiight\u2026\u201d Sabrina said with a slurp on her straw, watching her friend struggle with the difficulties her size had brought upon her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAITRESS!!\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, are you <i>sure</i> that something doesn\u2019t feel different somehow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie listen, I know you don\u2019t like change\u2026\u201d began the smooth customer Jamie Gardiner in his latest attempts to dissuade his girlfriend from suffering a nervous breakdown because of three highschoolers stealing their seat, \u201cBut maybe you\u2019ll <i>like</i> sitting so close to the dessert section?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from the silky-smooth latino, his latest in the long line of girlfriends (also longest) sat on the edge of her seat. She was completely unsatisfied with the simple change of atmosphere that was brought upon by <i>daring</i> to switch to another seat. With one hand clenched onto her thick forearm, Madeline Hilton bit her lip in an anxious way\u2014this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, honey,\u201d Jamie said with outstretched hands, \u201cYou thought you wouldn\u2019t like this place, remember?

I think you can handle not getting a window seat because some <i>gorditas</i> stole our usual spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have carrot cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, my favorite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sammie.\u201d Said one girl to the other as they sat in the booth, \u201cYou want this slice of cake?

Charlotte and Sammie were more or less like family around here, the two having popped in and out of this place since they were little tots. Charlotte had always been the bigger of the two, but during some unforeseen change of circumstance Sammie had really grown into her role as the \u201cbig sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was astounding. Seeing Sam, only slightly more voluptuous than any other girl, suddenly balloon into a full-fledged fattie so quickly and so abruptly. But with the way she ate, the mystery had apparently been solved\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why\u2019d you get it?\u201d Sammie asked innocently, her suspicions obviously unable to hinder her hunger as thick doughy arms reached across the table to pilfer her sister\u2019s pastry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as, not-so-subtly, Charlotte eyed the accumulated girth that her sister sported. A sly smile crossed her painted lips, only to be retracted just as smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I guess my eyes are just bigger than my stomach\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRully.\u201d Sam said as hers rolled into the back of her head, savoring the cake as audibly as possible, \u201cShucks fer you.\u201d She gnashed through cake, dabbing at her full lips with her chubby fingers, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll just have to enjoy this cake because my not-so-little sister\u2019s on a <i>diet</i>.\u201d she said mockingly as she dropped another forkful of cake in her mouth, \u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right\u2026 <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">you laugh it up, tubby</font>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nothing!\u201d Charlotte said, her attention darting back to her rice and veggies, \u201cNothing at all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, order up!\u201d cried the cook from the kitchen, \u201cWe got a Lunch Combo #5 in Section 3!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it!\u201d shouted our lovely heroine, taking the plate on her outstretched palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019t forget the barbecue sauce\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her best friend Deb is over Pat's place like she normally is. The two of them are just hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb sits on the couch with a laptop flipping through the internet. Pat resides in the kitchen wiping up a snack for the two of them. Suddenly Pat hears Deb call her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pat, come here. Quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats's up?\" Pat says as she enter the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's a picture of me from my vacation in Cancun. Where did you get it? The only place I have it is on Facebook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend sent it too me. They saw it online and thought it might be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would he have gotten it from?\" Pat says as she heads back to the kitchen to finish up and grab the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said it had been floating around some of the message boards and group he goes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww creepy.\" Pat says as she walks back into the living room with her tray of snacks. \"It's weird thinking about my pictures getting out there and strangers looking at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even want to know the kinda sites he visits either.\" Deb added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well now you have to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he is kind of into bigger girls, so he is always on appreciation sites looking up pictutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So people were looking at my picture because they like that I'm not skinny? That's a first.\" Pat wasn't fat but she wasn't skinny either. She was very pretty, but always shy about her looks because she had such a hard time with her weight. She was always slightly bigger than she wanted to be. It didn't help that she loved food and enjoyed sweets from time to time. \"We need to get that photo taken down though. I don't want strangers looking at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you're going to be able to get it taken down. He says it has popped up on a lot of sites. He also said it's getting a lot of positive feedback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Pat was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, people want to know who you are and where to get more pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More? I don't even want the one out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see what kind of oppertunity you have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What that nerds want to peer into my personal life because I'm a little out of shape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... well yes, but if they want more you can charge for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like make money buy selling my old photos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My friend does it all the time. He pays like $20 bucks a month to visit these site that do updates on them selves.\" Pat and Deb check it out and go to some of the site that her friend visits and looks at some of the posts where Pat's picture was posted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls are so fat! Why are guys even interested in me?\" Pat said in a confused manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you put on a few more you could make some real dollar bills\" Deb said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter?!? Hell no. No way am I going to end up like these whales on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't you just image the money you could make. $20 bucks a pop from these guys every month. If you just get 100 views your up $2000 bucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's more than I make now working full time. But still this doesn't seem right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on just give it a try. We will put up some more of these pictures of you and see what kind of a response we can get.\"</span></div></div>",

Deb downloaded a bunch of hot photos of Pat from her Facebook and started posting them on these message boards. The response it got was phenomenal. All the guys were eating it up and asking for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Deb ran out of photo's from Facebook, but the crowds were demanding more. She decided to start snapping shots during their hang out sessions. Even better was that Pat had packed on a few since her old Facebook pictures had been taken so the fans loved the added girth. Pat started to get suspicious when Deb started taking more and more pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb why are you always taking so many pictures lately?\" She asked her friend as Deb was preparing a snack for them. Deb was also trying to plumpin Pat up so the guys would love her even more. Pat had a knack for sweets and she used that against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to remember all these good times down the road?\" Deb retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course, but you have that camera in your hand 24/7. And you're only taking pictures of me. Shouldn't you be in them too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, everyone remembers the camera man.\" Deb said as she placed the snack down in front of Pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have that saying backwards, hon.\" Pat tried to speak some sense into her friend. \"Also Deb I think we need to cut back on the snack during these meet ups, I've been packing on some pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? How many pounds would you say?\" Deb very blatantly prying for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb what's going on with you? You're acting so weird.\" Pat said as she snacked away mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyways, to change topics, I was thinking about that photo you had mentioned last month, remember?\" Pat asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Did you change your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, of course not. I was just wondering if it was still floating around, or if it had died like it should. I should check, just in case.\" Pat started to get out her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! No I'm sure it's gone.\" Deb stuttered. She didn't want Pat seeing all the new photo's Deb had been posting of her. \"No need to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deb it will only take me but a minute. Why don't you go heat up some more pizza rolls while I check, these are all gone already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I check while you...\" Deb's heart was pounding as Pat was getting ever so closer to finding out what she had been up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat was just still clicking and typing as Deb looked on in horror. \"What! Deb look at this! There are more. So many more. And this, this one was taken here, by you. But how?\" Pat was almost at a loss for words. \"How could that... You! You did this? How could you?\" Pat was staring intently at Deb now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Deb stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I didn't want any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but... they like you. I mean they really like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Pat seemed to be calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See look at the comments. They want more. They are willing to pay.\" Deb tried to use the proof to pursaude her this time. \"I know you didn't want to give it a chance, but I wanted to prove to you that these guys were legit and are willing to pay to see more. The proof is right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said I could leave my crappy job if I went for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With popularity like this, you will be earning double. All you have to do is say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what can go wrong.\" Pat is swayed by the overflowing proof that this is a money making idea. </span></div></div>",

My friend is pretty good at these kind of things, so maybe if we give him free unlimited access he'll do it for free.\" Deb started typing away, getting things ready for Pat. \"Now we're gonna need a stage name, I don't think 'Pat' sounds too sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with 'Pat' it's a very feminine... aww who am I kidding, sounds like a tom boy name. But how am I supposed to come up with a stage name, what do these girls even call them selves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well some people have taken to calling you Ruby Red because of your lipstick from your first picture. So how about Ruby Red Rosie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's actually not half bad. Kinda seductive. Holy cow this is so exciting, I'm going to be able to leave a job a hate, and just take money from the smucks online, just from taking some pictures.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was decided that Ruby Red Rosie, Rosie for short, would work as Pat's stage name online. Deb went ahead and register the domain, and kept on getting thing set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat mean while had grabbed the phone and started dialing someone. It was only a moment later that Deb looked over and saw her on the phone. \"Who are you calling?\" Deb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat raised a finger to quiet her as she began to talk into the phone. \"Hi is Mr. Johnson there please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are not!\" Deb looked at her friend in terror. \"You can't...\" Pat cut her friend off and continued on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dick.\" Pat said into the phone in a stern voice. \"Got some bad news. I quit!\" And with that she hung up. Pat looked over at Deb shining a big smile. Deb's face still Pat a look of horror on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just quit being Pat, and became Ruby Red Rosie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pat you can't quit, we haven't even started yet. It's not like you are going to be modeling 24/7. You still need to work. We haven't even made any money yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the money is gonna come rolling in once we get the website set up right? I don't have to go to work any more, I thought that was the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's done is done, let's just focus on getting this finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we also get these pizza rolls finished cooking, I'm hungry.\" Deb knew there was a long journey ahead of them. </span></div></div>",

But he thought why not have a little fun with them, at the end of the day it will at least be fun to watch them fatten up.</span></div></div>",

It was the start to summer and he couldn't think of a more enjoyable adventure than this. She said yes and they were meeting for dinner tonight. He was taking her out to a steak roadhouse, a favorite of his. April was in her mid twenties and quite the cutie. She was quite thin, had cute button nose, and a slight curve to her figure. Dylan was so excited that she said yes, he even arrived to the restaurant super early. April came promptly on time and the two had a wonderful dinner. Dylan had an order of ribs and April had grilled chicken. They both laughed and told stories about themselves all night. When they left Dylan asked if they could go out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April I'd love to take you out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan I had such a good time, and I'd love to go out again, but I just found out my grandmother is in need of care and I need to go live with her all summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no is she ok?\" Dylan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is fine, but just needs help with shopping and getting everything done. How about if you are still interested we can go out the day I get back. Give me a call at the end of the summer.\" April wrote down her number for Dylan and gave him kiss goodnight.</span></div></div>",

It had sent him a notifcation that the summer was ending and he needed to call April. He rang her and was a little surprised when she picked up after so many rings. \"April, it's Dylan, how was your summer?\" The two said their greetings and what not, and then finally Dylan asked April out for another dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" She replied. \"You know what I'd actually love to go back to that steakhouse where we went before, I'm totally craving some delicious ribs or something. How about tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan was caught a little off guard how direct April was being but he wanted to see her pretty bad so he was willing to make the date for tonight. That day he prepared himself and was promptly at the restaurant at 7. They were quickly sat at a table and started to gab about their summers. Dylan was very interested to hear about April's trip to grandmas. April had seemed to come back home with a slightly different outlook on life, and Dylan was curious to learn more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both ordered drinks, April ordering a soda which was different from the water she had gotten last time. April heavily sipped her beverage when it arrived, nearly downing the whole thing in a minute. Dylan couldn't help but notice April's fuller chest sitting across from him. Three months ago she was quite the slim girl with only an average cup size. Dylan was shocked to see that April was now sporting giant melons, he couldn't even fathom what sort of bra size she must need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So living with grandma was pretty great. She is an old school southern woman who loves to cook. We had home cooked meals for breakfast lunch and dinner. Cooking was like an art for her, it just brought her so much joy. I spent most time helping her clean and doing anything she was too old to do.\" April went on about her days with her grandmother, while Dylan tried to picture the whole thing in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe envisioned April waking up to a home cooked southern breakfast of eggs, biscuits, sausage, and what ever else could be cooked in the house. Then a similar treatment for lunch and dinner. No wonder her chest had gotten so hefty. After about a month of eating so well she must have needed a new bra to support her growing girls. And now they are just gigantic.</span></div></div>",

She was accustom to these smells since her mother so often cooked and brewed tasty concoctions in the family's kitchen. On this evening her mother had made the family mouth watering Angus beef burgers and home made potato wedges, both with all the fixings. Tiff's father and brother were already eagerly sitting at the dining room table just adjacent to the kitchen. Tiff to her normal seat at the table with the family. As they all took their meals from the communal plate, Tiffany hesitated. Tiffany was on the larger side for her age. She was a senior in high school and was about 60 pounds overweight. It was mainly due to her family food habits, they didn't eat very health consciously. The rest of her family was over weight too, but on this particular day it had gotten to Tiff that she was fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier that day, Tiff had been at the mall. She was trying to get new clothes since all of hers were getting tight. She found herself needing to go up two sizes due to her new girth. This did not please her. The friends she was with tried to make her feel better, but by the time they all left she was still feeling quite fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany took a burger and some fries, she was hungry after all. When it came time for second Tiffany declined while everyone else dug in for more. It was at this point that her mother saw the tint in her daughters eye and knew something was up. After everyone was finished her mother cleared the table and sent the boys into the living room so she could chat with her daughter.</span></div></div>",

You know, a little mother daughter time. Besides I made your favorite for desert, chocolate creme pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I shouldn't. I'm still full from dinner.\" Tiff lied. Tiff couldn't resist her mother's sweets. It's one of the reasons she was so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then maybe just a small slice.\" Tiff's mom took the pie to the table and cut a small slice for her daughter. \"Some thing seems of darling, is everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine\" she deflected. After a few seconds and a bite of pie \"it's just, I've gotten so fat recently. I'm huge compared to my friends. I just want to be skinny like they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to be so skinny?\" Her mother asked as she snuck another slice on her daughters plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes never fit, and and, just because being skinny is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think being skinny is better. Seems to me that it depends on how you look at it.\" Tiffany's mom was also large like she was. She was actually the largest in the family. \"When your skinny you have to watch what you eat and exercise all the time. I'd rather eat what I wanted and do things I actually enjoy. If the only issue is clothes being a little tight, if say you have it much better than your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" Tiff now adding another slice to her plate, more like her normal behavior than how she was acting before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go to the mall tomorrow and I buy you all the new clothes you want, that way when you go back to school in a week you are going to be the most fashionable girl in those halls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mom? That would be so nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time dear. I just want you to be happy.\" After that Tiffany continued to finish off her pie until there was only the tin left. She thanked her mom for the chat and decided to head up stairs for the night. Her mother tired to send her up with another pie but some how Tiff resisted the tempting offer, she was fat but didn't want to be the size of a barn like her mother wanted. \"I'll just leave it in the fridge in case you change your mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany lounged in her room for the rest of the night, thinking about her weight issues here and there. The other thing on her mind was that pie waiting for her in the fridge. After awhile her belly started feeling hungry. She didn't want to have another calorie filled pie but she knew how good it would taste. She waited until everyone had gone to bed. She took one more second to decide until she gave into her hunger and stated to creep downstairs. Tiffany opened the fridge and retrieved the pie and took it to her room. She scarfed the whole thing down and then proceeded to lie on her bed and hold her now fully belly. It didn't take her long to fall asleep. And she didn't wake up until morning.</span></div></div>",

All Tiffany wanted was to fit in, and she was unsure that being so big was going to help her achieve that. What Tiffany didn't know was that her friends didn't care what her weight was, they loved her for who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was on a school vacation for a week and her mom thought this would be a great opportunity for her daughter to come into her weight and really accept who she was. She got right to work in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tiffany was waking up in her room up stairs. She had a smudge of chocolate pudding in the corner of her mouth from her midnight snack last night. She licked it with her tongue as she sat up in bed. Tiffany was an attractive young girl. Her extra 60 lbs gave her body a nice curve. She had a hard time seeing it that way even though her mother and her friends always told her how pretty she was. It was the first day of vacation so Tiffany put on some comfy clothes and headed down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had made some breakfast and it had just finished cooking. The smell was wondrous. Tiffany loved her mothers cooking and was almost brainwashed into having to eat as much of it as she could. Her body wouldn't let her stop if there was more to be had. She also always had to compete with her dad and brother because they both loved her cooking as much as she did. \"Come sit at the table dear.\" Her mother said which broke her out of the trance her nostrils had just put her in. \"I made some breakfast.\" Tiffany took her seat at the table and her mother served her some flapjacks along with eggs and bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are Trevor and Dad?\" Tiffany asked after a big bite of flapjacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought that since you had the whole week off we could spend some quality mother daughter time together, so I sent them off on a hunting trip. They wont be back for a week.\" Tiffany knew that quality mother daughter time usually meant tasty food and too many calories, and this left her conflicted. She loved her mothers cooking, but more calories meant more weight which she was insure of. What she didn't know is that her mother was going to make sure that after this vacation her daughter didn't have a shred of doubt left about her figure.</span></div></div>",

Her boss normally would have taken the meeting, but she had come down with a very nasty flu bug, and with Amy being there for a little over a year, she figured that Amy could handle a mundane, low level meeting without much problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had been out of college for a little over a year. She stood 5'9, and weighed 120 pounds. Currently she was attired in conservative business attire, but could also dress up very 'fun' on the weekends, a hold over from her time in college, where she was a typical sorority girl, partying at house parties and then bars when she came of age. She had been popular, but was not currently seeing anyone. Amy wasn't insecure about her lack of a boyfriend at the moment, because she knew she was hot. Her black hair and sharp features went well with her toned body. Although she played soccer in high school, Amy did not continue that in college, and stopped working out--her metabolism and sensible dietary habits kept that from becoming an issue, and after a year of work, her weight was as stable as could be. All of these things led her to be generally happy with where she was in life, and with her girlfriends who lived near her downtown, she had a great social life to complement her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Amy sat in the waiting room, in her work dress pants, a trendy female blazer and dress shirt, when he entered. The 'he' was David Rollins. Amy had only known the name as someone on her appointment calendar. She had never expected him to be so young. He was 6'1, had a great face, and looked like he probably was pretty well built under the suit he was wearing. Amy was slightly caught off guard by how attractive he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir meeting began and the two hit it off, joking about the mundane nature of napkins and their irrelevance to an airline's operating abilities. David expressed his desire of the company to renew the contract when the current one was up, quickly making Amy feel more comfortable in knowing she would have good news to bring back to the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, David did something a bit unexpected, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' he asked Amy, ''want to meet me for a drink after work?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was surprised, but was wondering if he was single throughout the meeting, so she accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great, well do you work around here'' he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, just down the street, want to go to that new place that opened up off tenth street?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That works, I will see you then.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy left pleased wondering how that meeting could have gone better.</span></div></div>",

She walked into the bar, which was higher end and filled with business people having drinks after hours. She had been texting some friends throughout the afternoon and learned that both of them had gone to the same alma mater, then, she got a text from her friend Carolyn, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're meeting David Rollins for drinks--odd--he has a gf<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought this was really weird, but before she could answer, or even think much about it, she heard his voice, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, great you could make it!'' David said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, wouldn't miss it.'' Amy at that point had a decision to make. Does she ask about his girl friend, or does she pretend that she had no idea? She choose the later, and after their drinks came, a vodka cranberry for her and scotch for him, they started talking about sports. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, where did you go to school?'' she asked with a canned quesiton she knew the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''State,'' he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No way!! Me too!'' Amy said with fake, but convincing, enthusiasm. She could not understand why she was still into him once she knew he was taken. As they spoke further it became apparent that they were both fans of their college basketball team as well, and they got into spirited discussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, there is no way that we should keep him as coach, we haven't been to a sweet sixteen in 5 years, it's time to let him go.'' Amy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He inherited scholarship restrictions, we need to give him a few more years,'' David replied. Both were having a great time, and before they knew it, they had polished off more than a few drinks, and Amy checked her watch, ''Ugh, it's getting late, I should probably go,'' she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, can I give you my number at least?'' David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Of course,'' she said, handing him her phone to let him type it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do you need a taxi or anything?'' he asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, I actually live down the street,'' Amy replied, ''I'll just wake up early and move my car before the meeters come back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great, well it was good meeting you today,'' he said with a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Same, let's keep in touch.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Amy walked into the cold fall evening weather. As she walked the 6 blocks back to her apartment, she wondered how available this new person was as she texted Carolyn back.</span></div></div>",

Amy came to the conclusion that she had probably just overstated the chemistry that they had, maybe he was just looking to network, she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Amy woke up and got a text from David, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I had a great time last night, we should hang out this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wondered why he was going through the motions of someone who was clearly on the prowl when it was clear for all to see that he had a girlfriend. So she she texted another friend, Julie, before she jumped in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...David Rollins, what is his gf's deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got out, she dried off and saw there was a text waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His gf is named Molly, and she is in her first year of law school so he never sees her. I don't think she's that cute though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pondered this. Was he just actively pursuing an affair? Did he think that she would not be able to figure these things out, so she responded, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they serious??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an almost instant reply-- \"YES. They have been going out for three years. Many mutual friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that her heart sunk and she got her work clothes on, a professional, but trendy skirt, and a tight button up shirt to go below her pea coat. Her boss, Karen, was back in and feeling better and was pleased that Amy did fine with the meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, nice job! Good to see you can handle your stuff. This is going to reflect pretty well on your upcoming 1-year performance review.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Karen, David was great to work with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's hard to impress those VP of in-flight comfort types, they get paid a lot of money to shave pennies off each flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just another reminder to Amy that not only was David perfect for her, he was also rich. Amy splurged at lunch, she was feeling kind of overwhelmed by the whole situation, so she ordered in Chinese food and got an extra serving of chicken, just because...why not? This left her feeling somewhat groggy for the rest of the day until she got another text from David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friday evening...drinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want from me?? she thought to herself. Part of her just wanted to ask that right there, but she also didn't want to confront a reality where he wasn't into her and he explicitly said so. Plus...she would look pretty foolish if it turned out he was interested in bringing her on at the company, or wanted to just be a contact at a company they worked with, so she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 6pm again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...let's do 10:15.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just starred at her phone, Well that's a little more direct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10:15 is a bit past business hours\" she sent back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I didn't want to discuss napkins\" apparently appeared back on her screen. Amy knew what this was...he wanted to bring her home...or go back to his place after, or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Friday evening came, Amy put on a skirt that was going to be cold, but that showed off a ton of leg. She also wore a very tight top that showed off her toned body, while still staying classy, she had always prided herself on knowing the difference between being hot and just dressing revealing, and the type of guy that attracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most weekends, Amy and her friends pregamed before they left her downtown apartment for the bars. This evening she invited Carolyn and Julie to get a bit of a buzz going before they went out. Each showed up within minutes of each other, and all three of them were in the same sorority class in college. Carolyn was from out of state, but stayed in the city after college and was an high school teacher. At 5'6, 125 with blonde hair and a sporty face, she looked like she could teach gym, but instead she taught math at a school that was in the exurbs, causing her to drive all the way to the edge of the metropolis, an hour commute from the city core that they lived in. Julie followed her in, 5'1, 105 pounds and at med school, she was the smartest of the three, but still found time to party on the weekends. All three of them quickly gossiped about what they had all been texting about this weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo,\" Carolyn said, \"what are you going to do around David tonight,\" as she took her first strong glass of rum and diet coke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do not know,\" Amy said while making herself a vodka and pineapple juice. \"Maybe I'll play it by ear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just know, Molly can be a huge pain. She's been known to be pretty territorial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if she is going to be coming out tonight, David didn't say anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course he didn't...he's trying to get with you!\" Carolyn beat Julie to saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished off a few more drinks and left the apartment at 10:15 for a 10:30 arrival at the bars...didn't want to look desperate.</span></div></div>",

The bar David invited them to was far more of a party atmosphere than the one he had invited Amy to for drinks after work earlier in the week. Where that bar had mostly table seating and was at the bottom of a nice hotel with a piano playing in the background, this one was packed with people right out college like themselves, and had loud music going. The other bar had expensive cocktails, this bar had tall boys...David's intentions were becoming very clear to Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Amy found David at the back of the bar with a group of people who she assumed to be his friends and she walked up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she said and quickly realized that he was drunk (not to say she wasn't, they drank a good deal at her place).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amy!\" he said eagerly, going in to hug her particularly affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led her into a corner in the bar and they began talking more about sports and work, and before they knew it, each of them had downed another 4 or 5 beers, and an hour had gone by. Amy found it harder to keep track of his conversation, and only wondered how he was staying composed...Who knows, maybe he's having as much trouble as I am with this. They talked some more, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you live downtown?\" David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, right down the street.\" Amy started to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're trying to doooo....\" Amy said, trying to poke him, but losing his balance and falling into him. David caught her and at that moment they were about to kiss each other when they hear a voice and he almost threw her off his hands. It was Molly, who had shown up after a long study session, and very sober. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...David. Are you going to introduce me to your new close friend?\" she asked clearly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...this is Amy\" He said, clearly trying to search through his alcohol sedated brain for an articulate way to describe what she had just witnessed. \"I met her at work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's nice, what does she do? World's oldest profession?\" Amy quickly snapped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the alcohol told her to respond there. \"We had a meeting together, I sold him napkins for the airlines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's exciting stuff! Everyone back from high school must be really jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyy--\" David interjected, \"it's a big account.\" Awww, Amy almost said out loud. Luckily she did not, as that only would have set Molly off more. As it was, Molly had seen enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, it was so interesting meeting you, and you've made me happy I decided to go to law school.\" With that she grabbed David's arm and hauled him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn and Julie came over, \"Woah, did she verbally undress you or something?\" Julie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...I don't know?\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...you're good for the night...waters for everyone on me.\" Carolyn said.</span></div></div>",

Molly had helped put him to sleep, and knew where his smartphone was. She also knew his password and proceeded to look through his texts. What she saw did not please her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had drinks together, twice?! This is a huge flirt fest. I am going to kill him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly took a brief moment of introspection. Why was David thinking of cheating on her to begin with. She thought about how, even though they lived together, she was always studying, or at class. It probably did not help that he had turned his internship with the company into an amazing job out of college, one of the youngest people ever to hold his position. She wondered if this made him feel entitled. Molly's thoughts moved to herself. She was always short to begin with at 4'11, and the girl who was nearly a foot taller than her (Amy) from the bar last night was clearly hotter. With all the studying had come an additional 15 pounds on top of the 10 that she had gained in undergrad, and now Molly weighed a chubby 150, something she thought was unfair due to her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegative emotions overtook her. She felt betrayed by David. She would have stayed with him if the tables were turned, and he were getting his MBA without a job and she had already been working. Instead, he felt like he was using his position of power in the relationship to his advantage. This created huge insecurity for her What if he leaves me, she thought, how will I pay for everything? It was a logical thought. David payed for the rent in their nice apartment, he let her use his car from college when he bought a new car after a few months on the job. Heck, he even bought her clothes as gifts most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly knew that she had to do something, but she didn't want to look desperate. She always thought that he had been attracted to her because she was the smartest girl in the class, and becoming needy, or changing herself may only look weak. No, she needed to take down the competition--if only there was some way to eliminate Amy as a viable option for David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went online into the alumni directory and quickly found the company that Amy worked for. Luckily, she knew someone who worked there her friend Christie, perhaps she would have an idea how to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly also wondered if she should try to befriend Amy, and find a what her weakness was, perhaps that could cause her to gain some weight, or at least guide her towards another target.</span></div></div>",

After she was finished, Molly had clearly achieved her goal in making Christie just as angry at Amy, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That whore!\" Christie interjected a few times, \"does she not care that you two are long-term, or that he's going to propose to you soon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know them,\" Molly replied, \"Amy, and Julie and Carolyn do not care about that stuff, they were just as bad in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we have to do something to stop that,\" Christie demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly found her opening, \"Yeah...I had an idea, but you will probably think it's pretty weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, tell me, I want to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what if we made Amy larger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked at Christie with a look that betrayed that she knew it was an odd thing to say, and she waited for Christie's response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larger...like fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Molly said, somewhat unsure of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess that would work, but how would you do that?\" Christie asked, legitimately curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly went into detail, saying that Christie could befriend her at work, bring tons of treats, and ask her to lunch a lot. \"It may not work,\" Molly cautioned, \"but why not try?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Christie said. \"Who knows, maybe it will be fun to become better friends with Amy.

At the donut shop beforehand, Christie felt somewhat out of place, she was never really a creature of these establishments. For one thing, she was into healthy eating, and her body showed. At 5'6, 120, her body showed that she was a former soccer player that still worked out. Her brunette hair and green eyes appealed to many guys, and in college, she had found herself having pretty good success with guys. She didn't really know Amy that well, they were in different sororities, but from what she heard, she did not like. She thought Amy was self-centered, and vain, qualities that Amy also thought about Christie. They worked together as well, Christie was in accounting at the company, and had gone out of her way not to talk to Amy when she was brought on in sales, even though they were in the same class in college. All of this made it somewhat odd when Christie walked up to Amy's desk that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up from her desk, somewhat confused about why Christie was there, \"Umm...not much Christie, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just think it's so funny that we graduated in the same class from state, and we never hang out...we should be better friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought this was random, but was not hostile to the suggestion. \"Yeah, want to go out for a drink tonight or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking lunch today, does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, meet me in the lobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Christie said before she walked away. Was she frosty to me? Christie thought, Or was I just awkward? In truth, it was a little of both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when Christie got to the lobby, she saw Amy standing there. She tried to loosen her up with her friendliness, \"Amy, I love your coat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks, I got it a week ago, I'm happy you like it!\" Maybe I judged Christie wrong, Amy thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to a casual restaurant down the street and got burritos. Christie watched as Amy had the person perparing it load her's up with many fattening options, like extra cheese and sour cream, Wow...if she has a bullet-proof metabolism, this plan isn't going to work, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down, they started to naturally fall into gossip about work and college, and hit if off. For all the coldness they gave each other in college, Christie and Amy hit if off very well, and talked in rapid fire, laughing and liking each other more as they went along. Near the end of the dinner, Amy brought up that she would like to travel more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's stopping you?\" Christie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money. I don't want to go overseas if it means running up a huge balance on my credit card. I have a plan, but I just have not taken time to really implement it.\" Amy said, getting ready to throw out an idea that she had thought about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Christie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I lease an apartment with two bedrooms,\" Amy went on, \"and thought I was going to use the office, but I have not bought furniture for it, and never go in there. I'm fine doing most of my work at home from the kitchen table. I would move, but it was really hard to get in an apartment this nice, for the price, and I am right next to everything, so I am looking for a roommate to sublet, so I could make a little extra money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie could not believe her luck. She was looking to move downtown. She lived out in suburbia, and had a 25 minute commute each day. She remembered from what Amy said earlier, that she lived a few blocks away from the office, and loved to walk to work. This would be perfect for her, plus, it would make helping Molly's plan against Amy easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...how soon would you want a roommate?\" Christie asked, with a smile.</span></div></div>",

It costs money to do everything, go to the movies, buy clothes, even to drive her car. Summer break had just arrived and Lindsey knew if she wanted to have fun this summer she should try getting a part time job so she could have some cash. When looking around town she spotted all sorts of business' with Help Wanted signs. The grocery was hiring, as was the local fast food joint. Lindsey didn't like those options and settled on the local bakery. That job would be top notch. Lindsey always had a secret sweet tooth, and thought it would be a fun environment, who is ever grumpy in a bakery, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went in one day and met with the manager, Nicole. Nicole seemed nice enough, but in a bit of rush when she had her appointment to meet Lindsey. Lindsey followed her back into her office. She noticed Nicole was a bit overweight and not fitting into her clothes all that well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lindsey I'm looking for someone to look after the bakery so I don't have to be here so often. The store is quite small and can be managed by just one person. Think you are up for the task?\" Lindsey had never taken a job before so she was up for what ever came her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When can I start?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are actually free, right now. I've got to run to a class. I'll be back in a few hours to help you close up. Sound good?\" Lindsey agreed. She didn't have anywhere to be and didn't want to disappoint her new boss. Nicole left the store in Lindsey hands. Thankfully for her there was very little business in the few hours she was alone, and the few people that came in had easy orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Nicole returned as promised. \"How did it go?\" She asked. Nicole looked quite red in the face and she seemed like she had been sweating recently. She was holding and drinking a protein shake as she conversed with Lindsey. The two of them closed up shop and Nicole showed Lindsey all the ins and outs of how the store ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh before I forget.\" Nicole inturpted the current train of thought. \"There is an employee discount on everything in the store. You get 50% off and the money just comes right out of your pay. Go ahead and try anything you want when ever you want.\" Nicole looked down at her waistline. It had obviously grown from having this job. Nicole told Lindsey that she had only been managing the store for a few months. The woman who owns the place hired her to look after everything while she tended to her other entrepreneurial adventures. The only other employee was the baker who came in before the shop opened and make sure the place was stocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, being a fan of sweets, couldn't resist trying out her new discount. Before closing up the pastries, she grabbed a few and started to nibble on them. They were so delicious. Before not too long the place was closed up and Nicole was handing her new employee a key to the building. Lindsey was thrilled about her new job. She bet that none of her friends had landed a job as cool as hers. </span></div></div>",

As she pulled in around back she saw the baker driving off for the day. His shift always ended as hers began. Lindsey was to work for the next eight hours until the shop closed. She placed on her smock and took up refuge behind the counter. Business was slow, but Nicole told her to expect it, the store made all it's money during only a few peak times. As Lindsey's bordum dragged on she decided to treat her self to something. She took out a large slice of cake from the display case and found a fork in the back. The cake was just as good as the pastries she had from yesterday. It was creamy and delicious. She quickly ate the whole large piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn't have much responsibility, Nicole was the manager and took care of all the orders and paperwork. The baker took care of stock, Lindsey was just a body to help the customers, but right now there were no customers. Lindsey decided to fill more down time with more sweets. Business started to pick up around 5, but that wasn't saying much. It still left her plenty of time to snack and enjoy the benefit of working in a bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy day's end her belly was full of sweets and even a little taut. She knew she over did it a little bit, but there wasn't much else to do all day. Work went pretty similarly for the rest of the week and even into next week. Lindsey worked five days a week and Nicole looked over the store the other two. Lindsey didn't see Nicole after her first day until two weeks had gone by. It was payday for Lindsey so Nicole stopped by the store to write her a check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole arrived right after store opening, when the store was the least busy. Nicole was drinking one of her weight loss drinks as usual. Lindsey had always found one or two lying around on a day after Nicole had been looking after the store. They also filled the waste baskets in the morning. She was wearing a track suit and looked flush from a recent workout. She was looking a bit slimmer from two weeks ago, almost as if she had been working out everyday that she didn't have to be at the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey on the other hand was looking absolutely bloated. She looked rounder all around. Her chin had a slight wobble, and her belly was showing some new roundness to it. Her boobs looked to have filled in a bit and her butt a little porkier. A smile washed over Nicole's face as she noticed Lindsey trying to keep her tight white shirt covering her larger midsection. Lindsey followed Nicole back into her office. Nicole sat at her desk and took out a large book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, this many hours, times your rate, minus your expenses, comes to... $8.32.\" Lindsey's jaw hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$8.32? How can my check be so little? Is it from all the snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sorry dear but I have to take that very seriously.\" Nicole told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to stop eating at work.\" Nicole's smile was struck away as Lindsey came to the realization. Nicole knew the dangers of working here to a woman's waistline and she had fallen victim to it so quickly. Not that she wished ill fate upon Lindsey, but she would feel like a total fatass is she was the only one who got fat from the food here. In a way she wanted Lindsey to be her surrogate eater. She also thought if Lindsey were to gain that Nicole could only look slimmer in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a genius idea came to Nicole. If Lindsey didn't have to pay for the snacks she'd surly balloon up. But how would she be able to pull that off. If she offered the hungry employee free food then she would eat the business into debt. Nicole had another \"A'ha\" moment and sent Lindsey back out to the floor to work. A few minutes later Nicole emerged from her office looking fumed. She wasn't actually fumed but was putting on a show for Lindsey. \"I can't believe that woman.\" Nicole bantered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess there was a customer complaint so the owner wants me to conduct taste tests on all the products daily now. The problem is that I'm too busy to get that sort of thing done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could do it.\" Lindsey chirped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that?\" Nicole was playing it up big time. \"You wouldn't have to pay for the samples obviously, but you would need to try one of everything and keep track of them. Actually it's going to equal about how much you were putting on your tab before.\" Nicole was dancing in her head. Her plan was going to execute perfectly. Nicole would eat the cost of the 'samples' but to her it was worth it for her self image and self esteem. Lindsey set out right away taste testing samples and was again quite full by days end. </span></div></div>",

It was paycheck day again and Nicole rolled up in her ratty car to deliver Lindsey with some much needed money. Lindsey's growth has caused her to out grow her whole wardrobe. She was heading straight to the mall with this money for some new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole burst through the doors looking as trim as ever. Nicole had the luxury of being able to buy an even smaller track suit now that she had slimmed down so much. Lindsey on the other hand was having a hard time tying her smock and not having the ties cut into her fat sides too much. Her newly formed potbelly hung snugly in front of her, and her rounded out booty filled her tightened pants. This week Nicole awarded Lindsey with a proper sized check. She had taken a little off the top from Lindsey's extra eating outside of her testing, but it wasn't much. Definitely not as much as last time. Lindsey was happy. All the extra weight hadn't really hit her yet, she was just happy getting paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole on the other hand wasn't so happy. All the food expense had left her with almost half a paycheck. Nicole's plan wasn't going as smoothly as intended.</span></div></div>",

Nicole wanted her to be down right fat. If only there was a way Lindsey could do her taste tests and still eat away her paycheck, she would balloon in no time. Sadly Nicole could think of no way to accomplish this task. Although her workouts had been going well, she wanted Lindsey to go through the same pains she did, she wanted to know she wasn't the only one who had no self control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't really self control that Lindsey lacked, Nicole of force feeding her these treats. Not that Lindsey wouldn't go full pelt in this place if she had the chance, she would eat this place clean if everything was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole decided she needed to take action. More taste tests. It would cost her a lot but she wouldn't be able to dispute the results. She told Lindsey the good news, but Lindsey had nothing but fear in her eyes. She was barely able to test everything as it was, now Nicole to doubling her work load. Nicole let Lindsey know that she'd stop by every night to help close up, that way Lindsey could finish eating her treats with the extra time. What Nicole really wanted was to see the bloated girl full if food looking absolutely stuffed and fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt a little bad taking her insecurities out on Lindsey, but then she remembered that Nicole was the only person that mattered and everyone else is collateral damage.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't even stop when there were customers in the store. She'd ring up their sales while chewing brownie bits in her mouth. By the end of the day Lindsey still had a small tray of treats to taste test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround closing time Nicole showed up like promised so she could close the store while Lindsey continued to chomp down. Lindsey was absolutely bloated. Even though she was wearing new clothes that fit her much better, they were already tight around her extended belly. Nicole looked on in glee, as her protege was taking so well to the treats. It took about a half hour for both girls to accomplish their task. Lindsey went home to nurse her food coma, only to start again tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more weeks went by before payday rolled around. Lindsey had been working and snacking for six weeks now, practically half her summer vacation. In the past six weeks she had mainly only worked. She worked so much and when she wasn't working she just felt like lounging around. More recently she had to nurse her bloated belly every night, which made leaving the house hard to do. Of course all the extra food intake had added some serious pounds to the young girl. Her belly was becoming quite round, as it hung in front of her and over her waist band. All her extremities were also thicker and wobbled as she went about her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole on the other hand was looking trim as ever. She also looked a little strung out, which was becoming a more common occurrence. The girls went out back to collect their pay. Nicole handed Lindsey her check, and then started doing the math for her own pay. After calculating all the taste testing product Nicole was left with practically nothing. She sighed and started to stress about not having a paycheck after two weeks of work. \"Is something wrong?\" Lindsey asked her distressed boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked over at Lindsey and saw how her newly formed double chin wobbled as she spoke. \"No dear, I'm fine.\" Nicole couldn't deal with the lack of money, but her project was coming along just fine. By the time Nicole got up to leave for the day, Lindsey was already face first into her taste testing. The bulging girl showed no signs of stopping. </span></div></div>",

Lindsey noticed that Nicole had not been looking so hot since last payday. \"Nicole is everything ok?\" Lindsey asked one night as she finished up her sampling for the day. Nicole had been looking more and more disheveled as the days past. Her hair was stringy and her track suit looked quite dirty and under washed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, just a little money problem. Nothing to worry about.\" Nicole replied. In reality it was something to worry about. She was behind on her bills and the lack of money was starting to take it's toll on the poor woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey on the other hand was just having a weight problem. She was quite thin when she had taken this job but had gotten increasingly chubby. She was starting to notice how severe the effects had been. At first it was just a few pounds here and there, but now she had a belly that bulged out in front of her and thick legs that touched more than not. She knew it was all the taste testing, and if the testing were to stop that so would her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, how long is this taste testing going to go on? We have not had a complaint since I started. It's just I've gained a little weight from all this eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole butted in. \"I don't know! It's not up to me.\" Nicole was a bit on edge with everything going on in her life, it probably didn't help that she was a workout fanatic and was constantly trying to lose weight. Nicole had become pin thin. She looked across the room to where Lindsey was working through the last sweets that were piled up on her plate. Lindsey wasn't fat yet, but Nicole was happy with the progress she was making. For some reason it warmed her heart to see how chubby Lindsey was getting. After taking a deep breath she re-evaluated the situation. \"But I will talk to the owner and see what I can do.\"</span></div></div>",

But she couldn't help but smile when she walked into the bakery and saw tubby Lindsey chomping away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if it wasn't for Nicole's forced taste test that she was paying for, her money situation would be fine. But the self satisfaction that she got from seeing this place ruin Lindsay figure kept her going like no other force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was getting chubby but Nicole wanted her fat. 'This pigglet eats sweets all day and isn't even fat yet. She needs to be shown what eating all these sweets does to your waist line.' Nicole was starting to come unraveled. 'This place tricked me into gaining 40 pounds and turned me into a pig. No that I'm back to my perfect form I can see that all this junk is no good. Lindsay needs to learn her lesson.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay, bad news, gotta up the taste tests. You're going to need to come in two hours early and stay an extra hour at night, we are doubling your work load.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay got started like a good little worker, but the pounds started appearing quicker than ever. Her butt grew as she sat on it for longer and longer each day. Her fat thighs only fit in her largest pair of sweat pants. Her belly started to spill into her lap as it grew rolls on top of rolls. Her big full breasts got huge and sat a top her round belly rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these changes didn't stop her eating tho. She had committed to doing her job, and she was going to do it well. Lindsay the eating machine was not to be stopped. As Lindsay became a massive girl Nicole could not have been happier. She was bankrupt, living at the bakery, and only owned one set of clothes, but was happy to see that Lindsay was learning its not all fun and games working at a bakery eating sweets,  lesson Nicole had learned when she first started.</span></div></div>",

She loved how fat Lindsay had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last day of summer and Lindsey waddled in two hours before the shop opened to start her eating. Right before opening Nicole showed up to run the show while Lindsay kept chomping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nicole!\" The bulbbery teen waved at her boss sending massive jiggles across her whole body. \"Excited about our last day together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement confused Nicole. \"What do you mean last day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School starts tomorrow. I've got to go back to school. I'm thinking about trying out for field hockey this year. I almost made varsity last year and I think I've really got a shot this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't even have time to address this comical statement from her underling, she was too focused on the whole not working anymore thing. Then it hit her. \"But you didn't even give your two weeks notice. You've got to work for at least two more weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then can I just work after school and on weekends? If you save me all the testing food I'll stay late at night and finish it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can accept that. And maybe then you don't have to quit at all. Just stay on working when you are not at school, I know how much this job means to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great! I'll come by right after school tomorrow!\" And so she did. Nicole had left 10 hours worth of food for Lindsay to eat. The fat teen ate and ate and ate until the wee hours of the morning where she passed out in the back if the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke the next morning groggy and realizing she needed to get to school. She cleaned her self up and went to school only to return after school to eat more bakery goods. The cycle repeated again and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gave no thought to abandoning her work and Nicole saw no problem with owning all of Lindsay's free time. As Lindsay continued to eat she continued to grow. 350 and then to 400 lbs. She was the biggest girl in the school but couldn't stop eating her sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd the field hockey tryouts go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't have a uniform in my size, but I also had a hard time keeping up with the girls on the field, its like they are marathon runners or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the home coming dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't be bothered.

Taking full advantage of the weekend off from her tech job, she was getting her run in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family couldn't afford to send her off to college like the preppy rich kids up at surfside, in prestwick, and as such, she was thrust into the workforce as a techie at Center Stage, one of the premier theaters at the tourist trap that is Myrtle Beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne negative was, of course, the pervy tourists. Then again, to be fair, she had everything any man could want; Slender waist, a big rack, and a sizable behind, not to mention a pretty face. Often a time she'd catch some obese 40-something man eyeballing her. Like any other girl, she hoped for the day her 'Knight in shining armor' would come in with sculpted, muscular abs and gentlemanly ways to take her off to his mansion.<i> Hah</i>, thought caitlyn, <i>As if</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe run had gone on a good mile more as she went up to the steps leading up to the grand, spectacular boardwalk that crested the line of hotels, restaurants, and bars that lined the beach and offered tourists eye candy with one hand, and grabbed fistfulls of their money with another. The saving grace was a starbucks that sat just by the boardwalk, that she entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of the freshly ground beans entered her nose like the smell of the salty air that powered her run a few moments earlier. She wiped the sweat off her brow, and looked ahead of her in line. Up ahead, she saw a woman that seemed very familiar, but they had obviously put on a few pounds. Correction, more than a few; Just by looking at the rolls on her back, she could tell the brunette had put on at least thirty, fourty pounds. The woman turned around to see Caitlyn. \"Caitlyn?\" The familiar, chubby, yet now even chubbier, cheeks of Abby Peters had turned to face her. \"Abby!\" Caitlyn greeted the familiar face, and hugged the expanded form of her old highschool friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she could tell this would happen to Abby. <i>I knew her daily chick-fil-a visits and her lack of exercise would do this to her eventually</i>, mentally reasoned caitlyn, <i>and it happened. I could say that I told her so, but I never told her</i>. The line slowly slugged on, as Abby spoke. \"Looking hot as I remember.\" Caitlyn smirked. \"I could say the same for you, Abbdominals.\" Abby chuckled, replying, \"Yeah, I've been on the seafood diet. I sea food, and I eat it.\" She chuckled, making her even more pronounced belly jiggle and shake. <i>Yeah, I bet you have</i> thought caitlyn. She thought that Abby would have somehow rearranged her life, it had happened to her when she had been on the bigger side. <i>Maybe one of these days I'll have an intervention, help her out, somehow.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby spoke. \"Coffee's on me, homegirl.\" Caitlyn spoke. \"Oh nah, I'm good! I brought my own change!\" she spoke, preparing to get out her money as Abby approached the counter. Abby paid her rather fattened hand on Caitlyn's wad of cash. \"Put it back, I got this.\" She turned to the Cashier. \"Hi! I'd like one coffee, extra milk, extra cream, extra sugar, and one White hot chocolate with Whipped cream, please. The blonde, stick thin cashier smiled and nodded. \"Yes ma'am, right away. Can I get the names?\" Abby replied. \"Coffee's for Caitlyn Taper, Chocolate's for Abby Peters.\" She handed the girl her Credit Card, the girl swiped it, and handed it back. \"It'll be right out, thank you for your order.\" Abby and Caitlyn went to a table and had a seat, waiting for the coffee to finish brewing as more and more tourists streamed in. It seemed to be that time of day when everyone seemed to be simultaneously nodding off and needed their second dose of caffinated conciousness. In what seemed like no time, they heard the shrill voice of \"Taper and Peters?\" Abby hurriedly got up, her enlarged form jiggling and shaking as she briskly walked over to the counter, as she picked up the two drinks, as she walked back over to the table, setting the coffee in front of Caitlyn and the Chocolate in front of herself. They sat and sipped their drinks. \"So how's the world treated you in the theater, Caitlyn?\" asked Abby. \"It's been good, we finished up our production of Fiddler on the Roof a couple weeks ago. We're thinking what our christmas musical's going to be.\" Abby nodded. \"Awesome. I got a job at Farm Bureau insurance, finished my degree. Making a good salary of, what, about 50,000 a year thanks to my Bachelor's? Either way, I'm happy about those years in school.\" The friends sipped on for a while, and Caitlyn spoke. \"Yeah, parents are saying that I'm gonna have to move out soon since I have a job.\" Abby perked up with excitement. \"I have a guest bedroom in my apartment at Carver's!\" Caitlyn replied, \"Really?\" Abby spoke, \"Yeah, it'll be PERFECT!\" Caitlyn spoke with excitement, though it may have well been the coffee. \"Of course! I'll have to get my stuff first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the evening, as Caitlyn walked up the stairs with her Staircase to the second floor. Abby's apartment number, 206 soon appeared promptly on her right. She knocked and Abby smiled as she let Caitlyn in. \"Caitlyn! Roomie's here, Already got you a spare key..\" She pointed to a key on the table near the door. \"And I've got supper ready!\" She pointed to the bag of Chick-Fil-A. Caitlyn mentally cringed. This wasn't exactly healthy, but who was she to turn down Chick-Fil-A? The two roommates sat down and began eating, Abby dug into her chicken nuggets and waffle fries, and Caitlyn began eating her Chicken Sandwich. The thought formulated in her brain about the weight intervention. She had her scale and tape in her bags. Eventually supper wound down and Abby, patting her full stomach, spoke. \"I'm gettin' down for the night. See you in the morning, Caitlyn!\" Caitlyn replied, \"Night abbs!\" She got up, picking up the Chick-fil-a bag, now full of the left-over trash, and putting it in the trash. She got into her room, and unpacked her suitcase, splaying her possessions around her room. She seperated the electronic scale and the measuring tape from the plethora of clothing, and laid them on the floor. She had the plan in her brain; She'd ambush her with the scale and tape in the morning, just before breakfast, and use it to scare abby into starting her new routine in the morning, as opposed to later. She wrote herself a reminder on her phone to wake her up in the morning, and after putting the clothing into an assorted pile in the closet, she got to bed. The next morning, she awoke to the sound of her phone. She looked at it and remembered, she had to start abby's routine today. She got up, and crept slowly towards the door, and opened it, seeing... </div></span></div></div>",

She didn't want to piss Abby off by straightaway annoying her with this, she wanted to intervene this morning, but she didn't want to be punched in the face, so she got a mug, filled it with coffee, and due to the fact she actually needed some, she filled it with creamer, but no sugar nor milk this morning. She had to try to set an example for Abby. She went over to her seat, and waited for Abby to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came in, grabbing her own mug and sluggishly greeting her. \"Mornin' Caitlyn.\" She poured a mug of coffee for herself, put in the usual metric ton of sugar, cream, and milk, and sat down. Caitlyn knew better than to try to make conversation, as Abby, like her, could not form a coherent thought this early in the morning as the sun crested over the beach waters, sending in a brilliant cascade of sunlight into the room. Eventually the topic of conversation had turned to breakfast. \"So, what do you want to do for breakfast?\" asked Abby as she was halfway done with her mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm thinking maybe we could do Ihop.\" spoke Caitlyn. She thought to herself,<i> Is it the time to spring the trap? Should I do it now?</i> She mulled it over as Abby spoke a reply after a sip of coffee. \"Sure thing, Cait.\" <i>No, it must be now. It has to be, she'll overeat at breakfast and the diet won't settle in</i>, thought Caitlyn. Abby spoke, beginning to get up. \"I'll go get dressed-\" She was interrupted by Caitlyn. \"Actually, first, I had something planned. Sit back down.\" Abby sat back down, speaking in a confused tone. \"O...kay...\" Caitlyn sighed and got down by Abby. \"I always avoided talking about it because I never wanted to offend you...\" spoke Caitlyn in a soft, unoffending tone to Abby's concerned face. Caitlyn touched Abby's large gut. \"...But this, this wasn't harmful when we were kids. It just annoyed us. But now that we're getting older, getting jobs...It can kill you, Abby. It can kill you. I want you to be alive for a long time, I don't want you to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn softly rubbed her stomach for a second, then got back up, reaching behind the chair for the scale and tape, setting the scale and tape out. A \"I'm not trying to upset you, Abby. But I want us to be healthy when we get older, we need to start planning for the future, take off the shirt for a sec.\" Abby trembled, saying shakily, \"O-O-Okay..\" as she rolled up her shirt to reveal her large belly. Caitlyn stretched the measuring tape around her rotund stomach. It turned out at about a 50. Caitlyn pronounced the number out loud. \"Fifty.\" Abby cocked her head back. \"Fifty...No, no, no, there's no way, I'm not that fat. You're lying.\" Caitlyn looked up at Abby. \"You think I'm lying, step on this scale.\" Abby shakily stepped on the scale, almost terrified. The scale rolled out the numbers: 215. \"See that?\" \"T...I'm over Two Hundred...No....No no no...\" Abby began sobbing intensely. Caitlyn hugged her. \"It's okay. We can fix that. We're gonna go out to Ihop, okay? We'll have a meal and talk about a plan for losing some of that.\" Abby began wiping her tears away. \"O-Okay...Let's do that... Let me wash up first...\" She sniffled, and went to the bathroom. Eventually she came out, cleaned up and walking away. They hopped into a cab, and went to a nearby Ihop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were seated they were approached by their lanky teenage waiter. They had ordered drinks earlier; Caitlyn and Abby both ordered coffee, straight black. It tasted like shit, but both were scared straight by the weight intervention. The waiter spoke. \"Okay, ladies, do we know what we want?\" Abby spoke. \"Yeah, I want...Hmm...\" She finally spoke, \"I want whole wheat pancakes, no butter,  with a side of...Three strips of bacon.\" Caitlyn nodded. It was a start. She however, felt rather famished this morning. But she also wanted to set a good example for Abby. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

Caitlyn waved her hand. \"That'll be it.\" The blonde nodded. \"Allll-right, I'll be back with your orders.\" The two women sat, speaking. \"So, did you ever hear back from Adriana?\" asked Caitlyn. Abby shook her head. \"Nah, from what I heard, she moved to Ohio, or somewhere up there. They also say she's been getting pretty fat.\" Caitlyn nodded. \"Heh. Always knew it'd happen. She always needed someone else to motivate her.\" Abby sheepishly nodded, knowing she was the same way but she only ever really worked out once, and only for approximately 5 minutes to some Hip-Hop Ab DVD, and she swore she'd never work out again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food eventually came. Caitlyn dug into her food, and it tasted absolutely amazing, the warm, buttered pancakes complementing the sausage and bacon very, very, very well. Abby occasionally glanced at it, and it looked good. Much better than her craptastic whole wheat pancakes. She looked down and ate what she could stomach of the meal. Of course, the bacon was an integral part of her being able to eat it. As the meal came to an end, Caitlyn leaned back into her chair, patting her stomach. \"Oooh, man, I'm so full.\" Abby faked it as best she could, joining her. \"Yeaaah, man, I sure am glad we're going running today. When exactly are we gonna do that?\" Caitlyn leaned her head sideways, making a long droning sound, finally ending it on \"Uh, how about Seven? When we get off work, and have some supper?\" Abby nodded. \"Sounds good.\" Caitlyn continued on. \"And we keep that up, every day we go running at Seven. On weekends we'll visit Planet Fitness.\" Abby Nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women departed for work, the State farm building was close by, so Abby could walk there, even without this whole weight-loss BS. She was rather scared after the weight intervention, but now that she saw Caitlyn not committing to the whole health thing either, she wasn't sure about this whole plan, which the hypocrisy on Caitlyn's part sure seemed to ruin. She opened the door, dressed in a white button-up. It made her feel every pound, every inch of her fat. It made her feel like a worthless blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlyn finally ended up parking her car in front of the large theater. It had the old movie-theater lettering on the headers, but it had the prominent sign: \"Center Stage Dramatic Arts Theater\" above the header, in large prominent letters, red lined in gold. She tramped into the theater lobby, which had that smell of fresh carpet. She sniffed at the air, humming at the smell. She entered the large theater room that stood behind a ticket gate between two of the 6 Ticket booths. The vast theater opened before her, a few chairs here and there occupied by some of the actors. She spoke. \"Carla, did you have new carpet put in?\" A slightly chubby blonde woman turned about, nodding. \"Mmhmm. They cost a fortune, but we could afford them, thanks to the summer dancing series. I never really did thank you for getting that together.\" Caitlyn nodded. 'She never gives me credit for anything. Bitch,' Caitlyn thought. She did not give this title to anyone, verbally or mentally, if they did not deserve it. And rest assured, Carla was completely deserving of the grand title of Head Bitch Up Her Own Ass. Every time when Caitlyn hit a cue perfectly when the actors were screwing up the lines or doing Improv to fill in, she always was there, doing her job. Carla never gave a damn about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about it made her both angry, and hungry. Luckily, lunch was brought in: Michael's Pizza. Caitlyn swooned at the sight and smell of the pizza. It was renowned as the best in the grand strand. She couldn't believe her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, at Abby's office...</span></div></div>",

The bland mix of incomprehensible work had blended together, even the words she was writing made less and less sense to her. To anyone else they would have formed a perfect example of an Insurance Claim Denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not to Abby at this moment, because she was feeling as emaciated as a liberian child, despite her huge, rotund stomach and lower body. The diet thing hadn't really settled in. Sure, she may have overreacted a little...okay, correction, a LOT, when she saw the numbers on the scale, but right now, she didn't care if the next thing she ate gave her a heart attack on the spot. She'd eat just about anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Abby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from a heifer of a co-worker, 23 year old Janelle Swanson. She had long since accepted the fact that she was fat, since high school, and though she went through some form of athletic-ish phase once, early in her senior year of high school, when she worked out with her friends once. Then she quickly discovered she'd be just fine living fat, if it didn't mean the hellish exertion and deathlike state of Workouts and Diets. She went from 190 by the end of high school to 355 by the beginning of this fiscal year, and she was always ballooning higher. Her button-up blouses always proved to be a constant expense, as she had to buy more and more as old ones began to burst and not fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby waved her fatty arm at the fat woman. \"Hey Janelle!\" She glanced at the bag of Burger King in Janelle's hand. \"Is that for me?\" Janelle spoke. \"Mmm-Hmm, we fat girls gotta stick together you know!\" Abby snatched it from her hand and gave a loving gasp. \"Oooooooooooomigodomigodomigod, I love you so much Jannie-poo,\" yelled Abby, as she began reaching for the nearest clump of fries within the bag. \"Ain't even a thang!\" replied Janelle. \"Buuuuuuuuut, I'm expecting to be repaid.\" Abby replied through a fry-filled mouth, \"Wotsh Dot?\" Janelle spoke. \"Oooooh, maybe something about having a girl's night out at Chick-Fil-A?\" Abby fervidly nodded, taking a breather and replying \"Sounds good!\" Janelle smiled and spoke. \"Well, I'm gonna get back to work. See ya later, gurrrl!\" Abby simply waved farewell as the blubbery woman waddled away. Abby gobbled down the food, and then got back to work, looking forward to the session of Chick-Fil-A later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, Hold up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud, shrill voice of Carla snapped the thin air of the theater, which was prior only broken by the periodic taps of actors practicing their dances. Caitlyn and her rather thin partner. \"Look, honey, I know you usually work tech, and this is your first time getting a role, but for the love of GOD, please have some decency and don't offend me with this SHIT. Look, I told you, Right step, Plie, Tendu, jump. You do it for some reason with your LEFT foot, you're not bending your knee far up enough, and you jump about as high as Gertrude, and her fat ass could go higher than yours!\" The thin man spoke up. \"Carla, don't talk about Gertrude like that, she died, you know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla raised a sole finger, pointing it at him. \"Huh? What? Do you hear that? That's the sound of you backtalking me. Do you want to keep your job? then obey me, or go fucking starve.\" The thin man looked down, sighing in anger and defeat. The pudgy blonde stepped back, shoving another mini-doughnut into her mouth. Her stomach was seemingly always expanding, and it was ironic that she was always criticizing her actors for putting on weight when dance practice wasn't in season, when she herself had been rocketing up in the pounds recently. Caitlyn sighed and returned to her routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's workshift neared 5:30, and she had shut her computer down and gotten up, when the phone rang. She waddled over to it, picked it up, and raised it to her head. She spoke, \"Hello?\" She was answered by the voice of....</span></div></div>",

Walking behind her gives you the chance to ogle for a bit. Her butt's big enough to have some serious bounce as she walks, and her pants are tight enough that you can get a good view every time. Nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou queue up at the cafeteria. There are a few tables around, but the place is pretty packed. Stacy offers to buy you something while you find a place for the two of you to sit. You tell her to get you a chocolate muffin and some soda. Getting out of the queue, you stupidly place yourself exactly where you're always in the way of somebody going one direction or another.

You can have one of these if you really want\", she says, but she looks a little reluctant to part with her pastries. Why did you say that? You want her to eat all of those!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's cool. I'll just get something myself if I want more\", you say sheepishly. Stacy nods and starts digging into the first of her pastries, and you start eating your muffin.

She sure does look quite a bit rounder than the first time you saw her. Her top has ridden up over a bigger belly, revealing a pudgy slab of squishy flesh spilling out in front of her waistband. Her breasts struggle to remain confided to the insufficent room her shirt has provided, with plenty of cleavage visibly jiggling with her every move. Meaty love handles form thick rolls at her sides and her arms are round and flabby. Her bulbous rear and shapeless thighs makes her tight pants seem more like a second skin than anything. Even her double chin, now visible at all times, jiggles along with her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spots you and waves, causing her arm-fat to wobble. You greet each other and head inside, ordering some burgers. You note Stacy ordering the biggest meal available. They don't call it fast food for no reason, and you soon have your meals. You find a table and take a seat. Stacy's well-padded middle bumps against the table, but she squeezes herself into place opposite you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh geez... Sorry about this\", she says, slightly out of breath from the effort of forcing her girth into place at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Stacy\", you say, but you're not completely sure what she's talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This burger is the best. I think I have been having a few too many lately\", she snickers. \"I just can't help myself. I'll take any reason to come here... like telling you to meet me here just so I can get a burger. Don't hate me okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat your burger, watch Stacy eat hers, and talk about class and stuff. Stacy's getting pretty fat, to say the least, and she's as gorgeous as ever. The extra pounds really only enhances her beauty in your eyes. You wonder what the future holds...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her non-stop eating and snacking means the pounds just keep piling on her hefty frame. She must have gotten new, bigger clothes already, she's just that big now, but her outfit looks as close to the breaking point as it always does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach waddling step she takes towards the cafeteria causes either of the two huge, fleshy globes behind her to visibly tremble. Glistening rolls spill out of her shirt and her meaty melons bounce heavily against the heaving mass beneath them as she moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an audible thud as she drops her bulk onto a chair. The table in front of her digs slightly into her malleable middle. She bends forward over her plate, and you do your best not to stare at her chest as it pools onto the table behind her pastries. As she starts to eat each bite causes her excessively round, soft face to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I drag you over here like, every day\", Stacy says between two gigantic mouthfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it\", you say. She doesn't have to drag you along anywhere, you're excited to go anywhere as long as it's with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a big bite, and crumbs fall onto the plate below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, not even good for me to eat like this. But it's so good, I just need it\", she says, licking her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but can't think of anything to say. You already said 'don't worry about it' a few seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy forces her gaze away from her pastries, and just looks at you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but seriously...\"</span></div></div>",

Her love handles that had popped up from under her shirt slightly bounced with each step. She was just a wonder to observe you couldn't help but stare.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're strolling down the street, just about to reach the burger place, when you hear a call from behind you. You turn around, and see Stacy right there down the street. She waves at you, looking quite eager and excited - you're fairly sure it's because she's getting close to a source of greasy fast food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacy,\" you say, stopping to let her catch up to you. Stacy hurries her steps to catch up, and you're amazed as the small shift in her movement sends all of her curves into an unparalleled fit of jiggles. Her besieged top is forced to endure an assault of heaving flesh as her chest crashes repeatedly against her plump torso, while her round, doughy belly attempts to flop it's way out of her shirt completely. As her tubby legs bring her closer to you, each step produces a heaving jiggle from her entire torso. You just can't bring yourself to look away as Stacy draws close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez... Phew!\" Stacy says as she clumsily brings herself to a halt next to you. You're blindsided as her chest makes a final bounce, almost surging right into your face. You are almost disappointed by the near miss. Stacy doesn't even seem to notice. \"I can't believe I'd, err, run into you right here. I thought I was going to be first!\" she says cheerfully. The prospect of a burger really seems to make her happy. And, well, the prospect of her getting a burger makes you happy too. So win-win, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head into the burger place together to order some food. You find a seat and Stacy scoots herself in opposite you. You watch with interest as she takes a couple of ravenous bites out of her burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum... I need this so bad...\" Stacy starts, before taking another bite of her burger and a big gulp of soda. \"It's like, I'm so hungry right now, you wouldn't even believe it,\" she continues. You try but fail to focus on your own burger, instead watching Stacy absentmindedly eating and drinking. She grabs a bundle of fries, bringing them to her face before promptly putting them in her mouth. Crumbs fall onto the table in front of her. You can't help but notice that her battered top is showing off a big, inviting slice of cleavage. Each time she leans forward to get another bite, there is just a hint of a wobble to her breasts, enough to emphasize just how much of them is on display. You ogle her for a moment, but then you're forced to tear your eyes away, fearing she might notice you staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy...\", you begin to say, mostly just to distract yourself. \"Maybe we should take a moment some day to really discuss our research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the project?\" she says. \"I mean, there's no rush, right? And aren't we talking about that right now anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but like, an extra meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to be eat- I mean, are we going to be at the cafeteria again?\" she says, rubbing the side of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about ice cream?\", you say, without really thinking. She lets out a surprised, amused giggle. Realizing she might actually buy in (not a big surprise, really) you give her a sly look that makes her giggle again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you... you know my weakness! I really shouldn't... I mean, I eat so much already...\" She puts down the burger and squirms a little in her seat, enough to make her belly shift slightly, beginning to hug the table between two of her squishy rolls. She's silent for a moment, seeming a little conflicted. \"I... I'd like it. I mean, I like ice cream. I think we can do it,\" she finally says. She takes another sip of her soda, and then her attention begins to drift back to the burger in front of her. You decide to start on your own meal. You already want to start daydreaming about the perfect ice cream encounter with Stacy, but there's plenty of temptations in the present, and you instead resume watching Stacy gorge on her supersized burger and fries. She pays no mind to either you or the crumbs burying themselves into that deep, perfect cleavage between her huge melons...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You kept meeting Stacy for pastries after class, and burgers when your schedules would allow, and now also ice cream every once in a while. Stacy also kept bringing snacks to class just as much as she'd done when you two first met. Although you didn't see her every day, you find it hard to believe that she weren't constantly eating even when you weren't around. Eating just seemed to be such a dominant activity in her life, and with every week, her appetite only seemed to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you first met Stacy, her meals only seemed to become more numerous. All the snacks and fast food had fueled her transformation from a thick girl to an absolute fatty. There was no mistaking that Stacy was fat, very fat even, but in your opinion Stacy was just the best. The added pounds made her go from already hot to unbelievably attractive in your eyes. Even better, her clothes were always just a bit too small to properly contain her doughy mass, leaving oh so much of her curves on display for you to admire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Stacy into class, mesmerized by your partner's elephantine ass; you're helpless to stop yourself from watching as each swing of her overly well-padded hips sends her ginormous cheeks crashing from side to side. Each step seems to transpire in slow motion, as either of the huge boulders of lard behind her is shaken, inevitably smacking into its twin in a glorious display of wobbling pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show comes to an end as Stacy squeezes into a space to sit, and instead you get a look at her upper body. Her waistline has certainly grown and her top tightly hugs a gut separated into two bulbous rolls. The top doesn't obscure much, and even as the rest of her is getting so fat, you have to believe that her big, bulging breasts are attracting a lot of attention. A little less obvious, but appealing to you in their own way, are her thick, pillowy arms that jiggle as she places down her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Stacy and sit down next to her. You notice her placing down some snacks next to her notes. There's an uneventful minute as the rest of your class gets seated. Then, you notice Stacy's right arm hesitate for a moment, but she can't resist reaching for her snack, even though there's barely been a minute since she sat down and class hasn't even started yet. She peels off the wrapper, taking a big, chocolatey bite. Licking her lips, she chews contentedly for a moment. But you think her appetite won't remain satisfied for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we going to the cafeteria after this?\" she leans over to whisper to you. There's an unmistakable groan from beneath her as she shifts her great weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you answer. Stacy seems satisfied, and heaves her considerable bulk back into a normal seated position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass is about to begin, and for a moment, you'll have to focus on something other than your marvellous partner. But you'll get back to her again soon enough.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Today her plates are packed with muffins. She slowly scoots into place, her middle immediately beginning to envelop the edge of the table. With each scoot her breasts jiggle and plop into each other, before finally coming to an uncertain rest as she reaches for the first of her treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Stacy's gotten started, she eats and eats with a relentless passion. You barely exchange a single sentence until there's just one muffin left. She looks at it for a moment, and then looks at you, flashing a faint, apologetic smile. <i>Just this last one</i>, she seems to say. But before she can grab it, a simple turn of Stacy's shoulders causes her big tits to swing to the side, smacking into the lone muffin and sending it tumbling to the floor. Stacy's round face is blank with confusion for a second, before she realizes what's just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whoops! Oh-oh my...\" she stammers, her cheeks quickly turning red with embarrassment.  \"I-I...my...bust?\" she continues, looking right into her revealing top at the ponderous pontoons looming over the now empty plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her head towards the muffin, lying upright on the floor diagonally behind her. It was really sent flying by that impact! She opens and closes her mouth a few times, looking from the muffin to you, and then back again. You do your best to look neutral, as if nothing remarkable is going on, but you can't keep yourself from watching her when she looks away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll-I'll get it,\" Stacy says after another moment of hesitation. With a little effort, she squirms out of the chair and swings around. You have a perfect angle of her pudge as she makes her way over to the muffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends over, until the flabby spare tire around her middle won't be squished any further. Her arms reach for the muffin, but there's too much fluffy fat keeping her from being able to reach her toes. She struggles; wriggling her rotund torso, keeping her arms as straight as she can, rising up and bending back over again. The muffin remains just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is quickly becoming too much for Stacy's already extremely tight pants. Her blobby legs and oversized rear remain encased in fabric, and the seams remain unripped for now, but with each effort you can see her fleshy thighs and globular ass cheeks rolling against their impossibly form-fitting casing, struggling to make room where there just isn't any to spare.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Stacy lifts herself back up. She shuffles her feet away from each other as she prepares to make another attempt at reaching her muffin. She bends over again and lets out a little squeal, her fingers reaching desperately for her treat. That's when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched her struggle, she almost had the treat, actually. Then a sound rang out across the crowded cafeteria, causing the area around the two of you to go silent for a moment. Stacy froze for a few moments. You looked down and saw a large and spreading rip in the back of her pants, though, the spreading was much quieter than the initial rip. You glanced away across the confused cafeteria goers who quickly resumed their activities. Stacy refrained from moving a bit longer, then a pudgy hand reached up and felt the hole where her pink underwear was showing through. She quickly sat upright, placing her muffin on the plate and finished unhealthily fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice seeing you today bye.\" she said flatly and quickly got up and left. You sat there watching her walk away for a bit, her gigantic cheeks shaking and jiggling with each step. When she left visual range, you thought to go comfort her, grabbing her and your things you quickly went through the same exit as her. Though she was fat, she was quick. You, however, knew her favorite parking spot. You quickly changed course to head there. You quickly got to the spot, a shady location not to far from any of the buildings that only someone with early classes like Stacy could grab. Leaning against the car, you contemplated what to say to her as you seemed to have gotten here a bit ahead of her. Then, the car beeped, unlocking. Stacy walked up hurriedly, when she got next to you, she put her large behind against the driver's door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing here?\" she asked, red-faced and red-eyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot your things in the cafeteria.\" You replied softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, thanks...\" she replied grabbing her various belongings from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be alright?\" You ask as she opens the back seat and place her things there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" she said faintly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to talk about it?\" you asked, stepping closer to her and placing a hand lightly on her soft shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip quivered. \"I dunno\" she said, hiding her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a hug?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yea\" she replied as she turned to you and quickly enveloped you in a tight hug. I felt great, her boobs and belly pressed against your torso. Her plump arms squeezing you, to which you reciprocated the hug, only not squeezing her as tightly as she squeezed you. You didn't want to seem like you were enjoying the hug <i>that</i> much. Your crotch stirred slightly though, and it didn't seem like Stacy was going to stop anytime soon. You lessened your grip on her and she gently let go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay to drive yourself home?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I've already done most of my crying anyway.\" Stacy said as she got into the driver's seat of her car, which sank slightly to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, if you need anything text me. I hope your days end well\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you.\" Stacy said looking up at you with what seemed a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y--you too\" you said as her door closed. You went slightly red in the face as she pulled out of her parking spot and drove away, curse yourself for being so awkward, but it seemed to have brightened her day, so oh well.</span></div></div>",

She sent you a text this morning, asking if you could meet her here - you said yes, of course. You figure she might not be so eager to return to the cafeteria right now, not after what happened yesterday, so instead you've brought some nice sandwiches for you and her that you could eat anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer class should just be finishing, she should be here any second now. You take a few aimless paces, your eyes fixed at the long corridor in front of you. That's when you see Stacy round the corner and appear in full view, taking the first steps into the aisle among a throng of students. She pumps her thick, thunderous thighs and swings her ponderous hips from side to side, bringing the heavy heaps of adipose that hangs off of every inch of her body into an ungainly wobble. A simple t-shirt-and-pants outfit are glued to her pompous curves, the thin fabric stretching almost into transparency across her bouncing, heaving girth. The bag containing her notes (as well as what you imagine must be countless snack wrappers) is looking comically small next to her vast plump mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy takes a few determined steps in your direction, gradually coming out of the crowd. You take a moment just to let her gorgeous puffy face, perfect hair, and big, bulbous fat rolls sink in. Then you wave and wait as she takes a few final steps until she's right in front of you. You're taken by surprise as she reaches her arms around you to greet you with a hug. Her soft, squishy embrace constricts your arms, so you can't even hug her back, and besides, you might drop your sandwiches if you tried. So you just let her hug you, enjoying the fleeting moment of being so physically close to Stacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Stacy\", you say, awkwardly frozen into place until she releases her hug and takes a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Listen, I'm sorry I left my stuff with you. You didn't have to take them to me\", she mumbles sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay\", you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have... I mean, I don't know, I just had to get out-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just, I wanted you to know, you really saved me some trouble. I don't think I could have gone back there by myself\", she says gratefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it\", you say, but really, you're flattered that she seems to have valued your help so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you are silent for a moment, until Stacy lets out a little hum. You can't miss her gaze drifting to the sandwiches you were just about to present to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these-\", Stacy gestures towards the sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I, uh-\", You grunt incomprehensibly, hesitantly holding up the sandwiches for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God yes\", she blurts out, almost before you've had the time to respond. Her hands lunge and clasp around the biggest sandwich, snatching it right out of your grasp. She's immediately licking her lips in anticipation of her next meal, holding her sandwich closely, protectively, near her chest. Her eyes dart indecisively from you to her sandwich and back again a few times, while you simply wait and watch her, wondering what she'll do next.</span></div></div>",

She quickly unwrapped hers and started eating, though not with the gusto she had had before yesterday. You slowly ate your sandwich, watching her eat. You enjoyed it, knowing the sandwich would only add to her fat figure. You reeled yourself in, though, you didn't want to be weird, especially in front of Stacy. You were half done when she finished her sandwich, balling up the wrapper and placing it in a small trash bin in the back seat. You watched her belly rolls glide across each other as she turned back around, your eyes darted up and met hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still kinda hungry...\" Stacy said, somewhat blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you said, still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we go get more food?\" she said, fishing her keys our from under her belly. <i>so hot</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's go.\" you said as you finished your sandwich and placed the wrapper in the bin. Stacy quickly pulled out of the parking spot and drove out of the parking lot. A few minutes down the road and you were in the center of a bunch of restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we go? Buger Hut? I need it, but we always go there. Oh! What Shu-Lin's? I need that too, but I don't know..\" she continued listing restaurants and how much she needed each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any of them are good, That sandwich was enough for me.\" You said as Stacy turned into a gas station to figure out where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I don't want to impose...\" Stacy said shying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really it's fine, go where you want and I'll be fine. Though, I thought you'd want to pace yourself considering yesterday.\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea, but, like, I'm hungry... y'know?\" Stacy says as she puts the car in drive. She decides to go to. </span></div></div>",

The two of you got out and you followed her as she waddled up to the door, watching as her love handles moved up and down on either side of her. You both entered and were seated, a booth. Stacy slid in and wedged herself into the seat inadvertently. You easily slid into the seat opposite her. You got a water and she got a coke. She started to get up but stopped and looked at you. \"Hey, um,\" she turned red in the face again, \"can you get some food for me? I'm kinda stuck.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything. Just fill a plate. Or two... just bring a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\" you replied, venturing forth to bringing her fattening goodies. You piled two plates with noodles, rice, seafood, fish, beef, pork, chicken, fried delicacies, and a slice of pizza. You returned to her and watched her consume it all, muttering intermittently about how she needed and deserved it all. Soon, you were back out getting a second round of plates. After you returned and  she inhaled the second round, she sent you out for a third.

It's a pretty straightforward menu here: You expect big portions of grease-dripping chicken, and not much else really. You think that Stacy might subconsciously be looking for the biggest, quickest, most fattening meal she can find. It's not hard to imagine her eating at this place, in any case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey listen...\" Stacy says, taking her hands off of the steering wheel. \"I feel like I'm dragging you around - are you sure there isn't anywhere you'd rather go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, Stacy, this is a great,\" you reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I could walk in filled to the brim with pizza or whatever, and still not be sure I could walk out without ordering anything. It's like, freaky good,\" she says, her eyes drifting to the restaurant just a short walk from her parked car. You're not really sure there's anything special with Colonel Johnson's, but you can totally believe Stacy's story anyway. The only caveat, you think, is that it probably applies to every restaurant she ever enters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think about that, Stacy gets ready to climb out of the car into the parking lot outside. You hear the sound of the car door opening and feel the slight rocking of the car's suspension as Stacy hoists her considerable mass off of the driver's seat and stands up outside. With her back turned to you, you can't help but watch as she tugs the hem of her pants over the upper edge of her massive rear - probably expecting you to be busy getting out of the car, rather than ogling her from behind. You let your eyes linger on the two planetary blobs rubbing against the seat of her pants, jam-packed with lard, separated by that long, deep, perfectly outlined crack and propped up by those dimpled, fantastically fat legs. You wonder and stare for as long as you can. When Stacy finally begins to turn around, you reluctantly avert your gaze from her body. You open the door on your side of the car as she closes the one on her side, and you get out into the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a <i>mountain</i> of chicken and condiments on Stacy's plate. It's so much food, there's just no other way to describe it. You don't know how a person could be expected to eat so much at once - but opposite you Stacy does not look suitably intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm... I can't stop myself... Where to begin,\" she hums happily, perching over the bulky brown-orange mass rising in front of her. Her bulbous breasts hover perilously close to her food, almost oozing right into the greasy, sauce-covered chicken in front of her, but she doesn't seem to notice. She lifts one dripping piece to her mouth, the clich\u00e9 fat girl about to start gorging on the fattiest of foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she starts to dig into her meal with her typical ferocity there's nothing to distract you from her greasy feast. You can't stop yourself from watching her and why would you want to? You think of how each and every piece of chicken fuels the ever-expanding layer of soft, bulging fat accumulating all over Stacy's rotund form, you focus on every jiggle and quivering movement of her round face and torso and you realize how hot she already looks in this moment. You're barely able to keep yourself from shivering in excitement and anticipation. You imagine that this must be how Stacy feels like when she sees a meal like the one currently in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't get easier for you to look away as Stacy's meal gradually dissappears from her plate. More and more pieces of chicken keep making their way into her mouth as she slowly starts to get close to finishing her meal. She reaches for more, but slower now. Her forehead's looking a little sweaty. She fans her face while her mouth processes the latest mouthful of chicken. Although it looks to you like a futile effort, you appreciate the way her doughy arm and even her chest wobbles along with the hand in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I changed my mind, I did <i>not</i> need all this...\", she suddenly moans, looking down at the still impressive mound of food in front of her. You can understand how she might feel full after all she's already eaten. \"...It's like, so much, <i>waaay</i> too much,\" she whines. However, at the same time she reaches for another mouthful of food. You watch the conflicted look on her face start to erode after only a few seconds, as she goes in for another bite, closing her eyes and continuing to fan her face while chewing slowly and deliberately. \"Well maybe. I just - Mmhm - just gotta get these last ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer regrets seem to vanish as suddenly as they appeared. For the next few minutes she somehow keeps munching greedily until there's simply nothing left on her plate. Her mountaineous meal is nowhere to be seen, all of it having gone into her voracious maw (or sprinkled as crumbs over her shirt). Despite her having eaten all that food, there are no popped buttons, no broken chairs or anything (and you're not sure what to think about that), although she does start to look a little queezy. If she wasn't full halfway through, she definitely is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both need a couple of minutes to recover and come to your senses again. Neither of you say anything. There's a content half-smile on her face, which only enhances her plump facial features and makes her look impossibly cute. After a while, she reaches meekly for you over the table. Her fingers gently brush against your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Thank you. I neede- <i>urp</i>!\" she begins to say, but ends up interrupting herself when she sort-of stifles a belch. You say nothing and probalby just stare dumbly as she quickly retracts her hand to her face and looks sheepishly to the side. You're not really sure what to do, so you do nothing. Stacy looks... awkward. After a moment of confused silence, she musters the will to look back at you. \"E-excuse me, err... now, let's get out of here. I-I think I need some fresh air\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Stacy gets onto her feet. Her shirt unsurprisingly rides up over the bottom of her belly, but she doesn't even seem to notice the big, bare slab of supple flesh that is left hanging out of her shirt as she starts to trod outside. You follow her back into the parking lot and continue to her car. Of course you can't resist the free opportunity to watch her hefty rear, ogling each big, wobbly ass cheek as it surges in tune to her ponderous movement. She stops next to the driver's door and turns around to face you. You look up at her, and your eyes meet for a moment. Is there anything any of you want to say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You quickly followed suit, anxious as to how this would turn out. You kept idle chat going while she was driving as you could see she was dozing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, you gonna make it?\" you said with a half smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, we're here.\" she replied as she turned into a parking outside a apartment building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just lead the way.\" you said as you got out of the car. She locked her car and led you to the first apartment on the left and entered it, leaving the door ajar for you. \"Lock it behind you please.\"<br>\r\nYou closed the door, locked it's strange mechanism, and turned around. Stacy was walking over to her couch, a deep impression was in the spot where she sat down. Once she was situated, she motioned for you to come sit next to her. You did, and she leaned on you, which you reciprocated, placing an arm around her, rubbing her belly slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that feels so good right now.\" she said with a slight moan, \"Rub my belly, please.\" she continued as she turned herself to free both your arms. You tentatively reached around and started rubbing her expansive belly. You felt her relax against you as an erection began to stir in your crotch. You sweated slightly: aroused, nervous, feeling her belly, in her apartment, no one around. When suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s kind of personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. She didn\u2019t catch you staring did she? You thought you were careful about it, but maybe you slipped up and she saw you as you were leaving the restaurant. You know you can\u2019t say no, so reluctantly you comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you can talk to me about anything, Stacy. What\u2019s up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy breathes a sigh of relief as she relaxes back into her seat. Still looking at her, you notice just her breathing is enough to cause her massive wrecking ball tits to wobble in her shirt, which at this point may as well be a bra given how much of her chest is oozing out, not to mention her entire stomach. Her love handles and hips are almost too big to fit in the car as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you drive me home first? I need some time to digest all this...\u201d Stacy gropes her bulging belly, squeezing it with her hands. You think for just a second that you saw her blush as she squeezed it, but it must\u2019ve been your imagination as she suddenly opens the door and heaves herself out of the car, clearly ready to switch seats and relax. You obviously take this opportunity to \u201caccidentally\u201d drop your phone, and sit in the car to watch her walk over to your side in secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass, massive as ever, you notice is just as wide as her tits are, noting how pleanty of her weight has gone to give her an hourglass figure, albeit a well fattened one at that. It has so much bounce to it you\u2019re kind of afraid of it popping out of her pants, similarly to the bounce her heaving mammaries give as they fight to escape the confines of her shirt, cleavage jiggling wildly as she slowly makes her way over to your side. Her belly may be stuffed, but it continued to jiggle about, rolls of fat bouncing up and down over her plump thighs and under her immense udders. And clearly her love handles have continued to widen from past meals, spilling over her pants and shaking as she swayed her oversized hips towards your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d You say, holding up the phone you \u201cdropped\u201d right before she has a chance to catch you staring. You turn to find her just as she stops in front of your door. Her head is above the car, unable to see you yet, and you take the time to take in her fattened form. Heaving breasts, bulging belly, widened hips, and you could actually see the top part of her ass from the front of her, due to how fat it had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally get out of the car, walking over to the drivers seat but not before noticing the vehicle shake up and down a little as Stacy dropped her full weight into the car seat. You wondered just how much she must weigh now, and how much she weighed before you met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take this turn and keep going straight\u201d. Stacy gives you directions to her house, all while giving out soft moans as she rubs her stuffed gut, not noticing you peaking glances at her overflowing cleavage. You manage to get her home without having a breast-oogling related car accident. She slowly walks up to her door, ass still swaying with the rest of her wobbling frame. She unlocks the door and walks inside, and she motions you to walk in with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a sort of small, 2 story house, kind of barren besides the large 3 seat couch and tv in one room. She reaches a set of stairs, slowly heaving her fattened body up, giving you another chance to take in her form as you follow her. Each step caused her breasts, ass, thighs, belly, and her entire body to wobble and quake as she made her way up to her room. Sitting on her bed, she looks up at you. Looks like it\u2019s discussion time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuff, finally. I need to install an elevator in here, those stairs are awful.\u201d Her fat face is beat red, from her bulbous cheeks to her full double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo hey, we\u2019ve been hanging out for like, a while. All these \u2018meetings\u2019 are starting to wear me out. I mean, I can\u2019t say no to food, but I\u2019m getting kind of worried.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what she wants to talk about now. You feel giddy with excitement, trying to hold back from showing it as you give her a somewhat clueless reply to keep her talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s nice to hang out with you. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, I can pay for all our food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles with a tired look on her face, and sighs again, causing her chest to heave and jiggle some. \u201cIt\u2019s not money I\u2019m worried about, though I would like to pay you back for all the food. No, it\u2019s... well...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings one hand to her belly, sinking it into the soft flesh as far as she can, about half of her hand disappears in between her rolls. The other hand goes under her chest, heaving it up some as she stares at it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten pretty fat. I hope it doesn\u2019t show too badly, what do you think?\u201d She looks up at you for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fat at all. You look...\u201d hesitant, you find the words, \u201c I think you look beautiful.\u201d She gives you a warm smile, blushing as her chubby face only looking bigger as the fat on her cheeks shifts. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. But I don\u2019t know about this. You really think I\u2019m not too fat?\u201d She grabs her middle, giving it a little shake, although unable to see it from over her blubbery breasts. \u201cI was thinking of cutting back on, well, some of the food I eat. But it\u2019s really hard not to give in and eat, I mean, you saw me back there at the restaurant.\u201d You vividly remember her stuffing season of chicken, dreaming of all the added pounds her meal would give to her swelling body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of it as she continues. \u201cI need some help with self control. I appreciate your thoughts, but I\u2019d still like to cut back for a bit, before I get too big to move anymore.\u201d You stop yourself from getting hard at the thought of Stacy growing so large she couldn\u2019t move, but again quickly focus back to her. \u201cI want to try some exercise, too, but I think I need some help with that, too. I don\u2019t want to burden you with my problem, but... could you help me with this and keep me from eating too much again?\u201d Shaking her stuffed belly as she spoke. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not too much trouble, maybe you could help me exercise a bit every day too?\u201d She gave you a pleading stare, one that held you with intense strength, and you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help you, Stacy. If that\u2019s what you want, let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d Her face beamed with happiness, letting you know you gave her the right answer. \u201cThanks so much, you\u2019re the best! If you could come by my place early every morning before class, that\u2019d give me pleanty of time to exercise and keep up with school. Oh, and here,\u201d she reaches over to open one of her drawers, her arm pushing her breasts enough to cause her cleavage to pour out of her shirt. She hands you a key. \u201cI\u2019m not always the greatest at waking up, so if you get here and I\u2019m not awake, don\u2019t hesitate to come wake me up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder the thought of her one morning, sound asleep under her covers, with you having to wake her up, only for her to rush out of bed, maybe even just in her underwear. The possibilities give you a feeling that this will all be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up from her bed and faces you, her fattened frame wobbling from the force. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, I don\u2019t want to keep you from leaving. I really appreciate you doing this.\u201d \u201cNo problem, Stacy. I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d You turn to walk out, only to hear the thuds of Stacy coming behind you. \u201cWait!\u201d She catches you before you walk down the stairs. She stops in front of you and, looking up, gives you a peck on the cheek, and you feel her chubby cheek touch your face with their girth as her lips hit you. \u201cI really mean it. You\u2019re the best.\u201d She blushes and gives you a big smile before she waddles back into her bedroom, giving you one last look at her wobbling ass still trying to escape her pants. You walk out the door, blushing from the kiss and all the praising from Stacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began your walk home, you thought to yourself about how you had a descision to make. You loved Stacy\u2019s growing body, every pound of it. Were you really going to help her work off that lovely extra weight she was carrying? And hey, she said it herself, she can\u2019t control her craving for food. Maybe a little bit of guiding her to higher weights could help her see it your way, and she wouldn\u2019t mind fattening up some more. But you already said you\u2019d help her, and you don\u2019t want her to get more upset over gaining weight instead of losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide to to?</span></div></div>",

You want to run upstairs to see for yourself if she's really in bed like you think she is, but you manage to control yourself and gingerly make your way to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach Stacy's room, and you see her bed in front of you. There's a big, bulging shape under the covers, and you recognize Stacy's long hair at the opposite end of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were right. It's the very first day she'd asked you to come over, and she still overslept. You witness as she twists under her covers, letting out a grunt as she lies down on her side. You look around for a light switch and flip it, causing Stacy's room to immediately light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" you hear Stacy's familiar voice as the light wakes her up, her words muffled by her hair falling in front of her face. She turns onto her back and lifts her head, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... Hey there, sorry, I overslept\", she mumbles apologetically. She raises herself onto her elbows, her covers falling down in front of her far enough to reveal her chest dressed in nothing but a sturdy bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best not to stare, but Stacy has other plans. Turning halfway to one side, she brings one hand up to her face to brush away the hair falling in front of her eyes and mouth. As she reaches over her torso, her rotund arm accidentally smacks into one of her huge breasts, jiggling the naked flesh of both ponderous appendages in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate getting out of bed\", Stacy groans as she shifts towards the edge of her bed. Her double chin, her arms and her breasts all wobble as she shuffles sideways, keeping your full attention despite your best efforts not to stare. Stacy gives you no attention in return except for one quick glance noting that you're still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stay calm while waiting for what's next. Is she going to ask you to leave before getting out of bed in nothing but her underwear?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...I don't need your help, just hold on\", Stacy mumbles as she twists sideways. She lazily pushes her covers away and carefully rolls over the edge of the bed, planting one foot on the floor to support her great weight before hefting her body over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Stacy's half-naked form tumble out of her covers. For a moment she ends up with her back turned to you and you can't help but ogle her rear. Her purple briefs might have brought some modesty to her gargantuan, bulging ass if they hadn't been so damn tight, squeezing her fleshy posterior so that her curves are almost more pronounced than they would have been had she been naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you admire Stacy's backside, she reaches in vain for some socks lying by her feet. She clumsily contorts her rotund body and stretches her arms as far as she can, putting even more pressure on her tight briefs. It's not hard to imagine them ripping apart entirely from the strain. However, before any such thing can happen, she realizes she can't reach the socks and gives up with a sad whimper, instead turning her ponderous mass around to face you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help yourself, your eyes wandering over her bulbous rolls and wide love handles, her round, droopy arms and of course her massive, meaty breasts. You notice that the bottom of her belly is tucked into her briefs, giving her a muffin top that looks pretty uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy moves one of her hands to her incredibly doughy middle, her fingers gliding into the depths between her heavy rolls. Moving her fingers along her folds is enough to make her enormous breasts jiggle back and forth inside of her sturdy bra, their size and wobbliness giving her elephantine rear serious competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that I'm a little slow today\", she apologizes meekly. \"I just need to put something on and I'll be right with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy walks over to her wardrobe, but stands there for a while without putting anything on. She looks over her shoulder at you, an unsure expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't really have any good clothes for exercising, what do you think would work?\" she wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, anything you feel comfortable in\", you answer with a shrug, struggling to hide your immense excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nods and looks back at her wardrobe again, scrounging through her clothes for a few more moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just grab a t-shirt, just a second\", she says, picking out a gray t-shirt and putting it on. When she's finished tugging the garment over her torso, it's clear to you that the t-shirt looks a bit tight and in danger of rolling up over her middle. You think just raising her arms would be enough to cause the t-shirt to retreat over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the socks\", you ask, not daring to ask 'what about pants'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looks over her shoulder, biting her lip as she views the socks on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, right\", she finally says. She turns around from you again, this time getting on her knees. You instantly notice how deeply her breasts and her belly droop towards the ground as she bends forward, almost touching the floor beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving picked up the socks successfully, Stacy rolls over onto her big butt, putting her socks on while she's sitting down. Hauling herself back up on her feet afterwards is a lengthy affair, leaving Stacy looking a little red-faced already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I guess I really needed the exercise\", she groans, her face grimacing with visible effort.  \"And it's time for the real deal. Could you show me what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that Stacy is, in fact, not going to put on pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suggest that Stacy walk up and down the stairs, since that seemed to make her winded last time you were here. She sighs at the thought, but agrees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take up a position at the bottom of the stairs before Stacy starts her first 'lap'. She easily wanders down the stairs, her magnificent blubber jiggling all the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached the bottom, she turns around to walk back up. Going up the stairs she is drastically slower, her gigantic ass cheeks wobbling weightily along with each step, but she manages to reach the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returns down the stairs, all heavy breathing and jiggling rolls, you rush up to congratulate her. Your intended high-five is overruled when Stacy locks you into a bear hug instead. Stacy's pillowlike chest and middle crash into you faster than you can understand what's happening, pressing softly against your torso while her lardy arms embrace you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me\", she whispers in your ear while hugging you tightly. \"I could never summon the willpower to do this on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it Stacy...\" you answer graciously, but there's one question you can't help but ask right away. \"...So, are you done or are you gonna go again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I guess I only walked up once\", she admits. \"I'll try it one more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of you and turning back to the stairs, Stacy begins hauling herself up once again. Reaching the top, she stops for a moment, tugging at her clothes. When she turns to face you again, you can see that she's freed her mountaineous stomach, letting it drop over the hem of her underwear. Her t-shirt has ridden up as well, leaving the newly uncovered skin completely bare. When she waddles down the stairs, her rolls bounce and flop down against her thick thighs, somehow making her tits jiggle even more vigorously in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom of the stairs, Stacy staggers to a halt, leaning her quivering bulk against the closest wall to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... I'm gonna need a shower before I sit down to study\", she wheezes. \"Maybe you can get us some breakfast in the meantime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", you respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Stacy getting out of bed in her underwear and lumbering around the house, it's just too hot for you to handle. As much as you want to stay and watch her catching her breath, you take the opportunity to go outside and get some time to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose the next question is what to get for breakfast. You see a store not too far away and decide to head there, hoping to find something delicious for you and Stacy to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your head hasn't stopped spinning for the last twenty minutes. Walking back through the door at Stacy's house, you clutched a white paper bag containing two breakfast burritos. At the corner store near by you were a bit too dazed and confused to properly inspect all the available choices, so breakfast burritos it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mental images of Stacy raced through your mind. You had never seen her like this before. The lack of clothes, the amount of jiggle, the sheer amount of exposed flab. You knew you had the hots for her, but this brought things to a whole new level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fresh air had been nice, it had calmed you down a bit. But then you heard Stacy barreling down the stairs. She was wearing an outfit you were more used to seeing on her, classroom casual. But like most of her outfits recently, it was a bit more than snug, and hugged her rolls from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we have there partner?\" She asked, bubbly as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured breakfast burritos would be good. Lots of eggs, and not a lot of carbs. I got them at the corner store just down the street.\" You informed her, trying your best to support her wishes of making healthy food choices, even if you truly desired otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\" Stacy moaned as she took a seat at the table were you had placed the bag, her chair moaning back from the large load that just sat upon it. You took a seat across from Stacy, her size still impressing you, even if half of it currently was blocked by the wooden table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer features had gotten so fat filled, no part of her had escaped her excess of calories, yet they had proportioned themselves so perfectly on her figure. Her face was much rounder, but looked even cuter than the day you met her. Her arms had gotten so thick, yet their puffiness made her skin look soft and smooth. And of course her chest had filled out quite a bit, which there was nothing wrong about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy attacked her burrito, like she had any of the other numerous meals you had watched her eat since your first after class snack at the cafe. You joined her, as you were fairly hungry yourself. Biting into the burrito you were surprised how flavourful it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally when you've gotten them the tortilla is bland and the eggs are under salted. This was much more savory than that. The burrito was obviously toasted with butter, as your fingers were shiny after holding it for only a few second. The insides were also bursting with juices, possibly from all the greasy cheese and bacon that looked it be in it. So much for a healthy meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to try and play off this quirky mistake with a joke, hoping to get Stacy to laugh, but she surprised you before you were able to speak up. \"Wow these are amazing. I've never had them before. And you said you got them just at the corner store down there? Well I'm gonna have to start going there for breakfast. I never knew a healthy breakfast could taste so good.\" She gushed, as she stuffed the final bit of grease filled tortilla in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to correct her, you need to correct her, but you hesitated. The moment was fleeting and it seemed like it would only be awkward at this point to bring it up. You knew that burrito undid all the work from this morning, yet part of you wanted to keep that a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you could correct yourself, Stacy had moved on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know what I'm looking forward to most?\" Stacy asked, snapping you from your inner thoughts? Stacy was getting up from the table at this point. You remembered that you still needed to eat your half a breakfast, as Stacy had long finished hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm whats that?\" You replied as you took another bite. Stacy's full frame was in you view again, and you couldn't help to try and soak in her curves when the opportunity presented itself, as stealthy as possible that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have to keep buying new clothes. I'm kinda embarrassed to admit it, but I've had to buy quite a bit of clothing this year. I just can't seem to fit into anything I own!\" Stacy complained. \"So I'm looking forward to fitting into some of my own clothes once I drop a few pounds. Thank you again for helping me with this, I couldn't do it without you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel an uncomfortable twinge each time Stacy mentioned her excitement to lose the marvelous curves she had blossomed over the course of this year. Stacy had still been quite the cutie the first day you met her, and just because she had transformed into your dream girl, you knew you'd still be attracted to her if she slimmed down to her original weight. You had bonded so much since starting your class project, a true friendship had formed around your continued attraction to her. You reasoned that if  once Stacy shrunk down to her formerly chubby self, you would still want to be with her, if she felt the same way. Right now it was obvious that Stacy wanted to focus on herself though, and you wanted to respect that, and not try and make a move on her while she was feeling vulnerable. She was counting on you to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo help was what you did. As the weeks rolled on some changes in the routine of your relationship changed. There were no more after class pastries, and burger joint project planning turned into Library study sessions, and there had not been an ice cream trip since Stacy had started working out. Speaking of which, was the one upside you saw in all of this. Every morning, seven days a week, you got to spend a special session with Stacy at her house, tackling the stairs. One tradition Stacy was adamant to continue were the morning breakfast burritos.Still thinking they were on the healthy side, she coerced you into believing they were the only thing getting her out of bed in the morning, even when that was really you on the days she overslept. Considering everything else she had given up, you didn't think one burrito would be that big of a detriment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month had gone by and you had started to witness some changes in Stacy already. She had gotten used to her stair routine, and was even making it up the first time without overly huffing. She still struggled with her second attempt though. Having added in a few more reps as the weeks progressed had made a difference, and also kept the jiggling scene going on longer. Thankfully Stacy was so focused on her heavy breathing, and the burrito waiting for her to finish, she never noticed the fire boiling up in your crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's stamina wasn't the only change you had noticed, but this one was more mystifying. You knew losing weight wasn't a fast process, but at Stacy's size it stood to reason that it would fairly easy to drop a few pounds just by making the lifestyle changes you had seen. The surprising thing though was that Stacy didn't look smaller, she actually looked bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having pledged to not buy any bigger clothes, it was easy to see the pounds were still coming instead of leaving. Her normal workout attire still consisted of a tee shirt, briefs, and socks. Where normally her tee shirt would reach the band of her briefs, that is before her jiggling belly made it ride up, there was now a permanent sliver of flesh peeking between the two garments no matter how much Stacy tugged at the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed by her continued gain, you came to realize the cause one morning when you went over for Stacy's workout, and she had slept in once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not even bothering to wait these days, you let yourself right into Stacy's house after only a 30 second knock. Catching her over-sleeping was starting to become more common than not, but you really didn't mind. Getting to see the heavy beauty pull down her sheets and wiggle out of bed in only her undies was a pleasant surprise on the days it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though you were in for a bit of a different surprise. Opening the door to Stacy's bedroom there was barely any light as it seemed she had drawn the shades closed, no wonder she had a hard time waking up. Flicking on the light always seemed to wake her up, but today it revealed something else as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the recessed lighting illuminated the room, you took in the sight of not only Stacy's bulbous form under the covers, but a bevy of fast food wrappers on her night stand and the floor. Trying to count them, you saw at least two large brown bags, four sandwich wrappers, maybe two empty fry containers, and two large drinks, possibly shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stirred as the lights had woken her up, her thick form jostling below the sheets. She rubbed her eyes before releasing herself from the covers. \"Nick, is that you?\" She asked as her vision cleared. A moment later she realized it was you, and also realized the mess you were now witness to. \"Omg, it's not what it looks like!\" Stacy shouted, feeling some social judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew that you felt to the contrary. You were committed to helping Stacy with her request to eat less and exercise more. It wasn't something that made you happy, but it got you closer to Stacy and that's what was most important. But it looked like despite your best efforts to help, Stacy wasn't 100% ready to commit to that new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had moved into a sitting position, but had pulled the covers back up to hide her face in embarrassment, giving her normally well defined curves more of just a bulky outline. You could hear her start to whimper and took a seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, it's not that bad.\" You came up with, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think I'm such a pig.\" Stacy sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not at all.\" You assured her. Obviously you were not able to oversee her eating habits 24/7, it's not like you two were married, hell you weren't even dating. So this had explained why Stacy had continued to gain weight. \"You know what, I think we went in the wrong direction with this whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's tears started to dry and she pulled the covers down enough to at least reveal her chubby face. \"What do you mean?\" Her eyes were a little red from crying, but still you could tell she looked directly into yours with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you kinda went cold turkey when it came to your old routine, maybe we should take a more gradual approach? You feel like you over eat, right?\" You felt kinda awkward talking about this, but hell Stacy was extremely fat, and you had been watching her workout in practically her underwear for the past month, some personal boundaries had definitely come down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sometimes.\" Stacy seemed more receptive to your support now that she was calming down, dropping her sheets even further down to her lap, fully exposing her chest packed into her sturdy bra that looked to be on the losing side of the battle. Also revealed was her impressive dome of a belly. The sheets bunched up around her waist, but a vast majority of her fleshy middle was right there in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you would do a lot better just trying to cut back a little, and not all the way. That way you're not depriving yourself and then overcompensating with a large greasy meal.\u201d You divert your gaze momentarily to see some additional wrappers you missed upon your initial inspection. \u201cAlso try and eat slower so that way you can feel when your body is full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes a lot of sense.\" Stacy agreed, you could see your words moving the cogs in her brain. \"Gosh, you really are the best. How did I get so lucky and fall into your lap?\" The sentiment sent a tingle through your groin. Although she used it metaphorically, the idea of Stacy sitting in your lap, the full weight of all her soft jiggly rolls on top of you, put a hint of butterflies in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to settle for the next best thing, as Stacy wrapped her thick arms around your neck pulling you in for a hug. Your head rested below her double chin, right on a nice plush spot above her bosom. The rest of her squishy form started to envelop you as you felt her warmth transfer to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting this moment to end, you waited for her to break off the embrace. \"I guess it's time for our workout then huh?\" Stacy surmised. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The workout went as it normally did. Her body jiggled non-stop for 10 minutes as she went up and down the stairs. On the way up you got to watch her beautiful booty quake back and forth as it fought her ever tightening briefs. On the much more rapid way down was when jigglefest really took place. Her titanic sized zeppelins proved to be far too big for even the extra reinforced bra she had packed them in. Not to mention as her belly was only getting bigger it was getting that much jigglier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to enjoy the show while Stacey got to \u201cenjoy\" the workout. As always she was left panting from the exertion and requested to go off and shower while you picked up breakfast as was your routine. But before you were able to part ways, each on your own mission, Stacy stopped you to make another admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you maybe pick me up an extra burrito?\u201d She asked. \"After you leave in the morning I may or may not poke down there for an extra one to tie me over for the morning. \" She smiled even though she was clearly a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, in her clearly too tight tee shirt, her soft body almost mesmerizing you, as you agreed to her request. Of course you would never bring it up, but you had yet more proof to explain your crushes continuing growing waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped over to the store, the fresh air and small break from Stacy helpful as always to cool your loins. Stacy, doing her part popped into the shower, and before you both knew it you were back in the kitchen ready for your usual breakfast. Pulling out four breakfast burritos, you pushed three of them in front of Stacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little surprised, since she only asked for one extra, but there was an easy to miss glint of excitement in her eye too. You were able to explain yourself before she got started. \u201cI know you only asked for two, but I thought this would be a great time to start our new plan. Have one burrito, then take a break. If you want a second after that, then go for it. And then after a second break, you have the option for a third if you\u2019re still hungry. The idea is you let your body tell you when it\u2019s full, so that way you don\u2019t over do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan my man!\u201d She said as she grabbed the first burrito with gusto. After easily finishing it she took the break you recommended to her, but it wasn\u2019t long before she was ready for the second. She ate the second one a little more purposefully, but polished it off easily just like the first. Again she took a minute, chatting with you a little bit about how she dropped a bottle of soap on her toe in the shower, and how when she went to bend over she sent three more flying. She laughed off the story, but it only left you picturing your dream girl naked in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sat there eyeballing the third burrito. \u201cI\u2019m still kinda hungry, but I\u2019m not sure if I should have it\u2026\u201d She looked to you for guidance. You were a little surprised she was still hungry after two burritos, after all they were shockingly filling. Then again you recounted some of the larger meals she had polished off in your presence during the past year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole idea is to listen to your body. If it\u2019s telling you it\u2019s still hungry then you should go for it. Better to have one more burrito now than going overboard later when you\u2019re still hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy agreed and unwrapped the third burrito. You didn\u2019t think this as how it was going to go down, but part of you was pleased with how it was unfolding. Your ideas about Stacy slowing down and really thinking about the volume of her meals really was a great idea, the only problem was in practice, Stacy was a much hungrier girl than most, part of the reason she was so thick and fluffy to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo thus came back the after class snacks, and the burger joint project planning sessions, and even the ice cream parlor breaks. Stacy seemed much more mindful about her eating, but so far that hadn't stopped her from looking like she was eating for two. Where normally a burger and fries would be a sustaining meal for one, for Stacy she started with two doubles, an extra large fry, and milkshake and was still hungry for more. You noticed that in the past Stacy was prone more to just have one really big meal. With the new plan in place she was having much smaller meals, but then going back for seconds or even thirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a sneaking suspicion that her weight was continuing to climb, and that your attempt to help, might have not been the advice Stacy was looking for.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time seems to be flying by. You've even started to think about the end of the semester. It will mean the end of your class project with Stacy, but what will that mean for your relationship? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd like to think you and Stacy would still see each other. After all, you have a key to her house and you visit her every morning. You don't think you've ever been as involved with another person's life as you have been with Stacy over the last month or two. It's amazing how much she trusts you and how highly she values your advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a little difficult balancing your time between your project, other classes and your increasing involvement in Stacy's life. Of course, you haven't forgotten about your promise to help Stacy lose weight, the reason you are so involved with her life in the first place. You try to spend as much time with her as you can spare, and you often find yourself thinking about her when you really should be focusing on other things. She's just such a lovely person, with a body that has only gotten more attractive to you as she's grown more and more overweight, you find that it's hard to stay away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how have things been going with Stacy lately?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that Stacy's exercises are still going well. Although she's not going to become athletic in any sense of the word any time soon, some part of you takes pride in watching her tackle the stairs in her home with increasing confidence. It may only be because you enjoy watching her waddling around in her underwear, but adding another turn up and down the stairs to her routine is always an exciting prospect for you. Stacy herself also seems to be eager to get through her workout, although you have a feeling that might be because she's always rewarded with her favorite breakfast afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Stacy's diet, well, you're pretty sure there is no diet anymore. You feel a little guilty about it, but it just feels right to watch Stacy gorging herself on whatever she can think of, guzzling down breakfast burritos, burgers and pastries every day in order to placate her insatiable appetite. You try to give Stacy advice that will help her get some semblance of control over her appetite, but sometimes your 'help' is more than a little counterproductive, and Stacy's ravenous hunger finds away to twist even your most genuine pointers into a simple, all-powerful command: Eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about the balance between exercise and diet? That's easy, there is no balance. The breakfast burritos that Stacy guzzles down every morning are more than enough by themselves to counter any effects Stacy's attempts at exercise could have on her figure. And that's just the first of many oversized meals that Stacy will have over the course of a day, not to mention the countless snacks that have been making their return to her daily routine lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn conclusion, not only has Stacy's efforts failed to help her lose any of her considerable weight, you're pretty sure her weight has only increased over time. Somehow your rotund dream girl has only grown even fatter since she admitted to you that she wanted to lose some weight. You're certainly not complaining, although you worry about what she will think when she realizes that her diet has not worked whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have already started to notice the effects of Stacy's failed diet, especially during her daily exercise sessions. She's wearing the same kind of clothes every day, so it's easier to compare how she looks now to how she looked just a few weeks ago. The one thing you can say for sure is that either she's getting bigger or her clothes have all mysteriously shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy has been struggling to put on her snug t-shirts lately, especially because any shirt has to somehow stretch itself over her imposing chest. Even when she's perfectly still her wide, heavy breasts challenge the integrity of any t-shirt just because of how big they are. Whenever she actually moves, her imposing melons echo every movement, bouncing up and down when she walks and swinging from side to side when she turns her torso. When she bounds down the stairs during her exercises, her humongous breasts crash into their confines with such brutal force that you can easily picture her clothes ripping themselves apart from the stress of such heavy impacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Stacy manages to cram her breasts into one of her t-shirts, there's a lot more of her left to cover, and usually not a lot of t-shirt left to do the job. While the top half of her middle can usually just about squeeze into her shirts, the bottom part of Stacy's rotund belly is always left hanging outside, spilling down in front of her hips. When she stuffs her overflowing middle into her pants or briefs it still shows up like a large, round bulge puffing out her clothes. On the rare occasion when Stacy feels daring or lazy enough to let her belly hang out fully in your presence, it's large enough and hangs low enough to obscure a lot of her briefs when viewed from the front, making her look almost naked. With her belly hanging out like that, there's so much bare skin on display that it's hard for you to even look in her direction without blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's hips and rear have only grown in width and depth as more and more fat has accumulated on her body, a catastrophic development for Stacy's poor briefs. Stacy's underpants barely manage to cling onto her girth without snapping off, squeezing her plush hips hard but keeping only a shrinking percentage of her butt encased in fabric. What used to be sturdy, well-fitting garments now routinely gets squished between two enormous, dimpled ass cheeks packed with an astounding amount of hefty, jiggling lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs obvious as these developments are to you, Stacy seems barely conscious of any changes to her body. She doesn't seem to pay much attention to her clothes coming close to ripping, furniture creaking under her weight or her body filling out spaces it used to fit in easily. She is her regular cheerful self, with her gluttonous side often taking over as soon as she spots a potential meal. Even as she speaks of trying to lose weight, her thoughts just as often turn to food, daydreaming about her next feast even as she polishes off snack after snack between meals. You imagine she's expecting to fit into her old clothes any day now, but she's practically bursting out of even her biggest outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she really is as ignorant as she seems or not, you know she's getting bigger all the time. Some day soon Stacy will be forced to reckon with the fact that she has just kept getting fatter and heavier by the day, even after she promised herself to lose weight. </span></div></div>",

As her large and lovely body slowly rose from her bed, meekly covered in her traditional triple strap bra and overstretched undies, you soaked in every additional pound of blubber that had formed on her frame. Looking wider than ever, her face looked red from just the exertion of lifting all her weight out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I think I kicked my shoes under my bed.\" Stacy claimed. Before you could react, the large lass was on her way down to her hands and knees, a feat you were worried she would not be able to get up from. You just decided to enjoy the show for now, of which made you realize just how big your class partner had become. Facing you, gravity was clearly beating Stacy's poor bra, allowing her boobs to sag all the way to the ground. The vast cleavage formed between the two supple breasts was almost too much to distract you from the fact her boobs had gotten so big they were currently dragging on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have not been positioned right, as she started to turn to the side, giving you a full view of her belly, which was too dragging on the ground. Her center mass had grown so large and round that not only had it made her wider, but was also sticking out more than ever. The additional gravity didn't help either, as it tried to pool everything down to the ground. Stacy's voyage continued until her rear was facing you, her full and supple rear. Stacy's wide ass was no match for her panties, which barely covered them. The cotton fabric was pulled tight, but showed off most of her pale dimpled cheeks. From this position though they did look like the formed a heart though, be it the largest heart you had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with her shoes in hand, she pulled the both out from under the bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stacy stands before you on top of the stairs in her home. You've taken your usual position at the bottom of the stairs, indulgently gazing upon her stationary body while you wait for her to begin her daily exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white t-shirt that she's tried to squeeze into looks skintight over her massive chest, even though most of her breasts aren't even inside of the shirt to begin with due to its outrageously revealing neckline. The stretched-out t-shirt visibly constricts Stacy's bulging curves, clinging hard onto the malleable rolls below her chest. The constrictive fabric comes to an end above Stacy's deep, cavernous belly button, letting plenty of her bulging stomach hang out unimpeded and totally uncovered. Even better, today is one of those special days when Stacy didn't bother to cram her belly into her briefs, so everything from her belly button to the very bottom of her belly is naked and visible, hanging like a thick, round, heavy apron in front of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're intending to continue your exploration of Stacy's scantily clad body, but a familiar voice calls out to you, bringing you back to your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello? Do I go now or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. You wince when you realize you've been staring at Stacy for far too long. Again. It's so hard to resist, you love to admire her extremely chunky physique, and the way her small, tight clothes dig into her soft exterior only tempts your gaze even more, despite the risks of being discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Stacy's face and she looks right back down at you, shrugging her shoulders, waiting for you to do something. Feeling a little sheepish after getting caught ogling her, you just nod your head in Stacy's direction, letting her know she can begin her descent down the stairs whenever she wants to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy takes the hint and begins to move her bulky legs, stairs creaking under her weight as one heavy stomp follows another. Her titanic breasts batter her undersized t-shirt as she walks down the steps, overpowering all attempts at resistance from her bra with their sheer size and heft. The jiggling of her middle is kept somewhat tame by her constricting t-shirt, but the part of her belly that's fully bared swings freely back and forth in front of her hips, hanging so low that it keeps smacking into her thighs as she walks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the distracting show of jiggling blubber, Stacy makes good time down the stairs. With one final stomp she reaches the bottom, placing herself right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad huh?\" Stacy says with a snicker. The little motion is all that's needed to make her chest jiggle, her breasts even more outside than inside of her shirt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah not bad, but you're just getting started!\" You say, nodding excitedly in Stacy direction, hoping she didn't catch you staring at her breasts again. You can't wait to see more of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy flashes you a quick smile before she turns her back to you. She eyes the stairs from the bottom this time, readying herself to heave her full-figured frame all the way to the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts a bloblike, naked thigh, drooping with doughy flab, setting her foot down on the first step. She shifts her weight and shuffles her hefty hips, her ass cheeks dangling out of her cramped underpants like enormous bags of quivering jelly. She lifts her other leg, just as thick and droopy as the first, and the whole process repeats before your eyes. Stacy's path up the stairs is a slow, ponderous process, nothing at all like her dramatic descent. You busy yourself with watching her panties gradually disappearing into the deep chasm of her engorged, jiggling rear as she moves further and further away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrives at the top with little fanfare, flashing another smile your way from her new perch before she starts thundering back down the stairs. Her feet slam against the steps, her breasts pounding away at the last bit of stability provided by her wavering bra, her globular, blubbery arms flailing along at her sides. The constrictive white t-shirt retreats up her middle towards her overdimensioned chest, her unveiled rolls clapping against each other as they begin to jiggle unhindered by the thin fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy barrels her way to the bottom of stairs with every part of her body jiggling, her unruly masses on the verge of destroying her threadbare clothing once and for all. She clumsily waddles to a halt in front of you just in time to ward off disaster, letting her rippling curves settle bit by bit while she bends over and takes a few seconds to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain in place and wait until Stacy's ready to begin her second attempt at scaling the stairs. Her plump thighs struggle to heave her incredibly hefty body up one step at a time, her underpants remaining thoroughly wedged between the unwieldy sacks of fat bouncing back and forth behind her. The exertion leaves her face flushed and her chest heaving with rapid, heavy breathing when she finally reaches the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Stacy first started her exercises, she wouldn't have been able to go much longer than this. Back then she was already astoundingly fat, but now her figure is bulging out even more in every direction. It would stand to reason that every additional pound of fat accumulating on her body would make her exercises more difficult, so it's all the more impressive to watch Stacy waddle back and forth on the stairs for minutes on end. Of course, each consecutive run up and down the stairs drains more and more of her already diminished reserves of stamina. Every time she gets to the top or the bottom of the stairs she has to take longer and longer pauses just to catch her breath, her chest rising and falling in tune to her increasingly heavy huffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Stacy staggers into your arms upon completing her last run down the stairs she looks like a wreck, her face having gone from flushed to beet red, sweat staining her shirt and running down her exposed skin. You let her cling to you, her soft, doughy mass pushing into your core like a very big and heavy pillow, her sweltering body heat radiating against your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like the room gets several degrees warmer while you remain in Stacy's embrace, trying desperately to contain yourself in such proximity to her. The more perverted corners of your mind imagine sinking into her glistening, wide-open cleavage and burying your face between her sweaty breasts, or giving her hanging belly or bulging rear a slap and watching it jiggle in front of you. It feels wrong to even think such thoughts while Stacy literally leans on you for support, so you draw on every last bit of resolve to stay calm. As weird as your thoughts may get, you don't want to become the creep who would take advantage of Stacy's sincere trust in you just to make one saucy vision come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at her sweet, pudgy face, sweat dripping from her brow all the way past her severely drooping double chin, her wide cleavage still glistening invitingly below. She meets your eyes for a moment, but then she moves her head out of your field of view until you feel it softly nudging your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to the shower,\" Stacy sighs in your ear, still huffing before and after she speaks. \"You'll have my burritos when I get back, right? I'm <i>starving</i> over here!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmm, do I smell breakfast?\" Stacy's familiar voice hums excitedly, accompanied by the weighty sound of your obese classmate's steps coming closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already seated at the breakfast table, ready with four burritos - one for you and three for Stacy, as she has started to expect by now. Although the thud of her footsteps warns you of her approach, you're not prepared for the sight that comes around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy appears in nothing but her underwear - not the same set she wore in bed, but just as tight around the rolls of blubber hanging from her rotund frame. She's no longer a red-faced, sweat-stained wreck, looking refreshed from her shower and change of clothes, but you notice her huffing a little just from walking the small distance from her bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy begins to waddle towards the table, her obscenely fat thighs smacking together with each step she takes. As she moves, the massive apron of jiggling lard hanging from her hips shakes with a great deal of heft to it, as does the gargantuan breasts bursting out of her bra. With obvious effort she makes her way closer and closer to the table until the edge bumps into the middle of her belly, which hangs down far below the table's surface even when Stacy stands up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that smells so delicious, I need it\", Stacy mumbles to herself as she bends over the table slightly, licking her lips with anticipation. She cranes her neck forward to see her food over the enormous pontoons below her drooping chin, but she bends over even further in the process, causing her heaving tits to drop further down towards the table surface, until they land right on the burritos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's breasts glide on top of the greasy wrappers as she closes her eyes, taking another whiff of the irresistible scent of her breakfast. You're starting to think she'll reach out a grubby hand and start eating before she's even sat herself down, but then she thinks better of it and straightens herself back up before beginning to make her way around to the opposite end of the table. You take the chance to ogle her rear as she moves away from you, noticing her sprawling ass cheeks positively swallowing her tiny underpants in between the two huge boulders wobbling behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Stacy reaches the other side of the table. She pushes her chair back, making space for her immense bulk between the backrest of the chair and the table's edge. With enough room secured, she shuffles into place in front of the chair and lets herself drop onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>KRRRRRRRRK!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's supersized booty plummets down onto the chair, the impact producing a piercing creak from the poor piece of furniture. You do your best not to make a grimace while Stacy ignores the noise, jiggling in place slightly as she settles herself on a seat that doesn't suit her current size at all. Her conspicuously flabby rear is just too big to fit on the seat, while her hips and legs are so wide and bloated with fat that they spill over both sides of the flimsy little chair, her bunched-up belly blocked from falling into her lap by the thickness of her globular thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy proceeds to scoot herself into place by the table, her chair continuing to creak underneath her grotesque weight. You're half expecting the chair to suddenly snap in half at any moment, but nothing happens. Stacy arrives safely in place at the table, rather than on the floor with a broken piece of furniture crushed beneath her giant ass, this time at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten seated properly, Stacy leans in eagerly towards her highly anticipated breakfast, which is still on your side of the table. You notice her breasts pooling onto the table surface, joined by a burgeoning fold of belly fat oozing over the edge of the table as it digs into Stacy's bulging gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how eager she is to eat, you pass Stacy the first of her three meals, leaving the other two at your side of the table, out of her reach for the moment. She deftly grabs and unwraps her breakfast, digging in without any further ceremony. Her jaws seal around the burrito, taking a big bite and sending crumbs spraying everywhere, bouncing off of Stacy's chest and the table in front of her. She eats like a woman possessed, her fat cheeks and drooping chin wobbling as she aggressively chews her food and then dives back in for another bite. The huge burrito vanishes before your eyes, Stacy gulping down mouthful after mouthful while you're too distracted to even open the wrapper on your own breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get a chance to clear your head until Stacy has devoured the entire meal, licking her fingers and leaning back in her seat for a well-deserved break. She's supposed to wait and make sure she's still hungry before she continues to eat, giving you a much-needed opportunity to catch up with your own breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a first bite, savoring the greasy, filling and delicious contents while Stacy leans back onto the table and watches you intently, a bit of a reversal of roles for once. However, before you can dive in for a second helping Stacy clears her throat and diverts your attention from your meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think you could help me with something after this?\" Stacy says softly as you look up from your food. You notice her eyes lingering over the remaining two breakfast burritos at your side. You consider handing her one, but she really should be taking a break before eating any more, or her chair might decide to break down underneath her after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, what do you need help with?\" you respond, curious to hear more. Of course you'll help her no matter what her problem is, whether it's about school or something more... private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing, as you know a lot of my, um, old clothes don't exactly fit me anymore...\" Stacy continues, hesitating slightly to mention her wardrobe issues. She looks up at you for a moment, but as soon as she realizes you're about to meet her gaze, she nervously turns her eyes back to the burritos next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder where this story is going. Stacy's old clothes haven't fit her in months, that's hardly a new development. Could it be that she's here in her underwear because she had trouble finding <i>anything at all</i> to put on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So I'm thinking, if it's not too much trouble, could you come up to my room and help me look for something that still fits?\" Stacy pleads, picking at the greasy, empty wrapper in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... wow,\" you grumble, but only because your vivid imagination has already began to distract you with ideas of how this situation will turn out. You're going back up to Stacy's room, watching her in her undies while she tries on a bunch of almost certainly undersized clothes? There's no way you're turning down that opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, yes, of course I'll help!\" you clarify when you come to your senses, nodding your head for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much! This is so embarrassing, but I trust you not to giggle behind my back,\" Stacy gushes, giving you a heart-melting smile that you can't help but return in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou momentarily forget about your responsibilities, taking pity on Stacy and handing over her second burrito even though she's only taken a break for a minute or two at most. The third one slides across the table not much later, bouncing into the bulging fold between Stacy's mountainous breasts, staining her pristine skin slightly with grease. Stacy happily laughs off the little accident and gulps down the rest of her breakfast with glee while you force yourself to attempt to match her pace, eager to go to her room and see what sort of scene might play out there.</span></div></div>",

You've been in a lot of flesh filled situations with Stacy, but this would be a new one. Giving her wardrobe a good look for the first time this year, you realize just how much clothing the girl owns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had always found Stacy pretty fashionable. That was one of the things that caught your eye the first day of class, that and the pounds beneath the clothes. A lot of big girls didn't seem to have the best fashion sense, but even as Stacy had grown this past year, she maintained a cute collection of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were now looking at them, a rainbow of colors, and all sorts of different styles. You had no clue about women's fashion, or men's fashion for that matter, you just knew she needed a top and a bottom. For as fashion savvy as Stacy was she didn't seem very organized. There were clothes everywhere. Some hanging, some folded, multiple piles on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm ok so where to start? Do you know like what absolutely doesn't fit, maybe?\" You ask, trying not to sound like you're telling her she's too fat for most of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know the stuff over here doesn't really fit...\" She went on and on explaining what everything was, but you got pretty lost from the start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you considered donating clothes that don't fit anymore?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well once I lose a few more pounds with your workouts, I'll hopefully be able to fit in all this stuff again.\" She said encouragingly. \"It's just my newest stuff must have all shrunk in the wash recently.\" You now realized just how bad her denial was. You felt bad because she had asked you to help her control her weight, and she had only continued to gain more. It wasn't really your fault, as both your plans were well intentioned, but just back fired. Maybe it was time she got on a scale and saw the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now we stuck with clothes. If you were going to be any help, this mess needed to be cleaned up first. You took the liberty of starting to organize anything and everything. Stacy told you what things were, and you folded and found a good enough spot for it. After things were looking ship shape, her closet was looking much better, but you came to realize not everything was going it fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a decent size pile of clothes Stacy admitted she hadn't worn since shortly after classes had started in September, and you could tell why. \"So maybe we part with these clothes, they way you can stay organized and be able to find things that fit better?\" You recommended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's chubby face looked conflicted. \"Aww but I love some of those outfits. Are we sure I need to get rid of them? I've been doing so good about eating only when I really <b><i>need it</i></b>. Maybe by September they will fit again.\" She dreamed. \"Here look, I'll try this shirt on that I love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was about to start. You didn't know how the idea of Stacy wearing more clothes excited you, she had been super exposed this whole time in her I'll fitting underwear. Maybe it was the ensuing jiggling, or the fact tight clothes was a turn on, you just knew you wouldn't go anywhere else for the world right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw the shirt over her head. The shirt was pretty big, but Stacy was just that much bigger. She slowly rolled it down over her huge melons, meeting resistance at every inch. Even past her Hooters it was a tight squeeze. With how wide she had gotten, and how thick her back was, even getting it over the middle of her torso was an issue. The bottom hem finally arrive just above her waist, well at least where her waist would be if it wasn't buried in layers and layers of fat. In actuality it rested just above her belly button, not able to start braving over her supple love handles. With her apron like belly hanging way over her panties these days, most of her stomach hung out of the shirt. Even the cuffs on the sleeves were so tight they dug into her puffy arms, pushing any mass they could out. The front of the shirt had a green cartoon dinosaur from a video game stretched tightly across her chest, something that couldn't be very comfortable for Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure if you should make the first comment. This shirt was living proof how ludicrously fat Stacy had gotten this year. Part of you was relived that maybe this was the message Stacy needed to realize how much weight she had truly gained. The other part of you just though about how hot she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Stacy spoke first. \"I guess you're right, these old clothes just don't fit like they used to. It's time to get rid of them.\" Well no big grand message gleaned there, but hey it was a start to the clothing problem.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that her clothes have been sorted and arranged into various piles, Stacy begins to look for something to wear to class. You're not sure what you can do to help, so you just hang around in her room and try your best not to gawk at her half-naked body too often, which is much easier said than done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I want to try that blouse! It's so cute, but I haven't worn it a while\", Stacy excitedly points towards the top item in one of the piles you've placed on top of her bed. Taking the opportunity to make yourself useful, you walk over to the pile and pick up the top item for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one?\", you say, holding up a patterned garment with buttons running down the middle. Stacy nods and gratefully takes it out of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly becomes apparent why Stacy hasn't worn the blouse for some time - it is simply nowhere near big enough to contain her vast girth anymore. From the very start she struggles to squeeze her puffy arms into the blouse, stretching the fabric above and beyond its maximum capacity, just about splitting the seams outright as she forces one flabby appendage at a time into the garment. With her arms inside, the blouse has been stretched out so tightly over her fleshy folds that you swear you can see her pale skin right through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her arms more or less covered, Stacy tries to close the severely undersized blouse over her middle. She tries her best, but she can't bring the ends together over her great mass, failing to do even a single button. She stubbornly responds by pulling harder at the blouse, squeezing her rolls tighter and tighter as she tries to force the garment to close up. The ends get closer to each other, but despite her efforts the button in her hand still gets stuck before it can fully reach across her bulk. No matter what she does, her middle remains too much of an obstacle for the blouse to be able to cross. Her resolve eventually runs out and she gives up, letting the ends fall away on both sides of her bulging love handles and fully revealing the gargantuan gut hanging down in front of her underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this <i>really</i> doesn't fit anymore\", Stacy states, peeling the blouse from her arms and dropping it right on top of the pile of discarded clothes at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the same deal with the next item she tries on, a pair of jeans that look large on their own, but not anymore when they are measured against the immense size of Stacy's lower body. It takes several minutes of hard work for Stacy just to hoist the skintight garment inch by inch up both of her astoundingly well-padded legs, leaving her flustered and huffing with her pants still stuck below her enormous rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not supposed to be this hard!\", Stacy grunts as she shuffles her wide hips, tugging uselessly at one end of her jeans and then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely makes any progress getting her jeans over her rear end, pulling increasingly violently at the hem and shaking her hips, causing her extremely hefty booty to bounce and sway. It's a real workout for a girl of Stacy's size, and the exertion quickly leaves her face flushed and her breathing heavy. She huffs and puffs as she tries bouncing up and down, accomplishing nothing other than tiring herself out and jiggling her blubbery rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working, these don't fit either\", Stacy wheezes under her breath as her vigorous movement grinds to a halt, her undulating curves continuing to jiggle for a moment after she stops bouncing. With a resigned look on her face she strips right back down to her stretchy underwear once again, pushing her jeans into the discard pile when she's done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry this is taking so long, I really thought I'd have found something by now\", she apologizes to you, her eyes locked at the pile of clothes at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Stacy, there's no need to rush, just take your time\", you respond, hoping to reassure her. You notice her twisting her shoulders to get her humongous melons out of the way as she looks down towards her feet, but you're not sure that's enough to give her a clean view. You wonder how much she can really see over her bulging chest and huge stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I just keep going <i>something</i> has to fit for sure\", she shrugs, finally lifting her gaze from the ground. You're not so sure about that to be honest, but you don't see any reason to voice your concerns just yet. Who knows, some of these clothes might fit just fine for all you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the next item Stacy tries on you can already tell will be a disaster from the start. You thought it took a long time for her to get into her jeans, but now she tries to squeeze her incredibly hefty bottom half into a skirt that she can't possibly have worn for months. After struggling for more than a few minutes, the clearly too small garment just about reaches the widest part of her hips and then won't go any higher. Stacy tugs hard on the garment, but her girth is just too much for the skirt, it cannot go any further. She tugs in vain again and again, nothing happening until a sudden ripping noise sounds out, leaving Stacy frozen in place with her skirt halfway up her incredibly expansive rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\", she hisses at you, her eyes going wide as she stops in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard <i>something</i>\", you admit, hoping you don't look too surprised - or too excited, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that... me?\" Stacy whispers anxiously. She moves her hands around her skirt but doesn't seem to find anything drastically wrong, so she waits for you to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't see anything out of place from here\", you answer her, and it's true. Despite the ominous sound, Stacy's skirt remains firmly stuck around her hips, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think these are gonna fit, I'm gonna take them off\", she decides, her voice trembling and her eyes avoiding to meet yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her words, Stacy reverses course and carefully begins the process of tugging her tight-fitting skirt back down along her lower body. She picks at the hem with her chubby fingers, but the skirt won't just instantly drop to her feet like she wants it to. The garment continues to cling to her extremely thick thighs as she struggles to free herself, her rotund limbs emerging very slowly out of their skintight casing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of her legs are finally freed, she picks up the skirt with her feet and lobs it towards the discard pile - there's no doubt where that particular garment belongs. She's once again standing in front of you in nothing but her underwear, having failed to find even a single garment that still fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand what's happening, I remember these clothes fitting so much better than this\", Stacy sighs, shaking her head at the sight of the big pile of clothes at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall seeing her in some of these exact outfits in the past, and now that you think about it you also remember them fitting much better. Of course, in your mind it's all too obvious where Stacy's recent wardrobe troubles are coming from. It feels a little ironic that ever since Stacy started talking about changing her diet and getting some exercise, she has packed on so much weight that she can't even fit into her clothes anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you thinks it's about time to break the news to Stacy. It's only a matter of time until some incident or another will make her realize how much weight she's gained recently. Maybe it's for the best to let her know right now, perhaps it might even help her deal with the whole wardrobe situation somehow. On the other hand, you have no idea how she'll react and the last thing you want is to make her feel bad about herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what to do, but the two of you can't remain in Stacy's room trying on clothes forever. You have to get to class at some point, and before then you're going to have to make a decision. Do you let Stacy know the real reason why her clothes no longer fit?</span></div></div>",

Mmm this is good too.\" Betty said. \"Marvelous now try this one.\" you say with another tray. \"Uh do I have to eat the whole thing?\" Betty said her small belly beginning to fill up. \"Welllll I guess not just take a nice big bite.\" you say, you wouldn't want her to vomit, plus you had 90 days to fatten her up, she'll need time to get her stomach accustomed to heavy feasting.

You knew she wasn't your fat princess.<br>\r\n     \"Okay Betty you've been a wonderful taste tester but I'm afraid it just isn't working out.\" You say. \"Phhhf whatever.\" Betty replied. \"Feel free to keep your uniform.\" you offer since the uniform had stretched and tore at the seams plus you couldn't help but admire how cute her fatty body looked in that dress. Betty waddled out the bakery while you gazed upon her swaying ass. \"Okay time to hire a new taste tester and start all over again.\" you say with a hopeful vitality.<br>\r\nThe next day a new girl applied for the job...</span></div></div>",

She was Anna a green eyed, blonde girl who fashioned her hair into pigtails, but her 5fot 4in body was rail thin, perhaps 100 pounds, well deserving of a good fattening. You two greet one another in the usual manner each exchanging information and taking a liking to each other.  \"Heres your uniform Anna\" you say noticing her eyes lit up. \"Oh how cute!\" Anna exclaims as she grasps the dress as she goes to another room to change. Within 5 minutes Anna returns wearing the german dress \"How do I look?\" Anna gleefully asks as she does a twirl. \"Why you look splendid Anna.\" you say picturing her 50 pounds heavier. \"I better not push her too hard too fast. A more gradual gain will be less obvious to her, plus I may be able to blossom her appetite while keeping her unaware of her growing body.\" you think to yourself. \"Now how about we get started Anna I just baked this triple layered chocolate cake and I need to know if its acceptable.\" you say slicing Anna a generous portion. \"MMM! its yummy!\" she says praising your culinary skill. \"Well I uh I do know my way in a kitchen.\" you say slightly flustered. \"You're such a great cook\" Anna says licking her chocolate stained lips. \"You seem to be enjoying that\" you say. \"Oh yes I hardly ever get to eat sweets like this, growing up my mother prohibited me from eating sweets in the house.\" she said. \"Really she must have been a health nut huh.\" you reply. \"Oh not at all my mother was actually quite fat, she had a real sweet tooth but just didn't want me to end up like her.\" Anna said. Upon hearing this you rejoice in an unbound elation. She was only skinny because she was under a strict diet, even better she's genetically prone to being fat, plus with the speed and joy of how she consumed the cake was encouraging. \"Oh well uhhh...I've got to go work on some muffins Anna. I'll call you to test them hen they're ready.\" You say anxious to feed her more.  As you feverishly mix the muffin batter you conjure up your plan for Anna's gain.   </span></div></div>",

Anna showed no signs of recalcitrant behavior as she happily scarfed down all samples you baked even appearing naive about her developing flesh.

Anna radiated with feminine grace as she enhanced her body through her constant consumption of sweets. Her massive boobs oozed out of her taut german dress which was tearing at the seams. Anna's belly currently strained the tenuous dress to the point of a near shredding. Her massive ass constantly emerged from beneath the uniform now riddled with jiggling flesh and cellulite. Her legs once trim and toned now wobble with excessive lard as she waddles to her next meal while her arms filled with squishy jelly shaking with movement.

As she stepped through the door, you got a good view of the young woman. She had dark hair and was certainly good looking. It didn't hurt your assessment of her that she was a little more, well, <i>average</i> than your previous testers. And when you say average, you might actually mean she was a bit rounder than most, just not as big as you'd dreamt. She already had a tubby, pillow-like middle, well-rounded thighs and an even rounder rear. Even her cute face looked round and soft, with full, pretty lips that already seemed eager to try out your fabulous baked goods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a head start with this one, but that didn't mean you shouldn't get to work right away. You greeted her and showed her around, making sure to fill her senses with the smell and sight of doughnuts, cakes and all the other things she would soon be paid to be eating. <br>\r\n\"So this is really it? This is like, my actual job? I eat it and tell you if it's good?\" Bridget comments as you show her the place were she is to sample the goods you have already lined up on a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to make sure every single thing I make is good enough. My reputation depends on it!\", you reply dramatically. \"I can promise you this, you won't run out of work. I'm always trying new things. In fact, There's more of these coming up right now\", you continue, and point at one of the pastries on the table. \"Also, these. And those. The ones over there, too. So, I'd like it if we got started right away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bridget begins to have a seat at the table, you recall her outfit. You knew this situation lacked something, and that something was a cute german dress. You zip out of the room to get one out of your outrageously well-stocked supply, and come back to find Bridget taking a huge, crumb-producing bite out of a delicious muffin. You're entranced by bits of muffin dropping onto her cleavage, you can't help yourself from watching as she brushes them off, drawing attention to her pleasantly pudgy chest. Oblivious to your staring, she simply proceeded to take another greedy bite. You place the german dress down close by, and get back to work. That's exactly the kind of initiative that you like to see, but you can't know for sure if it's going to last. Still, you can dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Regardless of how your plan worked out, you hoped she would be able to stick around--you could really use the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These,\" you said, gesturing to the tray, \"are the new tiramisu pastries, adjusted to your specifications.

The jeans she had worn on her first day were noticeably more snug on her thickening legs, the button having been long undone. Her olive-green tank top exposed her softer arms, with not a hint of muscle tone remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your eyes were drawn to her belly, spilling out of her tight top, round with food. You'd watched it blossom from the tiniest bulge of pudge to a full-fledged paunch, jiggling with every step and billowing onto her lap every time she sat down. Her shirts covered it less and less with every passing day, until eventually all of her tops were midriff bearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the way she was eating, it was only going to get bigger.</span></div></div>",

You had more baking to do, and you knew that your pastries would get consumed that much more ravenously when nobody was around to make the taste tester self-conscious.

Business was growing, and your taste-tester seemed to take just as much pleasure in her work as you had hoped she would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks you kept baking, and Bridget kept tasting, more and more pastries weighing her down as she left the bakery every day.

You headed over to Bridget's \"office.\" You found her slumped back in her chair, blissfully nibbling on some sweet bread, the button of her jeans undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at you as though you'd snapped her out of a trance, but smiled after she recognized you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just...\" she quickly scarfed down the rest of the pastry, stifling a burp when she was done. This girl could eat, no doubt about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply as she rubbed both hands over her swollen midsection, Bridget slowly heaved herself out of her chair. You helped her up onto her feet, for which she was grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have anywhere in mind you'd like to go?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Bridget's face began to turn red. \"... Would you mind if we stopped by my place for a bit? These clothes are...\" She grabbed the lapels of her jeans for emphasis. \"Well, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget saw your reaction. \"I'm sorry! I know it's a little forward, but I REALLY feel like I should--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's totally fine!\" you stammered. \"Whatever makes you... comfortable! Yes, comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smiled bashfully, looking down. \"Thank you. It's not that far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course, no problem.\" You offered her your arm. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget relaxed and linked her elbow with yours. On your way out, Bridget grabbed a cupcake from the counter. You gave her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really good!\" she said, taking a bite. You shook your head amusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 15-minute walk, you were standing in Bridget's apartment, waiting for her to get dressed. You looked at your reflection in the mirror and fussed with your hair. You wished you had worn nicer clothing today, but given the spontaneity of the night, you really couldn't blame yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps. You turned around, and the sight before you almost knocked you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Bridget, all pressed up in a black-and-white dress that may have fit perfectly 15 pounds ago, but was looking a little tight around the middle. Her belly strained against the fabric, the soft indentation of her navel only being obscured by the vertical black stripe running the length of her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zip me up?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, dumbfounded. She turned around, and you did your level best not to just stare at her plump derriere, which looked fit to burst from its satin constraints. You made your way over to her. Gently, you placed one hand on the nape of her neck and began to ease the zipper up with the other. You encountered resistance from her recently enlarged frame, but tried not to make a show of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uhhh... You never answered my first question,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have anywhere in mind you'd like to go for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

You could already notice her steps being a little stiff and awkward now that she'd squeezed herself into that tight, undersized dress. And as for you, you had a hard time keeping you eyes on anything other than her, what with the way her garments pinched and hugged every round, pudgy inch of her burgeoning curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Bridget out of her building. You walked for just a couple of minutes, before she held up her arms and pointed at another building in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there it is! Told you it was close\", she cheered. You nodded at her, and then looked up to read the sign in front of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lorenzo's</i>. You could swear that you'd seen that name somewhere before, but you couldn't quite put your finger on it. For what it was worth, the restaurant in front of you looked like a cozy, relaxed place. Not too fancy, but not too tacky either. For a dinner date on a random workday evening, it would do perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looks good\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-mm, I'm starving, let's head inside\", Bridget hummed. After everything she had already eaten today, it seemed silly that she could still be hungry at all. Yet, here she was, still eager to chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you headed inside the restaurant. You quickly got a table, and you sat yourself down opposite to Bridget. She impatiently awaited the opportunity to order her food, passing time licking her lips, twirling her hair and idly picking at the straps of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should totally get the pasta. Trust me, it's too good\", she asserted. \"Don't even think about getting anything else, I mean, I know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right\", you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be warned, they're <i>big portions</i>. Too good to resist, though\", she said, trailing off for a moment before continuing. \"You let me know if you can't finish it. I mean eating is my job after all, and I'll never complain over too much pasta\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could easily believe her. It seemed impossible that Bridget could ever have too much food put in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter arrived to take your orders. Bridget confidently ordered pasta for both of you, and sent him on his way. As you got back to waiting, Bridget continued to talk about food, before pivoting to the related subject of her job at the bakery. She told you that her friends couldn't believe she was getting paid to eat - erm, taste test - at a bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And I'm always like, yeah, it's as great as it sounds. And you know what\", she suddenly stopped to look you in the eyes. \"The baker is really, really nice too\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her sentence, her cheeks immediately turned a little red, and she looked away from you to twirl her hair again. At the same time, you felt yourself filled with joy and excitement from her compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridget, I'm so happy you feel that way. I feel the same way about you, it's been great to be with you all these days at the bakery\", you said with a smile. You couldn't have hidden how pleased you were even if you had wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been loving it so far\", she hummed, before turning her head and looking into the rest of the restaurant, towards the kitchen. Just at that moment, you could see two waiters appearing, carrying plates right towards your table. They were possibly the biggest plates you'd ever seen, and you remembered Bridget's words about the big portions served here. Just how much food were they about to put in front of you?</span></div></div>",

But there portions were just too much for you to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you could pay all that much attention to the food in front of you, anyway. Bridget was far too enchanting of a dinner partner for that. She did most of the talking, but you didn't mind. Beyond the bakery, you didn't really have much else in your life going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a pre-Law student in college,\" Bridget said, stuffing a mouthful of pasta into her mouth. \"(God, this pasta is amazing.) Thought I'd become a corporate lawyer or something. Something secure, lots of benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget shrugged, chasing a meatball with her fork. \"I dunno. Something didn't click.\" She took a bite from her meal. Her eyes closed and you heard get moan quietly in pleasure. Her attention snapped back to you. \"There's just so much more I could be doing, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thinking of anywhere to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget paused, chewing on some steamed vegetables as she pondered the question. \"Immigration, probably. My dad came here from Iran in the '80s. Pretty close to home for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Her eyes widened and she set her fork down. \"Oh my God, there's this great Persian place a few blocks from here. They're closed, but we HAVE to go sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. She must really like you if she's already thinking about going out with you again. \"I'd be down. Always good to broaden your horizons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure!\" Bridget said, taking another forkful of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why the job at the bakery, then?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta pay rent somehow. Law school's expensive.\" Bridget put a hand to her mouth, stifling a burp. \"(Excuse me.) Plus, I just really like to eat,\" she added, putting a hand on her belly. \"If that wasn't obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted in your seat, your face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget laughed. \"Hey, it's not like I can hide it. I haven't gone clothes-shopping in forever. This dress is the biggest thing I own that actually looks good, and it's <i>still</i> really tight.\" She plucked one of the straps for emphasis, before rubbing the strained fabric stretched taut over her belly. \"Especially around the middle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could've sworn you felt the sweat dripping down your neck. This was too much for you to handle. Your eyes darted down to your still mostly untouched plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna finish that?\" Bridget asked, pointing at your meal with her fork. Her eyes were bright with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her plate and almost fainted right there. Even after a whole day of stuffing herself with sweets, she had still managed to polish off about 80% of the biggest, richest serving of pasta you had ever seen. And here she was, asking for yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't think so,\" you said, pushing your plate towards her. \"It's really good! Just... More than I can handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget perked up. She brought your serving greedily towards her, scraped remainder of her meal onto your plate, and dug in. You watched her as she relished every forkful that passed her lips. Bridget ate with gusto and showed no signs of stopping. Was there a bottom to her appetite?</span></div></div>",

With every additional mouthful making its way into her maw, you felt your jaw drop a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your eyes as Bridget finally and definitively leaned away from a completely empty plate. On top of everything she'd eaten at the bakery, she had finished most of your giant meal, as well as all of her own equally imposing serving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget let out a long groan as she sat back in her chair. She seemed to be trying to give herself as much space as possible between herself and the table in front of her. She was breathing heavily, and you interpreted the look on her face as mix of discomfort and pleasure. You thought to yourself that Bridget, for the first time, finally looked like she was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while a waiter arrived to collect your dishes. He looked to both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope everything has been satisfactory\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget leaned further back, as far as she possibly could, putting her hands gently on top of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm satisfied\", she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent... Need anything else?\", he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say a single word, Bridget simply shook her head at him. \"We're done\", she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, when you were ready to leave the restaurant, you got up first. Bridget's eyes were squinting and her mouth pursed as she forced herself to straighten up a little in her seat. Her hands remained on her belly, and she let out a grunt as she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help here?\" Bridget huffed, slowly holding out one hand towards you. You clasped your hand around hers, giving her leverage to get on her feet. You stood next to her, holding her hand slightly awkwardly as she struggled to straighten herself out before she finally stood up. As soon as she was safely on her feet, she let go of you and immediately moved her hands to the sides of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's -ungh- go\", she wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the restaurant. When you reached the street outside, Bridget stopped and turned around to face you. The wind was suddenly blowing through her dark hair, and you imagined that the fresh air would probably be highly welcome to her, if she felt as full as she looked. She certainly looked happy, and that made you happy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming with me today. I hope you liked it\", she said. After a moment of looking at you she looked down at herself, and you followed her gaze. Her hands were still holding onto the sides of her belly. \"I know I couldn't get enough, that's for sure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo joke. You figured that she had eaten enough pasta to feed a family of eight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really good\", you said, nodding. Although you had already sort of forgotten what the pasta tasted like. The only thing on your mind was Bridget's incredible appetite. You couldn't imagine that belly of hers being anything but bigger in the future. With the way she was eating, that much was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", she said, her hands rubbing little circles against her sides. \"Come on, we'll head back to the apartment. It's just here around the corner\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't argue against that. She turned back around, and you followed her down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Bridget had looked awkwardly packed into her dress before, you didn't quite have the words to describe how she looked now. Her middle, swollen with a day's worth of constant gorging, was pressing itself against her dress, filling out every ounce of space that the tightly wrapped fabric would allow it to squeeze into. The straps over her shoulders and back looked somehow even tighter than before. It looked uncomfortable - you couldn't imagine her being more tightly forced into a piece of clothing than she looked to be right now, at least not without the garment immediately ripping apart or popping off of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget's pace was not exactly speedy. She held onto her bloated middle and trudged down the street, with you pacing alongside in silence. After an uneventful walk you reached her apartment building. You made sure to hold the door for Bridget, and she gave you a grateful nod in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great...\" Bridget groaned, as you found yourselves by the stairs of her apartment building. Her hands were still practically glued to the sides of her belly. \"Well at least I don't live on the top floor. It's not very far, I can do this\", she wheezed to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a single uncertain step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrrrrrrrp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you heard the unmistakable sound of tearing fabric coming from Bridget's direction. Bridget let out a peep, before slowly, rigidly, as if any additional movement might spell her dress' ultimate doom, turning her head and torso towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the damage?</span></div></div>",

First door on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget stepped to the side to clear a path for you.

You tried your best to ignore those brief seconds of contact and how soft it felt despite how undoubtedly jam-packed and stuffed with food it was, but... damn. Girl's got an appetite and a blossoming belly to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n201-B. First door on the left. You fumbled with the keys and hastily unlocked the door, switching on the lights as you walked through the entrance. You peered around the hall to check up on Bridget's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was remarkably speedy for someone in her predicament. You watched as she waddled up the last few steps, turned the corner--and almost ran smack into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the door--quick!\" she whispered strainedly, out of breath. She handed you your jacket as she shuffled past you into the living room. You put it back on and locked up quickly. You turned around when, suddenly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RrrrrrRRRRPPP</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze in place, completely floored by the sight in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing before you, holding the shorn halves of her dress in her hands, was Bridget in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*WHEW* Sorry about that,\" she said, blushing a little. \"Could hardly BREATHE in that thing,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss for words. You'd been able to quietly observe Bridget's midsection as it grew, but now you were faced with the full brunt of her weight gain. Cellulite dotted her thickened thighs, which jiggled at the slightest movement of Bridget's legs. Stretch marks lined the top part of her abdomen, though they were strangely minimal--perhaps she treated them with oil? Her bra seemed a bit too tight, her pudgy chest overflowing and bunching together just a tad. And while by far the majority of her growth had took place on her tummy, her hips and rear were nothing to scoff at either, stretching her briefs tight across her round lower half. Bridget was an undoubtedly curvy girl--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I overdid it, huh?\" she chuckled, giving her belly a pat. She exhaled, letting her belly swell out further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--and she was only going to get bigger.</span></div></div>",

Her tank top was stretched taut over her torso but still didn't reach her midriff, a band of uncovered skin visible between the edges of her jeans and her top. Her partially exposed middle looked plump and bulbous, bouncing whenever she moved even a little bit. Along with the massively tight jeans that cradled her thick thighs and curvaceous rear, her outfit was looking like it was on the absolute limit of fitting on her plumped-up figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bridget had stepped inside and closed the door, she dragged off her jacket, her soft-looking arms jiggling as they emerged from her tank top. She took her jacket in one hand, brushed through her hair with the other, and then waved at you. You nodded at her, before turning back to your baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you\", you heard Bridget say as she approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Bridget\", you said, stepping away from the half-prepared pastries to face her. \"Thank you so much for yesterday. I really enjoyed your company\", you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank <i>you</i>\", she responded. \"It was my pleasure to show you one of my favourite restaurants. Among other things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your own cheeks blush, but Bridget was giving you a coy smile. And you could swear you saw her wink mischievously! She sure didn't look embarrassed about splitting her dress right in front of you yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I'm so ready to eat - I mean, get to work\", Bridget continued. \"I only had a couple sandwiches and a muffin for breakfast. I get hungry, you know how it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her utterance, she brought her free hand to her side, gently rubbing her flanks. It was enough of a movement to cause her middle to jiggle, completely captivating your attention. The way her rounded, naked pudge was beginning to inch over the hem of her jeans, it was marvellous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched until Bridget let go of her middle with a sigh, forcing your gaze back to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there are some cupcakes I'd like you to try. They're in your office\", you managed to say. You saw her perk up instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank y - I mean, I'll get to it right away!\", she answered. You reluctantly returned to your work as Bridget twirled around and left you to your baking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemon! Mm-mmm, Don't mind if I do\", you heard from Bridget's office, her voice quickly giving way to relentless munching. That was all the prompting she needed to start eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was snicker contentedly to yourself. Bridget had proved once again what a perfect fit she was for you and the bakery. </span></div></div>",

Which is exactly what the pudgy, flirtatious taste-tester did, wrapping one arm around your shoulder and using the other to munch on a lemon cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the new batch of blueberry muffins?\" she asked, tilting her head into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" You picked up a carton of blueberries. \"Got these from that place you recommended this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget took a whiff of the berries and popped a few into her mouth, savoring the tangy flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice and fresh,\" she sighed, before finishing off her cupcake. \"I can't wait to try them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of--how were the cupcakes?\" you asked, setting the carton back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smiled. \"Guess,\" she whispered, taking your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stopped when Bridget put your hand right on her belly. She rubbed it in circles against the soft, bloated globe, and you felt your fingers sink just a little into her fluffy tummy pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can feel them in there, right?\" Bridget asked, laying it on thicker than her waistline. \"All those sweet, fattening little goodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only nod. Bridget smirked teasingly, walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hardly hold myself back,\" she continued, running your hand up and down the swollen dome of her belly. \"Normally, I take my time to really savor a tray, get a real feel for the food, but <i>this</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smacked your hand against her belly. It quivered a tad, but was mostly too taut to do anything beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I couldn't hold myself back. I just <i>had</i> to keep eating. But then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could fully process just what was going on, Bridget lifted her tank top over her middle, exposing the entirety of her big, round belly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... your food tends to have that effect on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was inches away from you now. Taking you by the shoulder, Bridget turned you towards her and thrust her belly up against your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no wonder I've gotten so <i>fat</i> since I started working here. These hips?\" Bridget leaned to her side and ran a hand hypnotically down her curvaceous leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This booty?\" she said, slapping her round rear for emphasis. Your heart damn-near stopped, right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This belly?\" she said, thrusting her torso forward and rubbing her plump middle against you in almost a reverse-grind. \"All this extra weight--all of it--from eating your delicious, delactable, and oh-so-<b>fattening</b> baking. And y'know what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget leaned in closer. You felt her breath on your cheek, as well as a faint scene of lemon cupcake. She whispered in your ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved every minute of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sweating bullets. Sure, Bridget had always been a bit of a tease, but this--you weren't really planning for today to go like this. Frankly, this was an entirely new situation for you and you had no idea how to respond. One thing was certain, though: Bridget had you wrapped around her finger and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" she continued. This time, her tone was a little more serious. \"There's still the matter of my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asgj--uh--... What about them?\" you finally sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget gave you a look. She gestured down to the rest of her body. \"Isn't it obvious? Were you paying any attention last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... T-They don't fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a one. These jeans are from high school, when I was at my biggest, and we both know they don't have much longer to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Aside from being incredibly snug (especially now that Bridget had eaten an entire trayful of cupcakes since this morning), the jeans themselves were pretty ratty and worn. While perhaps the holes torn into the knees and the bleached look of the fabric might've passed for fashionable, the paint stains on the thighs did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want me to do?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smiled deviously. She walked over to the entrance, grabbed a cupcake from the display, locked the door, switched the sign to \"Closed,\" turned around back to you,  devilish glint in her eye.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-wha-\",  you mumbled, your gaze flicking between Bridget's grinning face and your own hand hesitantly clasping around the cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget pressed herself even closer to you. \"You know exactly what I'm talking about\", she purred in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Bridget's hand taking hold around your wrist. She began to tug at your arm, bringing your hand and the cupcake towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opened wide. You hesitated, holding the cupcake in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps sensing your hesitation, Bridget suddenly stole back the cupcake from your hand, shoving the whole thing into her maw. She took as big of a mouthful as she could, spraying crumbs over both of you. She chewed quickly, and with a second bite she'd practically taken down the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to force the remaining little scraps into her already full mouth, crumbs popping out of her mouth and running down her jaw onto both of you. As the crumbs fell onto her chest and your torso, she impatiently finished chewing the last pieces of the cupcake still in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, <i>so good</i>\", she moaned, licking her fingers for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood still, your body frozen, but your mind racing, thinking of where this display might be heading next. You still felt Bridget's pudgy body being pushed up against your torso, and her face was still very close to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What now?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one\", she stated, her mouth reaching right next to you ear. \"I'm not busting out of these pants just yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Bridget backed off enough for you to move. While you scrambled to get something for her to eat, a trivial task inside of a well-stocked bakery, Bridget made herself comfortable sitting down by a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to her carrying an improvised tray filled with pretty much everything you could get your hands on. Cupcakes, muffins, biscuits, cakes, whatever was lying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chair was situated sideways to the table. Bridget was slouching in her seat, legs spread out wide in front of her, her puffy stomach already looking quite round and bloated - understandable, since she had been feasting on lemon cupcakes all morning. When she spotted you coming, she lifted her left arm which had been resting on the table next to her, and lazily waved you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on over here. You'll want to be right where the action is, I bet\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the tray down on the table, and circled around until you stood right in front of Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\", she shrugged, raising an eyebrow as she looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", you grunted, suddenly feeling the need to wipe your forehead. It was hot and sweaty to the touch. \"I, uh, I got you these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget didn't make any attempt at reaching for the pastries. What she did do, was stare squarely into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you want one\", you said, your voice shivering from excitement and, honestly, a little bit of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget let out a snicker in response, her gaze falling from your eyes. \"I don't want <i>one</i>. Bring me <i>all of them</i>\", she ordered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you started to feed Bridget the pastries. Before she'd even finished chewing the first one, she called for another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't noticeable at first, but as Bridget gorged on pastry after pastry, her tight jeans became put under increasing stress. With every mouthful her belly put more and more pressure against the single button holding the jeans together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget's hand reached for the button. \"No. I'll <i>break</i> these pants. <i>I'll break them</i>\", she mumbled to herself, her hand fondling the button, but not unbuttoning it. She asked for another pastry. You silently handed one over, she silently accepted it, chewed, and then asked for another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Bridget was starting to look a little queezy. She was breathing heavily and her pace of eating had slowed down dramatically. Her brow looked damp, her face was flushed, she was looking as hot and sweaty as you were feeling. Her jeans looked so tight, you were starting to worry she wouldn't be able to breathe properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you heard a flat <i>pop</i>. The sound was followed by an almost silent <i>ping</i>, as the button in question landed on the floor. Bridget's jeans opened up, her stuffed middle freeing itself through the breach. She let out a relieved moan, leaning back in her chair and relaxing her whole body. A bit of cake even fell out of her mouth as she stopped focusing on eating, bouncing off of her leg onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", she hummed. \"I knew I could do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back and brought your hand through your hair, taking a moment to yourself. You marvelled at Bridget, who seemed so proud to have busted out of her pants for some reason. Her stomach, peeking out through her top and now through her pants as well, was looking like a large, bloated sphere. You contented yourself to watching it rise and fall for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange to see Bridget's belly so full and round, while the rest of her body was looking the same as this morning. She had been getting bigger, no doubt, but only over the course of weeks and months. Getting lost in your thoughts, you couldn't help but imagine Bridget's whole body in the inevitable future. She was very pretty right now, of course, but she was going to look so good with even more meat on her bones. You thought about thicker thighs, bigger breasts, rounder arms and an even heftier rear to go with that bulbous middle of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have been lost to your own musings for quite a while, if Bridget's voice hadn't suddenly brought you back to reality as she articulated another demand:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bridget was still rather bloated from her morning shift, and it was pretty clear she was never going to fit in those jeans again. The bakery, though, had limited options as far as wardrobe was concerned, but you luckily did have a temporary option that was ever-so-slightly more palatable to Bridget than going out in public with her gut spilling out of her popped jeans. And so it was that you finally got Bridget in a German dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, the fact that you have such a well stocked supply is freaky,\" said Bridget, tugging at the itchy fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. Not much ground for you to disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a good look for her. Bridget had added her jacket over the white-and-black drindl, which gave the ensemble a sort of action/sci-fi vibe, only with a pudgy, biracial Persian rather than a conventionally attractive blonde. Bridget's slightly bottom-heavy figure took on a more hourglass shape with the jacket's padded shoulders, and while the skirt obscured the roundness of her rear just a tad, her big belly was delightfully prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you and Bridget had picked out an assortment of tops and sweaters--some for now, some to grow into--and had begun the insanely difficult task of finding jeans that fit. You thought you had it bad, what with your long legs and slim waist, but just helping Bridget out for this short time put you very quickly in your place. Either they were too big around her calves or too small around her hips or the store didn't even carry anything close to her size. Even with the weight she'd gained, Bridget wasn't all that big, and even if she was, you'd think clothing companies would want to have products that could reasonably be bought by more than just people with one specific body-type. This was just terrible business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, forget this,\" Bridget groaned as you exited your third store. \"Let's take a break. I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a look--half confused, half enthralled. Bridget merely patted her tummy in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I'm a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bridget?\" a voice called from behind. Bridget turned around in response, then suddenly became very ecstatic. You turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

How many girls are gonna get fat off of those pastries?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over Betty's shoulder for a moment, seeing Bridget standing behind the two of you, watching silently with her eyes wide open and a shocked expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put on a hundred pounds while I was working at that bakery. No wonder, because you had me eating non-stop for months!\", Betty ranted, picking at your chest multiple times with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back, surprised and overwhelmed by Betty's accusatory tone.

Look at this!\" It was your turn to be the shocked onlooker, as you saw Betty pushing a chubby finger against your current taste-tester's bulging gut. Although Bridget had been gorging herself as late as an hour ago, her belly was still malleable enough to begin to envelop her friend's pudgy finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so big already...\", Betty hummed quietly, as her finger rubbed against Bridget's side. Bridget looked as stunned as you were, both of you watching as Betty's whole hand joined her finger. Betty downright grabbed at her friend's flabby midsection, silently squeezing the bulbous abdomen and jiggling it back and forth inside the tight german dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty!\", Bridget exclaimed, looking down at her belly being groped by her friend. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of Bridget's voice, Betty looked up at her friend and abruptly retracted her hand. You caught a glance of her face, and it was suddenly flushing red. Maybe it was the angry outburst, but her eyes drifted to the ground and she did look rather sheepish all of a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just trying to show you, you're gonna get - I mean, you're already - I mean, just get out of there before you get as fat as I got!\" Betty said, poking the side of Bridget's belly one more time. And with that said and done, Betty whirled around again and stomped off, leaving you alone with Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the silence left after Betty disappeared, you heard the pounding heartbeat in your ears slowly recede as you managed to calm down a little. Seeing Betty again had been exciting, but seeing her so riled up had you worried. And how was Bridget going to react to Betty's accusations?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told me Betty used to work for you\", you heard Bridget say after a little while, when Betty herself was definitely out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you knew her\", you shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like she doesn't like you very much\", Bridget continued, glancing in the direction Betty had stomped off into with one eyebrow inquisitively raised. \"I guess that's why she's not at the bakery anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were expecting at least a comment on Betty's accusation of you fattening girls up, but Bridget didn't mention it, for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm still hungry, and I know the perfect place to go\", Bridget shrugged before taking hold of your arm. \"And after that, we still have to find me a new pair of pants.

You picked away at your fries and took a few sips of your shake, but you ended up giving most of your food to Bridget. You weren't that hungry, and she just kept giving you the just pathetic puppy dog eyes paired with melodramatic belly rubs. How could you say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Bridget's food arrived. You observed the absolute glee in her eyes as she watched her meal laid out on the table. She thanked the server and waited until they were just out of sight before she immediately sank her teeth into a massive burger. She moaned with pleasure, savoring the buns, the veggies, juicy meat with melted cheese, and washed it all down with some fries and her shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget made quick work of the first burger, and the second burger wasn't far behind. She ate with passion, and her already bloated belly grew ever-so-tighter against the fabric of the dress she was wearing. You watched her, entranced, as she devoured a meal fit for two people like it was just a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you knew it, she had downed the last of her shake with a mighty gulp. She looked you in the eye and belched richly, patting her tight tummy in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done?\" you asked, shifting nervously in your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smirked. She called a server to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could get us a chocolate-creme pie?\" she asked sweetly. \"Could really go for some dessert right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said the server. They whisked away to the kitchen with Bridget's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want sweets after...?\" you could barely bring yourself to even mention this morning without devolving into gibberish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't work for a bakery without a sweet tooth,\" said Bridget. \"And mine just can't be satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your face go hot. God, this girl was gonna balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget tucked into the pie as soon as it was placed in front of her. You took the opportunity to \"go to the bathroom.\" Though you desperately wanted to keep watching the spectacle of Bridget making a complete glutton of herself, this was the only opening you had to make sure Bridget didn't pay for lunch. You returned to find the voracious young woman slouched back in her chair, with two-thirds of the pie still fresh in the tin. She inclined her head toward you, a lazy smile on her face, and scooched over in her seat to make room for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me finish?\" she said, patting the space she made next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a question so much as a command, and you'd be damned if you didn't oblige. You slid into the spot next to her, grabbed the fork, and gently began feeding Bridget. After a while, when she began to slow down, she took your free hand and placed it on her gargantuan gut, running it in circles around its swollen form.

Even though she'd barely finished the previous item in your latest batch, she didn't hesitate before lunging at the pastry in front of her, sending pieces of sugar flying in every direction as her teeth dug into her latest snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm\", she hummed with her mouth full of food, patting the table in front of her with her right hand. \"Ish gooh\", she continued, her cheeks protruding with so many half-chewed pieces of pastry that she could hardly articulate the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to say that your role in Bridget's gorging had taken on another dimension. You surprised even yourself in your eagerness to comply with Bridget's wishes to be fed, bringing her plate after plate of baked goods and holding up each and every piece for her to greedily consume from the seat in her little office, just as you were doing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the near-constant eating was leaving its mark on Bridget's figure. The additional weight accumulated in her burgeoning middle, but also along her hips, her limbs and her chest, everywhere really. You noticed it mostly by how much her clothes seemed to be 'shrinking', leaving a lot more skin on display now compared to a few weeks ago. Her current t-shirt had her round, ungainly belly peeking out of it, and her supposedly new and well-fitting jeans were already showing signs of stress, having grown very tight around her hefty hips, legs and rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget was no stranger to what was happening to her figure, and she made sure you didn't miss how tight her clothes were getting and how pleasantly plump her curves were becoming. She didn't hesitate to press her body close up to yours, or asking you to rub her belly when she'd eaten just a bit to much at once, if such a thing was even possible for her. You enjoyed getting physically closer to Bridget, and judging by her continued teasing, she was enjoying every second as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now you had your sights set on spending the evening together with Bridget. You weren't quite sure yet what the evening would bring, because you and Bridget had both made your own secret plans for the night. Bridget was promising a 'special date', the details of which were secret, but doubtlessly enjoyable. Your option was the less glamorous plan of spending the night at the bakery. You could part with your expertise and teach Bridget a thing or two about baking. And of course she would be close to you all night in total privacy, in a building bursting full of pastries for her to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afternoon passed and you got about ready to close the business for the day, you and Bridget had to decide what to do for your evening together. Which plan did you pursue that night?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bridget had gone home to change into something \"fitting,\" she'd said with a wink and a smirk. You weren't entirely sure what she'd meant by that, but then again, you never did when she'd get all playful like that \u2014 you'd just wait and be pleasantly surprised. Even still, you'd been standing out here for 20 minutes. Where was--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of hands covered your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, handsome,\" a soft voice said. \"Sorry to keep you waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the sound of Bridget's voice. You took her hands off your eyes and turned to face her, but she stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you remember on our first date how I said that dress was the biggest thing I owned that still fit?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that wasn't entirely true.\" She took her hands off your face, allowing you to take in the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" she said, gesturing to the well fitting blue-and-silver cocktail dress she was wearing, \"was my prom dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Wait,\" you began, but Bridget cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost a LOT of weight after high school,\" she said with a wink. Suddenly, she gave her well padded hip a smack, sending ripples throughout her not-quite-chubby-but-still-quite-pudgy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think it's about time I gain it back \u2014 with interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw had been dropping on-and-off for the last 20 minutes or so by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget was midway through her third full-plate at the buffet, and given the speed at she was eating, she was FAR from done. Pasta, bread, veggies, and who knows what else \u2014 you were honestly having a hard time keeping track at this point. No, your eyes were fixed on the spherical mass gradually ballooning out further and further against the tight fabric<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that just as you thought you'd seen the limit of Bridget's appetite, she'd just loosen her belt and grow beyond it. It was hypnotic, and you were caught right in her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Bridget groaned. She leaned back in her chair and put a hand on her straining belly. Her eyes drifted over to you. \"Are you gonna eat that?\" she asked, gesturing to your plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, she pulled your plate over to her and handed you her empty plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a doll and grab me some dessert while I finish this,\" she commanded. \"We're not leaving here tonight until after this dress pops.\"</span></div></div>",

Though you could barely see it, her eyes still had that blissful, hungry spark of a girl who loved her sweets and just had a very good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her face, on the other hand, was telling you a different story. While she'd started off fast and furious, Bridget's eating speed decreased exponentially with every plate. The previously gung-ho young woman now was looking a little queasy as she laid back in her seat, her middle swollen out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, her belly had swelled to an almost comical degree. Tight as a drum and almost perfectly round, Bridget's overtaxed tummy was at its biggest yet, a true testament to the sheer depths of her gluttony over roughly the last two months. The old dress she'd worn for tonight's occasion seemed fit to burst, like all it would take was a few measly morsels to rip it asunder. Then again, so did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget tilted her head toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" she commanded weakly, letting out a nauseous burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated. Certainly, you were absolutely enthralled by your partner's sheer capacity and zeal to eat, but this time was different. Bridget really seemed to have hit her limit, and as much as you wanted to stuff her so senselessly round and fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the plate out of her hand and set it down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your dress won this round,\" you said, scarcely believing the words coming out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of arguing, but you eventually persuaded Bridget to catch a ride with you back to her place. Upon getting home, you walked Bridget up to her bedroom, where she immediately crashed moaning on the bed. After a few minutes if struggle, you were able to wrest the dress off of Bridget's expanded in one piece, (\"for next time,\" she said,) and soon enough you were both spooning in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I couldn't break it,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" you whispered. \"Next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to do something unforgettable. Something we'd both like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this, too,\" you said. You snuggled in closer. \"Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Bridget's midriff rise and fall as she sighed deeply. \"I suppose, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid together in blissful silence, reveling in the warmth of each other's bodies. Your hands gently caressed and soothed Bridget's overstuffed gut, joining Bridget's own across the surface of her soft yet tight middle. Gradually, Bridget's breathing slowed as she had more time to digest, and soon your hands were working alone as she began drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for doing this...\" she hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Anything for the woman I love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget's eyes shot wide open. Everything froze when it suddenly occurred to you that this was the first time either of you had used the L-word to describe your relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later, you were cleaning up shop at the bakery for another day \u2014 mopping the floor, dusting the counters, arranging the displays with freshly baked goods. Business had slowed somewhat in recent weeks, but things were still holding steady. This morning, you were working alone, but any minute now, that door was gonna open \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the bell ring and turned to see...</span></div></div>",

She had lasted as long as any of your previous employees now, but with her it was different. You loved her attitude, her appetite and growing body, a dreamy combination that you couldn't help but gush over and compliment constantly. Luckily, Bridget gleefully gobbled up your affections as eagerly as she gobbled up every meal put in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Bridget had spent the last month dating, although to be honest most of your dates revolved around Bridget eating until she was so stuffed she could barely move. You had also offered your former taste tester a proper position as your partner at the bakery, which she had accepted without a second of hesitation. Seeing your relationship continue to deepen and develop filled you with joy and anticipation for the future. So far your relationship with Bridget hadn't hit even a single bump, it had been going flawlessly. You could only hope that it would continue going that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched your new girlfriend and business partner as she made her way past the displays towards you. She was wearing an open jacket with a colorful top underneath and a pair of snug jeans. Another month of constant gorging on pastries and huge dinners had left a few marks on her increasingly chubby figure - her cheeks and chin were looking quite round and soft, her thick, chunky thighs looked tightly packed in her jeans and her belly bulged a bit through her open jacket, even jiggling a little when she walked, her top bouncing inside her jacket as she passed the last of the displays and emerged in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my favorite baker\", Bridget greeted you, wrapping her arms around you and rubbing your arms with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now that you're here, Bridget\", you responded, gently embracing her and holding your hands on her pudgy back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you've got a little treat ready for me - this tummy won't fill itself, you know\", Bridget leaned in to whisper in your ear, one of her hands leaving your arm to nudge against her soft middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never get completely used to just how eager Bridget was to stuff herself - you had only exchanged a few words before she twisted your conversation towards food. Of course, you had prepared just the thing she was looking for, but the extra-large, extra-rich cake awaiting Bridget this morning was by no means a little snack, quite the opposite. It'd be difficult to eat more than a few slices for any reasonable person, a nice challenge for Bridget's outrageous appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", you whispered back, \"Just have to finish stocking these displays first, and we can get right to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can wait, let me eat first\", Bridget insisted, but you gently shook your head. Despite the speed with which she could eat, Bridget's feasting sessions tended to be lengthy affairs and this was no small meal she was about to tackle. It was for the best to get all of your chores done before then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget tried to entice you by guiding your hands to her soft, empty belly, letting you gently pat and jiggle her middle, but you <i>had</i> to finish these chores first, otherwise they would never get done. Reluctantly you forced yourself to retract your hands and gesture towards the displays instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll help\", Bridget sighed when it became clear that her tactics hadn't gotten her anywhere this time. She let go of you and glanced towards the displays, some of them perfectly arranged while others remained empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could direct her anywhere in particular, Bridget had already turned towards one of the displays - one which had already been stocked with goods. She turned her back towards you, and the sight of her rear distracted your thoughts. The size of her round rump, emphasized by her tight jeans, kept your attention while Bridget did something to the display. By the time you realized what she was planning it was already too late. She turned towards you again - one item had been conspicuously removed from the otherwise perfectly arranged display and was now in Bridget's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, looks like there's a pastry thief at large!\" Bridget snorted with a wicked smile on her face before the freshly baked bun entered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head at Bridget's antics, but there was a smile on your face as well. Watching her eat and enjoy herself made you happy, and you knew that she knew it. At the same time, you were honestly hoping that the colossal cake awaiting Bridget would keep her busy for a while and keep your pastry displays safe in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out, and that was to finish your chores and take Bridget to her next meal...</span></div></div>",

The blossoming brunette grew by the day with the ever increasing influx of calories, the brunt of the poundage going to her tummy.

Everyone was preparing to film another reality tv show were a bunch of gorgeous women compete for a billionaire's love. Over a couple months the girls would be weeded down until only the top girl remained. The man would judge their actions and habits and dismiss those who did not meet his expectations. Our billionaire is Bruce Spencer, the typical handsome, charismatic heart throb billionaire that every woman craves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to begin shooting, a limo drove the gates pulling up to the mansion. The girls got out each one beautiful adorned in a glamorous dress with their silky hair flowing in the wind. The girls were also thin bearing similar physiques to that of a super model. The girls took their place in front of a podium were the announcer walked out. She was Kristie South a plus size model weighing a nice 180 pounds.  Her low cut dress displayed her sumptuous cleavage while her belly rendered her dress taut as did her back rolls. Kristie's hefty appearance somewhat confused the rail thin girls but they let it pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a microphone to her face, Kristie addressed the contestants \"Welcome to the mansion ladies! As you all know, you'll be living together in this mansion were you'll be provided with anything you want as you compete over Bruce Spencer. Now let's meet him. Come on out Bruce!\" In walked Bruce, handsome as ever \"Hello ladies.\" \"Cute huh ladies. But there's actually something that you didn't know about Bruce.\" Kristie announced stirring bewilderment among the girls. \"What if I were to tell you that Bruce here.....\" She paused a moment creating tension \"LIKES FAT GIRLS!\" Kristie enthusiastically yelled. The unsuspecting girls gasped. \"Now come inside ladies and we'll get you weighed and have your introductions taken.\" Kristie said.   </span></div></div>",

After spending two weeks at her family's house for the holidays, Amy now had three days back in her apartment before classes would begin again. Yet what struck Amy the most about her Christmas vacation was not the gifts (although some of the clothes did play a part). It was something else that caught her eye today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood in front of her mirror, examining herself. She wore new black jeans and a purple turtleneck. Judging by her reflection, however, they were not going to fit her any time soon. Amy couldn't button her jeans at all and the turtleneck clung tightly to her midsection, having rode up to just above her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had tried them on before the holidays, they would have fit just fine. But lounging around her parents house and treating herself to sweets, in addition to massive portion-sizes for her regular meals, meant that Amy was consuming a lot more energy than she was using. And those extra calories added up around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had weighed herself this morning. 140 pounds. Up 10 pounds since September. She was surprised that the number wasn't larger, considering just how lazy and indulgent she had been. Most of the weight had settled into a pudgy pooch of belly fat, although she did now have the beginning of some love handles and did seem to be generally flabbier all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at herself in profile. She sucked in her gut, then buttoned up her jeans, tucking her turtleneck into them. She let it out, causing her turtleneck to ride up. Her jeans felt like they were about to burst, so Amy carefully in unbuttoned them again. Her belly lurched forward upon having the button's pressure removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Amy pushed her belly out, making it even bigger than it already was. She turned back around. Amy rubbed the bottom curve of her belly. Taking it in both hands, she gave it a shake. It wobbled, and the movement... Intrigued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Amy found that she didn't mind her weight gain that much. If anything, she could have sworn that she liked it, of all things. She liked how round and soft her belly had become. She liked the way it jiggled. She liked how it was so large. There was no desire in her to lose the weight. If anything, she wanted to gain a bit more. She imagined herself fatter, with a potbelly and a muffin top. It was an image that Amy didn't find unappealing in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait\u2014am I actually considering gaining weight?</i> Amy thought to herself. But it wasn't such a bad idea in her eyes, she realized. After all, she could always lose it if she wanted. But there would still be the trouble of having to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amy could reach a definitive conclusion, her stomach rumbled. She was hungry, and it was almost time for dinner.</span></div></div>",

She had put on a large coat, in part to hide her weight gain, but mostly because it was freezing. She pulled into the parking lot and went inside, wallet in hand. Amy was greeted with warmth when she walked into the building. At the counter was an Egyptian cashier with moppy black hair. Amy recognized him from her child psychology class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Khalid,\" she greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhalid looked up. \"Oh. Hi, Amy. Have a nice trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhalid smiled. \"Good to hear. What can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to pick up an order. A large veggie pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. One second.\" Khalid went around to the oven and came back with a box. \"Card?\" he asked. Amy pulled out her debit card with a smile. Khalid scanned it, printed out a receipt, and returned both items to Amy with her pizza. \"See you in class,\" Khalid said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy picked up her order and made her way to her car. \"Thank you!\" she called out. Khalid waved as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was ravenous by the time she got home. She placed the pizza on the ground next to her bed, sat down, and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first slice was gone in a matter of minutes. Streaming hot and oh-so-juicy, Amy felt it slide warmly down her esophagus and into her stomach, desperate for more. Thankfully, it was a sixteen-slice pizza\u2014there was a lot more more to get through. By the fourth slice, Amy's belly began to bulge. For all intents and purposes, she should have felt full. And yet, some force compelled her to keep eating. The sixth slice was devoured soon enough. The seventh slice was where Amy started to feel stuffed. Amy leaned back, allowing her belly to stretch out a bit, and caught sight of herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of her swollen belly intrigued Amy. It was much larger than her earlier examination. While she would have thought that her reflection would have revolted her, Amy was actually quite enamored with this new look. While before she had been fairly ambivalent towards gaining weight, now she was very firmly set on it. Amy Michaels was going to get fat. And in order to do that, there was one course of action to take: eat.</span></div></div>",

Carol, on the other hand, had piled a plate high with fries and a thick, juicy cheeseburger. The conversation that dinnertime was small and short. Harold had a chicken salad. Carol had two platefuls.

Just gotta... lay back a bit first...\" She rubbed her swollen paunch and belched. \"Oh, ho! Excuse ME!\" She giggled. Harold sighed and trudged his way back to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, around midnight, Carol came stumbling back into the room. If she had looked swollen when Harold had last seen her, she was ready to pop now! Her stomach strained against her tight red dress, leaving no curves to the imagination.

I might have stopped at the bar too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold rushed over and helped his wife lie down. She continued in a slurred speech to describe the ice cream parlor. \"There's like 50 flavors!

Her breath told him that she HAD indeed been to at least one bar. \"Wanna... Help me work off that meal...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold pushed himself away from her. \"Carol, I can't. You're drunk and you need sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gazed up at the ceiling and whined. \"You never have any FUN anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold narrowed his eyes...</span></div></div>",

Unlike you with your obsessive binging!\" Carol propped herself up on her elbows and looked at him. Harold continued to rant. \"All you've done since we've got here, and for the past few months even, is sit around and eat! It's too much! You're eating yourself into an early grave. Just look at yourself! You're turning into a pig!\" He was getting red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol looked down and crossed her arms over her gut. \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\" She said adamantly. \"I would just like to have a nice cruise with my husband. But until he decides to be a good husband, I'll have this cruise on my own. Good night, Harold.\" She promptly passed out. It would have been rather comedic for Harold if it weren't frustrating. He let out a sigh and got into bed as well. He figured he could apologize and set things right in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, not through sunlight through the window but an alarm on the nightstand next to the bed the couple lay in. Harold rose first and switched off the buzzing clock. Moments later Carol rose up with a groggy groan. \"Good morning dear,\" Harold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol looked over an Harold and nodded stiffly. Harold shied away, wondering if she remembered last night. The two got dressed in silence. The air in the room felt suppressing, in contrast to the light teal walls with depictions of white beaches. Harold opened up the pamphlet and perused some of the activities on the ship that day. \"Huh, some of this looks interesting. Anything you wanna do?\" He asked Carol. She didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold sat down on the bed. \"Honey, I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have gotten angry with you like that. We both need to be more careful. Carol let out a huff and opened the door. \"Where are you going?\" Harold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm off to have breakfast. I am a gluttonous pig after all.\" She said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol, I'm sorry!\" Harold called out, but his wife was already out the door. He sat down and sulked. \"This cruise was a bad idea, and it's just getting started...\" He moped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until around noon before he went out to search for Carol. He found her at one of the buffets, stuffing herself. Her plate piled high with pancakes and waffles, coated with butter and syrup. She had been eating all morning. \"Great.\" Harold thought sarcastically. \"Just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another hour Harold watched his wife gorge without end. He had no idea she could even eat so much! Eventually she got up and waddled out, clutching her swollen belly. Harold breathed a sigh of relief and followed her silently until he saw her entering the ice cream parlor and hitting the buffet there. The next day went the same, with Harold following around Carol shyly looking for an excuse to find something to say and Carol eating enough for an army.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harold decided that if Carol wanted to eat like there was no tomorrow, there was no stopping her. He decided to shrug it off and wait for her to come to her senses. He, on the other hand, would enjoy the cruise for more than just it's food. Harold spent time relaxing on deck, enjoying the pool, hitting golfballs into the sea below, etc. He only saw Carol in the morning when they woke up and when they went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few days of this went by and Carol was beginning to grow. Harold hadn't noticed because of his new ideal of letting her be, but Carol's clothes, which once were tight when he was full, were now tight all the time. If he were to stop and think about it, Harold would realize that Carol was eating at least 50,000 calories a day, considering the volume of the food she was eating and how greasy and caloric it all was. He might have also noticed that as her stomach stretched out, she was eating more and more each passing day. By the time a week had passed, Carol was nearly tearing out of her clothes at 250lbs. Day in and day out she would stuff her greedy mouth. She had practically forgotten that the cruise provided other activities. \"It's all just so good!\" She'd tell herself. \"Oh, I'm so stuffed. Well, I could just try another bite. Those crab cakes look heavenly, I couldn't have JUST one! And you know what they'd go well with! Butter!\" She ate like a woman possessed until finally her dress gave way and split along the side seam. Embarrassed, Carol slipped on her skin tight jacket and waddled out, mumbling about the damn washing machines shrinking her clothes and disgusted waiters and guests stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Carol woke up early, her stomach growling. She hastened to slip into some clothes so she could start her ritual morning binge, but found nothing would fit on. \"Oh, these too?\" She grumbled as her biggest top pinched into her flesh and her jeans left a sizable muffin top poofing out. Just then, she heard a knock at the door. Carol did her best to cover up and peaked out. \"Hello?\" She called. Nobody in sight. However, at her feet were several dresses she had noticed in one of the stores on the ship when she had gone exploring for a food court of sorts in the area. They were gorgeous, clearly some of the more expensive ones, and when she slipped on one it fit perfectly! Carol stopped to admire herself in the mirror. The dress did hug her curves and rolls, but it covered her up. \"Oh, wow! And to think Harold is upset that his wife has such nice curves!\" She thought, feeling her blubbery sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving dressed herself and done her hair up, Carol made her way up to her favorite restaurant. She liked it because it was close. Her favorite restaurant was always the closest one. She grabbed a plate and piled it up at the buffet, as per usual, and dug in. Within a few minutes, she had devoured all of her first fraction of breakfast. Carol heaved herself up to go for the next plateful, but a man in a ship's uniform took the plate out of her hands. \"Allow me,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol looked up. The man was tall, taller than her. He appeared Italian, with thick dark hair and darkened tan skin, He had a strong jawline and was well built. His chest barreled out and from what Carol could see, his butt was perky too! The man walked over to the buffet and filled the plate up with skill, in the sense that he was able to fill it even higher than she could, and within moments he had returned. Carol immediately began to feast again. The man let out a hearty laugh. \"I'm honored to see how much you appreciate my cooking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the few things he could have said to break Carol out of her trance, that was one of them. She looked up from her plate, mouth half full of sausage. \"You're the chef?\" She said muffled through breakfast meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bowed and kissed Carol's hand, causing her to blush. \"Lorenzo D'Angelo. Head chef. I didn't make any of that stuff myself, but I oversee all the cooking on board, and there are few things I love more than when I beautiful woman such as yourself enjoys what I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol swallowed and smiled. \"Well my name is Carol, and I love your food!\" The two locked eyes for a moment. Carol then chuckled and stuck her fork back into her empty plate, not realizing she had finished it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, let me get that for you, miss!\" Lorenzo jumped in and snatched her plate to fill it again. Time and time again Lorenzo would fill Carol's plate for her and bring her more burgers, pizza, pasta and fries to eat. All the while they would talk, which was really a one sided conversation since Carol's mouth was rather full. Two and a half hours passed before Carol began to relent to the tides of food Lorenzo had brought her. He had even begun bringing her two plates at a time. \"Two plates? Oh, I just couldn't, Lorenzo!\" She laughed, but regardless she began to shovel fries into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, a lady such as yourself should have to qualms against indulging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only my husband had that perspective.\" Carol sighed. Lorenzo winced, but Carol hadn't noticed. Instead, she began to go on between mouthfuls about how he kept badgering her about her eating habits. \"He even called me a pig the other night! We haven't been intimate in AGES! Oh, sorry! That was personal, I'm sorry.\" She blushed again, but it was hard to tell under the red, sweaty cheeks she had already grown from her ravenous feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo pouted. \"No, it's fine. And if I may be so blunt, he is a fool to think you are not beautiful. There is so... SO much of you to admire...\" His eyes traced along the curve of your body. \"I must admit, I have been admiring you for some time. You've spent so much time enjoying my craft. If I had known you were married...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine!\" Carol cut him off before she could think. \"And thank you...\" She placed a hand on his. \"I needed to hear that. Honestly, I've been worried I've been making a bit of a glutton of myself. But I suppose that's what people do on these cruises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo took on a prideful grin. \"If you have, then I take FULL responsibility. In fact, you must join me for dinner tomorrow tonight! I insist! Your husband is welcome to join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Harold? He'll be off doing boring stuff. But I'd love to go, Lorenzo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo stayed to assist Carol's feast for a few more plates before kissing her on the hand once more and returning to work. \"By the way,\" he said as he walked away, \"I love the dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Carol waddled back to her room to digest her meal. The bed groaned beneath all <i>260</i> pounds of her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, when it was time for bed, Carol came lumbering back to the room after a full day of feasting. Her new dress was already starting to feel tight, especially in her current state of fullness. As she opened up the cabin door she was surprised to not see Harold there. Usually he had been back by now from his day of 'being boring' as Carol had been imagining it. Carol dressed down into she sleep attire, unfortunately that part of her wardrobe had not gotten upgraded like her vacation dress had been, so everything she wore was overly small. The tee shirt did nothing to hid her rounder belly, and the little short were being eaten up by her chunky legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol decided to wait up a little bit for Harold so she could try and ask him to dinner tomorrow with Lorenzo. At the end of the day Carol was still a faithful wife even though they were having this disagreement during this vacation they had been waiting to take their entire married life, and she didn't want to accept dinner plans with another man without at least involving her husband. But Harold was no where to be seen. Carol had come back to the room a little early, but she thought Harold would have been back by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting about an hour, Carol was starting to get impatient, and her stomach started to rumble. Usually not an issue because she was asleep by now, but after having not eaten for an hour Carol was ready for some more boat food. Since she wasn't dressed to go out she decided to bite her time by eating in. She called into the room service and ordered a few... dozen menu items. Not a moment later a trolley arrived at the door with Carol scrumptious meal. Sweets, comfort foods, and drinks were all packed onto the cart, so Carol wheeled it over to the couch and started in. She ate everything down in the same fashion she had been eating all week, fast and ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished it was even later, and Harold still had not returned. \"God where is he so late?\" Carol steamed. Most of the boat would have turned in by now, the only place open would be some bars and dance places, and she knew Harold wouldn't be caught dead in a club. \"He must be up to no good, that can be the only explanation.\" She proclaimed. She didn't know what ill advised things he was doing, but she was determined that something was up. She decided to go out and take a look herself. She wiggled on some shaggy slippers and crept out into the deck under the cover of darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol poked around the few places closest to their room. Pretty much all the restaurants were closed, and the one bar in their area was pretty empty, it had gotten pretty late after all. With no site of Harold, Carol continued to look. That was until she came upon an open establishment. All the traditional restaurants in this area near the cabins were closed, but this ice cream bar looked to be open late for dessert. Carol decided to pop on in, you know to see if Harold was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't, but Carol didn't want to leave before grabbing a quick bite. There were no customers there, and just one attendant running the small joint. You would think he'd be taken aback by Carol's appearance, but this wasn't the first overfed housewife he'd seen over the course of his career. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice cream bar was buffet style just like most other joints in this place, so Carol decided to help herself to a nice big bowl and plenty of toppings. After the first bowl she went back up, and she found some premade favorites to try. Banana Split, Peanut Parfait, Brownie Blast, and more. She grabbed two and brought them back to her table. \"Mmmm.\" She moaned. Quickly finishing she went up for two more. After trying one of each she decided to hit the bar one more time to craft her own creation. It had a mountain of ice cream, cookies, brownies, graham cracker crumbs, sprinkles, peanut butter cups, hot fudge, and completely covered in whipped cream. Carol was so happy with her discovery she decided to have just one more before she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a feast of ice cream and sugar, Carol took her leave. She waved to the young boy behind the counter, leaving looking bigger than she was when she arrived. \"Ma'am.\" He called out as she passed him. \"If your interested I have this box of ice cream sandwiches I need to get rid of, you can take them with you if you'd like.\" He pulled out a box containing classic vanilla ice cream sandwiches, the box red 12. Carol's eyes lit up, not wanting to miss to indulge her appetite while on such a marvelous vacation. Everything else had been so good why stop now. She gladly accepted the gift and thanked the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had left the parlor, she peeled open the top of her box, grabbed out a sandwich, taking the wrapper off, and consuming the treat in a matter of mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe search for Harold had not gone according to plan. At the off set Carol had not been too hopefully, this boat was huge and Harold could have been anywhere. But at least she got some ice cream out of the whole thing. Carol waddled back towards her room, finishing her box of ice cream sandwiches rather fast. By the time she was back at her door she was just finishing the last one. She opened the door to her room to find...</span></div></div>",

He was lounging on the couch, looking like he was just as groggy at this late hour as his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarold, where have you been?\u201d Carol asked, puffing from her shock that he was back. She was still holding the box that the ice cream sandwiches came in so she proceeded to waddle over to the trash bucket and throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d Harold said kind of laissez faire, not very stern at all like he had been in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d She asked, as she had noticed Harold had not moved from the couch and was not being his normal self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe? Maybe not? What's it to you?\u201d Now she definitely knew he was drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is very unlike you Harold.\u201d She huffed. She was starting to lose her focus, and had forgotten about the task at hand, which was to invite Harold to dinner with Lorenzo. It probably also had to do with the massive ice cream coma she had recently induced. \u201cWhat has gotten into you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have!\u201d He burst out, almost slurring. \u201cOr should I say lack thereof\u2026 or the other way around. Me not in you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk Harold, you need to go to bed.\u201d And with that Carol went to go help her husband up. He was agreeable, at least he was able to admit when he needed the help and when his wife was right. She grabbed his arm and heaved him off the couch with a tug, but then something made her take pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniff Sniff* Carol smelled the air she now stood in over Harold. In a slow pressing voice she said, \u201cIs that perfume I smell on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold retracted instantly and his face turned to one of playing dumb. \u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d He tried to brush it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is perfume, I know it.\u201d Carol demanded. \u201cWere you with another woman tonight? Is there where you were so late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, baby, no.\u201d Harold bounced his syllables. \u201cI was at this bar, and just minding my own business, and I mean this woman came over, and you know, just wanted to share a drink, and then her perfume must have just like got on my shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what else Harold? I know you are not telling me the whole thing. How many drinks did you have with this harlot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He panned. \u201cI kinda lost count.\u201d He mumbled quite cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a pig. Here we are on this romantic cruise, and you\u2019ve been too busy to attend to your wife, and now here you are flirting around with another woman. And here I am, looking around for you so I can ask you to join me at dinner tomorrow with the ship's head chef because I am a faithful partner, and would never do something shady behind the other person's back. Such a pig. I\u2019m not even going to invite you to Lorenzo\u2019s dinner, I\u2019m going alone, and I don\u2019t care what you think.</span></div></div>",

The next day she awoke and immediately left the room before Harold could say anything to her. She bee lined straight for her favorite breakfast place, she wanted to start the day right. She knew she had big dinner plans with Lorenzo later that night, but Carol couldn\u2019t help but indulge all day long, filling up her vast stomach with decadent buffet food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day started to come to an end, Carol\u2019s all day feast changed gears and she left the comfort of the buffet and headed to Lorenzo\u2019s quarters. She knocked on the door and was greeted by her host himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Carol, you look ravishing. Why don\u2019t you come in?\u201d Lorenzo offered. Carol lumbered in her belly swaying to and fro like the rhythm of the ocean.  \u201cNo mister husband tonight?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you mean the pig, Harold. No I decided not to invite him. Last night he got drunk and hit on another woman. Oh here I go again, being to open and forward with you. I really must stop that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m sorry to hear your husband is not treating you like such the queen you are. Why don\u2019t we just forget about him for a little while. And you came here to have dinner, let us eat, yes?\u201d Lorenzo ushered Carol out on to his port side dining retreat where a sizeable table had been set up that looked quite luxurious. Fancy table linen, cute centerpiece, relaxing ambiance. This place was quite romantic, but what stuck out to Carol were the serving dishes. There were large and seemed plentiful. Carol had been taking her indulging to the next level, throwing caution to the wind even more every day. By now she was making a total pig of herself, eating anything around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo showed Carol to her seat, and he took up one next to her. He took the lid off the first dish to reveal a large pan of lasagna. Carol\u2019s eyes grew wide as she gazed upon the gooey pasta dish. \u201cI prepared all this food myself, so you know it\u2019s good. I hope you like it.\u201d Lorenzo said with a smile as he served his guest a very large piece from the pan. Carol immediately started in on her meal like she had not eaten in hours, despite the fact that she had just been eating for hours. The quantity of food her stomach could hold was becoming mind boggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished the first piece she moved on to a second one equally as large. The whole time she moaned and groaned, saying how good it was, giving her complement to Lorenzo. After the lasagna came course two which were enchiladas, and they were the biggest enchiladas Carol had ever seen, but they were also the tastiest she had ever had as well. She quickly ate one after another, enjoying them more as she went, eating sides of Spanish rice and beans with the meal. After a few enchiladas, course number three landed on her plate, pu pu platter Lorenzo called it. It was various plates of Americanized Chinese food. Teriyaki beef, chicken covered in sweet honey sauce, pork ribs covered in sweet and sour sauce, plenty of rice, even the veggies were dripping with sweet nectarous liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlate after plate of food was served and Carol easily cleared them all. Each one tasted so fabulous Carol was always excited what was to come next. Lorenzo was the best chef she had ever met. Carol ate late into the night, not even realizing how beautiful the sunset looked, and how the boat slowly quieted down as the wee hours crept in. Soon desserts were being served, and Carol learned Lorenzo was just was good with his confections as he was with entrees. Her steam started to pick up again as she started to cram puffs and eclairs between her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her meal her new dress started to her concerningly tight. Her belly was holding on to all this rich and filling food, which really put a strain on the front of her dress. Carol just ate through the pain, who cared about her silly dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Carol, no one has ever done me such a great honor and eaten this much of my passionate cooking before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorenzo, it\u2019s just all so good. This is the best meal I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Carol said with a big smile, and a bloated stomach. After the onslaught of desserts, Carol decided to give her stomach a rest of a bit, and so her and Lorenzo chatted for a bit. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an hour of chatting, Carol noticed that the clock was reading 9:30. \"Oh, wow, time flies! That late already!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't tell me you're leaving already!\" Lorenzo got out of his seat! \"We haven't even started the second course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second course... mmmm....\" Carol said, rubbing her belly. Suddenly a second course sounded very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, my lady, I've noticed that as much as you enjoy the food here you've never been fully satisfied. So I've decided to make sure that tonight you are provided for until your appetite is truly sated.\" He took her hand and bowed. \"Think of it as my way of thanking you for such wonderful companionship.\" He gave her hand a gentle kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol giggled once more. \"Oh, Lorenzo, you gentleman! Well I suppose the portions here are pretty small, as good as it is! Well I can't say no, let's see what you've got! I'll try not to make a pig out of myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol, you could never be associated with such a beast. Please, never feel you need to hold back from indulging! A queen should never be denied such a right.\" He gave her plump hand a squeeze and walked into his kitchen, returning with another cart stacked to the brim with more food. At the sight of it, Carol's mouth watered. Any pain of fullness she felt suddenly was pain of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to Lorenzo's advice, Carol ravaged each plate, sucking the meat off a chicken wing in one gulp or shoving an entire creme brule into her stomach in 5 seconds flat, then licking the dish clean. \"Oh, Lorenzo, more! So good...\" She let out a wanton moan as her feat continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo was in heaven as well With each bite, the lovely Carol's belly bloated up more and more. The chef hadn't thought it possible, but she looked as if she had gotten fatter through the course of the meal. Carol was definitely at least pushing on 300lbs. Every sound she made, the hungry moans, slobbery grunts and groans, and crying out for more... If she made these sounds while eating Lorenzo's loins ached to think of how she would sound in bed. It was insanity how Carol's stomach could hold a quantity of food larger than she herself was. Perhaps that's how it was converting to fat so immediately. But it was no matter. If this goddess of gluttony's world was insanity, Lorenzo was a madman who longed only for her darkness and shunned the light of common sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Carol's mind, her thoughts were pretty simple. While her body's impulses kept her feasting automatically, her internal dialogue was calm and commanded none of her actions. \"Lorenzo is such a darling!\" She thought. \"Harold never doted on me like this. I wonder if Lorenzo has a little crush on me! And would that be such a BAD thing? Oh, heavens, I'm a married woman! But this man.. he's everything a girl could dream of! I could at least humor him for a while. I'm no worse than Harold, that's for sure.\" By the time Carol had completed that thought, the cart was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo went into the kitchen for dessert cart number two. \"Like I said, tonight is the night where all your hungers are sated.\" His tone was deep and sensual. \"Please continue to enjoy!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carol was in a blissful state of fullness but also enjoying an eating high. She had eaten more tonight than she ever had before, but some how she kept finding the room. Lorenzo had started her on course 3 has her stomach surged forward, so full with best chef in the worlds food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol just continued to chuckle, moan, and beg for more, as the hour grew late. \"Oh this Lorenzo, could there be a better man in the world?\" Carol thought as she continued hee feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo on the other hand externalized his thought. \"Miss Carol you are just radiant, you are truly glowing. Here have another plate of roasted marinaded mushrooms with your pork.\" As he pilled more on his growing guests plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Carol's fork was scraping the bottom of the plate, as she was startled out of her auto pilot eating mode. \"Ooo looks like another plate down Lorenzy.\" Caroled cooed. Lorenzo could only flash a grin from eat to eat as he cleared her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol just sat back, rubber her humomgus tummy, packed full of food. \"Don't tell me you are full just yet, we have a few more deserts left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.\" She moaned at the thought of more of Lorenzo's confections. \"I'm just getting a bit tired, but I can't turn down your baked goods, they are the best I've ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought all my cuisine was the best you've ever had?\" Lorenzo joked as her went around the corner to grab the last tray of desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are so right.\" Carol sighed. \"I'll never have any better than this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you won't ever have to...\" Lorenzo said under his breath, as he was still out of sight, and Carol's eyes had drifted into the back of her head for the moment any ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he retired with the treats placing them in front of Carol. Carol had sink down in her seat, allowing her billowing belly to relax in her lap. But as the treats landed in front of her, she reached forward for one immediately. Sadly for Carol, her stubby and now chunky arms were too short to reach. Defeated she slumped down even further, showing just how tried she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, she heard, \"Here allow me.\" From Lorenzo, and before she knew it there was a chocolate eclairs right on the tip of her plump lips. She slowly opened her mouth to accept the treat and it seductively slid half way inside. Carol chomped down, getting the chocolatey, flakey, and goo filled confections into all corners of her mouth. She chewed rhythmically, opening again to accept the rest when her mouth was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a soft moan, her eyes still closed, and again she was presented with a treat touching her lips the moment she was done. After the first few Carol started to pick up the pace, chewing faster and more forcefully. She had opened her eyes and locked them with Lorenzo. Lorenzo just kept up with the voracious girl, never missing a beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pace had started to ramp up Carol felt and hand come to rest on her extremely distended belly. Startled momentarily, she was not used to feeling anyone this close to her  besides her husband, and even then that was far and few inbetween. But for some reason she quickly let this startlization roll right off her back. Lorenzo had made her feel more appreciated in the past day then Harold had in the past few years. Lorenzo started to slowly move his hand in a circle, rubbing the top dome of her belly, above her dress of course. The whole time Lorenzo continued to feed his princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Lorenzo must have a thing for me, but just can't being my self to have him stop. There is just a few more treats, and either way his rubbing feels kinda good. I'm sure Harold had some own rubbing of his own last night anyways, that filthy pig. This is just an innocent dinner, nothing to be worried about.\" Carol thought to herself, as everything continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the platter was empty, but Lorenzo's rubbing did not stop. It felt good so Carol didn't stop him. She just closed her eyes again, relishing in the good feeling from the rubbing, but also from the food she had just thoroughly enjoyed. Without realizing it Carol drifted off to sleep, it was 11oclock and well past her usual bed time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carol woke up around 11:00 in the morning, as sunlight struck her face through a window and the smell of bacon came to her. She turned over and grabbed a pillow smiling. \"Wait... pillow? Bed? When did I fall asleep?\" She bolted up from the bed, sending ripples down her bloated, fattened body. After last night's gorge had set in, Carol had blimped up to 310lbs. She was still in the dress from last night, but it was splitting at every seam. \"These damn cheap clothes, can't even sleep in them and they fall apart?\" Carol moved carefully, lest the dress fall off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, figuring she was in Lorenzo's bed. \"Oh no, I didn't, did I? I didn't sleep with Lorenzo?\" Carol looked back in her mind. The last thing she could remember was Lorenzo's gentle stomach rubs, and that was in the living room. \"Did he carry me to bed?\" Suddenly scared and furious, Carol threw open the door. \"Lorenzo?\" She called out. Then the scent of breakfast came to her nose and all her anxieties wore off. Pancakes, sausages, bacon, rich syrups, thick creams, fluffy pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Carol, you're awake! I've been making breakfast for you. Did you sleep well?\" Lorenzo responded from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhhh,,,\" Carol snapped out of her trance. \"Oh, um, yeah. I did. How did I end up in your bed last night?!?\" She walked around the corner and saw Lorenzo, still in boxers and a t-shirt, but wearing an apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well as embarrassing as it is for the both of us, it seems you fell asleep on me last night! I carried you to my bed and slept on the couch.\" Lorenzo did not mention how much of a task moving Carol was. As strong as he was, Lorenzo almost resorted to dragging the obese woman, but feeling all that weight in his arms brought him to a Nirvana that made it worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo then took his eyes off his cooking to see Carol in her state of almost-accidental-undress. The side of her dress was completely tearing open, soft flesh oozing out of the side. Her bosom wobbled with each movement, flooding over the top of her dress, pressing her nipples against the fabric with great strain. Her stomach pulled the entire dress forward, causing most of the strain, revealing a deep indentation where her belly button was. Lorenzo could have painted a thousand images with this sight as his muse. His gluttonous, fat Aphrodite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol caught his stare after a second. She too was staring at Lorenzo. His biceps, pecs, glutes and all the other muscles were well defined under his clothes. \"Oh, uh, I'm so sorry about my clothes, these things are just so cheap I guess!\" She rested one arm across where her side was shown and another across her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no issue, I won't bother you about it.\" Lorenzo said casually. \"I guess I should apologize for my appearance as well, I wasn't able to get to my clothes without risking waking you up.\" He shrugged. Meanwhile, Lorenzo was thankful his heavy apron covered below his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's open now...\" Carol craned her neck around to see the piles of pancakes Lorenzo had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I see that. How about I go change, then I'll head out and get you a new wardrobe, on me. I get a discount as an employee. And in the meantime, help yourself to breakfast.\" Lorenzo headed off to his room to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol didn't need to be told twice. After all, she was starving for breakfast. She didn't even notice Lorenzo head out the door as she binged on the sweet, savory meal she had brought to the table, still stained from the last night's insanity.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carol's eyes involuntarily rolled into the back of her head as she took a large savory bite of her breakfast feast. The flavor dancing around on her tongue was enough to send her into a euphoric state. It was no wonder Carol had been binge eating all week since the cruise started, she had totally let herself go, and the pleasure she gleaned from eating was enough make her feel wholly satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol partook in her breakfast, and like she had been enjoying all her meals recently (especially last night) like a sexual conquest. She had been without in that department of her life for too long, and she was now finding a replacement. The roars and moans she elicited while stuffing her face could very well be mistaken as two lovers going at it in the night time, or in this case a little morning love session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol\u2019s belly easily filled up, as the massive quantity of food Lorenzo had prepared quickly disappeared. Carol was so oblivious to her increased size she had completely forgotten that her dress was splitting open, and was doing nothing to try and keep the seams together. The more she packed away into her gut the more strain it put on the front of the dress. Her generous and round bust was getting more exposed as the dress stretched further out. As she reached more and more to grab some of the plates just out of reach, the seams on the dress buckled even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol paid no mind though, she just kept scarfing down greasy strips of bacon, her fingers getting coated in the shimmery liquid as she ate them one after another. She was also enjoying some freshly made cream puffs between plates. The flakey pastries were a nice sweetness to complement the savoriness of the rest of the meal. The fresh puff cream filled her mouth with each bite, building up in her large belly as she consumed more and more of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol felt insatiable at the moment, she just wanted to eat every last crumb that Lorenzo had prepared. She was eating so wildly now that all her flab was getting bounced around and jiggled as she continued to enjoy the meal. All this jiggling was not without its side effects though. Carol had been careful earlier getting out of bed for a reason, her dress was not well. It\u2019s seams were weaker and more strained than ever, and her eating was not helping. Carol was nearing the end of her meal, she just needed to finish one more plate, but her pace wasn\u2019t slowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree big plate sized pancakes remained. Carol had already covered them in a good amount of melted butter and they were swimming in sugary syrup. She was cutting on big chunks, plopping them into her mouth by fork. Thoughts were racing through her head now that her meal was ended and her mind wasn\u2019t just focused on what to eat next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I hope Lorenzo returns soon, his meal was so delicious. It\u2019s like his cooking is getting better and better. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about Harold. He has been thoroughly a stick in the mud since we got on this boat. We were so excited to take this long trip, and he doesn\u2019t even want to indulge while we are here.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plate was shrinking as her thoughts rambled on. Half a plate, a quarter plate, Carol was soon putting the last bite in her mouth, dripping with sweetness just as much as the first bite was. Carol just sat back with a big smile on her face, enjoying the satisfaction of finishing another meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested for only a minute before she decided to stretch her legs. As she stood up her weight shifted, this time she wasn\u2019t trying to hold her dress up. The force of her shifting belly was enough to just pop that last stitch holding the whole thing up, and the straps of the dress that were once digging into her plush shoulders, were draping down to her sides. Carol got immediately red in, not sure how to fix the situation. She tried covering her boobs which were now only sheltered by her poorly fitting bra, but then she realize the seam along her ass had also torn halfway up her back, so she needed to cover that too. The dress to turning into rags quickly as Carol rushed to cover up. Eventually it was easier to to just let the thing fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to hear the cabin door unlocking...</span></div></div>",

Her now fully exposed body jiggled quite furiously as Carol rushed as fast as she could, only covered by her bra and panties. The hulking woman\u2019s body shook violently as she leaped into the bed tossing the blanket over herself to shield her almost naked body from this man he had only just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Lorenzo popped his head into the room. \u201cEverything already Madam?\u201d He had clearly seen her tattered dress, the empty plates from her meal, and possibly even heard her loud footfalls as she ran into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that dress wasn\u2019t as well put together as I\u2019d hoped.\u201d Carol giggled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this, this is so embarrassing of me. I fall asleep in your room, and now this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Carol, do not trouble yourself like this, you have been the utmost of guests. You honor me by accepting my dinner invitation, enjoying every course I serve. As your host it is my responsibility to put you up for the night if needed. And now I wish to thank your incredible accompaniment with a gift.\u201d It was at this time that Carol noticed the paper bag holding the clothes Lorenzo had gone out to fetch. Lorenzo placed the bag down beside him. \u201cI will give you your privacy while you change.\u201d Carol just sat there mostly under the covers still, clearly hiding her fleshy body, watching and smiling as Lorenzo walked out closing the door behind him. As soon as the door clicked close Carol was able to uncover herself, allowing her vast amount of bulk to once again be exposed to the warm fresh sea air and morning sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed the bag, picking out all the objects one by one. In the bag were a pair of leggings that she was able to get up her thick thighs and around her inflated booty. Also inside was a lightweight and airy tank top that was big enough to reach her waist, something all of her old clothes could no longer due. And then the final big piece was an elegant yellow sundress. It fit very well and seemed plenty sturdy, Carol was happy about that. The rest of the bag contained a nice pair and fashionable sandals and sunglasses, as well as an elegant hat that would keep the sun out of the beauties face. Carol put the whole ensemble on, and emerged back out onto Lorenzo's living space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo was over by the railing overlooking the water, but turned around when he heard Carol making her entrance. \u201cStunning. I\u2019ve never known such a beauty before.\u201d Carol blushed. \u201cAs not to step over a line, your husband is one lucky man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol couldn't help but scoff at the remark. \u201cIf only Harold saw things that way.\u201d She joked. \u201cHe has been nothing but a grouch since we got on board. Oh here I go again, telling you things you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo go ahead, who will you tell if not me? We are hundreds of miles out at sea.\u201d Lorenzo propositioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorenzo you have just been such a delight, I just don\u2019t want to spoil your good natured gestures by rambling on about my pig of a husband. It\u2019s just that, I don\u2019t understand why he needs to criticize all the time. He thinks he always knows right. Then the other night I smell perfume on his collar. I mean I might be overreacting, but we have been saving for this cruise for years and he is not even treating it like a vacation, he is just doing whatever he pleases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarol I have to say I\u2019m very concerned at this. May I offer a suggestion. Let me set you up with a private room for a few days, I think it best for you to take some time to clear your head, a little separation might help you do that. And I wouldn\u2019t come out to the restaurant, you wouldn\u2019t want to run into Harold like that, you should meet him on your terms when you are ready. I\u2019ll tell the staff to rush any orders coming out of your room, so feel free to order whatever you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol too a second to ponder this amazing offer. On one hand Carol was already nervous that Harold might be concerned since she didn\u2019t come back to the room last night, but on the other hand Harold had been acting like an ass for the past week, and even more so the other night so why should she care what he thought. Maybe Lorenzo was right, maybe she did need some time to herself. His offer was very generous, but so far everything he had done for Carol had been generous, she might as well allow him to do this as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorenzo you are just too nice. I think you are right, a few days away from Harold will do me good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then let me show you to your room, and then I\u2019ll make the necessary preparations while at work.\u201d Lorenzo took Carol down the hall away from his lush cabin. As Carol waddled in front of her generous gentleman, her ass swayed behind rhythmically bouncing up and down and side to side. Lorenzo directed her into an area of rooms she was not familiar with. It seemed very quiet compared to what she was used to, and it also seemed far away from much of the ship's entertainment.</span></div></div>",

The place looked much nicer and roomier than the cheap room Harold had booked. \u201cWow Lorenzo this place is nice. Any you are sure it\u2019s ok for me to stay here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course madam. This room is reserved for honored guests, and you just so happened to be my new honored guest, the room is yours for as long as you\u2019d like. But I must take my leave, I\u2019ll come check on you later.\u201d Lorenzo took Carol\u2019s pudgy hand giving it a kiss and he bowed, and then we off and on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol started looking all over the room, the first thing anyone does when they are in new living quarters for the first time. One of the first things she noticed though was a large basket of treats in the kitchen area. \u2018Oh this must be like a welcome basket for any honored guests that stay here, I might as well help myself since I\u2019m not an honored guest.\u2019 Carol thought to herself jokingly. She took the cellophane off the basket and started in on one of the sleeves of chocolate covered cookies. Carol munched away, grabbing the next treat out of the basket as finished her first. All the goods looked locally made and well and fresh, but they did not compare to the fresh delights that came out of the kitchen here, or from Lorenzo\u2019s own hands. Despite that fact she continued to eat them until they were all gone. By now she had explored the expansive cabin up and down, finding all the little extra touches an upper class room like this had to offer. Now that she was bored she had only one thing she wanted to do to fill her time, eat. She quickly found a menu and called in an order. Just like Lorenzo said, the service was very speedy, Carol\u2019s large meal was delivered within minutes. Carol munched her time away, demolishing the cart of food before ordering more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept this up all day, just like she had before, just this time she didn\u2019t have to waddle back up to the buffet or to a new restaurant when she wanted something new, she could relax in her recliner and chow down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten to dinner time and Carol just had delivered a feast to fill her up for the night, or at least try to. She rolled the three serving carts into her bedroom so she could lie down while she pigged out and watch the big flat screen in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just take a bite out of a huge bbq chicken leg when she heard a knock at the door. \u2018Who could that be?\u2019 She wondered. She lumbered over to the door, opening it and finding Lorenzo on the other side, who else would know she was here. \u201cLorenzo it\u2019s so nice to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you are enjoying yourself I see?\u201d Lorenzo looked down at Carol\u2019s stuffed belly knowing she must have been eating well all day. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come treat you to some dinner since I know you\u2019ve been alone all day. I made this all myself.\u201d He said as he gestured to two servers carts bursting with food in the hallway, wheeling them inside as he came into the cabin himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lorenzo I wish I had known, I just ordered dinner myself.\u201d She gestured over herself to the meal she had ordered just waiting in the other room. She chuckled before continuing. \u201cWell at least we know we won\u2019t go hungry today.\u201d Little did she know that Lorenzo had no intention of eating a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol waddled back into the bedroom, Lorenzo insisted that he not interrupt her plans. So she crawled back into bed, Lorenzo sitting in a one of the chairs next to the bed and one of the food carts in between them. Carol started munching down like normal, the two of them making conversational chit chat, Lorenzo had quite the way to engage in interesting conversation, keeping Carol occupied for hours has she continued eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had polished off the three carts she had ordered, Lorenzo wheeled in the two that he had prepared himself. \u201cNow I bet this is going to be a real treat, your food is just marvelous.\u201d Carol complemented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Carol your compliments just fill me with joy whenever I hear them. your remarks about my cuisine make me feel like the most successful Chef in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo presented Carol with the first course he had prepared and she took no time getting started. Even after eating all day and the three carts of dinner she had just polished off she surprisingly still had room for more. Carol ate platter by platter of delectable food that Lorenzo had prepared, she was in hog heaven so to say. Her massive gut surged forward with all the food she had packed away in it today. She was even starting to put some strain on the roomier dress that she had acquired just earlier today. None of this stopped her or even slowed her down, and she had finished Lorenzo's first cart before either of them knew it. Lorenzo wheeled over the fifth and final cart for Carol to start on.</span></div></div>",

Carol continued to dig in, but about halfway through the cart she beckoned for Lorenzo to come over and help. He more than graciously picked up her fork and started to help her finish the meal. He started to heap big forkfuls of pasta into Carol's awaiting mouth. Now this time it was Carol who had instinctively started to rub her own distended belly with both hands. It had felt so good when Lorenzo had done it last night so her brain mindlessly started to try and relieve her full tummy again. Carol moaned as she continued to be fed and rub herself during this pleasurable experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo was polishing off plate after plate into Carol's gullet, nearing the end of the emptying cart quickly. Finally the two of them together had finished off all the food and Carol leaned back as she let it all Digest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorenzo it was all so good.\u201d She cooed as she let her eyes close in pleasure. \u201cI am so full but somehow I still crave more of your cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes Carol, you honor me so much, and there is plenty more where that came from. I'll be sure to whip up more for you tomorrow night. But for now what do you say have, you left room for any dessert? I'm sure a woman like you can't go to bed without her sweets.\u201d Lorenzo encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned at the thought of some delectable pastries and cakes. \u201cOh Lorenzo I'm so full but I guess I can have a few treats before bed. Would you be a doll and order some up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my dear just a moment.\u201d Lorenzo went and picked up the receiver in the other room and Carol could roughly hear him calling in a delivery order. The service was quick as usual and the delivery arrived in mere moments. Carol was too stuffed to even move so Lorenzo answered the door and wheeled the desert into the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another serving cart appeared in the doorway Carol's eyes widened at the sheer amount of food Lorenzo had ordered. \u201cLorenzo honey I'm not sure I can eat that much I thought you were just going to order a few things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Miss Carol I did not know what you were in the mood for so I ordered a little bit of everything. I made sure to get it from the best sweet shop on board.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess I can at least take a look at what you got.\u201d Carol said as Lorenzo brought the cart over to her side. Carol leaned over trying to examine all the items on the three different tiers of the serving cart. She shifted her massive bulk in order to get a good view letting the rest of her soft body jiggle as she made the abrupt motion. \u201cHere let me try this one first.\u201d She said as she grabbed a small serving off the cart. Before she knew it she had finished her first treat and was reaching back for more. Quickly though Lorenzo noticed Carol slowing down and looking like she could not take any more on her own. This is when he jumped to action and started helping serve the large woman himself. Carol gave over control without a fight, and allowed Lorenzo to feed her as much as he liked. This time with the much simpler fair Lorenzo was again able to rub the lovely ladies distended belly with his free hand. Carol allowed it as again it felt amazing to get that relief while also being able to suck down more sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had her eyes closed so she didn\u2019t notice that she had polished off the entire dessert cart until Lorenzo stopped popping more into her mouth. He did continue to rub her enormous stomach though as she slowly opened her eyes. \u201cWow we finished that whole thing? I didn\u2019t know it was possible. I guess that's what happens when the food here is so good.\u201d Lorenzo nodded in agreement, as he felt his time to disembark had come, as to now step over any boundaries, this lovely lady was married after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol said goodnight, and Lorenzo left, and Carol had no problem drifting right off to sleep instantaneously. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next couple of days passed much like that first one, Carol calling room service all day and then Lorenzo showing up for dinner at night, making sure she was properly stuffed before going to bed. This extra laziness and increased gluttony was doing wonders for Carols waistline. She was already bursting out of the sundress Lorenzo had just got for her, and he had replaced it with a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending three days away in her own cabin Carol had decided it was time to go back and address Harold. Lorenzo understood and told her she could come back at any time if she needed to. After a nice humongous breakfast that Lorenzo had prepared for Carol, she gave him a kiss on the cheek for being such a gentleman, and she waddled off towards her old room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it had gotten to about 11am, Harold was getting a late start and was still in his room. His wife had been gone for three days, but Harold had not gotten too concerned yet. He had totally forgotten that she mentioned plans to have dinner with a chef, he had been too drunk to remember too many of the details from that night. But he did remember how mad she was, that's why he knew she must just be blowing off steam, and she\u2019d return when she was ready. In another day or two is when he would start getting a bit more worried that she was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold had changed into his board shorts and grabbed his towel and was ready to hit the sun, thinking he\u2019d hit a few golf balls today with some of the older guys who at the range every day, drinking beers from noon o\u2019clock on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooted out of the cabin and was walking down the deck when he spotted her. At first he didn\u2019t recognize her, not sure if it was the new wardrobe, or maybe the sunglasses and hat were obscuring too much of her face, but something inside after a few moments told him that this was his wife lumbering towards him. He didn\u2019t want to believe his gut feeling, but it was confirmed as she took her sunglasses down and started calling this name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarold!\u201d She called as she waved her hand in the air, her meaty upper arms shaking back and forth. A pit formed in his stomach. Not that he wasn\u2019t happy to see his wife, he was glad to know she had calmed down and had returned. No the pit was due to her large carol looked. It looked like she had grabbed a beach ball from the pool and stuffed it under her dress. Carol was pushing 350 after all the recent indulging, a huge gain from the last time Harold saw her. Carol had gotten absolutely fat during this cruise, and it made Harold\u2019s head spin. As they finally approached each other Carol opened her beefy arms and gave Harold a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi honey.\u201d She purred. Harold was just speechless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been gone for so long, I just needed to clear my head. I was so angry with you the other night, but I know what you did didn\u2019t mean anything, so I\u2019m sorry for overreacting. I just want us to have a nice cruise. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was still slack jawed. Huge, absolutely huge. He couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes were showing him. Carol was just staring at him, waiting for him to respond, so he just blurted out the thought he couldn\u2019t get out of his head. \u201cWhere have you been? Staying at the overnight buffet for three days straight?\u201d Harold\u2019s eyes were wide as his unbelievable curiosity was at it\u2019s limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than take this as an attack at her waistline, Carol felt under the gun due to the circumstances that lead to her receiving a private room for three days. She didn\u2019t know how Harold would react to another man\u2019s overly generous demeanor towards her, especially after the fight they had gotten into the other night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the chefs got me a private room so I could cool my head.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harold seemed to brush off her excuse, his question was more redundant and aimed at her inflated waistline, rather than her sleeping arrangements. Maybe that was because he thought what nefarious tasks could she be up to especially with her new increased girthiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, I do want to have a good time. I just\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d Harold stumbled to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok honey bear, we are back together, let's just start vacationing! Are you hungry? Let\u2019s grab a bite.\u201d She said nonchalantly, wrapping her thick wrist around his manly arm and tugging him in the direction of the closest buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was powerless to stop her. He didn\u2019t know what to say about her weight, but he certainly didn\u2019t want to start another fight, so he just went with the flow. The couple arrived at the buffet, Carol loading up a full plate of breakfast goodies, a stack of french toast with excessive amount of butter and syrup, a heap of sausage links, along with a layer of fresh bacon on top of it all. Harold wasn\u2019t quite in the mood to eat. \u2018Oh that Harold, never much of a breakfast eater.\u2019 Carol entertained her brain as she waddled to a close table, excited to enjoy her tasty meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold sat across from her as she started to dig into her calorie laden meal. Besides her rounded face, all Harold could see were Carol\u2019s Zepline sized hooters packed into her dress. Her chest had grown massive just like the rest of her, and now at this angle he was finally able to get a good look at it. The ripe girls were quite exposed in the low cut dress she had on, and it also didn\u2019t help that the fleshy tits were so big they were straining the fabric pushing it out further than it was made for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol just sat there eating like someone was going to take her food away if she didn\u2019t finish fast enough. To Harold she was eating like a complete pig. She had sat down with a fairly full plate, but in Carol\u2019s hands it was emptied quite quickly. The large girl had gotten accustomed to large meals and serving platters full of food, Lorenzo had spoiled her quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last bite went into her mouth, she was quickly headed back up to the line for more. Harold noticed her lips were covered from all the thick syrup off the meal she had just enjoyed, and even some had dribbled onto her chin. He watched as her wide ass swayed with the skin tight jersey dress she wore. Part of him was disgusted at the unusual large size of his wife's bubble butt, they other part of him remembered when he had been so attracted to her in their younger years. But now she was a waddling wide load, jiggling as she took each step, her thick legs touching down to the knee, her pale skin pulled tight as her legs had been injected with pure fat ever since the cruise started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Carol was back with a plate bigger than the first. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not hungry Harold?\u201d Carol asked with some concern as she had already taken her first bite and was talking with her mouth a little full. Harold just shook his head, not being able to take his eyes off his transformed wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol packed away plate after plate, Harold surprisingly not shocked at his wife\u2019s massive appetite. \u2018No wonder she was so large\u2019 He thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After her 15th plate Carol started slowing down. Harold thought this a good time to take some action finally. \u201cHoney want to go out by the pool? What\u2019s a cruise if you don\u2019t come back with a tan.\u201d Carol looked on the fence, she would be perfectly happy staying in here all day munching to her heart's content. \u201cThey have a poolside buffet\u2026\u201d Harold added, knowing that would help win over his porky wife. A smile emerged on her face as soon as he added that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that would be fun.\u201d She said, looking to be cooperative after the couple's lack of corresponding interests since the cruise started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat let\u2019s get you back to the room and into a swimsuit.\u201d The crux of his master plan emerging. He knew none of her clothes or swimwear she packed would fit her enormous new body. They only thing that fit her were these new dresses she kept dawning as she grew bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was a bit timid at this latest idea, she did not know the extent of her growth, but she knew something about her was thicker. Her boobs for sure she knew had grown a little bit. But again she wanted to be cooperative so she agreed. Harold was smiling for the first time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the room Harold rushed to where Carol had packed all her clothes, grabbing out a bikini that she used to love wearing, well that was before she grew. Now there was no way it was going to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Honey!\u201d Harold exclaimed. Carol started to disrobe in front of Harold like she had done so many times before, but this time things were different. She unfastened the tight dress, slowly taking it off revealing all of her new bulges. The first thing to come out were her massive hooters. The large mammaries sat as perkily as they could on top on Carol's large belly showing only a little sag despite their very large size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the reveal of Carol's huge tummy. The soft pale amalgamation of rolls had grown tremendously. Harold was stunned when the thing was hidden behind fabric, but he was even more surprised now that her belly had room to breathe and expand. The lardy middle protruded outward in a massive dome of rolls and folds. It hung slightly over her waist and in her lap. Finally she wriggled the dress over her round ass and it just fell to the floor from there. Her naked hips flared out at her sides making her even wider. Her hips lead down to her thunder thighs, which Harold had gotten a good look at the back of in the buffet, and the front looked just a fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol waddled over to where Harold was holding the bikini, her mountainous form jiggling and wobbling with each heavy step. Grabbing it out of his hands with a smile, she tried putting it on. First came the top, when the she couldn't tie the back she asked Harold for help. \u201cDear, there isn't enough length here to tie it off.\u201d He giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on now, when did they get so small?\u201d Carol said in frustration. \u201cHere let's try the bottoms then.\u201d Carol bent over, allowing all of her rolls to smash together, and for her rack bounce all over the place. She slid the stretchy bottoms up, but when it came to her ass they only came about halfway up. The band only was so long and her ass was just too wide. And the fabric that did come up to her cover her bum was so little that most of her cheek was hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter failing on both fronts Carol turned to Harold and pouted. This was it, the moment Harold had been waiting for, finally Carol was going to say he was so right and realize how fat she had really gotten.</span></div></div>",

Jesus she really is huge.\u2019 Harold had come to grips that his wife was now fatter than fat, but all these new little milestones were still so shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol picked out of couple of swimsuits and tried them on making sure they fit. Everything fit well, kinda snug, but that's usually what you want when it comes to swimwear. She paid up front, and had already changed into one to walk out of the store with. She had purchased a wrap as well to keep herself decent until she arrived poolside, where it would be more appropriate to let it all hang out, so to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright honey, let's get poolside, I'm getting hungry.\u201d It had been an hour since Carol had left the buffet, the first hour she had not eaten something in days, except for when she was sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold did not know what to do with himself, his wife was as big as a house and it seemed like she showed no signs of stopping. She seemed unphased by her new size, but she also didn't seem aware of just how large she had gotten.

She took off her wrap revealing her full form for all to see, only covered by a bikini that would be considered skimpy due Carol\u2019s large size and amount of flesh that was left uncovered. I\u2019d love to say there were shocked looks and gasps from across the deck, but sadly besides a few looks the wide woman received, no one really paid attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk honey where is this buffet?\u201d She asked turning to Harold, since this is a part of the ship she had never been too, if it wasn\u2019t a restaurant Carol had not visited it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDearest, why don\u2019t we sit down for a moment first? What's the rush?\u201d Harold tried to hold onto any last straws that might be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe I\u2019m starving though!\u201d Carol complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just had breakfast an hour ago.\u201d Harold reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! It\u2019s time for some lunch.\u201d Carol was looking out to the other side of the pool, looking to see where they had the food set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold had no more cards to play and folded. \u201cOk hun, it\u2019s right this way.\u201d Carol broke out in a big smile and Harold lead her to the tasty and plentiful poolside buffet. Carol polished of several plates as Harold sat there in boredom. He thought to himself he much rather be hitting golf balls and drinking beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carol had gotten a little satisfied (it had taken seven plates just to stop her stomach from yelling at her) Harold had convinced her to return to their lounge chairs. \u201cBut Harold I\u2019m not full yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pool boys can bring you something if you get hungry dear, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh they will?\u201d Carol said, cleaning her mouth with a napkin. After that Carol was much more willing to return to her seat by the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the plastic strap chairs were quite durable, because when Carol parked her massive rear down she almost sank to the deck below. She had so much bulk though she felt like she was sitting up normally. Harold just paid no mind to his zaftig of a wife and just closed his eyes enjoying the rays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot five minutes in did Carol start to get irritable. \u201cHoney where are these pool boys you spoke of? I wanna get a snack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ugg* Harold groaned. He was getting sick of all this insistence on food. Lucky for him he didn\u2019t have to respond or go fetch someone for his insistent wife, rather someone had just approached them looking to see if they needed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you folks anything?\u201d The pool boy noticing just how big and revealed Carol was now that he was up close and personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d Carol started, not missing a beat. \u201cWhat do you have on the menu that I can order?\u201d The young man presented Carol with the short menu, and she decided she would take one of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarol!\u201d Outburst Harold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She plainly questioned back. \u201cThere\u2019s only like 6 things on this menu, it won\u2019t take me long to figure out what I like.\u201d The pool boy started to write the order down, even though it was pretty easy to remember one of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, thinking for a moment. \u201cDo you want fries with all of those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm yes.\u201d Carol smacked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get a drink?\u201d Harold groaned. \u201cOld fashioned, neat, and keep em coming.\u201d Harold held his head down low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and an extra thick chocolate milkshake for me!\u201d Carol beemed. The boy walked away with the odd order, returning a short while later which Carol\u2019s abundance of food. He even had to bring over a second deck table to fit all the food on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore taking off he had one last plate. \u201cComplements of the chef.\u201d He said has he handed Carol a small decorated cake. Carol knew right away it was from Lorenzo, and upon biting into it she was 100% confident it was, because it was the best damn cake she had ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarold you\u2019ve got to try this.\u201d She said sticking out a forkful out for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine more for me.\u201d Carol said as she popped the bite into her mouth. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, after a long day at the pool, a day filled with Carol snacking and Harold groaning, it had become dinner time, a meal that Carol treasured dearly. \u201cHarold let's go to a nice restaurant tonight?\u201d Carol almost begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d Harold caved immediately. He was victimless to fight at the moment. They returned to their room to change out of their swimwear and into something a little nicer. The only apparel Carol owned though that would fit was the dress she had on earlier. It would have to do, so she retrieved it from the shopping bag and started to put it on. It was a bit tighter of a fit than earlier today, but it still covered up all the parts it needed to and tied at the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold marveled at his wide wife as she looked bigger now than she had when he first saw her earlier today. Harold threw on a nice shirt and sport coat. \u201cHarold, looking good.\u201d She purred. Harold could only smile, he did not have a similar complement to pay her back, she looked as round as ever and possibly bursting out of that dress any moment. \u201cHow about we go to that steakhouse, you know the one up on the deck above us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Harold didn\u2019t really care he, knew Carol was going to find some way to over eat no matter where they went. Even if they went to a salad bar, he bet Carol would just drink the creamy salad dressing straight from the bottle just to pump even more calories into her self. Unfortunately Harold wasn\u2019t going to see that tonight, because Carol was already making her way out the door and in the direction of the steakhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a table for two, no booths due to Carol\u2019s size, the couple sat down to a nice meal. There was bread and butter on the table, which Carol managed to eat herself before their waiter could get their drinks to the table, but he graciously refilled it after taking their orders. Carol downed two more baskets of bread before her meal arrive, which it did in the arms of four of the busboys. Carol looked on in glee at the steaming plates of food being placed on the table, excited to try it all. Harold just sat there and sipped his tall beer. Steaks of all sorts of shapes and sizes, a rack of ribs, couple of pulled pork sandwiches, and of course multiple of all the tasty sides including mostly orders of mashed potatoes covered in gravy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol didn\u2019t know where to start, but she went to town quickly. The waiter kept replacing her beer each time she guzzled it down with her meal, and plate by plate slowly cleared off the table. Big chunks of steak covered in A1 sauce, BBQ sauce covered sausage like fingers bringing bite after bite up to the porkers mouth. The mountain of meat was slowly disappearing, and Carol\u2019s stomach was slowly expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Harold was going with the flow, if Carol wanted to eat, how was he going to stop her He just thought let her order as much as she wants, if she keeps this up he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer this marriage could last, her increased waistline could be somebody else's problem. Harold still loved Carol, but this behavior was starting to drive a wedge between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had started to get into her meal even more as it went on. She started making a bigger mess and more of a pig of herself. Sauces coated her lips and hands, and dribbles had even fallen down onto her chest. But Carol paid no mind, she just continued to eat enjoy herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour the table was finally cleared. Carol had eaten a lot and had filled up quite a bit but was nowhere near capacity. Yet she was very satisfied by the large and tasty meal. \u201cReady for dessert honey?\u201d Carol cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgg, do we have to?\u201d Harold replied. \u201cCan't we just go back to our room?\u201d Harold pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a great idea.\u201d Carol squealed. \u201cWe can just order room service. Honey bunny you think of everything.\u201d Harold's didn't know how he became the hero in this situation but he would take it, anything to get his gorging wife out of the public eye and them into some privacy. Harold gentlemanly helped his bloated wife up from the table and escorted her as she wobbled out of the restaurant and back to their room. </span></div></div>",

They're mashed potatoes were to die for. Promise me we'll go back again before the cruise is over, I could have definitely tried so many more things there.\u201d Harold's just stood beside her letting her words watch over him blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the room Carol collapsed in a nearby chair allowing her stomach to digest her recent meal. \u201cHarold, honey, could you bring me the room service menu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn't you take a minute before getting more food?\u201d Harold attempted to slow his wife down, with any luck she would pass out from all how full she already was and he\u2019d be off the hook for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey I just wanna look at what they have.\u201d Harold obliged handing her the long and descriptive menu. Carol slouched there reading it over oohing and awwing at every little menu item they had. Soon enough she was ready to place her order, sooner than Harold would have agreed with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol picked up the nearby receiver and started telling the person on the other her large after dinner order. It included a few additional entrees as well as some tasty-looking appetizers and snacks. But the bulk of her order and what she most desired was in the desert department. Carol just couldn't help but try everything that her big tummy demanded and ordered almost everything off the menu. Harold just rolled his eyes as Carol seemed to be getting excited and worked up as she rattled off all the menu items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDearest don't you think that was a bit much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d Carol humbly asked back. It didn't matter because the order was coming no matter what and surprisingly it came very quickly for the amount of food that Carol ordered. When the knock came to the door Carol gesture for Harold to go and open it. She did not want to engage in the effort it would take to get up. As soon as Harold opened the door the young men on the other side pushed all of the bursting full service carts containing Carol's meal into their small cabin. After dropping off all four carts they left, closing the door behind them. Carol just sat there with a bevy of carts in a semicircle in front of her. Harold stood on the other side giving a disapproving look for what was taking place in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol did not even notice the look her husband was giving her, instead he just dug right into her newly and fresh meal. She started with some chicken wings and worked her way onto some mozzarella sticks and crispy chicken tenders. Everything came with ample amounts of dipping sauce and Carol use them to great effect. Next up were the additional entrees she had ordered, juicy burgers and a few creamy pasta dishes. Carol cleaned plate after plate loading the empty dirty dishes back on to the cart when she was done with them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally it became time for her desserts, which took up more or less three out of the four carts that had been delivered. It was getting late into the night and Carol wished to lie down in bed as she enjoyed her numerous desserts. \u201cHarold honey.\u201d She called out, as Harold had excused himself to the other room as Carol continued her gorge on more food. Harold begrudgingly came back out into the main quarters to find his wife still sitting looking even more stuffed. \u201cHoney could you help me up and into bed.\u201d Carol asked her loving husband. \u201cAnd don't forget the dessert carts, ok babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold could not believe it but he was actually helping his wife accomplish this task that she should have been able to easily do herself. But with her increased size and gluttony she had become incredibly lazy Harold was learning. So Harold helped her up and from there she was able to waddle into the bedroom and take off her dress, leaving her in her bra and panties. Carol crawled into bed and found a comfortable position, as Harrow wheeled all 3 carts of dessert up to the bed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol took no time reaching for the first thing, stuffing it in her mouth, thanking Harold for his help as her mouth was full of cream from the eclaire she had just stuffed. Harold said nothing as he just scooted to his side of the bed laying down and taking back out his book. Next to him lie a massive uncovered belly that was filling his wife's lap. Harold tried to focus on his book, but he could help but get distracted by the sight in the corner of his eye, just so much flesh. It didn\u2019t help that he could hear Carol wolfing down confections one after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had polished off the first cart and was working on the second, when she started to engage Harold in conversation. \u201cDid you have a good time today honey?\u201d Carol asked as she muched on a slice of Boston Cream pie that she was eating by hand. As she popped the last of the slice in her mouth one of her hands mindlessly drifted and started to lghtly rub her own belly. She continued to look Harold in the eye, awaiting his response, but Harold couldn\u2019t get his mind off what was happening right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he snapped back to reality and answered her. \u201cUmm, oh, yeah, ah yeah I had a good time. Tomorrow though I think I\u2019m going to go hit some golf balls with some guys, you wouldn't be interested, so I\u2019ll probably just take off before you leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to come and be you ball girl?\u201d She asked him seductively. \u201cWe can go to the pro shop and get me one of those preppy pink polos to wear, you know the one the balls sluts wear on TV, with the low but and all the buttons undone?\u201d Harold could just picture it now, his wide as a house wife sitting on the deck behind all the guys hitting golf balls, smoking, and drinking, Carol just surrounded by plates from the deck service, pigging away as usual, after having packed herself into a small pink polo and skin tight cream colored golf shorts. Wouldn\u2019t he just be the laugh of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs fun as that sounds, we don\u2019t really need a ball girl.\u201d He said, letting her down gentilly. \u201cAlso I don\u2019t think they would appreciate you calling them ball sluts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I\u2019m just kidding Harold, I know they are called ball whores.\u201d Carol laughed sending waves of blubber jiggling everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had not missed a beat and was halfway through cart number two, but she was starting to reach her limit. She knew she could be pushed to finish it all, but not without help. \u201cHarold.\u201d She said getting his attention again. \u201cWould you mind doing me one more favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d He responded, putting his book back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I want to finish the rest of these treats, and I know I can, but I just need a little help. Would you mind helping me out a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp you out? But how?\u201d Harold was puzzled at what his wife was asking of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to feed me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeed you?!\u201d Harold repeated in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I can\u2019t do it all on my own, I need you to feed me until all the food is gone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no way am I doing that.\u201d Harold protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut please Harold? It\u2019s not that hard, you just take the food and put it in my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I help you indulge like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you love me sweetie?\u201d Carol reasoned. After this mind bender of a day Harold knew not that to think. This Carol was totally new to him, but yet she was still his wife. He remembered his wedding vows from so long ago \u2018until death do us part\u2019. This was his wife so he just had to suck it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk honey, I\u2019ll try and help.\u201d Harold finally resolved. He moved back to her side of the bed so he could be next to the food, and took a seat next to her massive belly. He took the first thing that looked easy to grab and feed some one and slowly approached Carol\u2019s lips. Carol opened her mouth wide, ready to accept the delicious delivery of food, closing her eyes in the process. The plump wife took a big bite, chewing slowly as her mouth closed. Soon she was ready for more and Harold delivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one Harold unloaded the tray into his eager wife. The whole time she just moaned in pleasure as she ate more and more. \u2018Was she really that into this?\u2019 Harold had to ask himself. But that didn\u2019t stop him as he finished off the second cart and started on the last. Harold had picked up the pace, the faster they went the sooner he finished this unusual task. But this only got his wife more riled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRub me!\u201d She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me, rub me.\u201d She grabbed his free hand and smacked it on her large stomach starting to move it in large circles. \u201cKeep feeding me, don\u2019t stop.\u201d She said when Harold got distracted by his secondary task. \u201cMore Harold, More! Mmmm!\u201d She moaned as her husband stuffed her mouth full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold not sure how to proceed decided to move his hand up to his wife\u2019s large chest, because at least that was one bonus out of all of this. \u201cYes, my tits, Harold yes.\u201d Carol rang out as her body writhed in pleasure. Harold kept stuffing her as fast as he would, and the cart was quickly emptying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harold prepared the last few pieces it looked like Carol was at her limit. All of a sudden her tention gave away and her body went limp, sinking back into the bed, her mouth still chewing. \u201cAww babe that was great.\u201d Harold just sat there thinking \u2018What the hell just happened? Did she just orgasm from food? There is no way.\u2019 Harold helped Carol finish the last few treats, but he had stopped vigerously rubbing her boobs or belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was done Harold wheeled the carts out of their room and found his spot back on his side of the bed. They both drifted off to sleep, but Harold couldn\u2019t help but keep asking himself \u2018What just happened?\u2019</span></div></div>",

Not only did Harold truly connect with her and touch her like hadn't in the longest time, but she got to be filled with Lorenzo's marvelous cooking. Lorenzo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was in her dream that once again she was being stuffed like a pig, pinned down under a man who was pouring every food known to man into her mouth. She needed not reach for any food in her dream, so she instead lifted her arms and stroked the man's muscles, his biceps and pecs. \"Wait,\" she thought in the dream, \"Harold doesn't have pecs.\" She then looked up and it was Lorenzo who was feeding her, and she was filled with arousal and an immediate need to be pushed beyond full. She let out a needy moan, so strong that awoke moaning and incredibly horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why at this moment she was hellbent on getting as stuffed as possible.

Some where she was able to find a nice nightgown to cover in, one that cut straight across her chest with a silk band, and was held up with two spaghetti straps that wrapped over her shoulders. The rest of the light weight dress swayed over her bulging form, coming down to drape right about knee length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young middle aged debutante made her way, what she felt was, gracefully down the deck of the ship under the well lit moon. Carol\u2019s footfalls had become much heavier with her increased size, but she paid no mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to go far before she found one of the near by ice cream parlors beaming with light. 'wow I'm surprised they guys are open, but I sure am glad they are.' Carol skipped through the entrance, or at least lumbered quickly through the entrance, spotting the lone counter boy across the room. She flashed him a smile, the boy shocked by a customer at this late hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Carol noticed another figure approaching from the side. It was none other than Lorenzo, quickly coming to Carol's side before she could even step more than a few feet into the establishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miss Carol it is good to see you.\" Lorenzo said in his suave thick purring accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorenzo what are you doing here?\" Carol swooning, tossing her arm up and over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was glad to see you and Harold able to make up.\" He started telling his tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the cake by the way.\" Carol grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course madam.\" Lorenzo bowed. \"So after a nice full day I assumed you might be in need of a chilling treat, so I told them to keep this ice cream shoppe open jist in case you needed to come by, and it is a good thing I did, looks like someone was out for a late night snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I can't help but be a little embarrassed about being hungry at such a late hour, but I have to admit I'm very pleased that this place is still open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for embarrassment my dear, this being the closet option for you I thought it best to keep young Dylan here to have it open.

Carol started gooping the soft serve in big plops in her bowl. A big heaping of death by chocolate, as well as red velvet, next came a layer of rich peanut butter flavor, then on top was cookies and cream. The large bowl was filled to the rim with cold ice cream, so Carol proceeded to the toppings bar. All sorts of crushed candy started to be dumped on top, peanut butter cups, crushed cookies, rainbow Jimmy's. At the end she topped it off with a bunch of whipped cream and hot fudge. Carol had successfully gotten a little bit of everything in her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol notice Lorenzo at a table not too far so she waddled in his direction. She noticed her had on a big smile like he always did 'He must be a very happy man.\u2019 she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sat her wide behind down, her large cheeks rolling over the edges of the chair and squeezing out the back under the back rest. Carol flashed Lorenzo a big smile before taking a big bite of her treat. Carol loved filling her tummy, it filled her with so much joy, this ice cream was no exception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way through though her mind started think about her next conquest, this ice cream was good, but not enough to fill her, and right now Carol wanted to not just fill up, but get pushed to her stuffed limit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to eat she looked up and saw an interesting advertisement. It was the picture of a very large sundae. \u201cLorenzo what is that?\u201d She asked as she pointed a chubby finger at the sign on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that is their famous 32 scoop sundae. It contains one of every flavor, all on a cookie and brownie bed to catch all the melted ice cream, lined with sliced bananas on the side, topped with whipped cream and sprinkles. I bet you'd love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I want one of those next Lorenzo.\u201d Carol felt a twinge deep down that demanded the tasty morsle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have Dylan get started on it right away.\u201d Lorenzo beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol finished off her created concoction right as her next treat was being delivered. The super sized sundae sat in a long boat, the lenght of the 32 scoops, all lined up. Carol started by popping half of a banana in her mouth. \u201cReady to see this destroyed?\u201d Carol asked, eyeing Lorenzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it looks so tasty Miss Carol, you are sure to enjoy.\u201d With that Carol dug hee spoon in, taking a chunk out of the first of many large scoops. The ice cream, the bananas, and whipped cream, it all was crammed into Carol open maw. Carol began to moan as she ate faster and faster, becoming more pigish as she let herself go more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way through Carol went back and started to eat the cookies and brownies that lined the bottom. They had gotten drenched in ice cream, and tasted delightful. She even displaced the rest of the ice cream grabbing the treats that lay below the second half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brief break Carol was back in ice cream mode, enjoying every spoonful. Carol's stomach expanded as she filled it with sugar and cream, putting some real strain on her nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sundae had been delicious, but she was nearing the end. The last several scoops of ice cream had resigned to being melted blobs after so much time in the open warm sea breeze, and there were no longer and snacks to soak up the nectar. \u201cLorenzo I could use your help.\u201d Carol cute but helplessly said. \u201cWould you mind lifting that end?\u201d She asked as she wrapped her mouth around the lower end. Lorenzo did as told, and as he propped up his end the creamy melted ice cream slid down the tray and right down Carol's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol licked her lips after swallowing the last bit of it, rubbing her filled belly. Carol had not only finished a large sundae that would put some one in a food coma, but now she had finished a party sized sundae by herself, making sure to not leave one drip behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm ok what's next?\u201d Carol cooed.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to replicate that warm feeling between her legs, the feeling that had come from being completely stuffed with caloric ecstasy. Carol's eyes darted about, looking to see what could fill her desires best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to have as much as you'd like.\" Lorenzo tried to encourage. Carol who seemed paralyzed with underdetermination finally just decided to go up to one of the soft serve machines and let it rip. She gripped the handle with one of her pudgy hands, cranking it downwards, allowing the soft cool treat to flow freely. At first she got most of it in her mouth, but it was coming out too fast for her to keep up, so she had to back it off a little bit, but not before she had made a bit of a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one small serving of ice cream was not going to do it, Carol moved on to the next machine, getting a big mouthful of the cake batter flavor. Carol continued to squirt mouthful after mouthful, switching to another flavor when ready. Her massive belly was looking slightly more taut, but the rest of her body jiggled just as freely as before. As Carol hunched over each machine, her nightgown could be seen riding up her massive rear. Her big pillowy cheeks fought for room as the garment tightened around the middle aged wife's rolls. The bottom of her cheeks could clearly be seen escaping if she bent over especially far, and her matching pink panties caught some moonlight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she had gotten in enough, well to the point that she didn't want to keep doing all the work. Carol collapsed into a chair, catching her breath, feeling how full she had gotten herself. Carol started to feel a tremor between her legs, causing her to smack her thighs together. She wanted more, she knew it would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorenzo dear.\" Carol knew just what to do. \"Can you help a lady out, I just can't get anymore, would you be a doll and fetch me another sundae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh course Miss Carol, it would be a pleasure.\" A moment later Lorenzo arrived back with a bucket of soft serve. This was no bowl, no vessel a normal customer would use, it was a small bucket filled to the brim with swirling soft serve ice cream.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lorenzo had just handed Carol a bucket of soft serve ice cream, and she was ready and willing to destroy the whole thing. As much as she liked being helped over the edge, a state a fullness she was most surely at right now, she was determined to get there herself. In the past she had used the help of Lorenzo, and this past night Harold, to get her to this overly pleasurable level of stuffed, but she wanted the independence that came with knowing she could control it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol dug right into the creamy and sugary treat, feeling it add to the fullness in the stomach. Her belly became more taut as she reached closer and closer to the bottom of the bucket, tightening her nightgown, which only exposed more of her cleavage and crept even higher around her juicy backside. Despite eating chilling ice cream, a warmth started to grow even brighter inside her. As the warmth grew so did lust to eat even more. Carol scarfed down ice cream like a pig, her face almost completely in the bucket so she didn\u2019t have to move her spoon too far to receive creamy satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bucket contained numerous servings of ice cream, and Carol wasn\u2019t stopping until she had finished it all, she was not one for leaving any scraps behind if that wasn\u2019t obvious by now. The rotund woman shoveled spoonful by spoonful until she was only sifting through a puddle of melted droppings. At this point she tossed the spoon aside and relaxed into her seat, she had gotten so worked up as she wolfed all those calories down she didn\u2019t realize how winded it had made the lazy middle aged wife. Her break was but very brief, as it was only a few seconds before Carol was using the last of her energy to use her pudgy arms to bring the bucket up to her lips. Tipping the bucket up, a rush of warmed sugary cream entered her mouth. Without the energy to control the bucket her mouth quickly filled up with liquid, and she tried to guzzle it down as quickly as she could. Her attempt was futile, as she was not able to keep it all within her maw, and a small stream of melted ice cream came careening down her bulging cheek, over her thick chins, and down on to her generously exposed chest. Carol paid no mind with this little snafu, this was not the first time she had gotten messy while enjoying a good meal during this cruise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally now that all the ice cream was gone, and Carol felt she had reached her stuffed limit, she allowed her body to fully relax. She was riding the wave of pleasure that had come during her binge, and all there was to do now was to slowly come down off of it as everything digested inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Lorenzo graciously helped Carol up and walked her back to her room. The whole way back to her room Carol lumbered precariously step by step. Her massive ice cream meal sloshed back and forth in her taut tummy. Carol was in a haze of fullness, and at this late hour tiredness was starting to creep back in as well. Carol was just grateful that Lorenzo was there to help her, this would have been a much harder ordeal without him. Carol had become the queen of stuffing herself, but she still needed some manly help from time to time when it came to refilling her plate, or helping her to a resting spot once she was completely stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo spoke softly. \u201cMiss Carol, we are here. Will you be able to make it to your bed just fine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Lorenzo I will be just fine.\u201d Carol turned to face her exquisite chef, giving him a good last look at the bulging beauty for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well Miss Carol, and may you enjoy even more of our fine delicacies tomorrow when you wake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know it Mr. Lorenzo.\u201d *Yawn* \u201cI can\u2019t wait to sleep this one off and be ready for more in the morning.\u201d With that, Carol fumbled into her room, letting Lorenzo slink back into the night. Carol slowly trudged her way back to bed, her eyelids getting heavier by the moment, just like her waistline was during this whole cruise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping back down on her side of the bed, she quickly sunk into the soft mattress. Harold was jolted awake by the sudden thud, and quickly realized that his wife had returned. He shuddered to think how much food she had just gone out to consume, especially after that feast of a dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol didn't give it a second thought, she was on the vacation of a lifetime, one that she and her hubby had saved up for. There was no need to resist from indulging, especially when the food here was so magnificent. It was easy to see why Lorenzo was so well compensated, he presented quite the menu across the whole deck, a menu Carol had become intimately familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments Carol had drifted off to sleep, thinking of nothing else other than breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Carol reached out one of her chunky arms to feel for her husband, but her hand only waggled in fresh sea air. This was a signal to Carol that Harold had already gotten up and left to play golf. And if that was the case then it was proper time for Carol to get up herself, which also meant it was breakfast time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol wasted not a second more before rising quickly in bed and scooting off the edge of the bed to go get ready. The wider woman jiggled violently as she shimmied off the mattress, unaware just how much her flab shook now that there was so much excess of it. Carol could not be bothered with such details, breakfast was at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol whipped on some daytime attire, that was fitting more and more poorly at this point. She cleaned herself up and then she was off to the races. Carol had generated such an appetite that she was eating more and more with each passing day. Carol didn\u2019t mind this one bit, she loved that she could eat now, plate after plate without getting full. She also started to like the point at which she started to get full, a point in which she just wanted to cram as much into her mouth as she could so she could make herself as stuffed as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was just like any other that she had free roam of the ship to eat as much and at as many locations as she wanted. A large breakfast buffet turned into brunch at a railside restaurant. After a few servings there by some very generous wait staff, she grabbed a few smoothies and shakes before plopping down for lunch. The hefty woman we feeling extra peckish around noon so she decided to hit up another buffet. After several trays, sampling just about every dish, Carol waddled slowly out of the well stocked buffet. Carol\u2019s big round belly was getting quite full, but she was not ready to throw in the towel yet. Carol was ready to get off her feet though, so she lumbered back to the cabin. With one easy phone call to room service Carol had set herself up for the afternoon. Her food was delivered by room service once again, wheeled in by shining steel carts. Carol\u2019s eyes widened as she surrounded herself by yet another feast. She learned her lesson this time as she started her feast in bed, that way she could relax when ever she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol happily munched her way through her meal, leaving every plate clean before she moved on to the next. Her massive and full belly rested between her meaty thighs, as it continued to grow with every thing she emptied into it. When she had gotten back to the room she had stripped her shorts off, that way nothing was constricting her belly from getting as large as it need it, besides her stomach that is. Carol easily emptied one cart and moved on to the next. The greedy girl ate until there was nothing left to eat. At this point she was so full she had eaten herself into a afternoon food coma. Carol let her head fall to her pillow and she easily drifted off to sleep. The remnants of her meal showed on her face and her chest, but Carol was just happy to have consumed another delicious meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn\u2019t until hours later that Carol awoke. She wiped her groggy eyes, and also her satisfied, but now softer stomach. She looked around the small room, checking to see if Harold had returned, but he had not, or at least if he had, he had not left a trace. Carol glanced over at the clock on her side table and it read 6 o\u2019clock. It was dinner time, and Carol was definitely down for some dinner, so why not go out and get some. Dinner was Carol\u2019s favorite meal of the day, she felt free to eat rich and extensive meals, and on a stomach that had been able to digest for the past few hours, she had plenty of room to put it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped that Harold had returned so the two of them could enjoy dinner again tonight, last night had been so pleasurable for her she would not have minded a repeat performance. Sadly he was not here, but that wouldn\u2019t stop Carol from enjoying herself. Carol changed into an evening dress, one that hugged her nearing 400lbs body almost overly tightly, and took off for somewhere tasty to eat. Carol was feeling that she couldn\u2019t be bothered with the hustle and bustle of a buffet so she decided rather to hit a seated restaurant. Carol felt in the mood for pasta, so she found a place specializing in Italian to take her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide busty woman approached the hostess stand, flashing the young girl standing behind it a big smile. From the look of Carol she knew this woman was a big eater. She generously sat her at a table with a very sturdy and wide chair which left Carol in much comfort. Carol had been struggling with chairs recently as well as booths, and she wasn\u2019t sure why. Of course it was because of her shelf like booty along with her solid slab of belly she carried around with her everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before a waiter had come to her surprisingly large table to start to take her order. He asked if she wanted any appetizers to start with, and since she had not had the chance to look over the menu yet she asked for his recommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well the starter meatballs are very popular, as well as the baked mozzarella with a tasty tomato spread on the side. Another good choice is the sampler platter, a little bit of everything to try. But my favorite the chicken parm sticks, they are bigger than you\u2019d think, and they are to die for, one of our chef\u2019s specialties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll try all of those!\u201d The waiter was a bit stunned. Carol was obviously a big girl, big enough to maybe order two appetizers if she was feeling a little piggish, but to order four appetizers, one of them being the sampler, she wasn\u2019t going to have room for a meal, or so he very naively thought. \u201cAnd make it two orders of those chicken parm sticks, those sound tasty. And make it two orders of the meatballs too actually, I love a good meatball.\u201d The stunned waiter did not flinch and just took down the enormous womans order. The kitchen was going to think he was serving a big party with the amount of food he was going to be requesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had also ordered a drink which came out quickly, it was a sugary cocktail that went down the hatch quite easily. Soon the apps were ready, and they went down just as easy as her drink did, all while her main course was cooked up. Of course she had ordered a plethora of entrees, enough pasta to feed a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was enjoying her meal, slurping down plate after plate of rich creamy pasta, along with a few of her fruity drinks, as her waiter kept up with her dining needs. This had probably been the nicest place she had eaten in since she had been on this cruise, the food was almost as good as the stuff Lorenzo hand crafted himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Carol sat in the posh restaurant, she noticed someone start to walk from table to table, someone who wasn\u2019t a waiter. He looked more like a chef, dressed very similarly to how her friend Lorenzo presented himself most of the time. Soon enough Carol confirmed it as she of heard him speaking to the table next to hers. Afterwards he turned his attention to Carol, who was dining all by herself, yet she was surrounded by dirty dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is everything this evening ma\u2019am? Are you dining alone? You must be enjoying the food quite a bit.\u201d He gestured to the empty dishes before him. He could see how wide his guest was, and also how packed her stomach was from her very tight dress<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes everything is so good. Did you make it your self?\u201d Carol asked before taking another bite of lasagna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made some of the meals myself, I am the head chef of this restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so you must know my friend Lorenzo.\u201d Carol gushed as she name dropped one of the most important men on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so you must be the one Lorenzo mentioned, you fit the description perfectly. He told me you had the more exquisite taste in food. I must bring you out two of my special meals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Carol tried to be modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no I insist. You\u2019ve obviously been enjoying yourself tonight, let me enhance that by allowing me to cook two of my most famous dishes, I have not doubt you won\u2019t love them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol got red in the face by the lovely gesture. \u201cOk well if you insist.\u201d She gawked. With that the chef returned to the kitchen, not even acknowledging any of the other tables. By the time Carol had finished the rest of her meal, the chef was on his way back carrying a large dish, with a waiter next to him carrying an equal size one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the portion size is large, but I don\u2019t make this everyday, and only for the very best guests, and a friend of Lorenzo\u2019s deserves the very best.\u201d He placed the first dish down which looked like a double serving of pasta with a thick sauce covering the whole thing, and about four different kinds of meat. \u201cFirst we have Tortellini Carbonara, with Alaskan king crab, Dutch shrimp, and white belly tuna.\u201d Carol tried the first bite and her taste buds exploded. She didn\u2019t know why, but the texture of the seafood, the consistence of the pasta, mixed with the flavor of the thick sauce, coating just the right about a food, and of course the mix of cheese bursting in each bite, made for the perfect combination in her mouth. Now the plate looked like it could fed two adults quite well for an evening, but Carol was expected to finish it all herself. She got right to work, shoveling spoonful after spoonful into her mouth. Quickly the dish disappeared before her very eyes, and deep it sat in her expanded stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really do like fine cooking. Good thing I\u2019ve whipped up my other special for you.\u201d The chef continued before placing the next large plate before Carol\u2019s awaiting lips. \u201cThis next one is a little bit lighter, but I\u2019ve added some alfredo to give it some heft. It\u2019s gemelli with spicy chorizo sausage with a reduced alfredo sauce.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol took a forkful past her plump lips, comparing and contrasting the dish to the last. \u201cI loved the last dish, I wasn\u2019t sure if this one could live up to it, but it's just as good. Totally different, but still just as good.\u201d Without another word, Carol started to eat the dish by the forkful, making sure to get every last noodle and piece of sausage, covering them generously in the thick alfredo sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done Carol leaned back to give her body a rest, she had eaten quite the filling meal tonight, and again been impressed by another one of the chef\u2019s menus. \u201cMiss Carol it was a pleasure meeting your acquaintance tonight. Hopefully the next time to see Chef Lorenzo you remember how good my Italian cooking is. Now don\u2019t lift a finger, let my wait staff come and take care of all of this.\u201d Before she was even able to thank him he was gone, not that she really wanted to muster the words, he stomach was pretty darn full.</span></div></div>",

Please send my regards to the chef.\u201d The men left Carol to her sweets and she did not disappoint when to came to clearing her plate. First she started with the fancy dish, it as all sorts of sauces dripped over it, and some sort of candied ice cream in the middle, it was quite unlike anything Carol had eaten before. After that she enjoyed the very thick cake. The cake didn\u2019t look so menacing at first but after the first bite Carol realized how rich and dense the cake was, but also wonderfully tasty. It was a very powerful chocolate, but not bitter at all. She got every last forkful into her mouth before throwing in the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick breather Carol went to take her leave after quite the exquisite meal. The only issue was she wasn\u2019t finding it too easy to stand. Her tummy had gotten quite heavy with all that rich food in it, and Carol\u2019s arms just were not up to the task of lifting her heavy frame all on their own. Carol rocked back and forth, trying to get enough momentum to get on her feet. The slight rocking shook all of her jiggly mass, most of it confined to her tight dress. As she tried harder and harder to get up she could feel her dress tightening on her. Although the ordeal only took about 15 seconds, it seemed much longer. If Carol was listening she could've heard a few of her threads popping, but she was much too busy huffing and puffing getting to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rocks back and forth she was finally able to get up on her feet. After a brief moment all her jiggling came to a still motion, and Carol was finally able to waddle out of the restaurant. \u2018That was close.\u2019 Carol thought to herself as she made her way back to the cabin. \u2018Usually I have Harold or Lorenzo around when I\u2019m this full to help me out. I\u2019m going to have to be more careful from now on.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had a twinge of concern, but nothing that was going to stop her from stuffing her face and getting so full it hurt to move. At this point though Carol just wanted to curl up in bed for the night. No she wasn\u2019t stuffed to that pleasureable plateau of wonder, but she had eaten her fair share tonight, and was quite pleased with the taste of her meal, as well as her level of filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the portly woman walked, she could feel her dress tightening up all around her. It was getting between the rolls in her front, back and sides. Now she could hear the seams popping in the silence of the night air, away from all the other commotion. Carol was not concerned for her wardrobes safety, but she did wish for some more comfortable fitting clothing.</span></div></div>",

I missed you.\u201d She squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold turned his attention to his wife, as he had just removed his pants, leaving him next to the bed wearing a white tee shirt and blue boxers. \u2018Is it just me or does she look even fatter.\u2019 Was all Harold could think about. He was colloquial enough, definitely not as bubbly as Carol was at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the golf today?\u201d She inquired, as she slipped, more like peeled, out of her evening dress and into a tight nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fine.\u201d Harold plainly replied, obviously not interested in conversation, knowing full well that his zafig wife just spent the whole day stuffing her face. But before he let Carol jump back into her side of the conversation he added with a bit more emphasis. \u201cBut just a heads up I\u2019m gonna go hit balls again tomorrow, so I won\u2019t be around again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ok.\u201d Carol accepted that Harold was on vacation too, so he should be allowed to do the things he wanted, just like Carol was allowed to. \u201cBut can you please be back in time of dinner? I missed you tonight, it wasn\u2019t the same without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t look like that stopped you from enjoying yourself.\u2019 Harold said under his breath as he got into bed. \u201cSure sure, I can be back for dinner.\u201d He said to appease his wife. Although there was turmoil in their marriage, Harold at least wanted to be civil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was pleased and joined her hubby in bed. They both dozed off, Carol of course looking forward to breakfast, and Harold for his chance to get away again for the day. Sadly the following day would not work out as they both had expected. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Carol awoke to find Harold gone again. She wasn\u2019t surprised, the man was pretty passionate about his golf. Carol felt well rested, and ready to take on the day. She let out a big yawn, raising her hamhock arms above her head, allowing them to slap down hard on her sides, sending waves not just across her flabby arms, but also a cascade across her blubbery belly that also shook her chest, her large melons swaying back and forth freely in the unrestricting fabric. Even with her gargantuan gain, Carol was completely unphased and unaware of her titanic size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was morning time, Carol was rip roaring and ready to go for breakfast. Her vast stomach was empty and she was ready to fill it. Her clothes were more restricting than the day before, but she squeezed into an outfit and was bolting out the door as fast as her large frame would allow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gleefully sauntered down the deck of the boat, headed towards somewhere tasty to eat. Her large form swayed side to side as she waddled, her body which had grown double in size over the course of this cruise was quite the vehicle to handle. Although Carol didn\u2019t notice, she was taking up much more space than she was used to. People had to walk around her, or scooch against a wall just to avoid getting bowled over by the large woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol waddled with pride though, nothing was going to get her down. Well maybe a closed down buffet would, but everything thing seemed perfect in Carol\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol found herself turning into a nearby breakfast joint, and not her typical buffet. Recently Carol had started to have a love hate relationship with buffets. She loved the food they provided, but she hated having to get up all the time to resupply. Eating at a sit down restaurant she was able to get as much as she wanted delivered right to her table. When she had the aid of a man though she did enjoy the buffet. Maybe tonight when Harold joined her she could convince him to take her out to one of her favorite buffets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol enjoyed a scrumptious breakfast, one that made her feel quite full. Tall glasses off chocolate milk accompanied the many main dishes Carol enjoyed that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast she got to thinking about what to do with the rest of the day. Very shortly her mind wondered to Harold. She knew he was off golfing, but why should that leave Carol all alone in the lurch? They planned this cruise together, it would be nice to spend more time together than just in bed or dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol decided she would surprise Harold at his little golfing thing, and the same image that horrified Harold, now sounded appealing to Carol. She pictured herself lounging on the deck in chair. In her vision of course she was much thinner than in real life, but that's not the point. Harold would be right in front of her, hitting his golf balls into the sea. Carol would be surrounded by plates from the deck service, eating as much as she wanted, ordering more when ever she ran low. Carol thought this was the perfect idea, and cursed herself for not thinking of it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was not dressed the part though. 'I\u2019m gonna need one of those golf shirts if I'm going to fit in, I don't want to make Harold look bad after all.\u2019 Carol thought as she made her way over to a clothing store she knew would sell what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol lumbered into the store and was quickly greeted by the cashier. \u201cHello ma'am, how can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, I'm looking for like a pink golf shirt, like a polo. Is that something you might have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave Carol a once over to really think if they carried anything in her size. \u201cLet me check in the back\u2026\u201d she hesitantly said. The girl disappeared out back, leaving Carol to her thoughts. Sadly all Carol wanted to think about was what she was going to order first once she found Harold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the girl returned carrying a large pink shirt. \u201cOur changing rooms are just over here if you want to try it on.\u201d Carol went and changed and the shirt fit snugly, but it would have to do, Carol was starting to get a craving and didn't want to deal with trying to switch out the shirt. She paid for her new shirt, ditching her old one in the trash on her way out 'that old rag must have shrunk in the wash one too many times.\u2019</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carol had a vague idea where the golfing area was, so she headed there promptly. The whole time that nagging hunger craving grew worse in the pit of her stomach. 'i'm almost there, but maybe I should stop for something real quick.\u2019 Carol noticed a little bakery and decided to pop in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of sweets hit her nostrils immediately, and Carol was put into a blissful state. The girl behind the counter was nice, and Carol picked out about a dozen items and they were quickly boxes up for her. She took the first bite of one as she walked out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Carol didn't realize is that the powdered sugar on her confections was getting everywhere, and she was making quite the mess. But one by one her box emptied. It was unfortunately her last pastry, a creme filled donut, where she took too big of a bite and a large blob of white creme fell from the hole on the other side, plopping right down on the top part of her dome belly, barely missing her honking hooters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol cursed herself, and on her brand new shirt as well, otherwise she would not have cared. Also she had almost finished the box before making the blunderous error. She wasn't going to let it ruin her day though, she simply scooped up the creme and plopped her finger in her mouth. She tried to wipe away any evidence that she had made the blunder, but all she did was transfer some of the powdered sugar onto her shirt, making her look like more of a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had finally made it to the golf area, and she was shocked to see just how big it was and how many people were here. She thought it would be easy to find Harold, but now she was second guessing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the men were standing up near the edge of the boat, whacking golf balls into the water, this is where she suspected Harold would be. She started to walk down the line of golfers looking for her husband, but about halfway down she had only struck out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having just quenched her hunger with some pastries, her desire for food was coming back. Carol had expected to arrive at this golf place and be quickly prompted with food. This was not the case, she still needed to find Harold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she continued to waddle slowly down the deck looking for her husband. she resorted to calling out his name in an attempt to find him faster. \u201cHarold!\u201d She shouted in a tone that was most distinctly Carol's. She kept this up as she continued going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the end of the deck, Harold faintly heard something off in the distance that caught his ear. He didn't understand it at first but something inside told him it should pique his interest. Then he heard it again, and his brain put two and two together. He turned quickly to confirm his suspicions, but by the time he was able to rationalize what was going on it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol had caught his eye, and was beelining straight towards him. She resembled just how she looked the other day when she had returned from Lorenzo's, except she had only grown bigger. She was flashing the same big smile as before, and she was waving her meaty arm in the air, causing all the fat that had accumulated there to quiver. Her heavy footfalls, and pronounced waddle made the rest of her fat body sway and jiggle in ways that made sure everyone knew just how fat she had let herself become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached Harold, giving him a loving greeting when she finally was near him. \u201cHi hunny.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was a younger woman, and she was standing on the fake green grass between Harold and the ball and holding a golf club. Her stance was so that her body was right next to Harold, and she had undoubtedly just been shoving her ass in his groin as she attempted to hit the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck Harold!\u201d Carol shouted, as she noticed his erection. Her instant change of demeanor and level of volume started to cause a scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarol it\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d Harold tried to save face, even though he was starting to care less and less about his loveless marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not what it looks like? Who is this skank?\u201d Carol had directed her attention now to the young auburn haired girl. She looked like she was a few years younger than Harold, maybe even in her late 20\u2019s. She looked like a bimbo to Carol, as she had a trim waist, but a DD sized rack that was perkily pack on her chest. She also sported a booty that looked round and smooth, Carol grew angry thinking about how this harlot had been using that butt to grind up on her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm my name is Tiffany\u2026\u201d The girl decided to answer meekly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Psh* Carol blew off the girl, not really even caring what she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarol, look at yourself, you\u2019ve turned yourself into a whale during this cruise. Can you really blame me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were a pig Harold, and I hate myself for not figuring it out sooner. Is this why you have been rushing out of the room to play golf? The perfume from the other day? Or are there others, huh? You are a disgusting pig, and I never want to see you again.\u201d With that she turned around and started to waddle away, giving both Harold and Tiffany a perfect view of her titanic ass, watching as each cheek fought for battle as she slowly took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carol was long gone, and the other patrons returned to what they were doing, Tiffany decided to break the silence. \u201cSo that is your wife huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Harold said. \u201cNot for much longer though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s fatter than you even made her out to be\u2026\u201d Tiffany responded as she turned her focus back on the golf ball, and shimming her ass back into Harold\u2019s crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Carol was heading the only place she knew she could, Lorenzo\u2019s. She hoped to damn hell that he was there, she really needed his support right about now. Although up until recently he had been a complete stranger, with everything he had done for Carol, and all the support he had given her, she felt as though he would be the only one who would understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo heard an unexpected feverish knocking at his door, which startled him for just a brief moment. Lorenzo had been experimenting in his kitchen all morning, working on his craft. This had caused numerous meals to start to pile up around his cabin of various consistencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo opened the door, and the 370+ pound Carol barged into his place without even being asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLorenzoThankGodYouAreHereHaroldSuchAPigShouldHaveNeverTrustedHim\u2026\u201d Carol was ranting faster than Lorenzo could keep up. Without even asking Carol grabbed a plate and started to scarf it down. In her rage she had completely forgotten about her appetite and hunger, but now that there was food right in front of her she was going to eat it all. \u201cI\u2019ll show him a whale if he wants to see a whale.\u201d Lorenzo just closed the door behind him.</span></div></div>",

She never even returned for her things from their cabin, not that any of her clothes would fit. Soon after the cruise Harold had received divorce papers, and he was not surprised at all. Now a few months after the cruise had ended they had their court date scheduled. Harold sat at one of the tables in the courtroom, waiting patiently to get started. Tiffany sat in the stands behind him, they had been enjoying their fling ever since their time on the cruise ship together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the entrance opened and in came Carol\u2026 very slowly. Harold\u2019s jaw almost hit the floor when he saw his soon to be ex-wife waddling down the center aisle. If Carol had doubled in size during the cruise, it looked like she had doubled in size again, she must have been over 700 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large lumbering woman walked up and through the double gate, good thing it was a double gate because she would not have fit other wise. Carol was sporting a large green dress that draped over her enormous fat rolls. It hung down to her chunky knees, and surprisingly left much to the imagination, the whole cruise ride Harold had been able to see every bit of flub and fat rolls as they grew due to Carols lack of well fitting attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all you could make out was just how enormous her belly had gotten. It reached out in front of her what looked to be well over an arm length. You couldn\u2019t see where her belly ended, but you could tell it certainly helped build some tremendously large love handles. Also when Carol turned around, you could pretty well see that outline of her enormous ass. The thing had grown exceptionally wide, flaring out the dress at the edges of both cheeks. The only other thing you could tell from looking at her was how well her bust kept up with the rest of her. The pontoons on her chest were well covered, but you could see the outlines of the very full fleshy globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol took her spot at the opposing table, the wooden bench creaking under her immense weight. The lawyers had figured the whole split out, the court date was just a formality that both parties had to show up to. Carol noticed Tiffany in the crowd, she looked to be a bit more well padded than she remembered. Her knockers looked even bigger, and at one point she had to stand up, Carol noticed her inflated booty. She also seemed to be sporting a little pot belly as well. Carol laugh up the idea of Harold\u2019s new fling getting chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the judge arrived their case was over in mere minutes. Afterwards both parties went to leave, Harold slowed down to meet Carol at the gate. Carol was slow moving, especially getting up from the bench. He would have tried to help her up, but he thought that would have been stepping over the line considering the predicament they were in. Eventually Carol made her way up and Harold was able to catch her ear. All he could ask was, \u201cCarol what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, too much of a whale for you Harold?\u201d Carol said snarkily. \u201cAfter I left you I went to go stay with my friend Lorenzo the chef. Every day he made me marvelous meals. And when the cruise was over he asked me to stay on board with him. I\u2019ve been cruising around staying with Lorenzo ever since. He really knows how to treat me well, and I just love his cooking, I can\u2019t get enough of it. It\u2019s obviously had it\u2019s side effecting on me, but Lorenzo is so much more of a man than you are, he can handle my curves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold was speechless by what had happened to his ex-wife, so without anything more to say they both just parted ways.</span></div></div>",

Now it\u2019s was getting easier to see her feminine physique through the thinning dress. As she ate more the tighter it got, until it was straining against her bulging belly, and tightening around her tits because of it. Carol just wanted more, and Lorenzo was happy to supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd his bimbo girlfriend was there. Any you know what? She was actually looking a little chubby!\u201d Carol laughed, spitting up a little broccoli cheddar soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully that Harold learns how to handle his voluptuous women soon then.\u201d Lorenzo handed Carol another tray of sweets to give her a change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the loving couple heard two loud snaps. Carol was face first in a juicy steak with fixins, but certainly felt the relief of pressure despite her mouth and hands being full. The two thick shoulder straps on the dress had both snapped under the pressure of her enormous mammaries. It wasn\u2019t that her tits were growing, it was just that her belly was filling up so much of the dress now that her tits didn\u2019t have anywhere to go except to put pressure on the straps. The top of the dress fell over her spherical fleshy boobs, allowing the girls plenty of room to breath now. Her belly was getting so expanded in her lap that her boobs here being pushed into her face, but at least they were free, and now on display for Lorenzo to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wardrobe malfunction did nothing to stop Carol\u2019s normal binge, she just kept cramming everything in sight into her face. Carol just giggled as her sexy body grew even bigger. She started to get warm between her legs which only fueled her desire to eat more, and at a faster pace.</span></div></div>",

The flavors, the taste, the fullness.  \u201cOh Lorenzo keep it coming.\u201d She called out. Lorenzo brought over a resupply to his bulging lover, unable to remove the smile from his face. Carol\u2019s dress only grew tighter, and soon enough a weak spot started to show right in the middle of the dome of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like someone is about to pop.\u201d Lorenzo commented as he noticed the weakness in the dress. Carol kept cramming delicious decadent food between her lips, and soon enough that wear spot became a rip. The pressure was all too much, the rip started small, but it only took a second for her billowing belly to start seeping out, causing the rip to widen and go straight down her middle. Has Carol\u2019s enormous fat belly came flowing out of her dress, it left the garment split right down the middle, and now pinned underneath her, allowing her full fleshy body to be exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol felt so much freedom, freedom she could have gotten if she just had Lorenzo take off her dress when she had gotten back from her court date, but busting out of the dress was so much sexier, and it fueled the fire between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Carol was full of relief she noticed Lorenzo had stopped in his tracks. \u201cAdmiring your handy work?\u201d Carol purred as Lorenzo's eyes were transfixed on her behemoth body. Carol took a minor break from feeding her face to tease her lover a little bit. She started to rub her dirty hands all over the vast stomach and also played with her boobs a little bit. If Lorenzo didn\u2019t have an erection before, he certainly did now. The vast whale before him was the epitome of sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenzo was speechless, all he could do once he snapped out of it, was continue to deliver his bulging beauty with more food. Carol gladly accepted and ate until she couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Lorenzo knew she was at her limit, Carol had become very adept at making sure she was quite well stuffed, as long as there was food around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol was riding a wave of pleasure during her feast, and the pleasure didn\u2019t stop just because the food did. Carol was squirming in please due to the heat her binge had caused between her legs, therefore mountains of fat was shaking back and forth on the 700 lb goddess. Carol\u2019s massive stomach looked like a waterbed, glistening fat having a current all it\u2019s own. Despite how well streched her stomach was underneath all this fat, she had so many rolls now that her belly remained gelatinous despite her fullness. On top of her belly sat her two round beach ball sized tits. They had fallen out of her face slightly when her dress ripped and her belly had started to hang over her legs and off the couch, rather than getting caught in the dress and pressing ever outward. The two massive mammaries still blocked most of her view though, especially now that she was reclining backwards, allowing them to drop back towards her face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Lorenzo wasn\u2019t on catering duty he was free to indulge his lover. Carol cooed as she knew what sort of pleasure was about to befall her. Carol was so large and stuffed that Lorenzo took her right there on the couch. They both enjoyed themselves, the fatter of the two enjoying herself several more times than the other one, but they were both extremely happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was just a normal day for the new happy couple.</span></div></div>",

Harold had to downsize after the split and divorce, but had bought a new place on the other side of town. Recently he had asked Tiffany to stay with him, she was what you would call unemployed, but she was young and hot, so Harold made sure she didn't have to struggle. He even paid her last months rent before she moved in because she couldn't come up with the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the mail came that day Harold was busy at work, and when there was a letter addressed to Tiffany she was a little shocked but also excited. She rushed inside, her bubble butt swaying side to side quickly underneath her tight skirt. Popping the envelope open she revealed a letter as well as some other goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Tiffany\" the letter started. \"I hope there are no hard feelings.\" Scanning the letter she realized it was from Carol before moving on. \"I wanted to show you that everything is water under the bridge by offering you a free cruise ride. As you know I'm now with Lorenzo, head chef of the cruise liner, and as a little token we wanted you to come and enjoy yourself. Harold and I may have had a falling out, but that has nothing to do with you, so I don't want you to feel put out by me. The cruise leaves in a week so included you will find a plane ticket down here, and a ticket for the cruise. You will have your own room, for a little personal rest and relaxation. Who knows, maybe we can catch up and even be friends. I'm sure I'll see you soon. Signed Carol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany didn't know what to do. She was shocked by this kind gift from someone who was almost a complete stranger. Also by someone who she helped ruin her marriage. Tiffany wanted to accept the free cruise, she did enjoy the one she had taken a few months ago, and it's not like she had any responsibility here, and she would only be away from Harold for a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also worried about what Harold would think about all of this. He had been pretty open with his feelings towards his ex wife since their split and had told Tiffany everything, and it was mostly not positive.</span></div></div>",

She had a pair of average size breasts so she had never been too jealous of thicker girls sporting bigger racks. But all that changed recently. Kelly had a change of heart. Who know's if it was all the societal pressure telling girls to be thin, and Kelly looking to break out of the norm, or maybe Kelly learned that big women can be sexy after learning all about bbw culture from a friend, or it could be as simple as one day Kelly woke up and her brain clicked in a new direction. All she knew from that day forward though was she wanted to pack on some serious pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly started the only way she knew how, McDonald's. She was unwrapping her first Big Mac, as a large fry and drink sat on the table, nothing out of the ordinary, except for the lust that could be spotted in Kelly's eye. She hungrily bit into the burger, knowing it was going to one day lead her to the size of her dreams. Kelly had spent the day looking up pictures of large women and their weights, fantasizing about become them. 200, 250, 300 and more! She had a long way to go, but she knew she could do it. At a measly 100lbs Kelly was far from her goals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several bites Kelly put down her large burger and started to eat her salty fries and sip her surgery soda. The tastes swirled in her mouth, McDonald's was not a frequent stop for the young girl before today, and she was relishing in the new flavors she was tasting, another upside to her weight gain goals. Kelly finished her meal, and went up for a refill on her soda. She ordered an ice cream desert on her way out to complete the meal, sipping her newly topped off soda as she pranced out to her car. 'I can't wait until that becomes a waddle.' She thought to herself with a big smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

She thought she'd just take it slow and see if things could unfold naturally. People would obviously start asking questions after about 20-30 pounds. But after a few weeks or her new high caloric diet Kelly was dying to talk to someone about it. Her gain during that time had been minimal, only a few pounds.She had been enjoying McDonald's as much as possible, and eating more at meals, and never passing up a tasty snack, but her very active metabolism was able to keep up for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly decided to bring her best friend into the loop, so the next day at school she decided to tell her. Kelly had just turned 18 and had just started her senior year of high school. Victoria had not questioned Kelly's new eating habits quite yet, but Kelly knew she was bound to be the first one to realize something was up, so better to get that support from her now rather than try and win it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria wait up.\" Kelly called down the hall where Victoria was just closing her locker. Kelly caught up to the equally thin and attractive teen, and started to survey the area. \"Hey, come here I've got something to tell you.\" She said, pulling Victoria's arm and dragging her around the corner where they would be more secluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey whats the big deal? I don't have too much more time before class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a secret to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria's mood turned right around. \"Ooo a secret?

What kind of secret is this?\" Victoria was puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've decided to make myself fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FAT!?\" Victoria said a little louder than she should of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!\" Kelly trying to silence her friend. \"Yes fat.\" She said almost in a whisper now. \"I'm done with this ugly skinny life. I want to have curves, and be plush, and have a really rockin bod, and they only way to do that is pack on the pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you want that? You have such a great sexy body now.\" Victoria questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's sexy about all these pointy bones? Real women have meat on their bones, something to grab on to. It's a thing ok. Now are you going to support me or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I support you, your my best friend. I think I'm just gonna need some more convincing first. But let hurry, it's time for class.\" Victoria said as the school bell started ringing. The girls scampered off to class, but this wasn't going to be the last time they talked about Kelly's new fantasy. </span></div></div>",

For starters there's Kristen Kluge; I'd say that she plays the heroine of the story, but that's really giving her too much credit. She's a normal everyday working woman who struggles to juggle work, her personal life, and her lackluster dating life. She manages to squeeze in a quick lap or two around the block of her apartment building every week or so, but most of her free time goes to putting in extra hours at the office. She works at a local conglomerate that focuses on the production of makeup, having gotten an internship at 23. Now, pushing thirty, the working world had not returned what she had with so much fervor. After seven years, six of them paid, Kirsten had become an accountant; the joy of the working world. And after that, things had hit a stalemate. She got a Christmas bonus every year, but monetary wise she was still in the same situation as she was almost a decade ago. And in that time, she had done little more than grow her brunette hair out and start wearing glasses. So, as you can imagine, Kirsten's life was just about as mind-numbingly boring as it could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if her life wasn't a monument to unpleasant mediocrity already, the last year had been the absolute completion of said monument with the addition of Marilyn Fuller to the staff. For starters, she was the archetypical antagonist of every normal woman in the room; blonde, tanned, a breathy voice, long legs with a full ample bosom and a full seat in her short skirt. When juxtaposed to Kirsten, it was understandable that there would definitely be some animosity between the two. But above all, she was the biggest flirt anyone had ever seen. Their boss at the time, a Mr. Kevin Reynolds, picked up the phone and informed Marilyn's temp agency that he had decided to hire her full-time after only a two-week period and one long trip to his office. She worked as his personal secretary, right next to his office, and made almost double what Kirsten did (or anyone else in the office made for that matter). She was dumb, everyone agreed that she had to be the stupidest most stereotypical blonde woman of all time. But she was sitting pretty in her secretary's desk, and they were all in their little cubicles. Of course, there were a lot more trips by male population to get the Boss' opinion on a matter when Marilyn was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might have noticed some key phrases like \"were\" and \"at the time\" when referring to Mr. Reynolds. Unfortunately, about three months after Marilyn started full-time, he was busted for a serious sexual-harassment charge. Big shock. Now, he had been replaced by one workaholic of a woman, Ms. Jaclyn Powers. A rather shapely woman with a head of long, raven locks and a trim physique. She had a killer head for business, was ruthless and totally unstoppable when she wanted something. Of course, because it was just Kirsten's luck, a woman that powerful in her opinions and confident in her own strength just had to be a lesbian. Now at least Marilyn was uncomfortable with something in the office. But, then again, even a woman so approachable as Kirsten was put off a little. She wasn't grabby, and she wasn't open about it. But the way she checked out some of the women in the office really set some people off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, um, so that I've set up some characters and we've got a plotline; which one of these women is going to get plumped up by her co-workers? Could it be Marilyn as some sort of twisted revenge on Kirsten's part? Or maybe she leaves some extra donuts by her new boss' door in hopes for some weight gain and maybe a little respect? Or perhaps she herself is getting fattened by someone... maybe someones?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Great. Kirsten wiped the sleep out of her eyes, put her glasses back on, and stared at the scale. Again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous,\" she said aloud, to the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ridiculous,\" she repeated to the 185-pound woman in the mirror. The woman, for her part, took off her glasses, rolled her blue eyes and turned the knob in the shower to HOT. She had heard, once, that it was really good for you to take cold showers every morning, and she had tried it once. The resulting screams had been heard nearly a block away. The 185-pound woman stepped over the shampoo bottles assembled on the rim of the tub and sighed, half in relief (the bathroom was cold) and half in despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she thought, she knew she had put on some weight. She was getting softer in the midsection, and her navel was, increasingly, an \"innie.\" Her thighs had certainly started to wobble just a bit during her weekly (sometimes every-other-weekly) run around the block. But damn it! That run was supposed to be insurance against this sort of thing. Still...the big three-oh would be here in December--that was less than two months. \"The Big Three-Oh.\" Most of her friends who had hit it were, admittedly, fatter than she was. She thought of Rayna, the giggling, gossipy redhead, so tiny in college, who had simply ballooned four years ago after getting married and pushing out three equally chubby tots. Even Winter, her cynical friend from the internship who swore by organic foods had packed on about sixty pounds since settling down with another yoga instructor. They could be thirty, fat, and happy. But there was an important difference between them and her, and she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until I find someone,\" she pleaded with her body as she closed her eyes and gathered her chestnut hair to the top of her head. \"Then you can get as fat as you want. But please not yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped out of the shower, she could almost swear she looked fatter than before. She turned to the side. No double chin yet, but...how could she not have seen it before? \"Ack! Stretch marks??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it. She, Kirsten Kluge, was putting herself on a diet. 185 indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, along with the arrival of faithful Aunt Flo, perhaps explained her irritability, her over sensitivity three days later as she sat at lunch, eating her salad, thinking about one of the guys on JDate.com who had not responded to her last e-mail, when she heard Marilyn laugh behind the break room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's really getting big,\" she heard the blonde call out as she opened the door, talking to someone across the hall. \"All right, Greg, take care!\" Then there was a long, awkward pause. Kirsten didn't turn around, but imagined the svelte office beauty suddenly seeing her in front of her, and getting quiet. For her part, Kirsten could feel the blood rushing to her own cheeks and neck--though whether from awkwardness or embarrassment, she wasn't sure. Marilyn was gossiping about her! With Greg, of all people--a 28-year-old co-accountant who once spent lunches with Kirsten before Marilyn came along. And here she was, eating a salad while Marilyn and everyone in the office called her fat--literally behind her back. Well, it was typical, wasn't it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirsten?\" Marilyn's voice cooed behind her, and Kirsten turned around. Even now, she had trouble not staring when she saw Marilyn. The girl was, plainly, gorgeous. Not only that, but her blonde, curlicue locks and clothing were always perfectly arranged, making her look like a classical beauty crossed with a Valley girl. She always showed plenty of skin, but somehow it never looked...cheap. It was as though Marilyn was doing a favor to people by letting them see more of her. People like that weren't supposed to work...at...at real-people jobs. Marilyn had once told her she'd \"done some modeling\" but it \"wasn't for her.\" Ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirsten?\" Reddening, Kirsten realized she had just been staring at Marilyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Marilyn?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing these days?\" the blonde said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she lied. \"How are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" said the blonde, obviously surprised by the question. As if she ever wasn't \"great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" said Marilyn, \"I've...I don't know how much you heard of that last conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hear anything,\" Kirsten lied again. Her stomach grumbled in protest at her empty salad container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...some people are being kind of mean.\" My God, thought Kirsten, was Marilyn trying to apologize? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde went on awkwardly. \"I would...I'd like to try to help you...you know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With?\" said Kirsten, getting redder every minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With...uh...with your style and stuff. I know it sounds mean, but I'm not trying to be, I swear. I'd love to have you over and do...you know...makeovers together and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slumber party?\" Was this conversation actually happening? Kirsten almost forgot her anger. Maybe...maybe this would, at the least, be an interesting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" laughed Marilyn, looking almost offended that Kirsten would accuse her of anything so childish. \"No, I just...I've noticed that you've gotten a little...heavier...and I wanted to give you some make-up and fashion tips. Bigger people can be beautiful too, but it doesn't work to try to still look skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis. Was. Amazing. The most infuriating thing of all was the Marilyn seemed seriously to believe she was doing nothing wrong. A part of Kirsten wanted to accept the girl's invitation and ask, sincerely, for her help. Another part of her wanted to simply storm out of the room after calling the little bimbo a horrible name. But with this back-handed compliment, something began to snap in Kirsten and a third, more devious, part began to manifest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\" Kirsten said, cheerfully. \"But I have one condition.\"</span></div></div>",

She was tall, and slightly curvy but still rail thin, and attractive in a forbidding way with a vaguely goth look despite her standard leotard. She saw the similarly thin and attractive Millie walk in and began to wonder why someone like her would want to get fat. She approached her and said \u201cHi I\u2019m Jackie, and it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh..\u201d Millie shyly mumbled. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Millie. It\u2019s nice to meet you. I was going to ask if this was your first time Fat Dancing, but um, clearly, um. Sorry, I\u2019m kind of nervous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... me too. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m going to regret this. I don\u2019t really know how it even works. I guess we\u2019ll just have to figure it out together, though,\u201d she tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, class, listen up!\u201d A Latina woman who was massive, weighing over 300 pounds, waddled in. She was dressed in the same outfit as the rest of them, with her leotard clinging to her massive pear shaped figure. \u201cMy name is Daria and I am going to be your teacher at Fat Dancing. You all know the studio rules! No phones, no gum, etc. Now, as this is a beginner\u2019s class, I am here to instruct you on how you\u2019re going to adjust to your fat bodies as well as the movements! I\u2019ll warn you, this is undeniably a sexual dance. It has more in common with pole dance than ballet. You will be twerking, you will be thrusting, and you will be jiggling.\u201d She shook her hips back and forth to emphasize this. \u201cYou will be trained to show off your bodies and be sexy doing so. Anyone who is uncomfortable can leave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d Millie squeaked. \u201cWell, this ought to be interesting,\u201d Jackie commented quietly, staring at Daria\u2019s large stomach for an amount of time that it made her uncomfortable. She thought that maybe he wouldn\u2019t be that bad. It seemed like it would be fun and Millie seemed nice. \u201cExactly how do we get fat for this?\u201d she questioned. \u201cIs there a specific method you use or do we just sort of have to eat a lot?\u201d \u201cGreat question!,\u201d said Daria \u201cIn that case over there are 9 vials of a weight gain shake. You will partner up, and then you will drink one which will cause you to gain twenty pounds. You will drink another one every other week until you are at least 150 pounds heavier than you are today. In the meantime, I expect weight training to maintain that body, both your strength for movement and your body fat. Then, we will perform! Partner up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
