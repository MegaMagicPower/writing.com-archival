            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The high pitched sound of Konoha High's bell was like sweet music for Naruto's ears. Faster than any other of his fellow students, he left his desk and rushed to the exit, eager for lunch break. Wearing his orange and black jacket alongside a baggy pair of black pants, the short haired blond teen easily dodged the growing crowd of students within the corridors, his blue eyes focused on a lone, lovely figure at the other end of the line of lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterflies floated in his stomach when she saw her, so lovely with her short pink hair and emerald-like eyes. He did not notice the growing frown on her lips though, or how her fists began to clench in anger when she turned and saw him coming her way. Only when he was but a stride away and was about to speak did he notice the girl's glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...something wrong Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong? Oh, actually there is Naruto\" Sakura spoke softly, almost hissing each word as they came out of her mouth \"Guess who had to help principal Tsunade AGAIN because SOMEONE broke half the windows of classroom 2C? Someone who will not be sent to detention because there is no proof against him, even if we all know who HE is\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...impressed then?\" hoped Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked twice, as if that would allow her to understand what came out of Naruto's mouth \"Yes Naruto, I'm actually so impressed I've decided to give you a reward for your actions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened \"Wait, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, her smile cold \"Really. Close your eyes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll blood rushed up to the blond's head. Immediately, he closed his eyes and pushed his lips forwards, sweating nervously as he imagined his crush leaning forwards to give him the kiss he had dreamed about for so many years. Instead, and shaking her head in disbelief, Sakura silently walked behind the still-waiting blond. She did not pause. In two, swift moves, one of her hands yanked back at Naruto's pants, while the other leaped inside to grab the student's baby-blue briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill pushing his lips forwards, Naruto's eyes opened wide \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" roared Sakura as she shot the stretchy material up Naruto's back. Despite being taller than the girl by a few inches, the blond teen still felt the waistband of his briefs tickling the back of his neck only a heartbeat after Sakura's first pull. Clinging hard to the cotton, she took a deep breath and pulled again, so hard this time Naruto was nearly shot off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY AAAAAAAAASSS!\" he shrieked, blue eyes crossed in agony as he nearly tasted the cotton and crack in the back of her throat. Under him, his legs began to shake, no longer able to function as more and more cotton was brutally pushed into the dephts of his unready crack \"SAKURA, HAVE MERCY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Naruto, I'm sick of cleaning after all your messes!\" snarled Sakura \"Get ready, because from now on you'll be getting a ton more of these! Now look up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto obeyed, fearing that not doing so would end with another brutal pull. Instead of the ceiling though, his blue eyes were met by the almost-matching cotton of his briefs. <i>Did she really get them up there already?</i> was the last thought which echoed in his mind before Sakura released her grip and the material slapped Naruto's nose, thus securing the squealing teen's atomic wedgie. Screaming and spinning her arms around, he bumped with nearly lockers and walls too, his face red as he began to hear the laughter of nearby students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long week.</span></div></div>",

Feeling how his pants were starting to sagg down, he hurriedly tugged at them with one hand, all the while his other arm flailed randomly around, trying to find obstacles at least a moment before he slammed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of flushing water made him pause for a moment. The bathroom, that was it! Safe within one of the toilet cabins, he would be able to undo his atomic wedgie without being interrupted or laughed at. Forcing a hopeful smile, he turned and flailed around until his fingers felt the cold metal of a door knob. Immediately, he turned it and rushed in, unaware of the very specific sign on top of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing in here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze. That voice was feminine and, if he was not mistaken, quite angry. Cautiously, Naruto managed to drag the fabric an inch and a half up...then wished he had not as he met with the enraged glare of Temari, exchange student and one of Konoha High's feared bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you are thirsty\" she growled, cracking her knuckles while Naruto stumbled back \"Good thing I know just the toilet for you!\"</span></div></div>",

His paced was slowed by his running knock-kneed, a side effect of the atomic wedgie still being in-place. As uncomfortable as it was, he knew he could not waste any second trying to readjust his underpants because any lapse in movement would result in Temari pouncing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to curse his rotten luck, not only in managing to piss off Sakura in the way that he did, but the fact that he had to run into Temari of all people in this predicament. The previous semester, when Temari had first transferred into Konoha High, Naruto thought it would be hilarious to haze the new girl. He didn't even do anything too intense, just flipped her skirt up in the middle of the lunch room. Room had erupted with laughs at the time, none louder than Naruto's himself, but had quickly came to an uncomfortable silence to Temari's fuming red face. Temari's retribution was swift, and what followed was an experience that Naruto wished to never relive; he was given a bouncing wedging as Temari shoved her mashed potatoes and hot sauce down the back of his drawers. The pain was so intense that he had actually started crying in the middle of the lunch room, and Temari did not let up until she ripped his undies clear out of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the real unfortunate thing is even after getting her payback, Temari never let up. Naruto became her favorite punching bag from that point forward. Fast forward to today and the mere site of her in the bathroom, threatening to give him a swirly instantly struck the fear of Kami into him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto reached for the doorknob he could feel a threatening shadow behind him. </span></div></div>",

Tsunade was many things, but patient was just not one of them. Several times she had warned Naruto of what would happen if a teacher ever sent him to her office, or he tried to pull a prank while she was watching. The rebellious part of Naruto's mind, as creative as self-destructive, paid little mind to such warnings. Right as Tsunade bent over to drink some water, Naruto saw his chance and took it. By the time he could begin to think about what he had done, he was to busy laughing to care as Tsunade stood there, frozen with her tight pants below her ankles and her huge, bubble butt in full display alongside a pair of granny panties with heart prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since detention doesn\u00b4t seem to work with you Naruto, I've decided to try something less \"traditional\" for you\" spoke Tsunade, her smile sending shivers up Naruto's spine \"And before you ask: Yes, I have full permission from your mother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped \"Oh no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the woman. She was not too happy to learn about your behaviour and will surely have some words with you after class\" spoke Tsunade while rising from her desk \"Also, she asked me to tell you all the briefs and tighty whities you lose you will pay for with your own money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" gasped Naruto \"That's not...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair?\" Tsunade slowly shook her head \"Should have thought about it before pantsing me in front of my whole school Uzumaki\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStronger than she looked, Tsunade easily spun Naruto around, using just a single finger to force him to bend over and present his big butt and sagging, black pants to her. Naruto tried to gulp when Tsunade's fingers closed around the exposed waistband of his brief, but he found he had no saliva to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First...PULL!\" grunted Tsunade, swiftly lifting the teen by his baby-blue briefs. Eyes crossed in a mixture of shock and pain, Naruto could not scream at first, his lower jaw dangling loose as he felt his own undies splitting his butt in half. When his feet returned to the floor, he almost tripped forwards but was easily pulled back by a quick tug from Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Owwwww...\" he whined, fighting back the first tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"49 to go\" informed Tsunade as her fingers wrapped themselves with the blue cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?!\" cried Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, should have thought first before pranking me. Second...PULL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHIEEEE!\" shrieked the blond, his eyes this time shooting up alongside the stretching cotton which made his growing briefs. Rather than a wedgie, he felt as if Tsunade was pushing needle after needle between his jiggling buttocks, both pale and currently naked as his pants fell to the floor. Face red, Naruto struggled to get them back, only to freeze as Tsunade lifted him a foot higher over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, amusing as this is, just lifting you up and down won\u00b4t be enough to push my point across. That's why, right after your bouncing wedgie, you will...\"</span></div></div>",

Wearing his usual blue shirt and white shorts, he paid little mind to the adoring glances he got from some of the female students who just happened to walk by, or the angry glares of the male ones. With his back to one of the trees surrounding Konoha High and no class in nearly half of an hour, he allowed himself a moment to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" he hissed under his breath as he heard the buzzing of his phone. To busy opening it to look at the message, he did not notice the grinning blond right above him, hidden amongst the many branches and leaves of the tree. Cautiously, without making a single sound, he began to lower a rope, its end decorated by a hook whose dull tip easily found its mark inside Sasuke's shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sasuke scoffed as he read the name of the one who had sent him the message. For a moment, he played with the idea of ignoring it. Curiosity won in the end though as he opened it up and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Up, up and away!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Naruto-</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!\" holding to the other end of the rope, Naruto leaped down from the tree's top. What should have been a swift and quite nasty fall was immediately brought to a halt as Sasuke's red boxers suddenly shot out of his shorts, the leg holes following not an instant later as the dark haired teen suddenly found himself bent over and flying up to the sky, ascending every feet Naruto descended towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSS!!!\" cried Sasuke, eyes rolling up at the feeling of sharp cotton splitting his ass in half. Every inch he flew was like another sword blow, another axe shoved deep and hard into his crack. Face glowing red, he spun his arms around and kicked as he finally stopped climbing his way to the clouds, the sheer momentum of the stop making his spin in wild circles while Naruto secured his end of the rope around the tree trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you didn\u00b4t want to hang out\" laughed Naruto, beaming with pride at his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you get me down right now or I'll make you pay!\" shrieked Sasuke, his blush worsening as he realized the high pitch of his voice \"I'm serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, but I can\u00b4t miss my next class. But hey, I'm sure one of your fangirls will be more than delighted to lend you a hand\" Naruto winked before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, come back here! NARUTOOOO!\" screamed Sasuke, his kicks and constant squirming only making him spin faster under the branches.</span></div></div>",

Despite its reputation as a near-lawless place, Konoha High did have quiet moments of peace, where nothing interesting happened (well, interesting for Kiba that is). Wearing his black jacket and matching sweatpants, the brown-haired teen had already paced up and down the place, trying to come up with a way to fight back his boredom. For now, he got nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, he had pranked the hell out of most of her usual victims. Shikamaru, one of the biggest nerds in Konoha High, had already lost two pairs of tighty whities that week. And it was only Thursday! Naruto too had been seen stumbling around with his briefs stretched all the way over his head, followed right behind by a blushing and quite enraged Sakura who struggled to get her own pink, granny panties off her face. That morning, she had managed to \"surprise\" Tenten as she ran to class. Red from face to toes, she sneaked into the classroom almost half an hour late, the remains of her boyshorts still sticking out of her sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's left then?\" unlike Naruto, Kiba was not foolish enough to try and prank a teacher, let alone the principal herself. Again, he groaned and massaged his forehead \"Come on! I'm sure there's at least one person who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not Sasuke? It will be the greatest party ever!\" shouted a voice from behind the corridor's corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he looked there, Kiba was greeted with the sight of a sulking Sasuke, hands deep into the pockets of his white shorts as he tried to put as much distance as he coult between himself and an increasingly-annoyed Ino Yamanaka. Looking at him, a light bulb came to life over Kiba's head. Of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I'm not interested\" insisted Sasuke in her usual serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not?\" demanded Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sasuke turned around \"I have better things to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" asked Ino, who only now noticed how Kiba was walking towards the other teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting an atomic wedgie\" said Kiba simply, his hands already shooting into Sasuke's shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, getting an atomic...wedg...\" Sasuke managed to blink once before a wide stream of red cotton exploded out of his shorts \"AHIEEEEEEEEEE!!\" he shrieked, his usually deep tone now a girly scream as his boxers were mercilessly rammed up his ass. Wrapping both fists with the stretching cotton, Kiba took a deep breath and pulled yet again, bringing the now cross-eyed teen to the tips of his toes \"W-What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said it, not me!\" laughed Kiba, easily bringing the material closer and closer to the top of Sasuke's head. Ignoring his squeals and protests, Kiba turned to look at Ino and winked \"Don\u00b4t worry, I'll return him to you soon enough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can wait\" said Ino before clearing her throat \"This Sasuke, is what happens when you dont listen to me. Enjoy that wedgie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, Ino!\" squealed Sasuke, a new pull nearly lifting him off the ground for a moment \"AHIEEEE!\"</span></div></div>",

There was always a classroom he could jump into, a teacher he might meet who would save him from losing another pair of tighty whities. Panting hard, he ran drenched in sweat, his dark ponytail bouncing almost as much as his big, fat buttocks. Already, Konoha's top nerd could feel his pants slowly sagging down, exposing the first inches of white cotton his pursuer was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not fair. Shikamaru gritted his teeth, heart pumping wildly inside his chest as he felt a finger, then five more brush the waistband of his tighty whities. A whimper fled his throat when five more fingers followed, wrapping themselves tightly around the soft cotton. Knowing what would happen next, he clenched his buttocks, hoping that at least that might lessen the sting about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!\" he shrieked, eyes crossed as Kiba launched him off his feet by his tighty whities. The fabric stretched easily, rising several feet into the air before the leg holes bothered to follow right behind. By then, the nerd's pants had chosen a different path and just dropped on the floor, leaving Shikamaru to kick and cry with his huge bottom mooning his bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'm running low on cash today. Do you have some?\" asked Kiba, keeping the screaming nerd exactly one inch and a half away from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Go to hell!\" cried Shikamaru, only for his screams to turn girly as Kiba began to bounce him up and down \"My pants! I've coins in my pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes I promise! Just please let me go!\" begged Shikamaru.</span></div></div>",

He did so when his mother woke him up early so he could get ready for school. He muttered it under his breath when the teachers sent them homework, even if Shikamaru already knew all he needed to pass the whole year. When his friends wanted to drag him out of his home to hang out, \"troublesome\" was again the word he chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though, he felt like he had a great excuse for that. Ever since Math, Shikamaru had spotted how Kiba had been looking at him while doing pulling motions with his clenched fists. Naruto, maybe wanting to join in the fun, or maybe not wishing to become another victim, had done so too, sending even more shivers up Shikamaru's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the first \"to go to the bathroom\" had given him a few extra minutes, yet the nerd knew that was borrowed time at best. So, faster than he thought possible, he ran through the hallway into the school's garden, only to meet a familiar face watering the plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shika? Why are you running?\" asked Ino Yamanaka, gorgeous as always in her tight, purple top and mini-skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, Naruto...\" he panted, hiding behind a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wedgies again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded, blushing slightly as he turned around to peek over the tree \"It is way too troublesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmh\" muttered Ino, suddenly aware of how a few inches of white were already peeking out of her old friend's pants. A sly grin crossed the blonde's pouty lips \"Hey Shika, remember that game we used to paly when we were kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's not the time\" hissed Shikamaru, unaware of how the blonde's fingers were closing into his undies. That is, until ten, soft and slender fingers wrapped themselves around his tighty whities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you don\u00b4t remember because you always played the loser\" purred Ino while Shikamaru looked back in shock and horror \"IT has been far too long since I've given you a nice, tight, WEDGIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!\" cried Shikamaru, his eyes shooting up the same instant the fabric shot out of his pants and over his full back \"L-Let my undies go you troublesome woman!\" he squeaked, stumbling around while the fabric rose higher over his neck, leaving little to cover his big, jiggling moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is right Shika: A lazy butt is a big butt!\" laughed Ino, keeping the fabric high with one hand while the other delivered sharp slaps to Shikamaru's twin buttocks \"Now, what to do with you and your loser undies?\"</span></div></div>",
