Hong Meiling, the guardian to the gates of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, could once again be found sleeping in that standing position. Why again? At this point, Sakuya was pretty much fed up with it and decided discipline was needed. Naturally, she goes with tossing a multitude of knives at her..... only for them to be dodged yet again. Meiling was just that good, so it was nearly impossible for Sakuya to get the drop on her. ugh.... Yet another failure to remind the green wearing dragon to do her job properly. And so, Sakuya leaves the area and heads back inside to return to her maid duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sakuya was gone, Meiling was now there to do as she pleased. There was hardly anyone around, so Meiling opens her eyes, stretches, and then..... boing. Her large breasts bounce a bit after the daily stretch like they typically would. Being a natural E cup at the very least, yet their weight didn't seem to hinder her at all as she goes into a stance, practicing her movement and defense. \"Hyah!\" She lets out a series of karate yells as she does so, a thirty minute training session as she had dictated for herself. Once said session was over, she does her typical breathe-in, breathe-out motion to signal her training was over for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a very ordinary day, as was typical for this part of Gensokyou and the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Meiling was very ladi back most of the time, so it seemed natural that someone would be willing and able to speak to her.... which never happened except for Sakuya who was always scolding her for sleeping on the job. Today felt a bit different though. Meiling could sense something.... off. Attuned to her surroundings, she hears a noise. That noise is....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trouble began, not for the first time, with an apple.<br>\r\nThey lay big, round and red on doctor Yagokoro's desk and, if they would have known the future they would have ticked like bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harvest season was coming to an end and Kaguya had been extatic to see the appletrees she planted from seeds roughly ten years ago where ready to bear their first fruits. Sadly, before the harvest could comence, a firery duel with her archnemesis had reduced the lovingly cared for plants to ash and Kaguya never had a chance to taste the fruit of her labors. Kaguya was inconsolable. Eirin proposed to visit the Aki sisters on Yokai Mountain to aks, if necessary force, Minoriko to part with some freshly grown Apples, or even easier, just send Udongein to buy some at the Human Villiage. But the princess sneered on those ideas. They needed to have grown here in Eientei soil. Apples that where as beautiful as her, touched by the eternity and purity of the moon, but still have their earthly roots. Not willing to put up with Kaguya's moping and whining Eirin proposed to help nature to speed up the process a little and grow some apple trees in record time. By some kind of magic Kaguya brightend up at the idea of having super trees in the garden and was happy to have Eirin have a go at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the better of the week to modify a regular seed into a super seed that would grow in an adult tree in days instead of years and another two sleepless nights to mix a serum that would trigger fertility in the soil necessary to grow such splendid plants without making them die by their own rapid growth. Poor Udongein was running ragged with all the errants for exotic materials and magic formulars. But on the second last day of Autum Erin had grown truly amazing trees. Eirin couldn't help but feel pride in her work, as she watched the apples gleam in the sunlight of the late autumn sun. But bevor Eirin let Kaguya harvest and eat those fruits, she wanted to conduct a few test on them, to make sure they where actualy safe to consume. Playing god with nature hat the unfortunate habit of sometimes exploding into your face with unexpected and unwated side effects. Like exploding for example. While Kaguya was indeed as imortal as any being could wish (or not wish) to be, Eirin had a trusty student/Guinea pig who could test them out. Of course Kaguya complained that she didn't get the first taste of her labor, but Eirin just retorted that it was her labor that grew those trees and she decided that Udongein had the honor to play taste tester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, master?\" asked a nervous Reisen. She didn't want to play Guinea pig for her masters newest shady sheme but what could a pet do?<br>\r\n\"Have an apple, Udongein, and relax. I just have a few questions fo you,\" Eirin said and handed the rabbit youkai one of the apples. Reisen looked at her as if she had offered her a fistfull of spiders, sighed then and took the apple.<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Take a bite,\" Erin orderd. Reisen eyed the apple in her hand wearily. It looked harmless and innocent. Just a fruit. It had no sickly green or purple colour, nor did it glow in a concerning way. She closed her eyes and braved her first bite. Her mouth exploded with heavenly flavor. Juice ran down her chin and she greedly took another bite.<br>\r\n\"My, my. That good?\" asked Eirin and laughed. With a swift motion she stole back the apple from her student.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" shouted Reisen angrily, \"i was eating that.\"<br>\r\n\"And i decided that you will stop now. You can have the rest later. So, how are you feeling?\", asked Eirin and took a clipboard and a pen from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any different, than bevore the apple,\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Really?\", asked Eirin and made a note. \"And how did it taste?\"<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" gushed the rabbit youkai and bringing her hands to her chest. \"That apple was the best thing i ever tasted. Do you remember the cake Tewi had made for the princesses birhtday? That! But times ten!\" She started to feel warm. It spread from her stomach to her chest.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Udongein? You're looking kinda red? Are you feeling something now?\" asked Eirin curiously.<br>\r\n\"I feel warm in my stomach and my chest,\" Reisen said and started figeting. After a short while she added quietly \"And in my... neithers...\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Erin eyed her student.<br>\r\n\"My chest feels... tight. It feels like with every heartbeat something flows into it,\" Reisen explained. She moaned. \"It feels really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen started kneading her breasts earnestly her nipples getting erect and rubbing the inside of her bra. It was almost as pleasuring as rubbing her already moisteingn pussy. Heat seemed to spread in her entire body but centralizing in her for attention aching breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Udongein?\" asked Eirein concerned. The show her student was putting on was making her feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\nReisen only moaned in answer as she fondeled herself furiously. Her chest felt tight, like something was growing in it, stretching it...<br>\r\n\"Udongein!\" Eirin called out alarmed. Reisen Chest was bulging bigger under her clothes, strainign the shirt and making her bra dig into the soft titflesh.<br>\r\nWith an ecstatic scream Reisen ripped of the restraining clothes and let her growing boobs free. Her milky white breasts bounced and jiggled freely. Reisen's nipples where engorged and blistering red, screaming for attention and Reisen obliged them happily, twisting and stroking them. She mewled and moaned as her breasts became fatter and fatter only allowing her to stand because of her youkai strengh. Wettness traveld down her legs as her soaked panties couldn't dam the flood that had become of her pussy. Her Nipples had reached an obsene size and where now bigger than her thumb sending explosions of pleasure down her spine as she stroked and pumped her growing tits. White liquid began to leak out of her overszied teats lubricating her breastflesh and giving her ministrations a wet slapping sound. Finally Reisen found release and with one final scream of extasy she climaxed. Milk exploded out of her chest and made her eyes roll back. She collapsed on her her knees. Her Breast, which seemed to finally stop growing filled her lap completly, still leaking milk onto the wooden floor. Reisen panted heavily still shaking from her bombastic orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin, who had watched everything wide eyed stared at Udogein slack jawed. What the fuck had she created? Where the effects permanent? Udongein had taken only two bites of the Apple. What would happen if someone consumed a whole fruit? She stared at the apple in her hand. It smelled sweet and inviting, daring her to take a bite.<br>\r\nEirin congratulated herself for her quick thinking of not letting the princess have one. Who knows what would have happend? She had to be quick before some fool could think about eating an apple without wating for her okay. She made to leave her study and rushing to the garden.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eirin hurried out of her study into the backyard garden of her princess. There she found that her worries where unfounded, as princess Kaguya languished in one of the loungers while the earth rabbits played between the trees. Eirin let out a breath she didn't realize she was holding. Kaguya saw her aproach and waved at her with an excited smile. She gracefully rose from her chair and strolled over to the porch where Eirin was standing.<br>\r\n\"So, good doctor, are they safe? No nasty side effects?\"<br>\r\nEirin fixed her with a sirous expression.<br>\r\n\"No one has eaten any of the fruits? No one stole one and made away with it?\"<br>\r\nKaguya's happy expression turned serious and she looked over to the playing rabbits.<br>\r\n\"No. I forbid them from having any and i kept an eye on them,\" she answerd. Kaguya closed her eyes and sighed like a tragic heroine. \"So the apples are poisenous? Thats a pity. How is Reisen feeling?\"She sauntered over to the appletrees and plucked one.<br>\r\n\"Well i guess i can give one to Mokou at least. That promises to be fun at least. How many Apples do i need to forcefeed her to die from it?\" she asked Eirin.<br>\r\n\"They are not deadly as far as i know, but if you don't want your nemesis to have a bigger bust than you, i would recommend not giving her on of those,\" Eirin said eying the apple in the princesses hand.<br>\r\nKaguya narowed her eyes. \"Explain,\" she demanded.<br>\r\n\"I let Udongein only take two bites but her Breasts basicly exploded in size. They are now maybe three times their original size,\" Eirin explained in a hushed voice, \"She was overwhelmed by brain frying plasure. She also started to lactade pretty heavily.\"<br>\r\nKaguya stared at her friend. \"Really?\" The princess was at a loss for words. She stared at the Apple in her Hand.<br>\r\n\"I suggest we get rid of the trees immediately before they find theire way into the hands of some unwitting fool that thinks that this side effects are very much worth it,\" Eirin said and shot a look at the watching rabbits. They had stopped their playing and waited for the two lunarians to announce the beginn of the harvest.<br>\r\nKaguya sighed heavily again. \"It's such a shame. All this work we put into this,\" she said and gesticulated with the apple in her hand, \"and now we can't even enjoy them. But i see your point, those children really should not get into such a situation. That being said, can't we still safe some for... personal usage?\"<br>\r\nEirin looked uncomfortable for a second, like always when the princess alluded to her more... sexual interests. Kaguya huffed. Really, for beeing the greatest mind in all existance and her age Eirin was such a prude. It was a lunarian thing. Purity and the lot.<br>\r\n\"I will have to complete an antidote first. If not just so that Udongein can return to a more normal form. I will grow you a small potted tree that you can hide in your room if you really are set to this, but leaving them here in the open just calles for trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Eirin,\" Kaguya exclaimed happily and threw herself at her freind in a suprise hug, \"You are the best. I will await the completion of the antidote with baited breath!\"<br>\r\n\"I really have to return to Udongein and come up with a way to quarantine her until i managed to fix her,\" Erin said, \"can i leave the destruction of the trees to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure. It will brake my heart, but then again, i will get better,\" Kaguya agreed, \"now what to tell the rabbits...\"<br>\r\nEirin shrugged and let her eyes roam over the fluffle of rabbits. They seemed to become impatient. \"Just tell them they are deadly or...\" she broke off. She turned back to Kaguya with a concerned expression.<br>\r\n\"Where is Tewi?\" she asked alarmed. Kaguya's eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know... I think she was with the other rabbits? Do you think she has...?\"<br>\r\n\"She certainly would if she thought it was funny. If only to get a rise out of me. If you can try to find her and please discourage her of playing with this devil fruits, I really need to hurry back to Udongein,\" Eirin instructed and hurried back into the building, leaving Kaguya with the other rabbits.<br>\r\nKaguya nodded to herself and began to adress the earth rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hundred meters away from Eientei Tewi Inaba giggled to herself. Other her shoulders she carried a jute sack filled with the new addition to her home's plantlife. Apples like these would sell for a decent ammount of money. If not she could pawn them off to some random youkai or fairy. But luck was always on her side, so she grinned to herself and made her way out of the bamboo forest onto the road to the human village. The journey took the entire morning but was uneventful. She passed the gate easily. while it was the human villiage no one payed the little rabbit any mind. Everyone knew about the doctor from the bamboo forest of the lost and the hundreds of rabbtis that lived there. She made her way to the market and picked a corner a little away from the other fruit and vegtable stands. There she started to hawk her goods.<br>\r\nSadly their was no real interest in her little stand. Some child bought one for their teacher. The Girl with the bookstore, Kosuzu or something bought a four and then left. The afternoon draged on and Tewi made a few more sales. She groaned to herself. This sheme was a bust. She already wanted to pack up but was stoped by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can i heave one of your apples?\" A blue haired girl with an eggplant umbrella asked. Tewi recognized the girl as the luckless karakasa that tried to scare people. Kogasa Tatara was kinda infamous in the prankster comunity for being completely hopless when it came to pranks. She was also as poor as the goddes of poverty.<br>\r\n\"Can you even pay for one?\" Tewi asked suspicous. Kogasa only stared at her pleadingly.<br>\r\n\"I'm really hungry! Just one, please! You have a whole sack of them, surely you don't need them all,\" Kogasa begged. This girl is hopless, Tewit thought and sighed. She wanted to go home anyways.<br>\r\n\"Okay. You can have one,\" she conceded and tossed the karakasa one of the apples.<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Kogasa said earnestly and took a bite of the fruit. She gasped suprised.<br>\r\n\"Thi-this taste!\" she cried out and started to decimate the apple to the core in seconds. Tewi blinked suprised. Where they really that good? Kogasa mewled and licked the juice of her lips and cheeks. Then she started to suck on the core, trying to get more juice out of it. She started to breath heavily and let go of her umbrella to let her hands wander to her chest.<br>\r\n\"Um...\" said Tewi and stared at the redfaced and obviously very aroused. The other girl let go of the apple core and started to hoarsely moan. Other passerbys started to give them wierd glances and tewi grabbed Kogasa's hand and pulled her away into an unoccupied alleyway. She also quickly grabbed the sack with apples. out of the puplic eye Tewi allowed herself to breath freely again, only to startle as Kogasa let out another lustfull moan. Tewi turned back to the karakasa and almost fell flat on her ass. Kogasa was never a flat chest, but a B cup at best. Now her blue vest strained to contain massive tits showing way too much cleavage.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck,\" Tewi whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKogasa on the other hand needily kneaded her engorged chest. After consuming that apple, heat spread in her entire body making her more horny then she ever had been bevore. Her vest fought a loosing battle against the mass of titflesh and started to rip and tear. Two wet spots on the front started to show themself as her massive mammaries started to eject milk. One of her hands let go of her breasts and started to hastely burie inside her sopping wet pussie. She let out a relieved groan as her vest finally adimtted defeat and er breasts exploded out of the ruined piece of clothing. Milk errupted out of her cowsized nipples drenching the ground of the alley and creating puddles of white liquid. Tewi, who stood to close to the moaning mess that had become of Kogasa was drenched as well. Herr pink dress stained by sweet smelling milk. She wiped  her face but still some drops managed to enter her mouth. The taste almost brought her to her knees then and there. This sweet and rich flavor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKogasa's already massive tits where not done yet. They balloned out while constantly ejecting a river of milk. The whole thing hat only taken a good minute but already her Breast touched the ground Kogasa could rest her whole body on them. The pressure of her wight made Milk explode from her gargantuan teats flooding the now way to small alley. Tewi, who was as consumed by lust as Kogasa, and had started to masturbate furiously, was once drechend in Milk. The flood swept her of her feet and broke her out of her lust enduced frenzy. She had to go out of here. She had sold thos titmonster apples to unsuspecting people and she wanted to be as far away from the village when her customers took a bite of her goods. She grabbed the wet sack of apples and spared one last glance at Kogasa.<br>\r\nThe karakasa was lifted by her own breasts uneable to reach her milk spewing nipples or her aching pussy. Her ass had gown larger as well and she was humping her win clevage, completely lost to her lust. Tewi raced out of the alley, her foots making wet splashing sounds. Better run bevore she lost herself to her lust again. One she ditched the sack somewhere there was plenty of time to take care of her aching snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi ran out of the village and never looked back, but her mind returned to the helplessly growing Kogasa. What would become of her? When would she stop growing? As she reached the edge of the bamboo forest she realized that her sack was way to light. She oppened the sack. Someone must have taken some of the fruits while she was distracted... but Tewi didn't care. She lobbed the sack into a ditch and looked to find a secluded area where she could take care of her needs. All she needed to do was find an excuse, why her Dress was drenched in sweet smelling milk if Eirin or Kaguya caught her. Well, if they cout her at all, that was. Tewi laughed and ran into the forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daiyousei was resting in the shade of a great tree near the shore of Misty Lake. the late Autumn sun gave her all one last time bevor Winter could truly begin, and she enjoyed the glistering of said sun on the lakesurface. In a few moment Cirno would arrive and they would spent the day playing. Daiyousei sighed contently and making her joints pop. She stood up and flew up in the air to watch out for her freinds outline on the horizon. She didn't have to wait long. A small figure zoomed in her direction, waving with something that looked like a big sack.<br>\r\n\"Dai-chan! Dai-Chan! Look what I found!\" Cirno shouted and showed Daiyousei a big jute sack. It was full of grass stains and ominous wet spets, but the aroma it gave off was so sweet and inviting that Daiyousei found herself drifting closer to Cirno.<br>\r\n\"It smells good. What is in it?\" she asked. Cirno grinned proudly waggled her finger.<br>\r\n\"I'll show you in a second but let's go to our hideout first\" the Ice fairy ordered. Daiyousei nodded and they flew of into the forest of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hideout was a sizeable clearing hidden by acient trees. Ivy and other creepers growing between the tree trunks build an natural wall that looked like a overgrown rock formation from the outside with only a small opening, just big enough for a fairy or other child sized youkai to crawl through. It became the base of operation for the two fairys and their friends. It offered privacy for their prankplanning sessions, as the leave roof of the surrounding trees shielded them from other flying passerbys and even the Rain had a hard time to properly reach the ground there. Only small rays of sunshine made it through the leaves painting the clearing in an otherworldly light. The mossy ground was soft and warm so the two fairy plopped down and Cirno finally revealed her findings. She opened the sack and showed Daiyousei its content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlump, red and shiny apples that smelled and looked absolutely delicous. Daiyousei's mouth watered just at the sight of the fruits.<br>\r\n\"They look amazing! Where did you find them?\" she asked her best freind. Cirno puffed her chest and put on an superior expression.<br>\r\n\"I was wandering that bamboo forest for a while and i found them in some ditch.I think someone had forgotten them there. Today is sure my lucky day to have such great treats fall into my lap.\"<br>\r\n\"Can i also have one?\" asked Daiyousei pleadingly. Cirno grinned magnanimous and gestured at her friend to help herself.<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" the green haired fairy choose a big apple and immediately took a large bite out of it. The apple tasted even better than it had looked. Cirno grinned at her.<br>\r\n\"Looks like they taste great. We should share some with the rest of the team. Do you think Mystia could make some meal out of them?\" She asked Daiyousei and picked up an apple to try it. But Daiyousei didn't answer her and only started to make wierd noises.<br>\r\n\"Hey Dai-chan! I asked you something,\"she poutet and fixed her friend a childish glare. But Daiyousei didn't pay her any mind. Strange feelings welled up in her body. A needy heat spread in her and made her flesh itch with something she never had felt bevor. Her stomach felt warm.<br>\r\n\"Da-chan?\", asked Cirno and eyed her friend. Daiyousei let the apple core go and put her hands on her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Did you get a tummy ache? Did you not like the apple?\" Cirno asked, worried that the food she found was bad. Who could have thought that the apples she found in ditch where bad? That didn't make sense. If they where bad they would have not been in the sack.<br>\r\n\"I love these apples. I wan't to eat even more of them,\" said Daiyousei with a strange voice. Her face was flushed with heat and she had a strange expression. Cirno let out a breath of releave as she handed the other fairy the apple she had in her hand, glad that her find was as great as she thought it would be. She watched Daiyousei tear into the fruit with gusto. Applejuice ran down her chin and she let out a moan. She threw the cleaned core carelessly behind her and wiped off her hands on her dress. As her hands brushed over her chest she jolted as she was hit by an unexpected bolt of plasure. She couldn't hold back anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirno startlet as Daiyousei threw her head back and moaned loudly. Cirno watched as Daiyousei started to grow bigger. Her dress started to strain against her growing form, growing tight and short, exposing her thickening thighs and her expanding ass. Her Breasts exploded in size, pulsing bigger and bigger. Growing nipples showed themself as bulging wet spots on her front. Daiyousei let her hands wander all other her growing body, lustfully groping her expanding tits and rubbing her moist folds, all while moaning and cooing other her ascending self. Milk started to lactate through her clothers making the fabric even weaker and worsening the appearing tears. Finally the exploded of Daiyousei's body in wet rags, that fell on the ground, exposing her in all of her naked glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirnos eyes had grown to the size of saucers.<br>\r\n\"D-Dai-Chan?\" she stuttered. Daiyousei turned her attention back to her friend. The green haired fairy, now towering over the other, bend forward, making her huge boobs jiggle and her nipple almost reach the ground, giving Cirno a deep view down her cleavage.<br>\r\n\"~Yes, Cirno-chan?\" she cooed, unable to stop touching her self. \"How do i look?\" she asked.<br>\r\nCirno let her eyes wander other the steaming hot body in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Big,\" she answered truthfully, \"and soft.\" Daiyousei giggled. Her growth had slowed down now, but the heat in her body had not subsided in the slightest. There was a need in her flesh. A need she never experienced before. She wanted, she wanted...?<br>\r\n\"Can i have more apples?\" she asked, \"All this growing is making me hungry.\"<br>\r\nCirno was still overwhelmed by her friends change, so she just wordlessly handed over another fruit, that Daiyousei devoured greedily. It didn't take long fore the effect to show itself. Whatever it was that had changed Daiyouseis childish body into this smoking hot figure, three of it was to much for a fairy body to handle. A gurgling sound came from Daiyousei and she fell to her knees. her puffy vagina quivered, and her clit grew out like a sore thump. Her juices started to flow freely, soaking the mossy ground beneath her huge ass, but the only thing she could do was hugging her enormous breasts to herself, as they began to swell dramaticly. Quickly it was impossible to hold them with booth her arms and they sprang free, spewing rich and thick milk out of her engorged teats. Daiyousei screamend in plasure, neverknown feelings wreaking havoc with her, and unable to reach her needy nipples she burried her hands into her aching pussy and rubbed it as if her life dependet on it. But it was not enough, not nearly enough.<br>\r\n\"Touch me, Cirno-chan!\" she screamed, \"I want you to touch me!\"<br>\r\nCirno, who had grown afraid for her screaming friend, was glad to have somthing to do to aid the tormented Daiyousei. Also the smell of the milk and the sight of the rapidly growing breast in front of her made her head feel funny. She stepped closer to Daiyousei, who's breast where now at the size of Cirno's body while still growing and pressed both of her hands deep into the mass of titflesh in front of her. Daiyousei howeld at the touch, milk errupting from her gigantic nipples like from a fire hose, drenching the ground and the fairy in front of her. Cirno startled at the unexpected scream and slipped on the growing puddly of milk on the ground. She fell and was promptly coated with Daiyousei's rich and sweet fairy milk. Suprised she opened her mouth and swallowed a lot of the fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCirno had had milk before, but none of it could compare to the sweet nectar that was this ambrosia. She wanted more, and she wanted it now. Good that she knew exactly where she could get it. She got up and rushed over to her groundbound friend taking one of the giant nipples in both hand she led it to her mouth and started to suck. The teat was almost to big for her and a lot of milk spilled on her already soaking wet dress, but Cirno couldn't care less. The heavenly taste filled her and made her Warm on the insite. Daiyousei screamed in plasure, as the feeling of Cirno's sucking made her climax again and again. Her tits where already to big to see beyond them. Her ass had ballooned to a large size, each cheek easily thrice as big as her head. Her vulva pressing against the inside of her tights, growing fatter and fatter and she humped her underboob cleavage with her massive clitoris, which now looked like a big penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaiyousei's nipples had grown bigger again, but all the contaminated milk had started to affect Cirno as well. She had grown in size, no longer a child's body but one of a teenager. Her ass had gained a lot of flesh jiggling captivating as she moved and her breastd had started to grow out. Her dress was no match for all this expanding flesh and suffered the same fate as did Daiyousei's. She sucked and drank more and more of the sweet fairy milk, now not only because of the taste, but because of the sound her green haired friend made. It gave her shivers and made her feel good. Out of her sopping wet pussy her clit had grown into a dicklike monster, which she teased and rubbed with one hand while the other was groping at Daiyousei's monster tits. Cirno's own boobs had started to lactade as well and soon it was spurting out with each climax she experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hideout was soon filled with the sweet and heavy fragrance of fairy milk and the mad screams of pleasure of two masturbating and expanding fairys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Touhou Project series has a <b>TON</b> of awesome female characters! So what would happen if say...their breasts started growing? What would happen? How would they react? How would others react? This is a breast expansion interactive story detailing those events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I'm giving 750 Gift Points to all quality additions!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Multiple girls are able to grow at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. While this is a Breast Expansion <b>focused </b>story, Butt Expansion and GTS are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The stories for the characters can be either comedic and silly or serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. For the sake of the story, please add a decent amount per chapter if you would like to post. If I notice a string of 1 or 2 sentence chapters, I will delete them for the sake of quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Please keep this story in English, and use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You can make the girls as big as you want, but please give detail and time for their growth. A.K.A, I do not want a character's breasts to go from normal to galaxy-sized in one chapter. (Basically no instant giga-size) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Not really a rule, but be creative! As long as you follow these rules, you can do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for reading, enjoy the story, and while you're at it, why not ADD to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsst!
