            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Takes place 2-3 weeks after season 1 finale*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day in Central City, the birds were chirping, the sun was shining\u2026 another Metahuman was having a street side battle with The Flash AKA Barry Allen the fastest man alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet speedster arrived on scene to fight his adversary of the day, Jennifer Smalls who until the night of particle accelerator explosion worked for Mercury Labs as a Molecular Biologist. However an explosion set of in her lab by the wave of dark matter making its way through the city caused her to hospitalized. Now her works been published by an ex co-worker inside Mercury Labs and Jennifer is out for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me through Flash, I\u2019ll squash that little maggot for steal credit for my hard work.\u201d Jennifer raged, showing no signs of stopping in her quest for vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d Barry said, sparks flying off his body as he prepared himself for the upcoming fight. He knew he\u2019d have to be cautious since they haven\u2019t had an opportunity to find out what Jennifer\u2019s powers were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry took off, racing around Jennifer several times in the hopes of getting her to show him her ability. Streaks of orange lightning followed his body as he circled the female Meta, who seemed to secrete green slime from the surface of her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s attractive.\u201d Cisco joked, feeling safe from their headquarters inside S.T.A.R Labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarry be careful, we have no idea what that stuff could do to your body. For all we know it could be acid that will melt right through your bones.\u201d Caitlin chimed in, attempting to prepare Barry for any potential outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, got it. Stay away from the slime.\u201d Barry said as he continued to run around Jennifer. Meanwhile she tossed glob after glob of the green ozee in Barry\u2019s direction hitting cars and street signs alike. A quick glance from the speedster revealed that nothing was happening, could generating this stuff be her only power or was there something more to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to figure out the answer to this question in the back of his mind Barry let his guard down long enough for Jennifer to tag him on the shoulder, knocking him to the ground. After rolling for a few second Barry got up and turned to face off against his opponent, the only problem was that she\u2019d mysteriously disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back, I have a sample of her slime on my suit. Maybe we can use it to track her somehow.\u201d Barry suggested, running off without noticing that several cars hit by Jennifer\u2019s ooze had disappeared completely from the side of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a minute had passed but Barry had already managed to make his way into the Cortex at S.T.A.R Labs where Cisco and Caitlin were waiting for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGnarly, what is this stuff?\u201d Cisco asked, scooping some of the goop off the surface of Barry\u2019s suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, we still don\u2019t know what this is. It could be poisonous for all we know.\u201d Caitlin announced, pulling a latex glove over her hand to collect a sample. Prompting Cisco to shake the substance off his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin brought her finger under a microscope and wiped the substance onto a slide before removing the glove and tossing it inside the trash. \u201cI\u2019ll need to do a fully breakdown of the material but it appears to be alive, almost like her own cells are mixed into it. Her own genetic code is literally merged with the slime.\u201d Caitlin explained before turning to Barry and Cisco who were now standing at level with her 32B cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you guys just get shorter?\u201d Caitlin asked rhetorically, her shrinking friends looking up at her concerned face from below as she suddenly shot up in height from their perspective. Within mere moments they were standing at a height that barely reached Caitlin\u2019s thighs. However it only took a few moments more for them to shrink even more so that Caitlin\u2019s height appeared to rival that of a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on? Why are you shrinking?\u201d Caitlin asked before coming to a horrific realization about what was causing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet that stuff off of you right now before you before you become microscopic!\u201d Caitlin\u2019s loud voice boomed, her body now towering over her shrunken friends who\u2019s height failed to even rival the size of her two inch tall high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Barry and Cisco started wiping the substance of themselves but the damage was done, they stopped shrinking at only an inch tall. Looking up at Caitlin who for some reason appeared to be smaller than she was just a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Barry and Cisco allowed themselves to become overjoyed by this development thinking that they must be growing back to their normal size. However a quick observation of their surrounding denied them this hope, instead they came to the harsh realization that the only other person who knew about them shrinking and could do something to reverse it was also shrinking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin Snow got smaller and smaller from Barry and Cisco\u2019s point of view, quickly approaching a size closer to their own. Finally she stopped shrinking at about an inch tall, the same size as the rest of her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, we are so living out Honey I shrunk the Kids right now. I hope nobody breaks out a vacuum cleaner on us.\u201d Cisco said, making his usual pop culture reference in an attempt to downplay the seriousness of him, Caitlin, and Barry being bug sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this even happen, if the Metahuman I was fighting earlier had the power to shrink this how come I wasn\u2019t shrunk back at Mercury labs?\u201d Barry asked, looking to Caitlin for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually very simple, do you remember how I said that the gunk she shot at you possibly contained her own cells? Well her cells contract and expand at a staggering pace so It\u2019s quite possible that she can also make objects and even people much larger than their normal size. However she probably interacts with the cells before they exit her body through her palms, that's why we were all shrunk to the same size. She was trying to make you this small but she couldn\u2019t land a clean shot on you. That\u2019s probably why she ran away. And the reason we all shrunk when we did was because it took time for it to seep into your suit but Cisco touched it with his bare hand, that caused you to shrink at the same time. I handled it with a glove but it must have made its way to my skin at a molecular level which is why I shrunk last.\u201d Caitlin explained, taking a long winded breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense but how do we get back to normal?\u201d Barry asked, looking at their new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can get back to our normal sizes, at least not without the help of the Meta that shrunk us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up, your telling me I\u2019m stuck living the bugs life on twenty four hour loop until the girl who shrunk Barry so she could most likely stomp on him like a grape under her boot decides to make nice and unshrink us?\u201d Cisco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, with all three of us being so small there\u2019s no way we can reverse this.\u201d Caitlin said, pointing out that they were the brains of the operation and that Joe and Iris didn\u2019t get all of the scientific stuff they dealt with everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do you hear that?\" Barry asked, forcing his friends to stay quiet as sounds could be heard echoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Click, clack, click, clack, click*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like heels, we're not alone.\" Cisco stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's Iris. Maybe we can get her to notice us.\" Caitlin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the sound got closer, yet for some reason Barry wasn't hopeful of getting help. Iris rarely wore normal heels unless she had a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the person turned the corner it became clear to everyone that it was not Iris walking into the cortex but a very blonde, very tall Felicity Smoak.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/39/f5/8739f525f58d78637f801d2c3b6ac477.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/39/f5/...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was absolutely gigantic to the now tiny team flash who stood in her path, her heels creating powerful earthquake like vibrations as her feet met with the tiled floor beneath her. Alas Caitlin now knew what it was like for Barry and Cisco in the brief time period that they were looking up at her towering over them, it wasn't a feeling she wanted to get used to experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone here? I hope you guys don't mind that I pop in for a little visit.\" Felicity announced as she made her way into the room. Her booming footsteps drawing closer to her tiny friends on the floor who remain still in fear of being squashed like a bug under the blonde IT's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after her feet land on either side of Barry, Caitlin, and Cisco, trapping them in-between her feet and forcing them to look directly up at her. They could glimpse underneath her skirt at her dark green panties, but couldn't make out much else from their current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, usually someone's around here but the place is completely empty.\" Felicity said out loud, thinking that she was talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, did you know Felicity was coming for a visit?\" Caitlin asked, feeling even smaller than she actually was looking up at her friend who probably wore earrings bigger than her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just as shocked as you are. But at least now if we can get her attention she can help us track down the new Meta.\" Barry rationalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity notices them on the floor and moves them to a higher position on a chair so she doesn't step on them accidentally, only to sit on them when Iris arrives in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity explores the lab while Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin try to find a way to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Barry suggest climbing Felicity to get her attention pointing out that there's not much they can do on the ground except being stepped on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What are these little bugs on the floor? Usually it's so clean in here.\" Felicity's voice boomed, sending all three of the tiny scientists into a panic. Barry looked over at Felicity's gigantic high heel, and shuddered at the thought of how easily he could be crushed underneath the stiletto. And while being hit by lightening gave him super speed instead of killing him, he doubted there were any new super powers waiting underneath the IT girl's foot. He burst out into a run, surprised to find himself running no faster than the average person. Well, the average inch tall person anyway. Unfortunately, his sprint was quickly overtaken by a massive shadow. He looked up to see the underside of Felicity's heel hanging over him, ready to squish a bug out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Felicity's curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to take a quick look and see exactly what kind of bug she was squishing. Needless to say, they were not what she was expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry! Is that you?\" Felicity shrieked, shocked that the bug she almost squished was actually her tiny friend. She put her foot down gently, making sure that there were no other shrunken people in its path. \"And Caitlin and Cisco too! How'd you get so small?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity waited for a response, but none came. After a few seconds, she smacked herself on the forehead, \"Of course, you're too small for me to hear. Hold still, I'm going to pick you all up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity gently deposited the three shrunken people down onto the one of the wheelie chairs before crouching down in front of it to talk to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on guys? How'd you get so small?\" Felicity asked, rather too loudly considering her face's proximity to the shrunken people. Her booming voice knocked Cisco and Barry down onto their butts, covering their ears in pain. \"Oops. Sorry.\" She whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the metas from the particle accelerator explosion shrunk us with some kind of goo!\" Caitlin shouted, taking charge as the one still standing. \"I think it can be reversed, but I'm going to need some normal sized help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course I'll help you. Just let me know what you need.\" Felicity replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Felicity. We really appreci-\" Barry began, only to be suddenly interrupted by Iris's voice from the hallway: \"Hey guys? Anyone here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity panicked at the sound of Iris's arrival. She jumped to her feet, and turned to the hall where Iris's voice had come from, and wondered what she should do. She didn't have enough time to think of a real answer, only \"don't show Iris the tinies\" and \"act natural\". Unfortunately for the tiny trio, Felicity's panicked mind didn't come up with a gentle way of meeting those 2 objectives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FELICITY! DON'T!\" Cisco screamed as the tinies saw Felicity's enormous ass descending towards them. Felicity had pushed back her skirt as she began her descent, revealing the tight white pair of panties she had squeezed her enormous ass into. It wasn't a thong or anything, but the panties had ridden up Felicity's ass quite a bit, ensuring little of their view of her ass was left to the imagination. Their screams were silenced as the gigantic booty touched down on the seat, ensuring they didn't have to imagine how heavy her ass was either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris entered the room only a second after Felicity settled into her seat. \"Oh hey Felicity, I didn't know you were in town.\" Iris said. \"Have you seen everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...nope! Just me here! No one but me, since I got here til now.\" Felicity siad nervously, her mind much more focused on the fact that she was SITTING on the shrunken bodies of her friends. She could feel all 3 of them wiggling and squirming beneath her tremendous rear end. Clearly this was a horrible way to hide them, but she couldn't back out now. It's not like she could show Iris that she had all of her friends trapped under her ass. \"I imagine they're out somewhere, far away from here. Probably relaxing somewhere. They're under a lot of <i>pressure</i> with superheroing and all.\" Felicity bit her lip in frustration, trying to stop herself from talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok then...\" Iris replied, confused by Felicity's rambling answer. She decided to brush it off as typical Felicity awkwardness and push past it. \"So what's new with you then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity searched her mind for a response that was not related to the tiny people beneath her rear. What was actually new was the feeling of a tiny superhero squirming under her butt crack, while his two friends were flattened under each of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was a new experience for the shrunken people as well. Caitlin was pinned beneath her right cheek, bearing the tremendous weight of the IT girl's body. She had ended up just under Felicity's panty line, ensuring that while her body was pinned under Felicity's cotton undergarments, her face was directly buried in doughy butt flesh. She thrashed her head around relentlessly in an attempt to free her face from the endless skin, trying to get some air into her lungs. With a jerk she manages to turn her head, leaving the right side of her face pressed against the chair cushion will the left side supported a wall of pale booty flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCisco's experience was quite similar to Caitlin's, though he had ended up a little closer to the blonde's butt crack, decreasing the weight bearing down on him and sparing him any face to flesh contact. Barry on the other hand, was in a whole different world. While Caitlin and Cisco were trapped under yielding boulders of ass fat, Barry was trapped in a fleshy coccoon right between her cheeks. Felicity's underwear was quite tight, and as the unfortunate soul who ended up beneath her butt crack, he found that it was deep enough in her butt that while the front of his body was pressed against the fabric of her undergarments, his sides were being squeezed by bare butt flesh. He instinctively tried to free himself by squirming, but this proved to be a mistake. It did nothing to help free the tiny speedster from his unfortunate position, but it did have the unintendeded result of tickling Felicity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity suddenly burst out laughing as a result of the ticklish feeling of Barry's hair rubbing against the inside of her ass cheek. She never would have guessed she was ticklish there, but she also had certainly never checked. Realizing she couldn't explain this behavior to Iris, she reflexively clenched her cheeks around Barry, trying to stop the squirming from continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry screamed as the fleshy boulders squeezed themselves around him, tightening like a vice. Gorilla Grodd's grip had nothing on the tight clutching force of Felicity's buttocks. His screams went unheard by the giantess, drowned out by the planetoid sized cheeks embracing him. He squirmed to try to alert Felicity to what she was doing to him, but this only prompted tighter squeezing. Barry heard some of his ribs crack from the pressure, and quickly got the message that more squirming wasn't the answer. He stopped moving altogether, trying to remain completely still. As suddenly as they had started, Felicity's cheeks released their grip on Barry, and his superhuman healing quickly repaired the damage to his ribcage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... are you ok?\" Iris asked, caught off guard by the sudden outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... Yes of course!\" Felicity replied, clearly too enthusiastically, but relieved that the wriggling in her crack had stopped. \"I just remembered a funny joke Barry told me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok.\" Iris said, mildly relieved. \"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity almost smacked herself for walking into such an obvious dead end. She quickly scrambled to come up with a joke, but the only thing she could come up with was \"Did you hear the one about blonde who sat on her three shrunken friends?\", and she certainly wasn't going to say that. Finally, after 30 seconds of nervous silence, Felicity said \"It's really all about the delivery. I think you should probably just ask Barry later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok.\" Iris said, still bit unnerved by Felicity's frantic behavior. \"Anyway, since the others are gone, maybe we should catch up? How about we head to Jitters? Coffee's on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity paused to think. It took a bit longer to think with the constant distraction of three tiny people squirming against her butt cheeks, but she pushed past that. She didn't want to make Iris suspicious by saying no, given that she was just sitting around doing nothing (other than squashing their friends under her butt). But she also wanted to get rid of her as soon as possible so she could get on to helping the tiny trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity leaves to get coffee with Iris, quickly brushing the tinies off her seat and into her purse as she does so. Only after a few steps does she realize that Barry is still in her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity stands up to walk out with Iris, but Iris decides she needs to check something on computer quick and sits down on top of the tiny trio herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Felicity makes up an excuse and sends Iris away, and quickly stands up to apologize to the tinies as soon as she leaves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just let me grab my purse, and I'll meet you by the elevator.\" Felicity answered, unable to come up with any believable lie under pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as her tiny friends could attest coming up with a white lie had nothing on Felicity's ass in terms of pressure. Her weight was suffocating, and the size of her backside was simply massive to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought a whole new meaning to the term *gluteus maximus*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll see you over there,\"  Iris said as she exited the Cortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity was quick to act after Iris made her exit, standing up and rushing to gather her things so her friend would not grow suspicious. Leaving Cisco and Caitlin gasping for fresh air on her seat in the crater-like indent left behind by her massive derriere. However, it wasn't long before Felicity appeared over them for a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Felicity whispered, bringing her purse to the edge of her previously occupied chair. Not bothering to double check, and see if all her tiny friends were safe and accounted for before sweeping them into her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny scientists could hardly voice their objections before they found themselves in a freefall over the seemingly black abyss of Felicity's purse. Cisco fell onto an opened package of Mentos, while Caitlin found herself trapped between the plastic bristles of Felicity's hairbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag swung from left too right as Felicity raced out of the cortex into the hallway, looking into her purse to make sure the tiny people were okay. \"Sorry, are you guy's okay?\" she asked, feeling guilty of abusing her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm alive. Somehow!\" Cisco answered, feeling exasperated with everything that was happening. \"Cisco, I'm kinda stuck over here. Can you help me out?\" Caitlin asked, sounding no more pleased than her friend. But what caught Felicity's attention was what she wasn't hearing, someone was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's Barry?\" she asked Cisco and Caitlin, before realizing that she could still somewhat feel him wedged between her buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other situation, Felicity would've stopped dead in her tracks and gotten Barry away from her butt before he got hurt. But she'd just turned the corner and was in full view of Iris, who was waiting for her by the elevator. She couldn't just stop and pull a one inch tall Barry out of her ass in front of his childhood friend without some form of explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity!\" Barry yelled, hanging off Felicity's panties, hidden by her skirt but forced to watch the ground move as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got everything you need?\" asked Iris, sensing that something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure,\" Felicity responded, boarding the elevator with Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus some additional accessories,\" Felicity whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just making a mental note about a small situation, I can take care of it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well let's get going then,\" Iris said, pushing the button to take them to the top floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later on the streets of Central City, Iris and Felicity were nearing Jitters, and Felicity still hadn't found an opportunity to retrieve Barry. The shrunken Speedster's strength beginning to fade after being forced to hang from the blonde IT's underwear for twenty minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure if Felicity even realized he was still attached to her butt, Barry decided that he would have to save himself before he ended up falling to his doom. He only hoped Felicity would understand and forgive him as he crawled towards the edge of her panties. Planning to pull himself inside her underwear for safety reasons until she could remove him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just great. I didn't think we'd become the equivalent of Felicity's pet chihuahuas when I woke up this morning.\" Cisco groaned as he helped Caitlin escape Felicity's hairbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it took you this long to help me get out of a hairbrush,\" Caitlin replied, seeming quite miffed by their current situation as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault! Felicity doesn't make it very easy to move around, swinging her purse like some out of control Mary-go-round.\" Cisco added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity is too worried about Barry right now to focus on us. We have to get out of her and remind her that we need help, even if that means that Iris finds out as well. She already knows Barry is the Flash.\" Caitlin reasoned, wondering what purpose it served for Felicity to keep them a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Felicity, what brings you to Central City this time?\" Iris asked, making small talk. Meanwhile, Barry had just begun to squeeze himself between Felicity's butt flesh and the outline of her panties. An action that was quickly noticed by the giant blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just taking care of some small things, trying to keep people out of my <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>BUSINESS</b></font>,\" Felicity said, emphasizing her last word as a way of trying to tell Barry not to go inside her underwear, even if it was just for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sounds like someone's got a bug up her butt,\" Iris said, not sure how to take Felicity's sudden outburst with nobody else around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" Felicity replied, hoping it wouldn't come to that as she felt Barry roll down the fabric of her panties towards her buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully a cup of coffee will help take the edge off,\" Felicity said, sounding more upbeat in an attempt to assure Iris that she wasn't the cause for her earlier outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that coffee beans are actually seeds and that the drink itself dates back to the year 800AD? Also despite the fact that over fifty percent of Americans drink coffee we only grow the seed in two states and purchase most of the excess from countries like Brazil. Which is odd when you consider the fact that the Boston Tea Party helped to popularize coffee in America in the first place, you think we would grow more ourselves.\" Felicity rambled on and on, biting her lip between sentences as she tried to distract herself from saying what was really on her mind which was 'Barry is inside my panties'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Iris acknowledged, beginning to think Felicity was acting more like herself for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity and Iris continued walking down the road, nearing closer to their destination as Felicity's ass continued to chew away at a tiny Barry. Her panties riding up into her asscrack with each step, the fabric expanding and contracting with each stride of her long legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Barry, this effect was similar to that of a trampoline, bouncing him off the fabric of Felicity's panties and into her flesh over and over again. Each time, his body smacking full force into her soft rear cheek before falling back to repeat the process all over again. This happened with every step she took, his body moving centimeter by centimeter towards the center point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity could feel every impact on the surface of her skin, but after two or three times she knew Barry wasn't doing it willingly. After a few minutes of this, she was completely desensitized to what he might be feeling, knowing there was nothing she could do put an end to the situation without alerting Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Barry got sick of this endless back and forth, trying to put an end to it by grabbing her panties to balance himself. Unfortunately for Barry, he found himself very close to the center of Felicity's wedgie. Little did he realize that things were about to get much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity and Iris were close to Jitters at this point, but before their arrival, they had to travel through one more Central City landmark, the Town Square. This signaled bad news for Barry specifically due to the fact that Jitters was on the lower end of the park, meaning that Felicity and Iris would have to walk down thirty steps of a stone staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity realized this as well, deciding to take these steps at a fast pace, not wanting Barry's experience to last too long, inadvertently tossing him back and forth as her ass began to eat away at her panties, resulting in a massive wedgie. Barry noticed this quickly enough but it was already too late, he was swiftly drawn into her wedgie and being the densest(not to mention only) object in her panties he found himself pulled upwards rapidly. There he met up with the blonde woman's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Felicity?\" Barry asked loudly, trying to get the blonde's attention as he found himself staring down the rear entrance into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, let me out of here!\" He yelled, kicking against her supple butt flesh in an attempt to escape her ass trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis kicks were so weak, Felicity could barely feel them. But she still knew exactly where he was and she wasn't happy about it at all. However, she also couldn't blame the shrunken speedster at the same time for landing himself in his current predicament. A large part of the blame laid with how large her own ass was, she was the one who sat on him, Caitlin, and Cisco earlier in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was just a bit more careful, this never would have happened in the first place and she wouldn't have an inch tall Metahuman vibrator face to face with her asshole. At the same time, she couldn't react hastily or Iris would certainly know that something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Felicity smiled at Iris as the two walked up to the front door of Jitters, opening the door with a loud *Ding* sound that Barry could recognize even through her tonnes of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can grab us some seats, I'll order us some Coffee. You still take it the same way?\" Iris asked, wandering towards the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks,\" Felicity said, trying to focus on the best course of action. She couldn't leave Iris before she got her drink, and she needed to sit down or risk exposing herself to Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Felicity decided on a softer pair of seats in the corner of the coffee shop thinking that a softer seat wouldn't force Barry up her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the seats with long quick steps, making herself stand out quite obviously as she tried to undo her wedgie without touching her butt. Unfortunately, her success was small and Barry gained little relief in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she straightened out her dress and prepared to sit down. Moving carefully in an effort to avoid hurting Barry, making sure that her butt touched down lightly. And while she didn't want to hurt Barry, she couldn't deny that he also felt kinda good struggling between her cheeks as they touched down on the leather seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Barry watched as his surrounding got darker and darker until everything turned pitch black. Only able to feel the pressure as her soft unyielding flesh caved in on him, realizing that Felicity had sat down. He could feel every movement as she lightly twisted her hips, trying to make sure her body came to rest gently on the seat until her full weight rested on top of Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, she's come to a stop. Now's our chance.\" Caitlin insisted, tired of being Felicity's purse pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but where are we gonna go? In case you forgot Felicity almost stepped on us like bugs back at Star Labs, and there are much bigger people than her out there.\" Cisco replied, trying to be the voice of reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a better idea?\" Caitlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time that this conversation was going on, Iris returned with Felicity's coffee in hand, able to tell that something was off by the way she was sitting. She set her friend's coffee down in front of her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you seem really stressed. Don't worry, I know what will take the edge off.\" Iris informed, leaning down and pressing a button on the side of Felicity's seat. The chair began to roll back slowly, giving the blonde IT a footrest and pushing the majority of her weight onto her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's going on?\" Felicity asked, not liking the potential impacts this could have on Barry and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like? Jitter's just bought these new massage chairs last week. Pretty great huh?\" Iris smiled, falling comfortably into her own seat which was already turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, massage chairs. Uh oh...\" Felicity said with a pause, she could already feel the mechanisms rolling along her upper back, moving down. If it started massaging her lower back and butt then she feared Barry would be in for a tough time. But what could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she try to stop the chair first, or should she just excuse herself? Or will Iris notice a shrunken Cisco and Caitlin before she gets the chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity accidentally presses a button causing the chair to drop down, launching Barry into her asshole. But with the Jitters bathroom closed, she has nowhere to take him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity excuses herself to a bathroom to free Barry, hiding him somewhere else on her pocketless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caitlin and Cisco climb out of the bag and try to get Iris's attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barry Allen has not been a superhero for very long, but he already loved it. Speeding around Central City, stopping metas, running on water, all of it had been amazing so far. But occasionally, he found himself in a situation in which he needed to consult with someone a bit more experienced. Fortunately, he was friends with Oliver Queen, the Arrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking much of it, Barry decided to zip over to Central City to see if Oliver was around to talk. He didn't bother with his Flash suit, figuring he would only stand out in Star City dressed in bright red leather. Instead, he ran over in his normal clothes, planning on checking a few common spots in Star City where he knew he was likely to find Oliver. The Arrow Cave and Verdant were his first stops, but were completely empty. Next on the list was a high rise apartment uptown. It technically belonged to Oliver's younger sister Thea, but he had never had the opportunity to meet her himself. That was about to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, what neither Barry nor Thea realized is that Thea's father Malcolm had installed a little bit of extra security on Thea's apartment for dealing with threats from the League of Assassins. As Barry sped up the stairs and into the apartment, Malcolm's security system sprung into action, firing a precision aimed laser right at the speedster right as he moved through the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Barry knew what was happening, he began to shrink. His momentum from running continued to carry him forward as he did so, so even when he was so small that his feet no longer touched the ground, he was flying through the air, unable to control his trajectory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inch tall speedster came to a hard stop as he crashed into a pillar of pale flesh. He bounced off the barrier and fell backwards to the floor in a slump. \"What was that beam? What happened?\" Barry asked aloud, used to have other voices in his head through his coms. However, since he was not wearing his flash suit, he was only talking to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's internal wondering about how exactly he'd shrunk was interrupted as he saw the pillar he had collided with begin to move. It lifted into the air and spun around, revealing the giant, pedicured foot attached to the bottom of it. As Barry's eyes drifted upwards, he found himself looking up a giant brunette woman, who he suspected was Oliver's sister Thea. And just as he was looking up at her, her brown eyes were staring down at him. He was relieved to have been seen, though he hoped that she recognized him as a shrunken person rather than mistaking him for an insect. He was surprised to see a smile appear on her lips before she began to extend her hand down towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry didn't know why she was reaching for him, but his instincts told him to run as the giant hand approached. However, he soon discovered that what ever had shrunken him had also somehow impacted his connection to the speed force. He was running no faster than a normal person would, and at only an inch tall, this made him very easy to catch. He felt the goddess sized girl's fingers close around him, pinching his head between her pointer and thumb in order to lift him up into the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how did you get in here?\" Thea said with a cruel smirk, dangling the tiny man between her fingers by her grip on his head. \"You certainly picked the wrong girl to visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was shocked by Thea's reaction, since this was not at all what he'd expected. He hadn't ever met her directly, but based on what he'd heard from Oliver, he'd assumed Thea would be kind enough to help him in his time of need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Thea? I need your help! I'm one of Oliver's friends!\" Barry yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly not a very good one since I've never met you.\" Thea said thoughtfully, her Lazarus Pit tainted mind brimming with ideas. \"I'm sure he won't miss you too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss me? What do you mean?\" Barry asked, not liking where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you. Wanna make sure it works before I explain too much.\" They said, lowering the tiny speedster back down to the cold hardwood floor of her apartment and depositing him on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was confused what Thea's intentions were, but any confusion was eliminated by the sight of her bare right foot swinging into vision above, toes wiggling excitedly. \"Wait! Thea Don-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFWOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot came down on the man far too fast for a powerless man to dodge. Her splayed toes wrapped around his neck as the ball of her foot struck him square in the chest, pinning him to the ground beneath her pale slightly sweaty sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, this is gonna work well.\" Thea said with a smirk, feeling the tiny squirms of the shrunken man beneath her sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you me-\" Barry began, only to be cut off as her curled toes squeezed around his tiny neck, stifling his oxygen supply. His screaming face was buried into the disgusting crevice between her toes, filling his mouth with dirt and grime and his nose with the terrible stench of someone whose feet had been cooped up in a pair of boots all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little bug, it's kind of a long story, but what's important is that I nearly died, but was brought back to life with magic. Only problem is that the magic has 'bloodlust' has a side effect. I've been losing control of myself and attacking or torturing people uncontrollably. But you're the solution.\" Thea explained. Barry tried to interject, but Thea simply leaned her weight forward a little bit, pressing the ball of her foot down harder on his chest and causing him to scream out in pain, which was music to Thea's ears. \"You're small enough that I can take you with me anywhere. I can keep you trapped in my clothes, or in my boot under my foot, or wherever else I want. And by constantly torturing you, I'll be able to keep my bloodlust under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He was sure Thea would help him when she found him shrunken, but instead she planned on torturing him 24/7 to keep her murderous desires in check. He needed to get away from this girl, and fast, but he was powerless. His speed had stopped working at his tiny size, and he travelled here without his suit, so he didn't have coms available to contact the team. They had no way of tracking him, and no matter how hard they looked for him, they'd likely never think to check between Oliver's little sister's toes. He could become this crazy girl's insole for the rest of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this Thea! Please bring me to Oliver! I'm the Fla-\" Barry began, only to be interrupted by Thea grabbing him off the floor once more as she prepared to begin his life of torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care who you were little man. Because from now on, you're mine.\" Thea said with a smirk, before moving him towards his new prison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Thea tapes Barry to the sole of her foot just as he had been pinned beneath it, with his body under the ball of her foot and his face buried between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thea decides keeping Barry on her foot would be too visible, so stuffs him between her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Thea keeps Barry in her mouth, keeping him wedged between her teeth. </span></div></div>",

Tell him Barry Allen\u2019s here, I\u2019m the Fla-\u201d Barry testified in horror as he found himself being moved towards this young woman's ass, contained in a pair of skintight jeans. His words cut off as Thea squeezed his shrunken body into the center of her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t really care who you were before. You were foolish enough to try and enter my apartment so I\u2019ll be deciding your punishment you little bug.\u201d Thea announced, waving her hips from side to side in full view of Barry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see this giant ass, I\u2019m gonna have to crush you with it so please try to survive for at least a few moments before you pop alright. I\u2019d hate to waste your life without losing my bloodlust for a few days.\u201d Thea followed up, willing to go as far as crushing Barry like an ant under her powerful bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea pulled up a chair and dropped Barry on the center before reaching to undo her belt, in this moment Barry thought he could run all the way across Thea\u2019s apartment and take refuge under the young woman\u2019s couch until he could find a way to reverse the shrinking. Unfortunately his speed was still drained and he was stuck moving at the speed of a normal human\u2026 a normal one inch tall human that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea snapped the buckle on her belt and pulled the strap through the loops of her jeans surrounding her waist, tossing it to the side with a resounding thud to the shrunken speedsted. He could feel the vibrations from atop this chair Thea had placed him on top of. If her belt was that heavy, how much would Thea herself weight when she decided to use him as her own personal seat cushion? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry didn\u2019t want to wait and find out, he started running towards Thea as she undid the buttons on her jeans as she undid three of them running down her crotch. He thought he could grab a hold of her jeans as she let them run down her legs, resulting in his quickest transportation to the floor with the lowest risk of injury. Unfortunately without his current level of speed, not only was this idea proving more difficult to carry out it was damn near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the shrunken speedster could move more than a few feet Thea had already succeeded in undo all three buttons and pulling them halfway down her thighs, revealing a pair of red panties underneath. Clearly the two had something in common at the very least, their favorite colors were obvious both red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Thea noticed Barry running towards her at a slow pace and it didn\u2019t take her very long to figure out what he had planned, and how she could quickly put an end to his little escape plan. With a quick turn Thea faced in the opposite direction of the chair and thrusted her hips outwards, bumping the chair with her rear cheeks. Afterwards she let the chair rock back and forth before resting her cheeks on the edge of the seat, blocking Barry\u2019s path to her jeans as she allowed to to fall to the floor around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you already, I can\u2019t let you escape that easily, just accept being crushed by my ass and I\u2019ll make this as quick as possible.\u201d Thea lied, if this was gonna work she\u2019d have to drag out his suffering for as long as possible before using her rear cheeks to crush his body like a grape. Still it would be much easier with a willing tiny man, instead of a tiny guy clinging to life when faced with an impossible obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder Thea realized Barry had strayed to far away from the center of her seat, where he was most likely to endure the fully weight and pressure of her beautiful butt. \u201cQuick little bastard.\u201d she scoffed, still unaware of Barry\u2019s secret identity as the scarlet speedster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bumped the chair with her butt hard enough that Barry was knocked onto his back, looking upwards at Thea as she playfully moved her hips back to tilt the chair slightly backwards. However from Barry\u2019s point of view this shift was a bit more severe, his entire world slanting sideways as gravity began to drag him towards the back of the chair. Thinking on his feet Barry rolled onto his stomach, trying to grab a hold of any groove of seem in the leather seat to stop him from falling further. All while watching as Thea\u2019s massive panty clad ass got only slightly further away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had Barry right where she wanted him Thea pulled her backside away from the chair, allowing it to land on its front legs with Barry in the center of her seat. Still this hardly meant that Barry had a moment to catch his breath, surrounding him already was a large and dark shadow, cast over him by Thea\u2019s body as she lifted herself over the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her plan successfully carried out Thea wasted no time in bringing her full weight down on top of Barry\u2019s tiny frame, smothering him under the full crushing weight of her right butt cheek. Any normal person would have been crushed to a bloody pulp by such force, but not Barry. Not only was his body stronger than a normal human\u2019s but he also had the speed force healing his damaged cells each time Thea\u2019s flesh assaulted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill alive down there? Let\u2019s try something a bit tougher.\u201d Thea announced, her bloodlust becoming more palpable. Quickly her ass lifted off Barry, although only it was obviously only temporary it was nice to be free of Thea\u2019s immense weight. Looking up Barry still saw Thea\u2019s ass hovering overhead, her panties being pulled below her waist and between her thighs, leaving her butt visible to the naked eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for round 2?\u201d Thea asked, lifting her butt a few inches before slamming it back down into the leather seat. Effectively adding more pressure to her already incredible weight as she slammed the full brunt of her naked ass on top of the shrunken speedster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft flesh spread quickly from the moment it met with both Barry and the seat below, battling for dominance to fill every single atom of space beneath her weight. Of course that included the space currently occupied by Barry\u2019s tiny body. Her flesh attacking the shrunken Metahuman from all angles, preventing movement of any kind and making even breathing difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty tough for a little guy, lets see just how much you can take before you pop!\u201d Thea teased out loud, fully prepared to use her giant ass to put Barry through the ringer. She dragged her ass against the leather seat which was only kind of painful for herself as Barry was rolled under her weight like fresh pizza dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill alive?\u201d Thea asked, feeling Barry\u2019s screaming voice tickling her flesh from below. She couldn\u2019t admit it outloud, but it felt amazing. Like a massage for her ass. With her bloodlust beginning to subside Thea thought off a plan to help her manage it completely using only Barry as the subject of her rage. She just needed to put him though one more test to make sure he could handle the worst of it, she reached down and grabbed the underside of her seat, pulling herself down and increasing her weight on Barry even further. But she still wasn\u2019t done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her butt down into the seat she began twisting her hips slowly from left to right, grinding Barry into her seat like play doh, pulverizing him with her flesh to the point where his legs felt as if they were about to be snapped in half like weak little twigs. But she stopped just short of accomplishing this goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her ass slowly began to lift off the seat, had she had a change of heart? Was her bloodlust satisfied for now? What would either mean for Barry? The answer to all three began apparent within moments as Thea\u2019s asscheeks dragged Barry to their center, the young woman squeezing her glutes together so that Barry ended up between her buttcheeks as she stood up over the seat. Forcing Barry to watch as it got further and further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou survived my first test for you, but I can\u2019t let you go now. Especially not since I tried to kill you with my ass, hopefully you enjoyed yourself down there cause you\u2019ll be spending a lot more time down there helping me keep my bloodlust under control.\u201d Thea announced clearly, planning to keep Barry around as a stress toy for her ass. Truthfully she was enjoying this, having a tiny person suffering under her ass had been quite the enjoyable experience. She could do anything she wanted with him from now on and there was nothing he could do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hiked her panties and jeans up her thighs and around her shapely rear end, sealing Barry off from the outside world before turning her attention to more important matter. She grabbed a glass of wine she\u2019d prepared before Barry so rudely interrupted her evening and took a sip from the glass, smashing Barry between her buttocks with each step she took. Lastly Thea entered her living room, positioning herself over the couch before placing her glass on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed herself to fall onto the couch, giggling as she looked down at her ass imagining how pain this must have been for Barry. In truth it hurt less than when she was slamming her full weight down on him but was somehow more humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Thea do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Thea falls asleep on the couch, giving Barry an opportunity to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thea is still excited from her fun trying to squish Barry, so she decides to try moving him up to front of her panties and seeing how he fares in her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Thea's Phone buzzes as a reminder to go to the gym, remembering what her father told her about how a warrior must exercise everyday. Switching her jeans out for a pair of yoga pants and starting her workout like anyone else, on the treadmill.</span></div></div>",

Thea wondered what the cause of the heat inside her was, did she have a giantess fetish, a sadistic streak or was it just an extension of her dominant and commanding personality? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way her inch tall toy was getting her hot and horny, and unfortunately (for him) rubbing herself through her jeans wasn't doing her any good. The wine glass, as well as the 3 that followed probably, didn't help matters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Barry things were going much differently, he found that his miniaturized body was able to adapt much quicker than it should, only feeling pain when Thea moved, the general pressure of her ass becoming negligible as far as his body was concerned it had better things to do, like trying to build up speed force energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Thea has to sleep eventually, she is still human after all, even if she behaves like a monster, so once she nods off, provided she leaves him in her ass he will hopefully have enough energy inside of him to speed out of her butt and make his way at least to a hiding place, is not straight out of the apartment to safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't care where just away from this girl. This was not in the cards as he feels Thea rise and her jeans removed, as noted by the slight lightening of his prison, then came her fingers seeking him out. Had she come to her senses? Yeah.... no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea grins as she removes him, bringing the tiny speedster up to her face \"Hey little squirt, didn't know you could feel that good\" she laughs \"I have a much better place for a tiny buzzy toy like you than between my butt cheeks. MUCH better\" Barry doesn't like the tone in her voice, made worse when she flops back onto the couch and still brings him down to her lap \"I have my next test for you my dear little plaything, can you do as good a job being crushed by my pussy that it reduces my bloodlust and gets me off? Good luck\" she laughs as she presses Barry into her vaginal lips, moving him along the edge until it reaches her clit. A side effect of holding this much of the speed force inside of him causes Barry's body to become unstable, and as such, it was vibrating, a side effect Thea was taking full advantage of as his rapid-fire movement hit her doorbell like a jackhammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea moans and pants, keeping Barry pinned between 2 fingers so he can't either escape or get lost, grinding him against her clit before moving further in, his vibrating form doing a wonderful job as she rubs him against as much of the inside of her pussy as she can with the restriction she's giving herself, though there is one more thing she needs to check, as she can't hold him all the time she needs to see just how he'll fair alone in her giant pussy, so just as she was on the verge of orgasm Thea releases Barry and pulls out her hand from her pussy, though continues to rub herself to climax through the underwear, rocking her hips as she squirts, instantly soaking her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting Thea sighs deeply, provided he survived she has found a very enjoyable way to spend time on the weekends, which as she peels back the sodden material and sees the ting man is set to be exactly what she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She's still horny, so decides to see how much good Barry can do inside her ass rather than being crushed under her cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Tired but satisfied Thea decides to rest, but no before moving Barry to under her foot, meaning his escape plans were basically non-existent... I mean he can still try, it'll just be very hard to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) A knock on the door startles Thea, quickly putting back on her clothes seeing Oliver and Laurel has to talk to her brother and his best friend, all without letting it slip she has a tiny person in her panties, not as easy when Barry hears Oliver and tries to get his attention</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a classic team-up between heroes, Team Flash and Team Arrow coming together once again to stop a rouge Metahuman that had recently made his way through the newly named Star City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Arrow had grown to be a group of 4 members, Oliver Queen, John Diggle, and of course, Felicity Smoak, who was assisting the two teams over comms from Star Labs. Thea Queen was left to defend Star City by herself for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Flash was still small, however, relying solely on Barry to do most of the hard work, joined in the field by Cisco Ramon, Joe west, and the Harrison Wells of Earth-2 joining the fray. Back at Star Labs, Iris West and Caitlin Snow also assisted over comms, providing background information, and creating a strategy for the two teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of an encounter with the villain, Oliver and his team were pinned down behind an upside-down car. With everyone besides Barry from Team Flash taking cover behind the Star Labs van, the speedster running interference to draw the Metahuman's fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry talk to me, what's his power?\" Caitlin asked over comms, while Barry continued to run circles around the mysterious Meta. White beams flowed out of his fists, hitting stop signs, street lamps, trees, and a mailbox. All of which seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems to be destroying things at a molecular level, everything he zaps is disappearing entirely,\" Barry answers, slowing down and speeding up to better control his opponent's aim and stop him from hitting anything more vital like buildings or his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, that's impossible, you can't destroy matter. Only change it somehow, or move it from place to place. He has to be doing one or the other.\" Caitlin responded, prompting Cisco and Joe to prepare The Boot, charging the device for the takedown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to hit Barry, the Meta turned his attention to Barry's team, shooting two beams from his forearms at the overturned car and Van, making both disappear instantly, leaving both groups without cover. \"Say goodbye to your friends, Flash!\" he yelled, thrusting both arms forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver drew his bow and fired an explosive arrow between the two beams at the Meta's feet, noticing something on the ground where the car had been out the corner of his eye, it looked like a Hot Wheels version of the car he was just hiding behind. That's when it hit him, looking back up to see Barry racing towards them, trying to use his own body as a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, wait!\" Oliver yelled, discovering the Meta's ability too late as the widespread beam passed through them all, his explosive arrow going off a second later. *boom* the Meta flew back out of sight and both Team Flash, and Team Arrow were affected by the Metahuman's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCisco felt up and down his body, oh thank god. I'm alive, I mean we're alive. Focused on only himself and the others. However, some were already starting to see the bigger picture after coming to the same conclusion Oliver came to earlier. They'd been shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, what's going on out there? We're reading some weird telemetry back from Barry's suit, is everyone okay?\" Iris asked, jumping in front of Caitlin to check-in on everyone including Barry and her dad.  Everyone else still reeling after being shrunk down was surprised to discover that all of their equipment still worked just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Iris, thanks for asking. We're all pretty much okay over here, no physical injuries at least, but there is one problem. We're all an inch tall!\" Cisco yelled sarcastically into the mic, causing reverberations and feedback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Caitlin asked, amazed by the scientific element of reducing matter to such a tiny size. Not to mention, working on live subjects without any complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Barry and Oliver are...\" Iris started, unsure of how to put the term delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... the size of Tic Tacs!\" Felicity finished, bluntly saying what all the girls were thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helping!\" Cisco responded, not wanting to be compared to the tiny mint at his current size. The thought of being tossed around in Caitlin's mouth like a snack, or being sat on by Iris and Felicity sending a shiver down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, sorry. Where are you guys? I'll come by and pick you up, literally I guess. Can you see the Star Labs van? There's a tracking device inside, if you get in and drive somewhere safe, I should be able to find you pretty easily.\" Caitlin announced, grabbing her jacket and purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see the Van, it's right...\" Cisco paused a rhythmic earthquake shook the ground, they weren't very powerful. But were strong enough to be felt at their tiny size. \"Caitlin, are you guys reading any earthquakes?\" Cisco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all sectors appear to be free of all seismic activity. Why?\"  Caitlin asked, curious as to why Cisco would ask so suddenly about something seemingly unrelated to their current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cause I'm pretty sure one is heading straight towards us!\" Cisco said, panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think those are footsteps, quick everyone get to the van!\" Diggle said, putting his years as a private bodyguard to use as he leads everyone in an orderly fashion, thinking that the Meta from earlier was coming back to finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as everyone got within a few feet of the Van a brown boot came down, and quickly transformed their vehicle into a piece of scrap metal that was as flat as a pancake. But what was more surprising to the group was the boot's owner, following the massive pillar up to the face of a young blonde-haired woman in a police uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is officer Patty Spivot with the Anti-Metahuman Task Force. Joe, do you read me?\" Patty said into her radio, causing everyone to turn towards Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call her here, just jut crushed our ride? I loved that van.\" Cisco asked the tiny group standing frozen as Patty surveyed the overhead, only one more step away from possibly having 6 tiny bloodstains on the bottoms of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't know how she got here so fast, she always seems to do this somehow,\" Joe responded, taking the radio off his belt, wondering if they should try to contact her or risk fleeing while she investigates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys Joe is right, she would have found this crime scene one way or the other, but right now we need help and Caitlin's over a 20-minute drive away. We can trust her, she's my girlfriend.\" Barry said, the news coming to a shock to Oliver and Diggle that Barry was dating this giant woman, though they doubted she would be very tall at all standing at their normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call her,\" Oliver said, willing to risk her finding out his secret identity if Barry trusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Spivot, come in. Maintain position and look down on the ground in front of your feet.\" Joe said over the radio, causing a confused Patty to look down at what appeared to be a group of little bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a prank Joe? Why are you telling me to look at these insects when there's a crime scene all around me?\" Patty asked, leaning down to see that the bugs were acting kinda funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insects? Do we look like insects to you?\" Cisco asked, grabbing the radio to talk to Patty. Her face conforming to shock as the realization dawned on her, bending down closer to see that each 'bug' as she referred to them as earlier actually had a human body, they were just miniaturized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty laughed nervously and responded to Cisco's hypothetical question with an honest answer \"I mean, kinda. You can't blame me when you're all so tiny.\" defending herself. \"I suppose the Metahuman that was here did this to you guys, they must have the power to condense matter into a single point, drawing in all your body mass to make you shrink. The only question is how we can reverse this?\" Patty asked, inserting herself into Team Flash's business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we can handle this ourselves. We have friends that can help us return to normal, we just need to get to them first.\" Barry said, still hiding his secret identity for now, not that Patty would be able to see his face while she was still towering over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan on getting back to them without my help? Either let me help throughout the whole process, or you can find your way home yourselves.\" Patty announced, stating a rather bold stance on the problem at hand. Not giving them much of a choice in the matter when considering their other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin, stay put, we've got a new ride home,\" Barry said over comms. \"Okay officer Spivot, you win. But first, we need you to take us back to our friends, you can work with them to restore us to our normal size.\" Barry continued, speaking over the radio to Patty, discussing his voice by vibrating his throat muscles. Still, there was something oddly familiar about it that the giant police officer couldn't quite put her finger on, but she did already have her suspicions that it was someone she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so where are we going?\" Asked Patty, thinking of a way to carry six inch tall people back to her squad car around the corner without raising suspicion from anyone that saw her. Pulling out an evidence collection bag from her chest pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've got to be kidding me,\" Diggle said, not liking the idea of being carried around like trail mix in the giant blonde's breast pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone, get in.\" Patty smiled awkwardly, bending down and opening the bag in front of them, using her free hand to herd them inside one by one before sealing it mostly shut, leaving a small opening for air, but closing it enough so that they couldn't get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take us to Star Labs,\" Joe said as Patty lifted the bag to her face, looking at the tiny people inside before smiling at the tiny Flash, certain that she knew who was inside the red spandex suit. Folding the back once over itself and placing them inside of her left chest pocket for transport...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Last time we saw Supergirl, she was leaving Earth 1 via the breaching device given to her by Cisco Ramon. However, after walking through the breach, she did not return to Earth 38. Instead, due to a crack in the metallic casing, she was bounced through a space between their two Earths. Before she even realized what had occurred, Kara Zor El was spat back out into Barry's universe. Although, her return came at a much smaller size as she exited through a breach the size of a fist above the bed of Iris West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara fell down. Bouncing off Iris's bed and landing a second time in a pile of Iris's clothes set out for the day. Specifically, her destination was one of the cups that made up Iris's Bra. The soft surface absorbed the weight of Kara's body as the dazed Kryptonian rose to her feet. She had a tough time convincing herself otherwise but by the looks of her surrounding Kara was standing inside the cup of a 50-foot long bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tried to climb her way out of the bra cup, but the hills surrounding her were steep. She couldn't grab onto anything to help her scale the massive undergarment. Every time she tried climbing out, Kara only rolled back down the soft padding to the center of the bra cup where she started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's powers were drained, she couldn't fly out or tear through the interior fabric with her strength. This bra might as well have been stitched from strands of kryptonite. \"Fantastic, I land on an earth full of giants without my powers.\" Kara said sarcastically, kicking the spongy wall surrounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Kara was thinking things couldn't get much worse for her the sound of a door opening in the distance caught her attention. She gulped timidly, hoping that whoever owned this bra would see her before she put it on.  Maybe they'd even knock it over so she could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the owner came into view and Kara couldn't believe her eyes, it was Iris. Barry's girlfriend who was still living on her own at the time, she was absolutely gigantic compared to Kara. Like the CatCo media building back in National City, looming over her. She had just come from the bathroom after taking a shower and was about to get dress when Kara began calling out to her. \"Iris, Iris, down here. Look down, please!\" she yelled, straining her voice to go as loud as she could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Iris carried on, not hearing her new friend's voice as she called out for help inside her bra. Soon the African American woman's shadow cast itself over the bed as Iris positioned herself over Kara. Content with her privacy and unaware of Kara's presence in her room Iris allowed her towel to fall around her feet, revealing her naked body to the tiny alien woman. From Kara's point of view, Iris almost looked like a living tower of brown flesh, unable to see much below her belly button. Still, her size was very intimidating, even her usually small breasts appeared to be huge at her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, down here! I'm inside your bra! Please don't put it on!\" Kara yelled upwards, not wanting to meet Iris's boobs face to flesh. A few moments' later Iris's eyes looked down at Kara's location. Did she hear her at that time? Unfortunately not, Kara's luck wasn't so strong today as Iris's hands reached down towards her underwear. Her bra was the first article of clothing she picked up, carrying it up to her breasts with both hands, making escape all but impossible for the tiny Kryptonian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, wait I'm righ...\" Kara tried yelling as she got closer to Iris's face, her cries for help silences as Iris pulled her bra over her breasts. Sealing Kara's entire body against the underside of her right breast. Iris was only an A cup with size 34A cup breasts, but they were still huge compared to the shrunken Kara. Dwarfing her in size 15 or 20 times over each, the two in a constant struggle as Iris adjusted her bra too fit comfortable. Iris's breast flesh sought to fill every inch of her bra, including space currently occupied by Kara's body, while Kara fought back to survive the onslaught of flesh washing over her minuscule form like waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara screamed and pounded against Iris's supple flesh, but the young African American woman didn't feel a thing. Was she really so small that nothing she did would get the attention of her new friend? Meanwhile, Iris continued to get dressed. Her breasts swaying and bouncing in multiple directions as she moved around. Her flesh was now literally assaulting Kara inside her bra cup, bouncing off her inch tall body with the intent to crush the Girl of Steel like a little ant. She only a moment to catch her breath between each attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the pressure of Iris's tit on her body increased tenfold as she bent down to pick up the panties of her bed. Second, her breasts rebounded two times, only to fall back on Kara with equal force to what she'd felt earlier. Afterward, she experienced a brief reprieve as Iris pulled her panties from the floor to her waist. The weight slowly became less severe until Iris rose quickly to her full height at the end, causing her breast to hop inside her bra cup before falling back onto Kara's body, similar to a guillotine. In that time she thought to escape, rolling onto her stomach before Iris's breast pushed on her body from behind. She tried to stand her ground against the mass of flesh, digging her hands and knees into the padding below her body. But as the breast hit her foundation gave way to its immense weight, pinning Kara face first into the soft fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, unaware of what was happening to Supergirl inside her bra Iris continued getting dressed as if nothing was amiss. She turned around for a moment to admire herself in a tall mirror, checking out her own shapely rear end for a moment before continuing to get dressed. Next, she turned around and sat on top of her bed, the soft material of her mattress absorbing the blows from her butt's full weight. Meanwhile, Kara did the same for Iris's breasts as with each bounce the milk chocolate brown mammaries slammed onto her back only to rise up for a short time before coming back down. For Kara, this was equivalent to getting a back massage from a monster truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, after putting on her socks and pulling her pants halfway up her thighs' Iris stood back up and pulled her pants up with three tugs. Her breasts rose up, before coming down with a heavy *smack* on Kara's back. Then it lifted off her once more, before coming down with an equally powerful *smack*. Finally, Kara thought she had the timing just right, she could roll over closer to Iris's cleavage and be one step closer to escaping the young woman's bra. Her boobs rose as Kara predicted, allowing her to roll over onto her back just in time for the third *smack* to hit her body from the front side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last Kara was able to catch a break as Iris only had a shirt left to dress herself in. She effortlessly rose the article of close over her head and slid it down over her torso with ease. Kara hoped Iris was getting dressed for a meeting with Barry, or going anywhere that would allow her to get some help in returning to normal. Where has Iris been getting dressed to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The gym, Iris has dressed in Yoga pants, a free-flowing shirt and dawns a pair of athletic sneakers for her morning workout routine. Little does she know that she'll be working out with an unwilling partner during each exercise. Starting with a 3-mile jog on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Star Labs, Iris has dressed in a pair of jeans, a casual tee shirt, and a mini jacket. Heading over too Star Labs with Supergirl in tow to get a potential scoop on today's Metahuman activities for her job. Will she finally feel Kara after having time to wake up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Bed, Iris has dressed in her PJ's and is going to bed for the night. Hopefully, Kara won't suffer too badly as she falls asleep. With Iris sleeping soundly, the tiny alien woman might even get a chance to escape. Or will she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iris awoke to the sound of a loud door bang, rolling onto her back thinking Barry had just left their apartment, most likely in a hurry to save someone or stop a Metahuman attack on Central City. She threw her arms up over her head, stretching her back and rolled her neck after having a weird dream. She imagined that the rest of Team Flash had come up with a plan to safely hide her from Savitar on a different Earth until they could take him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes slowly at first, though they quickly began to widen as Iris caught sight of a gigantic pair of light blue eyes magnified by a pair of glasses looking down at her. Terrified she sat up, crawling back in a state of panicked fear as they stared down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey! Iris it's okay, you're safe!\" Boomed a familiar voice, nearly deafening Iris as this giant woman's lips parted to reveal perfect white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris froze as she heard the woman's voice, there was no mistaking it. That was Kara Danvers voice, or as she was known better on her Earth Supergirl. But what was she doing here, and why was she so gigantic. Getting a better look at her face from a distance Iris could tell in an instant, it was definitely Kara looking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara! What the heck is going on here? Why are you so huge? Please tell me I'm dreaming.\" Iris said, trying to regain some composure after having just woke up to the sight of the giantess superheroine. Kara was already a being with Godlike powers at her normal size. Now she was literally the size of a god compared to Iris with the same powers enhanced a hundredfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sincerely sorry about this Iris, please know that none of this was my idea. Your friends asked me to do this.\" Kara began to explain. Her voice filled with remorse as she leaned over the young African American woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about what exactly? What did they ask you to do?\" Iris asked, wanting some answers as to why Kara was a three hundred foot tall giant and what that had to do with her. Kara's answer to Iris's question started with the Kryptonian woman standing up to her full height over Iris. She appeared to be standing on some kind of tall flat surface that reached the level of Kara's thighs. She was dressed in civilian clothing, a white button-up shirt with blue polka dots, and a blue mini skirt matching the polka dots of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They asked me to take care of you for the next few months. They injected you with this formula that knocked you out temporarily and would also shrink you over time before you woke up. Honestly, I was pretty worried you were going to shrink even smaller than you are now.\" Kara explained while Iris took in all of her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. By the looks of things Iris had shrunk down and was on Kara's Earth now, inside of her apartment. On her right side, she noticed an everyday lamp at Kara's bedside, standing taller than some national monuments. While behind her stood eight pillows split up into two rows of four, each approximately sixty feet tall and sixty feet wide. This lead Iris to the conclusion that she was currently standing on top of Kara's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how tiny am I?\" Iris asked as she continued gauging the size of everything in Kara's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about an inch tall. I'm very sorry about this. They told me it was necessary that you remain tiny in case this Savitar guy came looking for you on different Earths.\" Kara announced in a somber tone, wanting to help her friend but also wanting to keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's ridiculous! I already told them I wasn't going anywhere, bring me back to my Earth right now!\" Iris yelled, stomping her feet on Kara's bed as she unintentionally took out her frustrations on the Alien woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, I really can't do that. But I promise you things won't be so bad living here with me.\" Kara said reassuringly, trying to bolster her confidence in her friends' ability to keep Iris safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u203d How the hell am I supposed to live like this\u203d How, do you think I'll survive like this\u203d Do you think I'm going to live in a dollhouse or something for the next three months, or am I just supposed to roam around your apartment looking for food like a mouse\u203d Looking over my shoulder every time you have guests over to make sure someone doesn't accidentally step on me!\" Iris exploded, venting her many complaints and concerns about being so tiny compared to the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara simply smiled for a moment, ready to tackle each of Iris's worries head-on in an attempt to put her friend's mind at ease. Pausing for a moment to think of the many ways in which this experience could be a positive one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't own any Dollhouses. I Kinda burned- or melted my last one down testing out my heat vision when I was eleven. Anyways you're my friend, no way I'd let you wander around for food. Luckily at your size, it won't cost too much too shop for you at least. Oh, and Friday nights are Ice cream night. I'll take home a large sundae and I can always bring home a spoonful of whatever you like.\" Kara joked, attempting to lift Iris's spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily it seemed to do the job, she could see Iris beginning to crack a smile. She realized Kara was only asked to help and it's not like it was her idea to make her this small. \"Also you don't have to worry about anyone stepping on you. At that size, your body is basically indestructible, a side effect from the serum used to shrink you.\" Kara added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can do movies. I have a flat screen in the living room and an old model car you could sit in. Like you're going to one of those old drive-in movies.\" Kara suggested, pointing out what appeared to be a toy 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air on her shelf. Which, oddly enough looked to be a perfect size for Iris to sit inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Maybe I was being a bit dramatic, living here might not be so bad after all.\" Iris said, beginning to come around to the idea of being this tiny. Kara might have been a goddess living among human beings, but she was also one of the sweetest people she'd ever met. She'd never do anything to purposely hurt or endanger her health and wellbeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little jealous of Kara at first too be honest, she and Barry had so much in common that Iris didn't share in any way. She remembered Barry introducing them and the excitement he had as he described Kara and what she was like. Iris thought of this as a good opportunity for her to get to know Kara as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. I have so many fun things planned for us!\" Kara announced excitedly, jumping with joy as she got Iris to change her mind about being tiny. Deep down she probably realized that she was much safer at her current size than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara gets an alert on her phone, there's an out of control train heading for a cliff and Supergirl is the only one who can save them from certain death. Not wanting to leave Iris alone Kara pulls off her clothes and quickly stuffs Iris down the back of her panties for safe keeping. Apologizing in advance before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara insists on watching a movie and invites Alex over for girls night(Not telling her about Iris). She then picks up the toy car mentioned earlier, droping Iris in the driver's seat and making some joke about how she could probably get her friend Winn to make it operational for Iris. Kara then brings Iris to the living room and puts the car on the couch while she goes back to her room to change into PJ's and find a movie. Shortly after a tired Alex enters and moves straight for the couch to sit down, choosing where Kara left Iris in the car. How will Iris react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A knock at the door prompts Kara to hide Iris between her boobs, down her shirt after using her X-ray vision to see that it's her friend Lena Luthor. Unable to explain why Kara Danvers would have a 1-inch tall woman, she decides to keep Iris a secret from her friend. But when Lena asks Kara to join her for Dinner she can't say no, leaving Iris between her boobs for the night as she goes out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Brrrr, brrrr* Kara's phone suddenly buzzed, she'd just gotten an alert. There was a runaway train sliding off the tracks across town. It's passengers heading for a dead end, and Supergirl was the only one who could get there fast enough to save them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" Kara thought out loud, she had to go save those people. That much was obvious, but she couldn't just leave Iris here by herself. She promised the member's of Team Flash that she would keep an eye on Iris at all times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she'd never really thought about how she'd bring Iris out into the field with her while carrying out her duties as Supergirl. With lives on the line and time running out Kara decided it was better to act fast and ask for forgiveness later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry about this Iris, but I don't have any other choice.\" Kara announced, plucking Iris off the surface of her bed. Iris tried to squirm and break free of Kara's fingers, but the giantess Kryptonian was too powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, wait! What are you doing?\" asked Iris, as the alien woman brought her above her massive backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara?\" Iris asked again, hoping her new friend wasn't planning what she thought was about to happen. However, with no time to answer back, Kara simply remained silent. Pulling her skirt and underwear back, she revealed two enormously round and perfectly toned buttcheeks to the shrunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, Kara plea-ahh!\" was all Iris could get out before Kara reluctantly released her grip, allowing Iris to fall to the mercy of her giant asscheeks. She could feel a light blow landing on her butt as Iris bounced off the surface of one cheek and into another, the soft mounds of flesh absorbing the tiny woman's weight for a brief moment before striking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven Iris's tiny size in comparison to the Girl of Steel's ass, it didn't take very look for her to find her way down Kara's buttcrack, nestled safely between her rear cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara, not wanting to waste any more time quickly changed into her Supergirl outfit in the blink of an eye. One moment Iris's view of the outside world through Kara's white panties was bright, quickly turning dark as Kara got dressed in her red leather skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough her transformation from Kara into Supergirl was complete, and she was ready to save the day. Trying not to think about the tiny woman stuffed between her buttcheeks, Kara took three steps toward the window before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was a relatively simple task for Kara, it was another matter entirely for Iris. With the first step of Kara's right foot, her left buttcheek began to attack Iris, trying to fill in the loss of mass. However, the next step was perhaps even worse than that as Kara stepped forward with left foot. Her right buttcheek reacted to this change by steamrolling over Iris's body, trying to reclaim it's original form while her left cheek lunged forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the third and most disastrous of Kara's steps forward, Iris was drawn further into Kara buttcrack as she got down on one knee for takeoff. Lunging before she jumped out her window Kara instinctively clenched her cheeks, not having the luxury of sparing Iris the humiliation of being fully engulfed by her encroaching asscheeks. She could only make a note to apologize to her later, another item on her growing list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Iris struggled within the deepest depths of Kara's ass, surrounded by flesh at all angles. Her movements completely restricted. She found it difficult to breathe as Kara to took to the skies, reaching an altitude of 1,000 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying between skyscrapers, she couldn't help but look down at the ground below. From way up here the people below looked like mere specks, much smaller than Iris. Even the cars that lined the streets of National City look minuscule from her point of view, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was nothing more than a momentary distraction for Kara as she felt Iris kicking and screaming against her soft skin. Truthfully, she was dealing with an internal state of panic. Her ass? Out of all the places she could have put Iris to keep her safe, why did she choose her ass? Furthermore, how would she tell her friend  Barry that she'd dropped his girlfriend in her ass while out on a mission?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Iris was simultaneously asking herself the same question. Sure she was upset with Kara, she was furious. But at the same time, she couldn't help but see things from Kara's perspective. Much like Barry, Kara protected her city and her world from threats of all shapes and sizes. Which came with a high level of responsibility, making it hard for Iris to stay mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the anger she felt towards Kara was nothing when compared to the insignificance she perceived when compared to the Girl of Steel. She'd been an inch tall for less than a day, and yet already she'd been reduced to this. No bigger than an assortment of lint rolling around between Kara's asscheeks. It was humiliating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris continued to fight against Kara's flesh, hoping she'd have some spare time to stop and let her out of her panty prison. But no such luck was in the shrunken woman's future as Supergirl carried on. With that said, Iris's struggles did not go unnoticed as Kara felt a tickling sensation coming from her rear end. Kick after kick, Iris's many blows did nothing but tickle the Kryptonian's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara snickered for a moment upon noticing this, before suppressing her giggles. It just slipped out, before she even released what was happening she'd already laughed a little bit. As the blows subsided, Kara hoped that Iris hadn't taken note of her laughter. The last thing she needed was her tiny friend believing that she'd intentionally been laughing at her situation. Unfortunately, Iris was quite aware of Kara's little outburst as her whole body moved at the moment she supressed her giggling. Which, did little to help Iris feel any less significant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kara spots the train racing forward at over two hundred miles per hour heading towards a cliff. \"Why are they always heading for a cliff?\" she asked, swooping down into action with only seconds to spare. Hoping Iris's invulnerability to being crushed would hold out Kara landed on the tracks in front of the train, bracing to hold it back. For Iris, this meant big trouble as every muscle in her body began to tighten at a moments notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG, CRACK CRACK CRACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Iron train collided with the Girl of Steel, pushing her back as the tracks broke behind the heels of her boots. She dug into the ground with her feet knowing it would cause Iris extreme discomfort, realizing she would need a considerable amount of her strength to stop the runaway locomotive before it reached the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was lucky, being hit by a train was nothing compared to what Iris was enduring at the mercy of the superheroines backside. The pressure of cheeks clasp increasing a hundredfold in the blink of an eye. Iris becoming so entombed in the blonde woman's butt flesh that she couldn't even wiggle her fingers or curl her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried screaming out in pain, but Kara's ass muffled her pleas for mercy before they even left her lips. She couldn't even hear herself cry as Kara continued holding back the train. Being crushed to death in the ass equivalent of a trash compactor might have been preferred to enduring the pain. It had only been a single second and Iris was utterly miserable. Next time Kara needed help hiding from an evil bad guy, Iris had little doubts about suggesting her ass as a form of payback. Wanting to see how the Girl of Steel held up during an intense and long workout at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this brief fantasy came to a literal grinding halt as the weight placed on Iris by Kara's ass seemed to double yet again. Outside of the Kryptonian's panties, Kara had started using more of her stregth. The train to beginning to slow down at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this also put Iris at her breaking point. Trapped in total darkness and surrounded by warm flesh on all sides her oxygen had begun to run low. On top of which her bones had finally started cracking under the pressure of Kara's rear muscles. She wasn't entirely sure if she was about to die or if it had already happened, she just wanted it to be over. Luckily, she would survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before passing out from a combination of factors nearly responsible for Iris's death, she could feel Kara's ass beginning to loosen up at the train came to a stop. Grateful for her longevity she breathed a sigh of relief, as did the many passengers aboard the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Supergirl!\"<br>\r\n\"You saved us!\"<br>\r\n\"You're our hero Supergirl!\" they cried, praising her heroic actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kara could only focus on one person at that moment, looking over her shoulder at her butt. She couldn't feel Iris moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well she couldn't just take a tiny woman out of her ass in front of all these people Kara quickly took off, assuring the survivor's that help would arrive shortly. She launched into the sky, taking off for a location where she could safely check up on Iris's wellbeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she go? Back to her Apartment or the DEO headquarters to meet up with her adoptive sister Alex Danvers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara goes back to her apartment, taking Iris out of her panties and placing her back on her bed. Iris is furious and erupts with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara heads to the DEO, worrying that she might have hurt Iris while saving the train. However, Iris says she feels fine now and only wants to go back to Kara's when an alien attack forces her to leave Iris with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara heads home, taking Iris out of her underwear and placing her on the couch to apologize. Iris is very understanding at first but when Lena Luthor makes a surprise visit Kara is required to hide her again. This time under her butt by sitting on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally Kara would head straight for the DEO after an incident like this and see whether there was any villainous activity was responsible for the train's malfunction. That, or if it was simply an accident due to negligence on the city's part. But she was worried about Iris's health and didn't really want to reveal her to the others just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, it would save her from a lecture form J'onn or more likely Alex about taking on responsibilities she wasn't prepared to handle. She knew she could keep a tiny person safe. It's not like Iris was a hamster or something like she had was a kid (and even then, she had only accidentally spattered it against the ceiling).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith confidence and her blatant mental denial intact Kara zipped into her apartment, dug around in the back of her panties (thinking \"Wow, Iris really ended up deep back there\") before pulling out the shrunken woman and placing her gently on her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, can you hear me? I'm really sorry that you had to experience that especially so soon into this little adventure. I was worried you might get hurt while I was gone and my suit doesn't have any pockets like Oliver's so it seemed like the best option. The only others were my bra, which would have been similar except you'd have a jello mountain crush you or my boot, which would mean dropping a Kryptonian mountain on you combined with the smell of my feet. My species still sweat despite everything else that we can and can't do.\" Kara sighs, kneeling over the tiny woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is that I shouldn't have put you in my butt without asking you. That wasn't right and there were so many better plans I could have come up with but I didn't simply because there was an emergency and I had to get there as quickly as I could. Please say something Iris! Oh, Rao please don't say I killed her!\" Kara was chewing her lip and her eyes were getting misty, worried she'd ruined everything after less than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris lay there, staring up at the ceiling high above, at first she'd remained silent in order for her brain to process everything that had been done to her as well as hold back what she wanted to say to the idiotic alien who thought her ass was a good hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it quickly became clear Kara had also come to this revelation, so she then just listened to her as she said what she felt needed to be said and saw once more that Kara was just like Barry: She needed to help people, sometimes to the point she doesn't think of her own (or in this case Iris's) safety and well being. Plus even as a giant Kara's sad face was impossible to remain mad at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she sighs deeply and speaks (though it is slightly croaky) \"It's fine Kara, I'm okay and I know your intentions were pure. It really wasn't that bad back there at all.\" Of course, it was actually pretty terrible, but Iris could tell Kara was sorry and didn't want to make her feel worse for no reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably work out a better system for the future though. If I was in there much longer I might have gotten pulled all the way in.\" Iris said, though she never wanted to be anywhere near Kara butt at her size ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara immediately looked relieved, glad to hear she hadn't tormented Iris as much as she had thought. Smiling, Kara nods and says \"Yes of course Iris. Just give me a moment to change out of these clothes.\" zipping off and returning once more in her Kara Danvers clothes, even having the fake glasses perched on her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, having Supergirl hovering over you probably didn't make this any less intimidating. But this is okay right?\" She asks, giving a little spin as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris nods as she sits up, laughing at the giant blonde. \"Yeah it's all good Kara, though you're right, Supergirl was a bit much for a person of my size, Hell it's probably a bit much for normal sized people at times too\" Kara nods, chuckling to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get that a lot, but you have nothing to fear, Supergirl won't be putting you under her skirt anytime soon and Kara Danvers will be keeping you safe. She's a Lena Luthor approved hero after all,\" she smirks in a way that shows whatever she said meant more to her than Iris, obviously some kind of in-joke with this Lena woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by thought itself the door of Kara's apartment clicks open and high heels are heard passing through the doorway, setting off a series of events that also lacked forethought. For Kara, it was that she needed to hide Iris as she still hadn't told Lena the Supergirl secret, so there was no way for her to explain a tiny human in her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, In order to hide Iris where there was no chance of her being seen Kara had to act drastically. She turned around and drops her ass down on top of her, Kara's right cheek pinning her to the couch. Kara winced as the felt the impact, having meant for Iris to end up between her cheeks as she had earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shook off the pained look from her face though to help keep her secret in front of Lena. And besides, Iris had said it wasn't so bad under there right? And Kara figured Iris was certainly grateful to Kara for keeping her safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little time under her Kryptonian booty was really a small price to pay for safety from Savitar. Plus, and Kara hated to admit this to herself, she actually rather enjoyed the way Iris felt squirming against her cheeks. Maybe if Iris got used to it, her butt could become a more frequent storage location for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Iris it was a little worse, as she saw the deer in headlights expression on Kara's face before she began to move, and even started frantically waving and yelling up at Kara: \"Kara wait there's plenty of other opt-\" she began, trailing off as Kara's moon-sized ass dropped down towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris knew she wasn't strong enough yet to be able to even try to evade the impact, she just lay back and hoped she could relax her body enough to reduce the pain she knew was coming. This time instead of being chewed up by Kara's ass crack, Kara's right cheek dropped straight down onto her, pushing her into it before depressing the very cushion and causing Iris to slide into the direct center of Kara's butt cheek, where she experienced the full weight of Kara's alien buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena you're back\" Kara squeaks as her best friend enters the room, grinning widely as Lena kisses both of her cheeks, still clearly using the social greetings from her latest business trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, did you forget we had plans for today? You said that since today was the only day I didn't have booked full of business meetings this month we should spend time together.\" the Irish ravenette explained, and Kara's eyes widened as she remembered saying that nearly 3 weeks ago \"You forgot didn't you?\" Lena asks, sounding disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No.\" Kara scoffs, trying to play it off. \"I just wasn't sure you'd actually be able to keep it free, so I didn't put much thought into what we'd actually be doing\" she admitted, shifting in her seat and then instantly regretting it as she remembered she was grinding her ass cheek across the tiny Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are the girls going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) They decide to just eat in to avoid the paparazzi, and when Kara gets up to help her to make their food, Iris comes with her, having adhered to her butt via pressure and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Lena has already booked them a table at the new Italian place on the other side of town, Kara smiles and accepts, then as she stands up, grabs Iris from under her cheek and puts her in her shirt pocket, where she'll hopefully avoid being crushed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Kara suggests they stay in and watch Netflix, as Lena is behind on some of the series Kara has recommended her, (Such as OUAT, seems like something both would watch) shifting over so that the CEO could sit with her. This has the side effect of freeing Iris from Kara's butt only for Lena's to take its place, though unlike Kara's buns of steel Lena is human so it's softer, larger and has a lot more give to it than Supergirl's.</span></div></div>",

Without even thinking about it, Kara slid to the side, realizing too late that she had left Iris exposed. She caught a brief glimpse of the shrunken girl in the crater her butt had left behind, but soon she was obscured by the tremendous skirt clad derriere of Lena as it plopped down next to her. Kara winced as the CEO settled into place wondering if Lena's larger butt was better or worse for the shrunken girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Kara?\" Lena asked, confused by Kara's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I'm fine! Let's just get the show started.\" Kara said, trying to downplay her stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was certainly not fine. She had been relieved of the weight of Kara's butt, only to have a curvy Fortune 500 CEO drop her ass on top of her. Lena was wearing a black skirt that tightly hugged her hips, and Iris was pinned between that and the couch, right in the center of her left butt cheek. This was a very different experience than Kara's butt. Rather than the muscular buttock of a super-heroic Kryptonian, she was now under the weight of a soft and yielding human butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena flicked on a movie with no objection from Kara, but Kara could barely focus on the TV. All she could think about was the fact that Iris was trapped under her friend. She had never put a lot of thought into it before, but Lena's ass was certainly formidable. And now Iris was pinned beneath it, trapped while her Lena was none the wiser. She eyed Lena out of the corner of her eye, noticing every shift of her weight and every twist in her seat, knowing that Iris was living those movements up close and personal. And that was not all Kara was feeling. To her surprise, she was experiencing a feeling that was relatively rare for the girl of steel: jealousy. She didn't want Iris to be suffering under a giant booty, but if Iris had to experience anyone's butt, she thought it ought to be her own. Kara had actually really enjoyed the feeling of Iris fighting against her butt cheeks, and was now somewhat missing it. Meanwhile, Lena was now drowning Iris under her butt without even appreciating the tiny girl's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was also certainly not appreciating Lena's movements. Every wiggle and adjustment of the CEO's hips meant dragging her giant soft butt cheek across Iris. As Lena's, weight settled on Iris, Iris slowly began to sink into Lena's cheek, the soft flesh forming an almost mold around the sides of her shrunken body. So when Lena slid, Iris was dragged along for the ride, pushed and pulled by butt flesh on all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the movie, when Kara was finally starting to calm down, Lena's phone vibrated off the edge of the coffee table. \"Damn, probably work again.\" Lena muttered, standing up. Kara immediately looked down at the seat, planning to use the opportunity to snatch away Iris. However, the seat was completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lena bent over to pick up her phone, Kara found the missing girl. She was stuck to Lena's ass like a starfish, now facing outwards after all Lena's shifting. The incognito superhero and the shrunken girl were staring directly at each other, while Lena remained none the wiser about the shrunken girl mounted on her ass. Unsure how to proceed, Kara gave the shrunken girl a weak smile and mouthed \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris had a lot more to say. \"Kara get me out of this righ-\" Iris began, only to be cut off by the WUMPH sound of Lena falling back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear something Kara?\" Lena asked, looking around the room and twisting her ass in her seat as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Nothing.\" Kara said sheepishly, biting her lip in stress. She'd have to have a plan next time, otherwise Lena might leave with Iris still on her ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris could feel just how powerless she was without Kara's help as Lena twisted her butt into the seat, seemingly \"rubbing in\" how hopeless her situation was. And the fact that Kara was not helping her was making her angry. This whole situation was Kara's fault, and now she was just letting her friend sit her fat ass down on her without doing anything about it. Iris assumed that this meant this Lena girl who was sitting on her didn't know Kara was Supergirl, meaning she had no way to explain a shrunken girl from another dimension. Still, she wished Kara was creative enough to come up with something. But since that wasn't happening, Iris decided to take matters into her own hands. She began to frantically kick her legs against the giant ass cheek, trying to alert the CEO of her presence. She didn't care if Kara's friend found out her secret identity, all she cared about was not being squished under a butt any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Iris's credit, this did get Lena's attention. Unfortunately, it was not in the way Iris wanted. Lena interpreted the tiny kicking as little more than an itch to be eradicated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena lifted up her butt a little bit, allowing Iris to gasp in some oxygen. When she saw Lena's manicured fingers slide under her butt, she practically squealed with joy, ready to be plucked away from the endless pressure of Lena's butt. Unfortunately, that wasn't what Lena had in mind. Lena's fingernails came down right next to Iris, poking into the supple butt flesh she was stuck to. Then they advanced on Iris like a line of football players going for a tackle. Iris screamed \"No! Please!\" as she realized Lena just thought of her an itch, but only Kara's super hearing caught these words. And she didn't do anything as Lena's fingers rolled Iris along her butt, bringing her down towards the giant girl's thigh. The fingers lifted up again, and took a few more passes over the area Iris had been, before retreating, leaving Iris alone beneath the butt. It hung in the air for another terrifying moment, then dropped down on top of her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was now further under Lena's butt, and under much more pressure as a result. The doughy cheek she had gotten familiar with had been replaced by the more muscular thighs of a woman who spent all day in heels. She didn't dare squirm though. She was too insignificant to he found, little more than an inch on a CEO's ass. She would need Supergirl to get out of this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, their movie ended, and Kara looked expectantly at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd best be going. Have to work early tomorrow.\" Lena said, stretching her arms over her head. As she did so, she leaned back in her seat, as if to allow her butt to assert one final dominance over the shrunken girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris is stuck to Lena's butt as leaves, and Kara is unable to retrieve her. Supergirl is forced to secretly tail Lena as she heads home, looking for an opportunity to retrieve the tiny girl before Lena finds her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris is in the left in the crater of Lena's ass, and goes unnoticed by the CEO as she leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Lena glances down at her seat as she leaves, and notices the tiny Iris. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lena smiles as she stands up, letting her spine click back into place and allowing Kara to see Iris still plastered on her thick butt cheeks. Looking over her shoulder the ravenette raises an eyebrow \"Everything okay Kara, is there something on my butt?\" she asks, her hand reaching down and doing a mix of squeezing and patting down of her right cheek, causing the blonde to squeak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything's fine Lena, you're perfect as always\" Kara stutters before she could get anywhere near Iris, glad to at least see Lena smile before she hugs her, the blond resisting the urge to peel Iris off Lena's butt right now, as it would require putting her hands on Lena's ass and she didn't really have any excuse that would work for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in the end, she had to let Lena leave, her hips swing ever so slightly as Kara mouths <i>'Hang on, I'll get you as soon as I can'</i> to Iris, even at this distance she could tell Iris' expression was along the lines of <i>'Like I can do anything else'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the lateness of the day, her super suit would stand out too much for what she was planning, so she dug into the back of her closet and retrieved the all black 'Dark Supergirl' suit she wore when the Red K was turning her brain to mush. If she remained in shadowed areas, was high enough and moved at a high enough speed for people not to actually know what they saw she should be able to tail Lena without the (understandably) paranoid woman suspecting a thing. Also forgoing the cape, Kara floats out her window and begins looking for her friend and her charge who was currently stuck to said friend's plush rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't looking up for Iris as Lena had decided to walk home today, she guessed with everything else going on that people were too intimidated to do more than glare at the Irish CEO, as well as mutter behind her back. Unlike previous instances, though Iris was praying not to be released from Lena's butt, at least not while walking down a busy street where she'd probably last 5 seconds after escaping Lena before getting stepped on and turned into a bloody pulp. It was because of this Iris was doing something she hadn't expected to do in a million years, she was clinging to Lena's rear like her life depends, though she needn't have bothered as the shrunken woman was pretty stuck to the youngest Luthor's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather relaxing stroll from Kara's apartment to the building her family secretly owned later Lena breathes deeply, only tapping her foot as she waited for the elevator to bring her to the penthouse, though as it was her left foot Iris felt every tap from her minimal safety of Lena's jiggling left ass cheek. Finally she entered the room and collapsed into the seat in her study, lying almost bonelessly in it and allowing the memory foam cushion to adjust to her still growing arse, she knew it was getting bigger and Kara had been staring, serves the blond right it was her fault with all that food she brings over, she was weak when it came to the girl, always going along with her every plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should flirt harder next time, no that would scare her away and then where would you be? Alone and friendless, again\" Lena sighs, running her fingers through her long hair and groaning, she had a lot of work to be done and not enough time to do it, but staying here when she was tired sounded so much better than paperwork right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Iris saw Lena's chair she knew it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, but what did happen was how she imagined (and given the amount of time under asses she's experienced since getting shrunk she has thought about it) it would feel during Kara's earlier rescue if her ass had been that of a human's rather than the muscles like reinforced titanium of a Kryptonian's: hills of jiggling mass colliding, covering and smothering the tiny human, luckily the seat was still adjusting to Lena's form, or else the connection may have essentially sealed her into a tomb of butt flesh and foam, as it happened there was enough of a gap in shifting foam Iris could still breathe, even if it was difficult with her currently limited lung capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena finally feels something under her ass she is pretty sure isn't an itch this time, pinching Iris between her fingers and taking her out from under her. As metas and shrink rays aren't really a thing on this Earth, Lena comes to what is the most logical conclusion for Earth 38, that Iris is a tiny alien. She then gets annoyed as she has enough to deal with (as the whole Luthor thing makes her understandably unpopular with the aliens of National City), without the little bastards invading her private space [Whether that means her penthouse, or her pelvic region, up to the writer, either will do] and decides to vent her displeasure on someone who won't be missed or noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Lena stands to go to the bathroom, luckily leaving Iris in the chair, dazed and in pain. This is the moment Kara was waiting for, slipping in and retrieving her friend, then leaving as stealthily as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) As is common for Lena at this point there is an attempt on her life, this time with a bomb in her home. Kara rescues her, but also while picking her up, cups Lena's rear and palms Iris, dropping her into her boot until she can get back to her apartment and they can discuss safe travel options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately, when Lena finally stood up, Iris remained on the seat, gasping in the newly available air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was immensely relieved as she watched Lena's ass rise up and away from her, feeling pretty confident that she had endured her last ass of the day. Her view of the ascending ass was cut off suddenly as Kara's hand closed around her, and she was once again in (somewhat) safe hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara breathed a sigh of relief as she felt Iris squirming in her fist, glad to have Iris back. As Lena began walking to the door, Kara gently placed Iris down on the arm of the couch, both because it was out of Lena's sight now that she was far enough away, and because it was somewhere no one would possibly sit. Kara mouthed \"be right back\" at Iris before scurrying after Lena to show her out. Iris was just happy to have a break from being sat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about that Iris! I didn't know she was coming and I totally panicked!\" Kara said as she returned, apologizing profusely as she looked at the battered tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, it's ok Kara. Just please don't leave me out in the open again.\" Iris said, too exhausted to complain. All she wanted was to go to sleep. \"Can we just go to bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course.\" Kara said, relieved Iris wasn't unhappy with her. The superhero gently placed Iris in her palm and walked slowly down the hall to her bedroom, keeping her hand level all the while. When she arrived, she placed Iris gently down on top of her dresser, before stepping into her closet to change into pajamas. She came out smiling, dressed in a matching pajama top and bottom. Iris couldn't help but laugh at the sight, knowing that seeing the almighty Supergirl in her PJs was probably a rare sight. Kara smiled down at her, glad to see she wasn't still upset about the butt barrage she had endured throughout the day. When Kara got to the dresser, she opened the top drawer and pulled out a fresh sock. placing in down in front of Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your sleeping bag.\" Kara said with a sheepish smile. \"I figured it might get cold overnight, and you needed something soft to sleep on. I promise it's very clean and doesn't smell at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... ok.\" Iris said, a little unnerved by the idea of crawling into one of Supergirl's socks. \"I guess this will work... as long as you promise not to accidentally put it on in the morning while I am still inside.\" Iris was reluctant to mention this point, but after the day she had had, she needed some guarantees Kara wasn't going to forget about her and condemn her to a day as toe jam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not Iris! I would never...\" Kara began, before stopping to consider just how forgetful she had been throughout the day. She really had no business saying she would never make a mistake like that. \"Well you're right, I've been forgetful today, but I wear heels without socks when I go to work, so I won't even put socks on tomorrow either way.\" Kara explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough to pacify Iris for now. \"Alright then, goodnight Kara.\" Iris said, smiling weakly as she approached the entrance to the sock. She slid into it just like a sleeping bag, albeit much bigger than any one she had ever encountered. It was soft and clean though, and far away from giant butts, and that was good enough for Iris. She was asleep in seconds. Kara smiled, relieved, then crawled into bed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kara lay in bed, thinking about the events of the day, she knew she needed a better system to deal with Iris than frantically hiding her all the time. She also knew that she really liked keeping Iris between her butt cheeks, and that Iris had said being back there was not so bad, except for worrying about getting pulled in too deep. An idea began to form in her mind as she lay in bed, and suddenly she was very excited to go to work tomorrow. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, ready to tell Iris her plan in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris woke up to the feeling of Kara's fingers grabbing her. She was moving at superspeed, and fingers seemed to be everywhere around her at once, bending and twisting and... knotting? All of a sudden Iris felt a rope of some kind around her chest and arms, holding her down. Then, in a flash, it was over, and Iris lay tied up on the table, deeply unhappy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Kara? Why am I tied down!\" Iris asked, already unhappy with how this new day was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's all part of my new plan! Keeping you in my butt yesterday was a challenge because you got pulled in so deep that my cheeks really did a number on you. And of course, we wouldn't want you to go any deeper than that.\" Kara said, looking red faced at the thought of Iris anywhere near her butt hole. \"And then with Lena, you got pinned under one of her cheeks, which is a lot of weight to have bearing down on you. Which is why I came up with a better solution.\" Rather than explain further, Kara held up a mirror, allowing Iris to get a good look at where she was: tied down in the middle of the back of a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tied me into your panties! How does that help?!\" Iris yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're tied in the middle so you won't get squished under one of my big cheeks. And since you're tied down, you won't be able to sink too deep, unless I get a really intense wedgie. And even then I could easily pull you out without finding a private place.\" Kara explained. This may have sounded like an improvement to Kara, but for Iris it still meant being cheek to cheeks with a superheroine's butt all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Iris, this is going to be way better. But I don't have time to keep chatting now, I've got to get to work.\" Kara said, lowering the panties to her feet. Iris realized Kara was already in heels and a skirt, having only neglected to put on a pair of panties. But that's because <i>she</i> was the panties now, tasked only with keeping a superhero's butt covered. She wondered how often people caught a glimpse of Supergirl's panties as she flew overhead in her costume skirt. These thoughts were replaced with the familiar terror of an approaching butt as Kara began to pull up the panties, sending Iris on a quickly rising tower of terror ride, ending only with the familiar embrace of Kara's cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fairness to Kara, this was better than the first time Iris found herself in Supergirl's butt. Being tied down to the panties kept her from getting twisted around, and she didn't have to worry about getting pulled deeper because she was secured to Kara's panties. But the muscular glutes squeezing her on either side were just as oppressive as always, and the fact that Iris had been reduced to Kara's butt lint still made her feel incredibly insignificant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara bit her lip happily at the familiar feeling of Iris squirming in her butt. The truth was, she had really missed having Iris back there. And now that Iris was back between her cheeks, Kara couldn't wait to get to work. She wasn't sure what the day would bring, but her squirming distraction in the back of her panties would certainly keep it interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess it's time to head out.\" Kara said contently, before strolling out of her room, heels clicking and cheeks rolling with every step, chewing on her developing wedgie and its tiny passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Follow Iris and Kara to Catco. Will Kara's day be a lot of sitting and typing, or will she have some interviews to do around the city? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Time skip: Savitar is defeated, and Iris is returned to her Earth, choosing not to recount her butt based experiences with Kara. But when Reign proves a near deadly challenge for Kara, Alex takes a page from Team Flash's book and shrinks Kara, sending her to Earth 1 for safety. But will she be safe in the hands (or ass) of Iris?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kara arrived at the CatCo Worldwide Media building several minutes late that morning, so focused on enjoying her new butt toy Iris that she lost track of time in the process. For some reason, she thoroughly enjoyed feeling Iris's tiny body struggling against her powerful rear end. She knew it was wrong, but nobody else on her Earth even knew Iris was there to stop her, plus she was keeping her safe from Savitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed towards the Elevator Kara took great joy in using her supersonic hearing abilities to listen in on Iris's screams. \"Kara, please! Let me out of here, your butt is too big!\" Iris yelled while Kara giggled at her, the shrunken woman's voice tickling her rear. Still, even if she was clearly the dominant one in their mutually beneficial relationship, Kara couldn't accept that crack about the size of her butt. At least, not without dealing out some kind of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the next elevator that came down, pressed the button for the top floor and stepped to the side. She stopped for just long enough for Iris to breathe a sigh of relief before she moved her hips towards the wall, keeping her strength in check just enough to scare Iris as she bounced her butt off the wall hard enough to dent the steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupergirl's toned butt flesh bouncing off Iris's body with the force of a semi-truck, the tiny woman practically falling unconscious after just one of the Kryptonian's hip checks. \"Oops, sorry about that Iris, you feel so comfortable back there I almost forgot about you. Let's get you tucked away in a safer spot.\" She teased, taking full advantage of the fact that she was alone in the elevator as the metal doors closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new degree of privacy, Kara placed her hands on her hips, sliding her fingers under the waistband of her panties and giving herself a slight wedgie. For Iris, this meant being pulled closer to Kara's asscheeks, her body hugged by them from both sides. Which was somehow even more embarrassing than being a piece of butt lint rolling around under Kara's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Ding*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the elevator reached the top floor, allowing Kara to exit into her workspace where she was quickly intercepted by Eve Teschmacher who was James Olsen's personal assistant. \"Excuse me, Mr. Olsen would like your latest article on Cadmus ready by six for tomorrow's paper.\" She stated, before walking off to keep the office running smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara then motioned towards her desk, enjoying the feeling of the rejuvenated struggles her tiny butt toy produced between her rear cheeks. Meanwhile, Iris was soon after attacked from all angles by Kara's jarring flesh with each step that the giantess blonde took. Finding the experience to be much less enjoyable while she was face first into Kara's ass, knowing that things could still get much worse for her having been face to face with the Alien woman's asshole in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Iris's sake, Kara's desk wasn't far away from the elevator, and she only had to deal with pain and humiliation of being ground between Girl of Steel's buns for a few steps. But it also wasn't Kara's intention to harm Iris in any way, she just enjoyed the feeling of having Iris squirm against her ass like a bug. Then again, when she thought about it like that the situation did sound pretty bad, especially when she considered the steps she'd taken to accomplish that goal. Literally sewing her friend into the back of her underwear, then giving herself a wedgie, all while she felt turned on by the power she had over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting these thoughts aside Kara decided to focus on her work, pulling out her chair and sitting rather unceremoniously in front of her computer. Iris's world being turned sideways and her butt came down on the seat, her cheeks spreading out to cover more surface area as Kara's full weight began to rest on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she wasn't nearly as heavy too Iris as she was the first time she sat down on her, and her bottom was also much more forgiving to her than Lena's. Iris had been promoted from being Kara's butt lint to acting as the world's smallest seat cushion for the last daughter of Krypton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, get off of me!\" Iris yelled as loud and for as long as she could, finding it hard to replenish her lungs with new oxygen within the tight space under Kara's butt. Her screams muffled by the tonnes of butt flesh surrounding her, unable to be heard even by Kara who only felt a ticklish sensation coming from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kara had begun typing away at her keyboard, trying not to focus on Iris so she could nail down this article so she could take down the organization that brainwashed Jeremiah Danvers. By good fortune, Kara was skilled on a keyboard, typing just over eighty words a minute with the aide of her powers. Faster than even the most skilled typists. What made her work go by even faster was the abundance of reference materials she collected while fighting Cadmus as Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween that combination of resources, it wasn't long before Kara had lost herself completely in her work, nearly forgetting that Iris was even in the room, let alone under her butt. Iris only wished that she could be so lucky, with every waking moment acting as a constant reminder to just how insignificant she was on Earth 38. She could scream for hours on end, and nobody would be coming to save her, least of all the city's hero who was the sole cause of her distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-Some amount of time later-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris couldn't tell how much time had passed, she knew it had probably been a few hours since Kara arrived at the office and sat down, though it felt much longer than that from her point of view. Her body had long since become numb and adjusted to the pain of being sat on, but the humiliation of this fact never faded. She was trapped in complete and utter darkness under Kara, yet she never forgot what part of Kara she was lost under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kara's body began to shake as she tiredly lifted herself up, light passing through Kara's skirt illuminating her surroundings for the first time in hours, allowing her to see the shadows of things and people near Kara. Desks, chairs, even co-worker's feet as they walked passed her, unaware they someone they worked with had a miniature person trapped in their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess blonde made it a point to check up on Iris at this time, moving towards the nearest restroom and locking the door behind her. Making quick use of her x-ray vision to make sure they were alone before deciding to give Iris some much-needed breathing room. Grasping the back of her skirt and Panties, slowing peeling them free of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-hot lights far above her were blinding to her retinas, like several small suns shining down at her all at once. In contrast, a pleasant breeze of cold fresh air from the building's industrial AC unit washed over her, giving some much needed fresh air. \"Hey, Iris how are you holding up down there?\" Kara asked, with no understanding of how hellish Iris's life had been the past two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris looked forward, only too see Kara's pale white moon dominating her vision, the very object of her misery. Her eyes trailed up Kara's skyscraper like back to her face looking down at her over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I'm doing? Your butt is gigantic compared to me! At this size, it probably weighs more than my house! What, did you think this would be fun for me? It's humiliating to be reduced to some extra padding for your underwear! And don't think I haven't noticed that you've been enjoying this the whole time, I realized that while you were squashing me under you're giant ass! Let me out of here this instant!\" Iris raged, furious with Kara for making her live like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was visibly shocked by Iris's words, and a little disappointed in herself, but most of all she was upset. How dare Iris yell at her like that when the main reason she was even in this situation was because Kara agreed to help protect her from Savitar. Her face soured, seeing no reason she should accept attitude from a woman the size of a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, who do you think you're talking to like that? I'm sheltering you from a situation where your only alternative is death. I understand this isn't the best situation for you, but I have to keep you with me at all times. I need some way of carrying you outside of the house. Otherwise, you become vulnerable to an attack by Savitar.\" Kara replied, throwing the hard truth back in Iris's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're clearly not very grateful for the risk I'm taking here, maybe you just need a little time to think about this. I'll Let you back out when you're ready to apologize!\" Kara said furiously, tugging on the back of her panties and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris realizing what Kara meant began to beg, her tone shifting as she saw Kara's butt getting further away, knowing that wouldn't be the case for long. \"No, no, no, Kara wait. Please, I'm so-\" was all she could say as the giantess blonde released her grip, forcing Iris to rocket towards her gigantic hindquarters yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Snap*</b> Was the sound that cut Iris off as the elastic waistband collided with Kara's hips. Iris's added weight provided enough momentum to force the shrunken woman back between Kara's asscheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will Kara go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Before heading home, Kara is alerted to a robbery taking place downtown. Compelling her to intervene as Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara runs into Lena Luthor on her way out of the office who asks if she would like to go out for lunch at this new place a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara has one more task before the day in over, interviewing the owner of an amusement park about a new attraction before it's open to the public.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Team Flash two weeks to defeat Savitar from the time they shrunk Iris, and Iris spent most of that time in Kara's butt. From the first time Kara tied Iris down to her panties, Kara was convinced she had found the perfect solution for keeping Iris with her. Usually, the most frustrating thing about being an undercover superhero was doing things like taking public transportation to work. She hated sitting on the bus knowing she could just fly there. But with Iris in her ass, nothing was ever boring. She always had her little squirmy butt toy to distract her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heart, she knew that it wrong to keep Iris in her butt. She probably could have had her friends at the DEO whip up something more reasonable. But she <i>was</i> saving Iris's life by keeping her between her butt cheeks, so it was not like Iris could really complain too much. She thought of Iris's squirming as a payment of sorts for her trouble. And she loved every second of having her back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the day finally came when she got a message saying it was safe for Iris to go home, she was very disappointed. Still, she was Supergirl, and she knew what she had to do. She handed an unconscious Iris back off to Caitlin, and Iris woke up in her bed the next day, full size, safe, and no longer attached to anyone's panties. Iris didn't see Kara again until the wedding, and other than a knowing smile from the blonde, neither of them mentioned it (though Iris couldn't help but cringe as she watched Kara shaking her ass on the dance floor). In fact, neither of them ever told anyone where Iris had spent her time on Earth 38. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was not going to let this slide though. She knew Kara had meant well, but after weeks being squeezed by her Kryptonian cheeks, Iris no longer cared about that. She didn't know when, but she fully intended to get back at Kara for what she had endured at the mercy of her ass. Sometimes she even dreamed about shoving a shrunken Kara in her own butt. She knew she'd never get an opportunity to do so, but the thought of Supergirl under her butt still made her feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne year later, her opportunity arrived. Iris was minding her own business in her apartment, when a breach suddenly opened up in her kitchen. Iris drew a ray gun that she had specifically for security purposes, only to lower her guard when she realized the person stepping through the portal was Alex Danvers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex you scared me. What are you doing here? I haven't seen you since the wedding.\" Iris said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Iris. It's Kara. Another Kryptonian showed up on Earth and beat her pretty badly.\" Alex said, clearly worried for her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, is she ok?\" Iris said, temporarily forgetting her anger at the blonde heroine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she is now. But it was a close call. I can't let her fight Reign again. We're going to have to resort to Kryptonite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kryptonite?! Won't that kill Kara if she's exposed?\" Iris asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's why I'm here.\" Alex began. \"I know that last year when Barry was dealing with Savitar Caitlin shrunk you and had you stay with Kara so you'd be safe. I hardly saw you at all while you were there, but since Kara is always talking about how much fun she had with you and how she misses having you around, I figured that you must have had fun together, and that you wouldn't mind watching her for a while...\" As Alex said this, she held out a rectangular box. The front panel was glass, and every other side was some kind of metal. And inside, was a shrunken Kara, still in her Supergirl costume. If Iris hadn't know what to expect, she would think she was looking at a Polly Pocket doll based on Supergirl, not the real hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course Alex! Kara will be perfectly safe here. I've actually been missing her as well. I'd be happy to take care of her for you.\" Iris said, her mind already racing with ideas. Clearly Alex had no idea about how Kara had chosen to store Iris during her time on Earth 38. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much Iris! I'm sure Kara will be excited to spend some time on Earth 1, once she gets over us sidelining her.\" Alex said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was already mentally cataloguing her underwear, trying to decide which pair Kara would be joining her in first. She estimated it would take about three weeks to try them all. \"Don't worry Alex, I'll be keeping her very busy here. She has a lot to see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she does.\" Alex said, unaware that most of what Iris would be showing her was a pair of cocoa brown buttocks. \"Alright, well I'll get back to the DEO. Kara should wake up in an hour, and I don't want to be the one to break the news to her.\" Alex said, opening a portal once more. With a little wave, she stepped through, and was gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris took a moment to revel in the excitement, looking at the box in her hand and tiny girl within it. \"We are gonna have so much fun together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kara woke up, the first thing she saw was Iris West. \"Iris? What's going on? Where's Reign?\" Kara asked, confused by why Iris was practically on top of her. Not to mention that her arms and legs were restrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry about Reign any more Kara. Alex and the DEO are taking care of that. Your sister just sent you here so I can protect you while they resort to Kryptonite based weapons\" Iris said, smiling as she awaited Kara's moment of realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Kara said, realizing Iris wasn't all that close to her after all. \"You're huge! Or, I'm shrunk! How could Alex do this? I need to go back to my Earth and fight Reign!\" She could now tell that she was in someone's (presumably Iris's) apartment, tiny, and looking up at a kneeling Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kara, I promised your sister I'd keep you safe here with me until she came to get you. And I have the perfect place for you.\" Iris said, grinning even wider as she saw realization dawn in Kara's face. To make her point crystal clear, she stood up to her full height, letting Kara see all of her, while also emphasizing the main event by spinning as she stood up, ending with her tremendous booty dangling over the tiny girl laying on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Kara. It's your turn to go in my butt now.\" Iris said sweetly, savoring the moment. Kara was about to understand exactly what she had forced Iris to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Iris! Your butt is way bigger than mine! I'll get squished in there!\" Kara objected, looking up at the massive ass. It easily dwarfed her own butt. Kara was an athletic girl who spent all her time fighting villains. But Iris had a much curvier and less athletic figure, and that showed in her big, jiggly rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Supergirl. Shrinking made you durable, just like it did to me. Plus your Kryptonian body would be much harder to squish anyway. So long as I remember to take you out for some sunshine every once in a while you'll be safe and snug in here.\" Iris said, punctuating her sentence by slapping both her hands onto her bare ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But! But!\" Kara yelled, objecting. She was transfixed by the sight of Iris's cheeks shaking and reverberating from the impact of her slaps. Every movement Iris made echoed through her ass, sending ripples and bounces through her sexy rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Kara. Nothing but butt.\" Iris said, grabbing the panties Kara was tied down to off of her bed and bringing them down to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kara got to experience the terrifying sight of two giant feet narrowly missing stomping her into a stain as Iris stepped through the panties, just as Kara had many times before. Once she was past the feet, she found herself looking up the giant pillars of her legs to Iris's awaiting ass, cheeks clenching in anticipation of having someone to chew on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to tuck you in.\" Iris taunted, before pulling up the panties with a strong tug. Kara screamed as she rocketed upwards, but her shouting was cutoff as she was buried between the black beauty's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of underwear was Kara tied to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A regular but lacy pair of panties. Iris had a long day of blogging ahead of her, and Kara was going to keep her company, snug and safe between her cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. An athletic thong. Iris was heading to the gym, having no intention of easing Kara into her time in Iris's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A bikini bottom. Iris was heading to the beach, and wanted to bring Kara along. She will just be another grain of sand between Iris's cheeks. Fortunately, as a Kryptonian, Kara cannot drown.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kara did not accept the reversal of their roles lying down, using all of her brute force in an attempt to break free of her constraints. Surprised by the fact that she couldn't even move her arms and legs, believing that Iris wouldn't have been able to use anything stronger than cotton fabric to tie her down, and yet she was completely immobilized, almost like she'd been caught in a web of chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, let me out, please! I'm sorry!\" Kara begged, struggling between Iris's ebony buttcheeks. Her words serving only to tickle Iris's supple flesh, but her message was received all the same. Iris looked over her shoulder and laughed. Finally, she understood the way Kara felt during all those weeks she was held captive inside the heroine's panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kara was beginning to understand the more unpleasant half of their arrangement. Feeling humiliated, embarrassed, and ashamed as the black beauty's butt toyed with her so effortlessly, reducing the so-called Girl of Steel to a plaything for the blogger's buttcheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris walked around her bedroom, she came to understand what Kara had felt during her stay on Earth-38, she felt empowered by the blonde woman's struggles. Able to immobilize her at will with a simple clench of her rear cheeks, the same way Kara had done to Iris countless times in the past. Unfortunately for Kara, she always had to restrain herself, or else she'd have risked crushing her friend to a pulp. Iris had no such limitations placed on her since Kara's Kryptonian body was much denser and more sturdy than an average human's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped to admire herself in the mirror, radiating confidence as she turned to face her butt towards the reflective glass. Sure, her butt wasn't as large as Felicity's. But she wasn't too far off either, making it a perfect temporary home for the shrunken Supergirl. At least in Iris's humble opinion as she rubbed her hand over her right buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris grabbed the back of her waistband and pulled it away from her skin until Kara was visible, looking down at her from over her shoulder. \"Are you enjoying your tour of Earth-1 Kara? See any attractions you'd like to visit?\" Iris teased, giggling at her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, please! I'm sorry about the way I treated you while you were staying on my Earth. I should have never degraded you like that, I was only trying to keep you safe.\" Kara explained, using her brief free time to beg for mercy. \"But, It's not an excuse to treat me like this now.\" She continued, sealing her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an excuse?\" Iris asked, beside herself by such a bold claim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trapped in your panties like they were a jail cell for two whole weeks, and you never so much as considered letting me out, ever during your days off at home. I was sat on by your giant butt during work, bus rides, and even movie marathons with your sister, and I never got a break. You can't even pretend like you didn't hear me, begging to come out cause you have super hearing, you only laughed and clenched your cheeks around me like it was a game.\" Iris said, frustrated as she unloaded on the tiny Kryptonian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara paused for a moment, not realizing that Iris had been so traumatized by the events she orchestrated over a year ago. \"But Iris, you had to have realized that I was only trying to protect you. Savitar was a speedster that could travel between dimensions. I couldn't risk him seeing you out in the open like that.\" Kara replied, raising a good point against Iris's revenge fantasy since Reign didn't have that ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I can't be too safe then. Right?\" Iris asked, brushing off Kara's rebuttal with a simple flick of her wrist, allowing Kara to rocket back in between her butt cheeks once more, adding to her embarrassment by giving herself a small wedgie to ensure that she enjoyed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that off her chest, Iris felt much better. Smirking at her butt in the mirror as she felt Kara struggle against her flesh, walking back towards her bed to finish getting dressed. Putting on a tank top, and a pair of sweatpants for a night indoors, writing articles for her blog about the recent increase in Metahuman activity. Neither of which affected Kara's situation much outside of adding another layer of cloth to contain Iris's body heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris then proceeded to the kitchen, to prepare herself a glass of wine for the evening, purposely walking slow to savor the feeling of Kara rolling within her cheeks, like a piece of lint in her butt crack. Though for Kara, it was more like having her body put through a taffy puller, with no end in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her resilient body, the Girl of Steel was no match for Iris's buns of steel. The dark-skinned woman swayed her hips from left to right, pouring the bottle of wine into her glass, almost dancing as she hummed a song she heard on the radio. Picking up her beverage and strutting towards the couch where her laptop was already set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris then set her glass down on a nearby end table, turning away from the couch and pausing for a moment. Kara was relieved that Iris was finally stationary, giving her a moment to find her bearings. Although she couldn't shake an eerie feeling in her gut that something was about to happen. \"I've always wanted to do this.\" Iris smiled, leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties conformed to her skin as she moved to sit down on the couch, dragging Kara into the furthest depths of her friend's butt crack the fabric would allow. Screaming in terror as Iris allowed her self to fall back onto the sofa cushion. Her cheeks separating upon the moment of impact, giving Kara a preview of Iris's butt hole, only an inch away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough unfavorable for Kara, this arrangement did return limited use of her arms, now that Iris's panties were no longer stretching across her full rear cheeks. However, the impact had a second effect that only Kara and Iris respectively could appreciate to the fullest. Kara had only ever experienced it second-hand herself, but that was about to change as Iris's flesh rushed back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara panicked, glancing left then right before holding her arms out to defend herself. Unfortunately, it was already too late, her arms were pinned to her sides as the brown buttocks squeezed Kara from all angles. Iris snickered upon feeling the tiny girl's resistance, settling on the couch as she leaned back into her seat, allowing her cheeks too spread out to the point where Kara had some wiggle room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kara, you're a reporter? Right, what do you think is the best way to keep the reader's engaged while you're writing an article?\" Iris asked, nonchalantly picking up her laptop and placing it across her thighs. Playfully making small talk with the miniaturized woman under her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, this isn't funny! Get off of me, I already told you I'm sorry. I get that what I did to you was wrong, but I don't deserve this!\" Kara yelled, her screams tickling Iris's sea of butt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A plot twist! Why didn't I think of that?\" Iris teased, answering her own question since Kara was unable to do so. \"So, something along the lines of 'Invincible Girl of Steel, losses fight against blogger's buttcheeks' would be a real eye-grabbing story, huh?\" Iris teased, wiggling her butt down on top of Kara for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad I couldn't share that story, at least not if I want to keep you where you are for the next two weeks. Then again, I'm sure Kryptonians are a lot harder to kill than Speedsters, so maybe you'll get to spend a whole here. I know you didn't want to give me up when Savitar was defeated, and I assure you that I feel the same way, Kara. We're gonna be spending tons of quality time together.\" Iris teased, not taking Kara very seriously, despite being the most powerful being in either of their universes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop joking around Iris, I don't want to hurt you! Just let me out and we can talk this over!\" Kara yelled, becoming frustrated with Iris's lack of care for her, not realizing how similar it was to the treatment she'd shown her while their roles were reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris leaned forward, picking her butt off the couch by only a few inches, but it was enough to turn Kara's entire world sideways. \"Stop fighting it Kara, the only way you're getting out of there is if I want you out. And for now the only place I want you is right here.\" Punctuating her last words with a resounding slap to her right butt-cheek, sending ripples through her flesh before she dropped her weight back on top of Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis double whammy came as a shock to the shrunken blonde, encouraging her to go all out to escape Iris's butt. Using the limited motion of her arms, Kara began landing solid punch after punch against Iris's flesh, sending waves through her skin even though her strength was greatly reduced along with her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is a pleasant surprise. I should tell Caitlin about this, you make a wonder butt massager Kara. Butt, unfortunately your tiny muscles can't hurt me, pun intended.\" Iris smirked, but what will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. One of Kara's punch's slips and hit's Iris's butt hole, surprising her and making her feel kinda horny in the process. She free's Kara but only for a moment. Telling her that she's going right back inside her panties, this time as her butt plug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris decides to show Kara by means of force that she's no match for her anymore, laying down on her stomach across the couch and using a mixture of her hands and butt muscles to squeeze Kara submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara bites Iris's butt, causing her to become enraged with the tiny woman. Deciding to see how she'd prefer someone else's butt instead. Making a trip to her old house to drop off Laundry, she sneaks into Cecile's bedroom and sewing Kara into the thong laid out with her closes, being sure to cover her mouth this time.</span></div></div>",

Why don't I remind you?\" Iris said, clenching her glutes around the shrunken Supergirl. She doubted she would ever get tired of doing that. But still, there was only so much she could do with just a glute muscles. Granted, she planned on working her glutes as much as possible now that she had Kara back there to spot her, but Kara's punishment couldn't wait for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara felt her world flip over as Iris sprawled out on the couch, now laying on her stomach. This left Kara hanging face down, looking down into the depths of Iris's ass. She was glad now for Iris's big fleshy cheeks, since they now kept her thong prison from slipping deeper into the abyss. But she wouldn't be grateful for long. She couldn't see it, but Iris had placed one of her hands on each of her butt cheeks, and things were about to get very tight for Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris smiled as she brought her hands together, clapping her butt cheeks together around Kara. The clap was so sudden and forceful that the sound echoed throughout the room. Iris giggled, wondering what it must have been like for Kara at ground zero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Kryptonian living on Earth, Kara rarely felt pain. But Kara had also never been at the mercy of an Iris butt clap. Despite their incredible size, they moved incredibly fast, slamming into Kara from both sides before she knew what was coming. All the air was forced out of Kara's lungs from the impact, forcing her to gasp for oxygen, just in time for the second clap to force Iris's ass cheek into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claps continued relentlessly, slamming Kara over and over again, with Iris giggling all the while at just how easy it was to torment her previous caretaker. Though she had to admit, having Kara back there felt amazing in general, not just for revenge. She totally understood the attraction of keeping someone back there now, though she of course didn't approve of what Kara had done to her. Still, once she was inevitably forced to return Kara to Earth 38, she wondered if Barry would be willing to try shrinking down and exploring her giant butt, so long as she promised to be gentle with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you like this.\" Iris said, pushing both her cheeks in again. But this time, it wasn't just a clap. She kept pushing and pushing, squeezing her cheeks tighter and tighter still around the Kryptonian, putting her full strength into the action. She knew Supergirl could handle whatever she could dish out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Kara's senses were overwhelmed at once: what little she had been able to see was covered by the cocoa brown flesh, it forced its way into her mouth and against her nostrils. All she could taste, smell, see, or feel was Iris's ass cheeks, dominating her in every sense of the word. Despite the tight squeeze, she could still hear Iris's voice, taunting her pitiful position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not have buns of steel, but I think you'll find they're more than enough to handle you.\" Iris teased, still squeezing her cheeks with her hands. She was in love with the feeling of control she had over Kara, not to mention the sweet joy of revenge. She couldn't help herself from pushing more and tighter. \"Remember when you sparred with Alex with me between your ass cheeks? I do! Remember when you and Alex had that six hour movie musical marathon? I was inches away from your asshole the whole time! Then there was the time you decided to do a spin class with Lena. I asked you to keep me in your locker, but you said I wasn't safe unless I was with you and left me in your ass for the full hour! You bet your tiny ass I've already booked several spin classes this week for both of us! And worst of all, through all of it, you constantly told me how it was for my own good and how your ass was the only safe place for me! Well we both know that was a load of bullshit! You kept me in your butt because it was fun for you, but you wouldn't admit it. I'm not afraid to admit it though. As long as you're tiny on this Earth, you're my butt toy. You're just a little bit of lint from my panties, stuck between my giant butt cheeks. And that's where you're going to stay, unless I come up with a better way to punish you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara got it now. She understood what she had put Iris through. She understood how horrible it was to be bound to a thong and shoved in a friend's ass crack, and how horrible it was to spend hours being battered by giant butt cheeks. She had always justified to herself that she was keeping her friend safe so she might as well have some fun, but now she knew how horrible it must have been. But it didn't matter, Iris was hell bent on revenge, and it seemed she was going to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin walks in on this scene, she heard everything. But whose side will she be on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris demands Kara start kissing her ass cheeks, threatening to swallow her if she doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Iris gets tired and heads to bed, keeping Kara in her butt all night long with a tight pair of booty shorts.</span></div></div>",

As she savoured the moment, resting her chin on Kara's shoulder her eyes widen when she see's something moving on the couch, in fact squarely where she'd been sitting this past few hours \"What the..\" she stops and as the 2 separate she reaches down and picks up the tiny creature<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaras brain went on full panic mode when she felt Lena's heart flutter, the words telling her this wasn't going to end well for her \"Lena\" she begins but stops when she turns and the Irish lass was poking and prodding at Iris who responds with wriggling and high pitched shouts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, what is this?\" Lena asks, lowering her hand from her face (and giving Iris a new fear, being smothered under the CEO's impressively large chest) and turning to look the blond in the eye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara chews her lip \"You might have a better job with this\" she reaches into her pocket and retrieves an earpiece, passed on from Cisco to make Iris (or shrunken people in general) easier to understand and hear for non Kryptonians. Lena raises and eyebrow and does as requested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I've spent the last 5 hours being crushed under the asses of the people on this earth, I don't need your cow tits in my face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rude little creature\" Lena sighs and clenches her fist, both hearing the scream and yelp of pain from Iris, though only Kara winces, both from imagined pain, as well as how Iris' day just wasn't going well, the low light being Lena happening to become able to understand her mid rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not always like that\" Kara defends weakly, Lena clearly not beliving her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite. Now once more Kara, what is going on, and what is this tiny creature I've apparently been using as a cushion?\" she asks, Kara's mind frantically trying to come up with a lie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she tell Lena?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) That Iris is part of a race of tiny aliens called minizora (not real entities, but who cares they need a name and I've used it before for tiny creature so hopefully it can stay), and Kara is helping her get used to life on earth, badly it would seem. Lena feels sympathetic and a little guilty, offering to help create size appropriate materials for the shrunken woman, as well as offer her body for warmth, safety and transportation much like Kara already has. (Lena believes the lie because helping a tiny alien refugee sounds like a Kara thing to do)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Kara tells her Iris is a human prisoner of the DEO, being used in a test procedure for secure containment. Alex gave her Iris to see how easy it would be to keep them under control, and after signing the NDA's was allowed publish articles about it once the trials are over and everything is made public. Lena looks down at Iris and Kara shivers seeing a smirk on her face she's seen on Lillian and in photo's of crazy Lex, seems Lena was about to relive a little stress on a tiny, basically unbreakable prisoner, and Kara can't think of any reason she could use to defend her punishing the 'guilty party' without exposing herself as a liar and they'd be back to square one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) She knows Lena will see through a blatant lie (but hasn't figured out the woman knows she's Supergirl) so Kara tries a close enough to true statement. Iris was from another earth, in interdimensional witness protection and she was asked to mind the girl until such time as she was able to return to her earth. This both saves her ass and opens the floodgates and Lena sits back down on the couch, sits Iris on her lap and begins grilling them on Iris's earth and the multiverse, her eyes lighting up like a kid in the candy store.</span></div></div>",

Plus I'm a trusted source in the media, so once all the kinks have been worked out I can write a story about it. I really hope none of this violates the NDAs Pam made me sign. Interestingly the shrinking process makes them essentially invulnerable \" Kara grins, until she sees the cold look in Lenas eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's human you say, completely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Yes, 100% human female\" Kara answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So she's Cadmus then\" Lena states rather than asks and Kara pales, of course she'd come to that conclusion, the DEO deal with aliens, Cadmus is the only human thing they handle themselves. Oh why didn't she just say FBI, that was what Alex's fake id said she was part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lena\" Kara pleads as the other woman examines her tiny captive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You said they're practically invulnerable correct?\" Lena asks, poking and prodding Iris more roughly than necessary<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well yes but...\" Kara stops when she sees Lenas face, her smile causing her to gulp, last time Kara was that smile Lillian was about to torture her with kryptonite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You people have caused a lot of problems for me as well as the aliens of National City. You thought the DEO was bad, that's nothing compared to angering a Luthor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the first punishment Lena inflicts on Iris?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) seeing as she has proof Iris can survive being crushed under her ass, Lena decided to take it one step further, opening her pants and slipping Iris in, leaving her dangerously close to her asshole before it snaps shut. She then leaves the apartment with an extra swing in her hips, really having to leave the pleasure of Karas company<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Lena drops Iris, letting her but the floor with a bounce before pinning her under her foot. Batting and toying with Iris under her feet, Lena then grabs her with her toes and puts back on her heels, waving to Kara and telling her that she'll return Iris to her when they next meet up tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Iris comments give Lena a fun idea on how to if nothing else teach her not to mouth off to those infinitely stronger than them. Placing Iris on one of her 'cowtits' she then walks over to Kara to get a goodbye but from her at times overly affectionate friend, a kryptonians firm bust pressed against a human's larger and softer mounds, with Iris caught in the middle. Kara is conflicted as on the one hand she's helping Lena torment her charge, but on the other Lena is hugging her,  the woman her at times shys away from human contact initiated a hug, they really were becoming gal pals</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I know just what to do with you.\" Lena said, giving Iris a mischievous look that only barely concealed the loathing behind it. Iris had no idea what Cadmus was, but she knew that Lena did not approve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris felt the all too familiar rush of air as Lena's hand carried her down and around behind her back, leaving her hanging over the gigantic ass she had just been crushed under. \"Not again!\" Iris screamed as she saw Lena pull open her pants and underwear, revealing a pair of enormous pale cheeks and separated by a giant chasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena naturally assumed that what Iris meant was that she didn't want to be reintroduced to her ass. She had no idea that Iris had spent some time earlier that day between Kara's cheeks while she was flying around as Supergirl. Satisfied that she had chosen a good punishment, Lena released her grip, allowing the shrunken \"criminal\" to plummet down into her ass crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara stared on in horror as Iris disappeared between the CEO's cheeks. She was only snapped out of her shock by the sound of Lena's waistband snapping back against her back as her pants settled back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, what are you doing? Why'd you put her in your butt?\" Kara asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing my part as a citizen.\" Lena said, shifting her hips back and forth as she adjusted to the squirming woman being dominated by her cheeks. \"If someone needs to be punished, I'm more than happy to help out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Kara replied weakly, struggling for words. \"Putting her in your butt?\" It seemed such a ridiculous instinct now, even though she had done it herself earlier that day. In fact, she couldn't help but feel somewhat jealous of Lena. She knew it could be pretty fun to have Iris between her cheeks, and envied that Lena was the one getting to experience that now. Not to mention that with her super hearing, she could hear every word of Iris's screams between Lena's cheeks: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kara I swear you get me out of here right now or I'll-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?\" Lena retorted. \"I'm a busy woman, and I don't have time to spend all day actively punishing her. Much better to let my glutes take the passive route. And we already know she is not a fan of being squished by my butt, so it's the perfect punishment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara watched as Lena's nose scrunched up in what seemed like mild discomfort. Before Kara fully understood that Iris was the cause, Lena took hold of her panties and pulled them upward, giving herself a slight wedgie while Kara looked on in complete shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahhhh! No no no don't push me deeper I don't want to be a butt plug!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? She wasn't deep enough, had way too much wiggle room. You can't expect me to get anything done with squirming that much can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... well... it's just that...\" Kara sputtered, trying to make sense of it all, with Lena and Iris both talking to her at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway Kara, I really must be going. My cheeks will take good care of your shrunken charge, and you can meet me for lunch at L Corp tomorrow and get her back. I think you'll find she is much better behaved when you do.\" Lena said, giving her butt a threatening smack before turning and walking out of the apartment. Kara's eyes remained transfixed on her rocking butt cheeks as she did so, unable to believe that Barry's girlfriend Iris was currently being chewed between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kara don't you dare let her keep me in here all night! I swear you'd be the worst babysitter ever!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door slammed shut, and even Kara could no longer make out the tiny squeals from Iris. She was alone in her apartment, trying to decide on a next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Iris was cursing to herself as she bounced along with Lena's cheeks, assuming at this point that Kara had no intention of trying to free her. Who was this Lena woman that Kara was somehow so intimidated by? Any wondering she was doing about this was quickly squeezed out of her as Lena plopped down into her limo seat, crushing Iris in the squeezing grip of butt flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me home please.\" Lena said, before sitting back in her seat, shifting her focus to trying to feel the tiny squirms of Iris, her little Cadmus agent turned butt pet. She wondered if her mother would end up being shrunken like this as well if the test pilot program ended up being a success. It wouldn't be easy, but she imagined with that her own vast resources, she could probably get appointed her mother's \"warden\". The idea of keeping that hellish woman imprisoned between her ass cheeks the way she had Iris right now made her smile with glee, and she gave Iris a nice tight squeeze just for practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was relieved when they finally arrived and Lena stood up, allowing her to suck in some much needed oxygen. The rhythmic walking was nowhere near as bad as being sat on or clenched between Supergirl's ass cheeks, so she appreciated the little break she had, and braced herself for whatever Lena intended to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara just decides to get Iris back at lunch tomorrow, and Lena finds some time in her night time schedule to play with the shrunken Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Lena goes to bed after not too long, and Kara decides to shrink herself down and fly into Lena's bedroom to rescue Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Lena drops some papers on the floor, and when she bends over to retrieve them, Iris accidentally slips into her asshole.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In hind sight, Kara was surprised by how easy it was to 'borrow' the shrink ray from her Earth 1 friends: quick breach to Star labs, telling Caitlin shs wanted to shrink some things to make Iris stay easier, and she was simply given directions to the device. It might have been because they were busy trying to deal with an evil speedster, but Kara wasn't going to let good fortune pass her by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting up the device, which had a feeling she wouldn't be doing as well with were it not for her high intelligence by virtue of being Kryptonian, Kara prepared to begin her stealthy infiltration and rescue mission. Knowing things would go smoother if she were a little bigger than her target, Kara had it shrink her to 4inches, then let the beam wash over her, luckily this method allowed her to keep her clothes or in this case costume intact and on her, which was why she didn't simply steal some of the formula they used to shrink Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new size stabilised and a quick check showing her powers appeared to be intact, Kara flew out the still open window and made the now much longer trek to Lena's penthouse, where there would hopefully be a way for her to sneak in, so as not to have to explain why there was a tiny hole in one of her best friend's windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad Lena's bathroom window had been left open a crack, so she could pull it open enough to squeeze through, especially when her 4 inch size, or more specifically the bust of her 4inch body was too big to fit through the slits of the vent openings. From there it was a short flight, through halls she'd come to know rather well, to reach her destination known as Lena's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the size of the CEO's curves Kara had expected (and just a tiny bit hoped) that Lena would sleep on her side, but nope on her back, which also meant Iris was either being smothered under a lot of milk white buttflesh, or dangling from her crack, Lena's asshole hovering ominously above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering her thoughts Kara gently landed on the bed beside her target, deciding to just go with the direct approach get access to Iris West. The problem was a mix of reduced size vs a plump human rear, Kara finding her strength to actually be less than proportionate, possibly due to it being at night and her not exactly trying to recharge her solar battery during the day, but she just wasn't making any progress. Didn't help whenever she put and pressure against Lena's ass she felt like she sank 3 inches (from her POV) in before meeting any resistance. Finally Lena rolls onto her side, and after picking herself up from falling flat on her face, Kara ran full speed to the crack of that panty clad ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris!\" She shouts, getting the expected response of \"Kara!\" as well as very angry threats were she to not get her out this minute. Steeling herself Kara begins to push her way into Lena's ass, sure the sight outside would be quite amusing, with just her skirt and legs sticking out, there was nothing that could be said. Still, going that deep was worth it when her hands found Iris much thinner arms, and by digging her heels into Lena's cheek, managed to get enough leverage and stability to pull both of them back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch\" Iris screams, slapping Kara even if it won't hurt her \"do you have any idea what you let me go through, this woman is a monster. I'd even prefer your ass, at least you don't get off on having someone at the mercy of your ass\" Kara wisely kept quiet about the fact, she kind of does, she hadn't expected to, but in hind sight, she REALLY did like having Iris in her ass, the power she had and that their lives were hers to protect... wow. She was actually wondering if she should offer her body for more of these protection gigs, her shoes and bra are all available for tenants, she should bring it up the next time she's saving Lena from assassins, having the Iris lass pressed against her breasts or ass, sounds like a nice bonding experience for them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you even listening?\" Iris question snaps Kara out of her daydreams<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Iris, I'm here, and now that you're safe we can head home\" Kara says with her usual Supergirl confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Lena rolls back onto her ass, the tinies unable to get away in time and are pinned under her jiggling ass cheek<br>\r\n2) Kara flies Iris back without a hitch, but when she tries to grow back, Kara discovers she can't operate the machine at her current size<br>\r\n3) Feeling what she assumed was another itch on her butt, Lena reaches back, Iris for once manages to avoid the hand, Kara on the other hand doesn't and ends up face to face with a sleepy and a little grumpy Lena Luthor </span></div></div>",

He did know practically every musical that existed, maybe it was an Earth 38 exclusive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was then when it was over she as going to have to find a way to get Kara and Barry to sit down together and binge watch all earth exclusive musicals there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if only she could hold back the slight wave of jealousy at the idea of Kara and Barry curling up on that sofa, singing together as they watch their favorite movies. Though she doesn't bring this up to Kara, it was only the first day after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, girl's night is ready to go, just need to get you set up and safe for the evening\" Kara smirks, placing Iris on the counter and walking away for a short time. Not seeing the need to use super speed Kara walks out of the room like a normal human, leaving Iris to her own devices for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's not a convertible but the doors open so you can get in and fit just fine,\" Kara apologies, finally returning with the toy car she pointed out earlier. Placing the car beside Iris and opening the driver side door, allowing the Earth 1 female to enter the car that seemed to be made for her, or at least someone of her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seats weren't as hard as she feared they turned out to be rather comfortable. To her surprise, it even had seatbelts, though the door took her full strength to close \"It's better than I expected, the door needs some work though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara chuckles \"True but it's not really meant to be sat in or played with, we don't exactly have people your size on Earth 38 or many planets. The car itself is quite sturdy though.\" she demonstrates by flicking the door on Iris's side and while the car rocks the only noticeable damage is a dent in the space between the front and rear left doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, if you want a little more independence I could bring it to my friend Winn and let him play with it for a couple of days so as to make it basically function as a real, though tiny car,\" Kara suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Means you can drive around the apartment to get where you want to go and I could even set up some courses to amuse you while I'm in work and off doing Supergirl duty.\" she smiled, Kara's smile was infectious as Iris grins back, beginning to consider treating this less as an exile and an attempt to stop her from being killed by an evil speedster and more a kind of vacation. It definitely helped her reduce her stress levels and to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Iris pacified Kara gleefully picks up the car, internally cooing at how cute Iris looked in her tiny car before placing her gently on the furthest left cushion of the sofa and leaves to get into her PJ's as well as find Alex's in case she decides to stay the night as she often did for sister's night (she'd have offered some to Iris but as she didn't have any doll clothes, especially none Iris' size).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kara gets out of her normal clothes, safely puts away her glasses and gets into some comfortable sleepwear, Iris settles into what she hoped was a nice night with her friend and her sister, her worries temporarily buried under Kara's unstoppable enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually happy when the door opened and Kara's sister made her way in, calling out her name as she made her way to the sofa. What she was less thrilled by was the fact that Alex had a very long day at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deciding to just flop down onto the closest section of the sofa and just sit there for a while to rest.... which just happened to be where Kara left the car and Iris. Not even bothering to check her soon to be seat Alex turned around and hiked her jeans up tightly around her butt. That's when Iris realized what neither her or Kara had been thinking about up until that moment, Kara never told her sister that she was here or that she'd be shrunken during her stay. Alex had no idea who Iris even was, and now she was about to sit down on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! ALEX! DOWN HERE! DON'T SIT DOWN!\" Iris yells, frantically trying to get the red-headed giantess's attention as well as escape the car, but it seemed Kara's little proof of the car's durability had also caused the doors to jam, getting them open would require more than her minuscule strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex's shadow completely overtook the tiny vehicle Iris was filled with a sense of hopelessness as the giant buttocks came falling down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens? (Note, for option 1 I have a poor sense of scale, so if I'm wrong, apologies to Haro and anyone who reads it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The car gets caught between Alex's buttcheeks, leaving Iris trapped under an unaware Alex's ass. Kara assumes Alex found and moved Iris and chooses not to worry about her friend until some time later when she asks Alex what she did with the car that was on her seat, with her tiny passenger still wedged between her cheeks. The car protecting her from getting too smothered by Alex's sizeable butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Alex sits down for a moment before feeling the car under a cheek, afterward she reaches back and tosses it off the sofa, which while saving Iris from being crushed under Alex's butt, puts her directly into Kara's path, and the happy Kryptonian is a little too excited to pay attention to her surrounds any more than a normal human might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Kara hears Iris' pleas for help and zips over to stop Alex from sitting on her shrunken friend. After a thorough explanation, Alex understands and Iris is allowed to join in with the Danvers girls for 'Sister's movie night\"..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"ALEX NO, AHHHH!\" Iris screamed as Alex's butt came down with no sign of Supergirl coming to her rescue, forced to sit there and watch as the mighty DEO agent's rear end slammed into the seat cushion with the speed and grace of a falling meteorite. The two-inch-long car surprisingly surviving the initial impact, creaking and popping under Alex's weight as her jean-clad butt sought to fill every nook and cranny under its mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, Iris continued to scream in absolute darkness, feeling around the car for a way out before Alex crushed it completely, not sure how long the model vehicle could withstand the adult woman's behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the car, everything appeared to be perfectly intact. While outside each window she could feel a warm abrasive surface, which she assumed was Alex's ass. She must have been somewhere between her buttcheeks, which also might help explain why the car was still in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that might not stay true for long as Alex kicked off her boots, placing her feet on Kara's coffee table. She loved the feeling of cold air on her socked feet, wiggling her toes in delight as she sunk further into her seat. Iris surroundings shrieked in response to the additional weight, all while Alex was clueless of the horror she'd installed in the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on\u203d\" Iris yelled, trying not to have a panic attack. Curling both of her hands into fists and banging on Alex's asscheeks, hoping she would feel her hits. Unfortunately, she wasn't so lucky as a giddy Kara reentered the room, not concerned by the fact that Alex was currently sitting on the couch where she left Iris. Believing her sister would have seen the car and moved it to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this show on the road. I've been waiting to see this all week.\" Kara said energetically, catching Iris's attention. Even though Alex's thick layers of flesh she could make out two muffled voices. One that was coming from a source further away, and one coming from directly on top of her, obviously belonging to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is that Kara? Thank god, she can tell Alex about me and get me out of here.\" Iris said hopefully, thinking Kara would be curious about her current whereabouts. However, after a few moments, she realized that Alex's ass was not moving off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, Kara! Is that you, can you hear me!\" Iris yelled, hoping that Supergirl's supersonic hearing abilities would detect her voice. Unfortunately, she had no such luck as an excited Kara jumped on the couch, forcing it to scrape across the floor a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara? What's going O-AHHH!\" Iris screamed as her world was turned upside down, quite literally as Alex's ass rolled over her, this time trapping the vehicle under her asscheek. The toy car turned upside down, dropping Iris onto the roof of the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't the only effect Kara's carelessness had on Iris's situation as she would soon discover. The thin metal shell of Iris's vehicle proving to be no match for the full weight of Alex's robust tonnes of flesh, barely contained within her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris heard a loud bang, one of the tires had snapped off its hinges. The vehicle's hull began to shake and squeal underneath the destructive force of Alex's cheek as Iris became painfully aware of a new problem. The car was shrinking, not literally, but her surroundings were getting smaller by the second. She was trapped, and Alex's ass was the equivalent of a car crusher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the process was slow, due in large part to Kara's soft couch cushions, absorbing most of the damage for Iris's protection. However, these same cushions helped silence her screams for help from Kara. The same was true for her screams begging for mercy from Alex's ass, the short-haired woman becoming a symbol of terror for Iris in the short time she's known her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Kara! Anyone! Somebody, help!\" Iris yelled, panicking while the Danvers sisters were having an enjoyable movie night right on top of her. Trying to think of anything that might help keep her alive a little while longer, kicking off the passenger door and holding onto the steering wheel to higher, not wanting to be under the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump, Bang* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car dropped as the roof support racks caved in, closing off Iris's access to every window surrounding her, including the front and rear windshields. Iris screaming as the glass shattered, which resulted in yet another failure to draw the attention of her Kryptonian bodyguard. At least when it was Savitar that was supposed to kill her, she could die with some dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, fortune smiled on Iris as Kara found herself feeling hungry all of a sudden, planning a trip to her kitchen for a movie snack. Of all Kara's incredible superpowers it would be her super appetite that would be responsible for saving Iris's life. \"Hey, I'm gonna go make us some popcorn. Do you want anything from the kitchen?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any soda?\" Asked Alex in response to her adoptive sister, sitting up in her seat. Her gigantic rear driving Iris and the tiny car into the cushion with one last push, causing the vehicle to collapse in on itself. Iris's surroundings compressed until they were within a few inches of her, which limited her mobility to the point where she could no longer extend her arms or legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, one more question. Where did you put the car? I wanted to ask Iris if she wants anything too.\" Kara asked, scanning the areas around the couch, only looking back to see Alex's confused face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did an Alien hit you too hard on the head or something? What car? And, who's Iris?\" Alex asked, genuinely bewildered by her sister's questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, she came her from Barry's Earth. Long story short Barry from the future is trying to kill her, and his friends asked me to keep her safe. Iris didn't want to come here, so their friend Caitlin shrunk her, I put her in the model car from my room so she'd be safe and left that on the...\" Kara said, pausing as she realized that Alex must have been sitting on Iris this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Oh my god! Alex, get up! Quickly!\" Kara rushed, helping lift her adoptive sister off the couch carefully. Looking in the crater-like imprint left behind by her sister's sizeable rear to see the car mangled, but after sitting for more than half an hour, she was expecting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here? Why are you freaking out all of a sudden?\" Iris heard just after Alex's butt lifted off of her, able to see small rays of light through the cracks created in the car's frame. It must have been Alex talking, seeing as how it was a voice Iris didn't recognize. Then, the tiny woman lost consciousness while the two voices continued talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---A Few Minutes Later---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris came too on top of a long pale surface, wondering if everything she'd just experienced was just some kind of crazy dream. However, the looming shadows of two gigantic beings confirmed otherwise as Iris's eyes adjusted to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, she's waking up. She's okay.\" Kara said aloud, allowing herself to breathe a sigh of relief. Although, Iris would hardly agree with her statement believing that she was far from okay. In the span of a day she'd been unwillingly introduced to both of the Danvers girls backsides, and this time she nearly died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane? I'm clearly not okay!\" Iris yelled in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin shrunk me because she trusted you to take care of me and keep me safe, not so you could toss me in the back of your underwear and then leave me out to be sat on by your sister's giant ass.\" Iris roared(or rather 'squeaked' at her size), causing Kara to turn to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what?\" Alex smirked, holding back a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand. There was a train, and I didn't have a lot of time. It just happened so fast.\" Kara said, unable to structure a proper defense for her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This cannot become a normal thing around here Kara! Both were humiliating and degrading and they happened because you weren't doing your job right. You're supposed to be my guardian while I'm this small and you can't afford to keep messing up cause unlike you I can get hurt. Treat me like a person and not some kind of pet or plaything!\" Iris yelled in response to Kara turning her attention away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she immediately regretted this when she glanced over towards Alex to see the short-haired woman glaring daggers at her. Clearly, neither of the women were making a good first impression on one another. Kara was visibly upset as well, but in more of a sad way in contrast to Alex's anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Iris could say another word she was ripped out of Kara's hand by Alex, who began marching towards Kara's bedroom. \"I understand you're small and that really sucks, but that doesn't give you the right to talk to my sister like that. She's kinda like your foster mother here, so you can just think of me as being your Nanny from now on and I think you've earned yourself a time out.\" Alex announced, not being followed by Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened a drawer filled with Kara's underwear, bras, and such. Holding Iris over the sea of soft fabric's that laid unfolded inside, looking down in horror as Alex swung her around by her legs. \"Now you think about what you've done little lady,\" Alex said, releasing her grip allowing Iris to fall safety into one of Kara's bra cups before slamming the drawer shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things got quiet as Alex left the room to console Kara and finish movie night without Iris. Convincing Kara that this was best, but what will happen in the morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara brings the car to Winn and has him Alex-proof the vehicle for Iris's safety, presenting it to Iris the next day for a demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Alex wakes up in the morning and has to go to work, deciding to bring Iris along for the ride for talking back to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara wakes up in the morning and checks in on Iris, dragging her into the shower with her to clean off the tiny woman and to keep a better eye on her.</span></div></div>",

I'm taking this to Winn so he can make it durable enough there are no more repeat performances\" Kara explains as she picks up what now barely resembles a car and moves toward the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep an eye on the brat while you're gone, take care\" Alex teases lightly, lying back and closing her eyes, there was no chance Iris could get out of Kara's bra cup given her tiny size and the kryptonian's large breasts, never mind getting out of the drawer. With that in mind, she let herself drift off to sleep, the long day finally getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the NC branch of the DEO took less than a minute, with Kara happy to see her friend Winn still at work \"Hey bud, I kind of need a favor and help making something.\" she says in way of greeting, to which the tech nerd turns to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what time it is?\" he asks, sounding tired and a little annoyed because of it, causing Kara to wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9:47\" she answers, checking her watch \"But you're the only person I know who can help me upgrade this into something awesome\" she then places the car on Winn's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, what happened to this thing?\" he asks, just barely recognising it as the car he's seen a few times in Kara's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It lost a fight, with Alex's butt,\" Kara replies, not seeing any reason to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinn chuckles \"Those toned glutes do some major damage then. What do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing, I'm babysitting a friend of Barry from Earth 1, but she's really stubborn, like 70% Alex stubborn\" Winn whistles rather impressed \"The point is, the only way to get her to my earth and safety... was to shrink her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait they have shrinking tech on Barry's earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. But back to you and me, I told Iris I'd see if you could turn the toy car into basically a fully functional tiny one. Think you could do that?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinn clicks his tongue as he thinks \"Probably, there are some freakishly small alien power sources around, though everything in the car will need to be replaced, even before Alex steamrolled it with her butt.\" he deducted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara chuckles as she hip checks Winn's chair, sending the man into the lab with a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's another thing after Alex wrecked it, I realized the entire vehicle needed to be reinforced, so it not only functions as a mode of transport, but as a defense against everything a giant world can throw at her. So, up for a collaboration with me?\" Kara grins, which is matched by Winn, who had wanted to have a team up of any sort since discovering she was Supergirl, though this team up will be more like the one he had with Lena dealing with the alien guns from under the table than Kara and Barry dealing with Livewire and Silver Banshee. And as a non-combat agent, he was perfectly fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>An hour later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kara, we created a masterpiece, if I do say so myself\" Winn grins as they both stare at the completed SuperCar. \"The galvanic battery is miniscule and fits easily into the boot of the car, as well as the engine going exactly where it should. The wheels and their connectors have been reinforced and thanks to having a Super as a partner in this project...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a titanium frame so there is no chance of human butt related incidents\" Kara finishes, just as proud as Winn of their combined accomplishment \"Iris is going to love it. Hey, seeing as it's a completely new type of car, want to name it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinn hums for a moment before smiling \"Are you okay with the Superschott?\" Kara laughs and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Thanks for giving up some of your evenings to help me with this\" she chirps, hugging him close and ruffling his hair, the tech mock glares at her as he fixes it, then watches her leave with the car, before heading for the exit to head home himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Back in her apartment</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slips in silently, amused to see Alex passed out and curled up on her couch. Not having the heart to move her Kara instead puts the car on the table and curls up next to her, wrapping her arms around her waist and her chin on Alex's shoulder, the redhead reacts with a muffled content moan and wriggling herself closer to the warmth on her back, Kara smiles and lets them both rest, they probably need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>The next morning</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost mornings Alex would like having a busty blond wrapped around her like a sexy octopus, but said blond was her sister, so it was a little bit awkward \"Kara, let go of me it's morning\" she whines, Kara pouts but stands up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Alex, I'm going to check on Iris and show her the new and improved car,\" Kara says with a grin, picking it up and walking into her room, her sister following behind her sluggishly. When she got to the bedroom Kara was frowning at her \"Alex, why didn't you give Iris some kind of bedding?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighs \"Because there was no way I was going to go rooting through your underwear drawer, really don't need to know what color thong you wear\" she replies, cracking a smile as Kara turns bright red \"Also didn't want you to lose Iris in your underwear, she might end up getting tangled lost and then shoved in your butt otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara winces \"You may have a point there\" she admits, then moves to the now open drawer and plucks Iris from her bra cup \"Good morning Iris, I got something to show you\" she coos, ignoring the tiny woman's angry yelling as she places her on the bed beside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris blinks as she looks at the sleek grey vehicle to her right \"Is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I present to you, the Superschott, your new and improved, fully functional car.\" Kara presented, Iris walking over and opening the driver side door before sliding into the seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite nice, but I'm still mad at you for all the as...\" her argument is interrupted when Alex sits on the car, making sure it's in the center of her right ass cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" Kara scolds, the redhead just laughs before she stands up again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, proof you did exactly what you promised, made an Alex-proof car.\" she grins and Kara chuckles, Alex did prove to her and Iris something she's sure the tiny girl was unlikely to have believed her word on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex decides Iris needs an actual punishment for being such an ass in response to Kara's hospitality. Picking up the car she slides it between Kara's massive Kryptonian tits, convincing Kara to make her spend the day in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Kara has to rush off for a Supergirl thing, leaving Iris with her 'nanny' Alex, and she's going to show the tiny why it's bad to be a bitch in the Danvers house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Kara allows Iris to enjoy her new ride without fear of being sat on by Alex's butt, setting it on the floor by her and Alex's feet. Telling Iris to park near the front door and honk when she was ready to get picked up.</span></div></div>",

Now they are trapped by Kara Danvers doppelganger from the Nazi ruled planet. Slowly they all regain consciousness inside of a glass square prison, with only a single light shining down on top of them leaving the rest of the room mostly pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello my little toys, glad to see you\u2019ve finally woke up.\u201d Boomed the familiar voice of Kara Danvers, or the Kara from Earth X that is. The group of hero\u2019s along with Iris and Felicity frantically looked around them, unable to spot Overgirl anywhere outside the glass. Then Sara spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm guys, think we\u2019ve got a big problem on our hands.\u201d She said, noticing a rather larger figure walking in their direction from inside the shadows. It was Overgirl, but she was absolutely gigantic compared to them. Now they knew how Ray saw all of them when he shrunk using the Atom suit, but how did she get to be so huge? Was it a new kind of power belonging exclusively to this version of Kara? If so why didn\u2019t she use it in her battle against they Kara Danvers knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was staring up at the colossal Kryptonian in a state of shock and awe as she so easily towered over them, then a simple clap of her hands activated the lights above. Based off their surroundings it became instantly clear their their first assumptions of their situation were factually incorrect, this Nazi version of Kara wasn\u2019t bigger, and they weren\u2019t in some large glass prison either. In reality they\u2019d been shrunk in size down to only an inch tall and what they were standing inside shared resemblance to a mere fish tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is my sister you giant bitch\u203d\u201d Alex yelled defiantly, trying not to show her fear of the giantess blonde. Overgirl scoffed and brought her hand to her neck, pushing her hand down in between her breasts and pulling out a pendant attached to her neck by an iron chain. Attached to which was Kara, dangling in midair with her arms and legs restrained like she\u2019d been crucified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t killed her just yet. We discovered that I could survive simply by milking the solar energy absorbed by her body through my skin. Don\u2019t worry she still gets plenty sunlight and fresh air, thirty minutes everyday so she can fully recharge. Other than that she spends every waking moment pressed against my flesh, something I\u2019m sure you\u2019d both enjoy Alex and Sara was it? You both like women don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll make sure you both suffer for your sins against nature before you die. After all, to you I might as well be a god passing my judgement on you.\u201d Overgirl announced, wrapping up her speech by shoving Kara back between her tits where she belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cruel, how could you be enjoying this?\u201d Iris asked, rebellious to Overgirl\u2019s overwhelming power over her and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? How dare you speak to me with such disrespect!\u201d Overgirl yelled before reaching down into the tank and pulling out Iris with such ease. She brought her under the gaze of her bright blue eyes, attempting to remind Iris that she was an inferior being. \u201cEven before I shrunk you, I would look at someone like you and think of you as nothing more than an ant that needs to be erased from my world. Now your worth even less than that and you will be punished.\u201d Overgirl threatened, turning to Barry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s who you were going to marry? Disgusting! He\u2019ll share in your punishment.\u201d Overgirl stated, turning around so that her back was facing the rest of the shrunken heroes. She then swung Iris over her leather clad posterior, teasing her for a few seconds with her enormous rear as she teasingly swayed her hips from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust remember you little bug, this is too good for you. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019ve decided to spare your life.\u201d Overgirl said, pulling out her leather pants to reveal her naked white ass in all its glory. It was perfect in every way, round, perky, and plump, the advantages of being a Kryptonian absorbing yellow sun rays. She couldn\u2019t put on any weight so her body remained flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch, let me go this instant!\u201d Iris screamed, not wanting to get any closer to Overgirl\u2019s sizable rear end. However Overgirl saw this as the perfect opportunity to take Iris by her words a bit too seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, if that\u2019s what you want. Can\u2019t say I blame you for wanting a closer look.\u201d and with that released her grip on Iris, allowing her to fall between her cheeks, screaming the entire way down. In trying to climb her way out Iris only succeed in dooming herself further, sinking deeper into the giantess blondes butt flesh until she was completely entombed within its grasp. Her cheeks were so warm, so large, and so powerful that fighting against them was not only impossible, but risky. One wrong move by Iris or strong clench of her Overgirl\u2019s cheeks was all it would take to erase the shrunken woman from existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIris!\u201d Barry yelled, attracting the unwanted attention of Overgirl as she looked back a him over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, you wish to join her? Well, while I certainly think there\u2019s more than enough room back there for the both of you I have something different planed for you.\u201d Overgirl announced, turning her body so that she towered over Barry and his friends who were forced to watch as her goddess like hand swooped down and lifted the shrunken speedster up...up...and away to her face almost two hundred feet above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, you\u2019re kind of cute and with those fast little legs I\u2019m sure you could entertain me for a while. I\u2019d start vibrating this instant if I was you or your little Neger might meet her untimely demise by my ass.\u201d Overgirl said, threatening to crush Iris if Barry didn\u2019t obey her commands. Wanting to teach her new toys that her word was now law if they wanted to continue breathing the same air as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry did as she demanded and started vibrating at a speed that would peel the flesh of most people\u2019s skin, but to someone like Overgirl it only the center of her palm tickle. \u201cThat\u2019s good you pathetic little bug, now lets see how long you can keep this up for.\u201d  she said, tugging on her leather pants from the front this time as she lowered Barry towards her crotch. He didn\u2019t like were this was going, Kara was a longtime friend and he felt like he could never look at her directly in the eye after what was about to transpire. That is assuming they ever escape Overgirl\u2019s clutches at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvergirl forced her palm against her genitals, moaning as she stared intently at the weak individuals trapped below her as they watched on in horror at what was happening right in front of them. After teasing herself by running Barry alongside her clitoris she began to lower him further before pushing him inside of her body. Still he vibrated at the pace Overgirl demanded, knowing that if he stopped for even a moment Iris\u2019s death between Kara\u2019s doppelganger's ass cheeks was assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good, looks like you already have a new job. Moving up in the world from hero to vibrator in just one day.\u201d Overgirl mocked, pushing Barry deeper into her pussy. Constantly changing his position to pleasure herself, from one sopping wet wall to the other then forcing him to go upwards. In was at that point that Barry became so far enveloped by Overgirl\u2019s Vaginal walls that her fingers could no longer reach him, however she still continued to rub her clitoris so that she could be brought to a swift orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me more, vibrate faster or I\u2019ll smash that little Neger to a pulp.\u201d Overgirl threatened, grasping one of her breasts with her free hand. Suddenly she was reminded of Kara\u2019s presence between her tits, she was having so much fun with the Bride and Groom of the wedding she just interrupted that she\u2019d all but forgotten about her Earth 38 counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Barry's pace increased rapidly, willing to do anything if it meant saving the life of the woman he loved, in that respect he and the Earth X version of Oliver were a lot alike. Overgirl grasped her womanhood as Barry released a barrage of punches up and down her vaginal walls as her was dragged alongside them by the building juices. One hundred, no maybe two or even three hundred punches per second delivered by the tiny speedster, and all for her divine pleasure. Even for Overgirl this was simply too much for her to take for long, at least in terms of pleasure that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing became more intense as she continued fingering herself, turning her attention down to the shrunken group of heroes beneath her, turned on further by her plans for what she was going to do to them. She could see it all clearly, and in the end they would all be dead, all but Kara who would spend the rest of her life pressed up against her skin. The excitement building, swelling up inside \"Faster, faster, faster, you little bug!\" Overgirl said in between breathe until she finally reached her breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, and what a good little bug you are.\" Overgirl said, pleasantly surprised with Barry's performance as her vibrator as she came. The fluids outpouring from her pussy strong enough to was Barry out into the front of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now that was more fun than I anticipated. You've certainly pleased me, now you Neger can live for a little while longer. Now I think I could use a ________.\" Overgirl said announcing her next plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Snack- Overgirl tells Barry and Iris to take a break, putting them back in the tank with everyone else so she can eat Felicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Shower- Overgirl decides that Sara and Alex need to be punished for committing the crime of making love to another woman. Bringing them into her shower to show them her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Rest- Overgirl takes a seat on her couch and forces Barry to continue serving her by rubbing her feet, reminding him that Iris was still under her ass and alive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good work toy. You've proven your usefulness to me. I'll certainly keep you and your little bitch alive as long as you can make me feel that good.\" Overgirl explained, carrying Barry over towards the glass box. Rather than placing him into it though, she opened the top drawer of the dresser it was resting on, revealing an assortment of bras and panties. She dropped Barry down into the drawer without any regard for his safety, sure his speed healing would handle any broken limbs. She threw a scrap of paper towel in after him \"Clean yourself off though. I won't tolerate my new vibrator being dirty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Iris?\" Barry asked, ignoring the fact that he was now little more than a human vibrator for a cruel Nazi Kryptonian. \"Take her out of your ass right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvergirl scowled down at the tiny speedster in response to his comment. \"First of all, I will not be spoken to that way by anyone, let alone a sex toy. If you didn't make me feel so good, I'd shatter your arms and legs on the spot. So instead, Iris gets a squeeze.\" Overgirl said, placing one hand on each of her butt cheeks and pressing them inward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris's screams reverberated inside the fleshy prison of Overgirl's ass as the toned glutes of the Kryptonian squeezed tightly around her. No one could hear her shouts of pain as she was compacted by the the enormous butt. She felt as though her spine might snap in two if the evil Nazi added any more pressure, and wondered if the cruel girl had learned from experience exactly how much she could push a tiny before breaking them. She was very skeptical any of them would survive this, but if she did, she fully intended to shrink the giant bitch down and introduce Kara to her own big booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris!\" Barry shouted, the tone of his voice conveying his powerlessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I haven't squished her yet. But she is not coming out of there. I don't want to have to look at someone like her all day, and I actually rather enjoying her squirming around in my butt. Plus, as long as she is my ass toy, I know I can trust you not to run away from me.\" Evil Kara teased. \"Anyway, I'm done with you for now. Recharge your batteries, because we will be going another round later. Maybe I'll even let you visit your wife in my butt later.\" Overgirl said with a wink, while also imagining introducing her new vibrator to her asshole. \"I have someone new I want to play with now though.\" explained the giant Kryptonian, who casually slammed the drawer shut without another word, leaving Barry trapped in the dark confines of her panty drawer like the vibrator he now was. She then reaches down and plucked Felicity out of the glass box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not shove me in your ass you giant Nazi bitch!\" Felicity screamed, her hatred of Nazis overpowering her common sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little one. That's not where you're going. A filthy Jew like you doesn't deserve the privilege of my divine ass. It was perhaps even too kind of me to let the my new vibrator's wife live between my butt cheeks. I have my own special way of disposing of your kind.\" Overgirl said with a smirk. Without elaborating, she slowly slide her tongue out of her mouth and gave her lips a quick lick. It was enough to let Felicity an idea of what she had in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No way... You wouldn't....\" Felicity stammered, her eyes fixated on the giant woman's mouth. Her smile revealed giant rows of pearly teeth, each easily large enough to eviscerate the shrunken IT girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I would...\" Overgirl said, widening her toothy grin to show off more of her teeth. \"In fact, you wouldn't be my first. I've eaten my fair share of your kind. Sometimes the camps just get too full, or I am feeling like playing with my food, so I have a bunch shrunken and brought to me on a silver platter. They're never quite enough to fill me up. Not a lot of meat on their bones usually. But they make great snacks. And the really bony ones are nice and crunchy. You, on the other hand, have been very well fed. I think you will be nice and chewy.\" Overgirl teased, appreciating how round and curvy the tiny girl's body was. As Felicity stared at her captor in shock, Overgirl lunged forward with bared teeth, slamming them together mere inches away from Felicity's face. The tiny blonde could see her reflection in the saliva coated teeth of her friend's doppelganger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overgirl! Don't do this!\" Oliver yelled, diverting the gigantic Kryptonian's attention from his tiny girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Oliver, you'll be thanking me for this later. Trust me, you don't want to marry this little morsel.\" Overgirl teased. \"And besides, I'm famished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take me instead!\" Oliver yelled, willing to trade his life for Felicity's without a thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not Oliver. I can't bear to eat someone who looks so much like my dear husband. But maybe once Felicity's dealt with you can go live with your Kara between my tits, and get started on the relationship you were always meant to be in.\" Overgirl said with a taunting wink, before turning her attention back to the shrunken blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, on to the next question.\" Overgirl mused. \"Should I cook you first, or just eat you raw?\" Upon saying this, her eyes began to glow red with the power of heat vision, causing Felicity to squirm in panic within her grip in her attempts to avoid being cooked to a cinder. As if responding to gear, her eyes returned to normal. \"Nah, raw is definitely the way to go. You're a squirmer, and I wanna enjoy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity screamed as she was suddenly pulled close to the giant blonde's mouth, fully expecting to be tossed inside then and there. She closed her eyes instinctively, not wanting to see her painful end. Instead of a freefall into hell though, Felicity was struck in the face by a warm, wet, and bumpy wall. She opened her eyes just in time to see Overgirl's tongue pull away from her now slobber covered face. Felicity shook her head like a dog to get the saliva out of her eyes and nose, but her hair remained soaked and matted with Kryptonian spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Overgirl say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Mmmmmm.... you're much tastier than the regular snacks... I'm gonna enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ugh. You taste like dirt. I think I'm just gonna squish you. Anyone wanna join her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmmmmm.... you're much tastier than the regular snacks. I'm gonna enjoy this a lot.... Overgirl said, biting her lower lip in anticipation. The cruelty and hatred was still in her eyes, but now there was also a flash of excitement, as she knew this would not be a meal she would soon forget. She raised the tiny blonde over her mouth, opening her maw wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no please! Don't eat me!\" Felicity screeched. Overgirl was holding her up by only her right arm, dangling her over the black cavern that was the Kryptonians wide open mouth. The giant blonde began to lower her slowly, savoring the fear and panic the IT girl was feeling. Felicity could do little more than scream and kick her feet as she descended. Finally, she felt her kick connect, striking the plush softness of Overgirl's lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexively, the giant Kryptonian immediately closed her lips around the tiny foot, her tongue getting its first taste of Felicity. Excited for more, she quickly slurped the shrunken Jew's leg into her mouth up to the knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmm.....\" Overgirl moaned with delight at the taste of the tiny blonde, sucking on her leg like a lollipop all the while. The sound travelled through Felicity's entire body, shaking and deafening her all at once. The tiny girl shuddered as she felt a gigantic tongue running across her bare legs, covering them in saliva. She frantically began to kick her other leg out against the gigantic pursed lips, hoping to dislodge her first. She struck her foot again and again against the soft and pillowy lips, growing more desperate with each passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Overgirl's hunger got the better of her, and she was tired of playing with her food. In anticipation of Felicity's next kick, she pursed her lips a little bit wider, and the tiny blonde's other lleg slipped in along with her first. The giant Nazi slurped up the tiny blonde like a spaghetti noodle, her lips widening slightly as they passed over the tiny hacker's hips then tightening as the rest of her body slid inside. Overgirl stopped just short of sucking in her head though. She puckered her lips such that the tiny girl's head was in the center, like she was a lion with an enormous pink mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde giantess leaned over the box of tiny people, leaving Felicity's tiny head peeking out of her lips over the tiny people. She let out a scream of fear as she felt Overgirl's tongue spring into action behind her, but it was cut off as she was slurped up into the Kryptonian's mouth, cutting her off from the anguish filled occupants of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvergirl wasn't done just yet though. She wasn't gonna eat a feisty little girl like Felicity without taking some time to savor her. She quickly flicked her tongue upward, pinning the shrunken woman to the top of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Felicity, it felt like gravity had switched directions. She was pinned to the wet ceiling of the giant Nazi's mouth, her face pressed against Kara's palate by the enormous tongue which was probing her from behind. She could only scream into the pink spongy flesh she was held against as Overgirl's encroaching tongue dragged itself over every inch of her back. The Nazi giantess took her time as her tongue inspected Felicity's ass, not used to food with so much meat on their bones. She considered biting into it then and there, but decided against it. She knew it would be much more fun if the girl squirmed all the way down. Just thinking about how it would feel to have the girl fighting her way down her throat was enough to convince her that she couldn't wait any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity felt the pressure dissipate as Kara lowered her tongue, but quickly realized the side her head was on was falling much more quickly than the one with her feet. It was hard to see in the dark, but she could still make out the giant Kryptonian uvula hanging overhead as her bullying tongue turned into a slide straight down into the giant blonde's throat. She let out a final scream that echoed through Overgirl's skull, but it was cut off as the blonde's head slipped down into her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies in the box heard the sound of swallowing as Overgirl tipped her head back and allowed Felicity to slide down her throat. They could see the bulge on the Kryptonian's throat as Team Arrow's tech genius made her way down into the belly of the gigantic beast, disappearing from view as she passed behind the girl's enormous cleavage. The shrunken heroes in the box didn't know this, but from her shrunken place on the pendant, tiny Kara could hear Felicity's screams of anguish through the giant Nazi's chest. These too died out though, as Felicity finished her trip down the esophagus and came to a final stop in Overgirl's stomach. The cavernous organ was more or less empty at the moment, but she knew it wouldn't take long to spring into action now that it had something to digest. The tech wiz futiley banged her hands on the walls of her captor's stomach, not sure what it would accomplish, but unwilling to just sit and wait to become fat on this giant bitch's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that certainly hit the spot.\" Overgirl said, flashing the other tinies a cruel grin as she patted her stomach. She couldn't help but continue to smile as she saw the looks of absolute horror on their faces. Some looked angry, some had their faces frozen with shock, and others were on the verge of tears. \"Hey now little ones, don't be upset. If anyone wants to see Felicity again, I'd be more than happy to eat them for dessert. She is still alive in there after all. I can actually feel her wriggling around in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You psycho bitch! Give her back right now!\" Oliver screamed, worked into a frenzy by seeing his girlfriend devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Overgirl respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Feeling playful, she gives Oliver an opportunity to go in after her food, lowering him down her throat into her stomach in a string (she may just decide to eat Oliver too though)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She decides to introduce Oliver to his new life with Kara, binding him to the opposite side of her swastika pendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Deciding Oliver was too annoying, she decides to assign him to a new role as her boot insole, along with another member of the shrunken group. </span></div></div>",

Gideon has detected an anachronism in the year 1928, Amelia Earhart's plane was just torn apart by King Clovis and Salian Franks tribesmen.\" Sara said, alerting her crew of their next time jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares, all I need to know is where I can go to get a drink,\" Mick says, focused more on getting drunk then protecting history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't get drunk, it's during the prohibition. It's illegal to get drunk.\" Ray Palmer answers back, looking to keep Mick out of trouble with the lawmen of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically speaking, alcohol was banned throughout the entirety of the roaring twenties. But it was hardly difficult to get your hands on, by the late 1920's they had speakeasies set up blocks apart from one another. With the right historical data, I could help you find any number of establishments that serve alcohol.\" Nate Hardwood interjects, strapping himself in for the coming time jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, looks like your my new drinking buddy metal man.\" Mick laughs, strapping himself in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard them Gideon take us to 1928,\" Sara says, setting the coordinates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Captain Lannnnn.\" Gideon began before crashing, the light on board the Waverider going dark. Power soon faded, the engines of the ship stopped pushing the Legends through time. They could feel the ship cruise towards the curved walls of the timestream, the crew bracing themselves for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on\u203d,\" Asked Zari as she forced her way through the mechanical door with the help of Amaya's animalistic strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strap yourself in or grab onto something, we're crashing in time!\" Sara exclaimed. Amaya, using her totem to boost her speed was able to get to her seat in time and strap herself in. Zari, on the other hand, whipped up winds using her own totem to propel her to the wall where she quickly grabbed onto something sturdy that could support her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking! We can't actually crash in time, right?\" Zari asked, concerned by Sara's words. Suddenly the ship ran adrift into a wall of cascading energy, a loud bang filling the hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it feel like I'm joking!\" Sara yelled as the ship fell outside the timestream. Their exit point was a park located in the center of National City on Earth 38, the vibrations caused by their Timeship hitting the cascading wall strong enough to open a breach between worlds. However, without the proper amount of speed and force usually required to travel between worlds, the rift it produced wasn't very large. In fact, it was barely large enough for one person to squeeze through if that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legends ship exited from the breach, approximately being the size of a basketball. Smoke billowed from the engines as the ship quickly plumed from the sky, or at least six free of the ground. The Waverider was being driven to the ground, and its passengers all knew what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace for impact!\" Sara yelled just before the ship made a terrific crash landing on the grass of the park. They nosedived through the dirt, carving out a path a few feet long in length before coming to a complete stop. However, the Legends problems didn't stop there, more accurately they'd only just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, is everybody alright?\" Sara asked, checking on the condition of her crew before worrying about the damage done to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Nate asked, being the first person to get his bearings after the crash, one of the benefits to being made of steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, best guess. The Dwarf Star overloaded Gideon's circuits, forcing her to shut down until we figure out a way to get the ship up and running again.\" Zari suggested, unsettling some members of the Legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Haircut. We've got ourselves in a real mess now.\" Mick said casually, seeming more or less unaffected by the crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? There's no way, my calculations were precise down to the last decimal.\" Ray said, feeling the need to defend himself from Mr. Rory's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy's arguing about this is pointless, let's just figure out where or when we've landed,\" Amaya interjects, bringing the discussion of how they crashed to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legends came to gather in front of the Waverider's front windshield, their view blocked out entire by the black smoke coming off their ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">*Boom*</font> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">*Boom*</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Asked Wally West, who'd remained silent up till that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounded like a loud bang to me, do you think something blew up on the ship?\" Amaya followed, asking a question of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was we wouldn't be standing here, trust me,\" Zari commented, having some recent experience with an exploding Waverider herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">*Boom, Boom*</font> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">*Boom, Boom*</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the tremors vibrated at a deeper frequency, causing the Waverider to shake as a result. Not only that but they had doubled, two larger quakes, followed by two slightly smaller ones. It was at that moment Ray realized what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys. I don't know how to tell you this, but we've um...\" Ray paused recalling the first tests he ran on the A.T.O.M Exosuit after escaping Damien Darhk. Then suddenly an extremely tall leather boot touched down in front of the Waverider, traveling up no less than a hundred feet to a woman's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...shrunk,\" Ray said, finishing his earlier statement as the smoke began to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way, it couldn't possibly be,\" Said a familiar voice, most familiar to the ship's captain Sara Lance. Funny, she had the exact same thought as the smoke cleared to confirm both women's suspicions as Sara found herself looking up at a massively gigantic Alex Danvers, accompanied by a younger teenage girl named Ruby <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost confused by this turn of events was Ruby, at first glance she simply thought the Waverider was just some kind of weird looking drone or some toy. She couldn't tell why Alex was taking such an interest in it, or even that there were tiny living people inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, what is that thing?\" Ruby asked, thinking it looked almost like a flying saucer. Although, it was much smaller than the ones she'd seen on television. We're there even aliens that tiny that could ride in such a ship, it was no bigger than a basketball. She could pick it up with ease, having thoughts of stopping an entire alien invasion by herself. Swatting down their fleet one ship after another and crushing the Aliens inside under her sneakers, imagining how power she would be compared to such a puny species of bug-sized aliens. She could then be like the woman she admired most of all, Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ruby deep in thought, Alex had a moment to decide how she was going to deal with this turn of events? Does she decide to introduce Ruby to the Legends or keep them a secret from the young girl? She had to make a decision quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Alex takes to long and Ruby asks Alex again what the object in front of them in, walking up to it herself to get a better look and forcing Alex's hand to tell Ruby what's really going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Alex knows Ruby is too smart to be lied to for long. Instead, she tells her that the device in front of them is part of a military project at her job and she must return it to them. Bringing the Waverider to Kara so she can get it into the hands of Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Alex doesn't say anything to Ruby about what the strange ship actually is and instead picks it up, bringing the Legends home with them to her apartment. Alex tells Ruby she can go into the freezer and eat as much Ice Cream as she wants, putting the Waverider on her bed before making a call to Kara to tell her whats going on. However, things take a wrong turn when Sara authorizes a team of Legends to go out in the Jump Ship for help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Don't worry about it Ruby, I'll take care of it. I am pretty sure I know the owner\" Alex said, lifting up the ship and bringing it up to her face to take a closer look at it. Her enormous eye stared into the window, but it was hard to make out details of the inside, as the windows were quite small. She thought she could see some tiny people inside, which was enough to at least partially validate her suspicions that this was the real Waverider. And if she was right, the owner she was looking for, the tiny Sara Lance, was between her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooookaaaaay....\" Ruby replied skeptically, feeling like Alex was hiding something from her. What was this thing anyway? It looked like a toy, but then why would Alex recognize it? Maybe she was right and it was aliens? But then why would they be so tiny? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to push past Ruby's obvious doubts, Alex began walking back to the apartment, Waverider clasped against her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the shrunken Legends, this was not a casual walk. Alex did her best to hold the ship steady, but as she walked the ship naturally bounced and moved side to side in her hands. And while this was so minor that she barely noticed it, the shrunken Legends certainly felt what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on to something!\" Sara yelled, holding tightly to her captain's chair. The rest of the tiny team did not have her impressive assassin reflexes, and as such did not react quickly enough to do avoid being thrown about. Ray clumsily banged his head, immediately passing out. An already mildly drunk Mick toppled over into the wall, cursing all the while. Amaya and Nate both reached for each other, but neither remembered to brace against anything solid and so they were thrown across the room into the library, landing in a pile of dislodged books. Wally was fast enough to buckle himself into one of the other seats, avoid the brunt of the shaking. Zari managed to deflect any flying objects with her wind powers, and kept herself floating in the air to avoid the shaky floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the Legends, Alex's apartment wasn't too far away. After they walked into Alex's apartment, Ruby once again brought up the shrunken spaceship, which had been occupying her mind for the whole walk. \"What are you going to do with that Alex?\" Ruby asked, still wondering why Alex was acting so weird about all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Ruby. I'm just going to try and contact the owner to let them know we have it is all.\" Alex said, still worrying that Ruby was not buying her lame lies. \"Why don't you leave this to me and go have some ice cream? I have plenty in the fridge, and you can have as much as you like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough to get the teen girl to drop any lingering worries about the ship. She quickly thanked Alex and turned on her heels, running back to the kitchen to begin preparing her dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Alex walked into her room and gingerly placed the ship down on her bed. She paced around her bed, examining it as she wondered what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Legends were just sitting in the control room watching as the gigantic Alex moved about, her tremendous body looming over their shrunken home. Finally, the gigantic brunette shook her head and stepped out of the bedroom, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Sara? How come Alex isn't acknowledging us?\" Zari asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... It does seem odd...\" Sara said, the gears in her head turning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she doesn't think it's really us?\" Ray suggested. \"Perhaps she thinks the tiny ship is some kind of trick or trap?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but then why would she bring us home with her?\" Sara replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it has something to do with the little brat with her.\" Mick grumbled, not showing any concern about their situation as he popped open a beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sat in thought for a moment as everyone looked to her for orders. It was up to her to make the right call. What did she decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sara decides to send some of the team out in a jump ship to try to see what Alex is planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Before she can make a decision, Ruby comes into Alex's room and grabs the ship, wanting to figure out what it was</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, well I say we stop guessing and find out for ourselves.\" Sara interrupted, getting the undivided attention of everyone in the room. \"Let's send a small team out in the jump ship to investigate what Alex is doing. No making contact, just a reconnaissance mission. Any volunteers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go. My enhanced sight and hearing could be useful.\" Amaya volunteered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go too!\" Nate said, a little too loud. He was going to take any opportunity he could get to spend time with Amaya.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wally, could you tag along and keep an eye on the lovebirds?\" Sara teased, causing Nate and Amaya to look away from one another as their faces flushed red.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye captain.\" Wally said, and the three of them headed out towards the jump ship. Amaya and Nate took the two front seats next to each other, while Wally took a seat in the back, already feeling like he was third wheeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey managed to take off in the jump ship without too much trouble. The ship didn't seem to be moving very fast at its reduced size, taking them a full minute just to cross from Alex's bed to her bedroom door. Fortunately, the giant DEO agent had not closed the door all the way, leaving a crack for the tiny jump ship to squeeze through. Out in the hall, they came to a fork. Looking to the right, they saw the gigantic Ruby preparing herself an ice cream sundae. A silent look between the crew members was enough to agree that that was the wrong direction. Looking left, they saw Alex disappear into her guest room at the end of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight over to Alex was uneventful, arriving in the room just in time to overhear the tail end of a phone call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Kara I know it sounds ridiculous but I think this is the real deal. We could really use your super hearing and vision right about now.\" Alex said, tapping her foot impatiently as she talked to her sister. She knew what she had seen, and leaving it unattended in her room was making her nervous. \"Alright thanks sis. See you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like we've got nothing to worry about.\" Wally said. \"Supergirl will be here soon, and she'll be able to see and talk to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, the tiny trio turned the jump ship around and headed back out into the hall. All they had to do now was let Sara and the rest of the team know that they were in the clear. What could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate watch out! It's the girl from before!\" Amaya said, pointing at the giant Ruby who was currently walking right towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Amaya. She's just a little girl. We're just going to fly right past her.\" Nate said, his voice full of confidence. He was much more worried about impressing Amaya than about some kid, even if she was giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, how did a fly get in here.\" Ruby muttered, noticing the tiny flying ship out of the corner of her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate... she sees us...\" Amaya said, growing very worried as the gigantic eyes of the girl stared directly at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a little girl, she's probably afraid of bugs.\" Nate said, trying to sound confident despite his growing fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so man.\" Wally replied, pointing towards Ruby's raised hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evasive maneuvers! Hang on!\" Nate yelled, grabbing the flight stick and pushing it forward, sending the ship into nose dive. The ship shuddered from the shock wave of her hand swiping behind them, only barely missing the tail of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull up Nate!\" Amaya screamed, more willing to take their chances with a giant teenager than to crash at maximum speed into Alex's hardwood floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate pulled back on the stick, straightening out the ship a few inches above the ground. They were at Ruby's ankle height now, near her tremendous sneaker-clad feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a close one.\" Nate sighed, exasperated. He had no idea that this was far from over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are bug. Time to get squished.\" Ruby's voice boomed above them, just before the entire ship was engulfed in shadow. Looking up, the tiny trio saw that this was due to the enormous sneaker now hanging over them, ready to crush them into the floor. At their size, they could see every speck of dirt and mud on the bottom of the giant teen's sneaker, and if they didn't move quickly they'd be mixed in with it. Wally reacted first, grabbing the controls from Nate and jerking the ship to the side. The sneaker slammed down next to them, missing them by a mere inch. The rush of air as her foot came down sent the ship rolling, throwing the tiny trio around the ship as it spun. This time Amaya was the one who regained control, grabbing the controls and straightening them out while pulling them up. They rose as they stabilized, coming to a stop right at Ruby's eye level. The gigantic eyes locked onto the ship, and the shrunken Legends could see they were full of contempt for the bug that had invaded their apartment. And she was about to end that invasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\" Nate said, watching the giant palm come careening towards them. There was no time to move, only to wait for impact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact sent the tiny ship careening across the room, far faster than it was capable of traveling under its own propulsion. It only stopped when the ship struck a hard surface. The passengers were too disoriented to know if it was a wall or a ceiling but it was hard enough to shatter the ship. The sound of breaking glass and bending metal rang in their ears as Ruby's palm struck the jump ship in mid-air. The entire vessel split in half on the impact, leaving its tiny passengers in free fall as the metal shell crashed to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, Amaya, and Wally all screamed as they plummeted downwards, completely out of control. They only got a brief look at where they were heading before they crashed down into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Ruby's Ice Cream Sundae, just before she sat down in front of them with a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The couch (Amaya and Nate end up on one cushion, Wally ends up on another. Before they can get back to each other, Ruby and Alex sit down on each of them to watch some TV while they wait for Kara). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Alex's giant boot, just before she put them on because her feet were cold. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We're going down!\" Wally yelled as the wall of the ship crumbled from the impact of Ruby's hand, leaving a gaping hole right near Amaya. She tried to activate her totem as quickly as she could, but there was no time. Faster than even Wally could run, she was sucked out of the hole into Alex's apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amaya!\" Nate yelled, diving out of the ship after her. He had no plan on how to save her, but he had to do something to help his girlfriend. He dove downwards, gaining speed and aiming directly at Amaya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Nate shouted, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her close. While this was somewhat comforting, it did nothing to solve the main problem, which was that they were plummeting to what might be their deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wally was still in the falling jumpship as it spun out, holding on as best he could. He caught a quick glimpse of Nate and Amaya together through the hole as he spun past, but the ship was growing farther from them with every passing second. Suddenly, an ear splitting CRACK echoed through the damaged ship, and the entire thing split in two like a cracked egg, dumping Wally out of the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of their tiny plight, Ruby was still looking for the fly she had swatted, hoping to finish it off once and for all with a final stomp. She was mostly focused on the apartment floor, not noticing the tiny people falling through the air now that their ship was in shambles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you lose something Ruby?\" Alex asked, stepping back into the room from her call with Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just trying to find a fly that was bugging me.\" Ruby replied, standing back up. \"I swatted it down, but didn't see where it landed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate bugs.\" Alex said, annoyed that one had even made it into her apartment. \"Don't worry about it too much though. If you knocked it down, we'll probably end up squishing it by accident sooner or later anyway. Let's just start the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation echoed around the shrunken people as they continued their descent. Amaya and Nate lung to each other as they fell screaming downward toward the couch, with Wally not far behind them. The shrinking process had their powers on the fritz, preventing them from saving themselves. Amaya could not seem to find a flying animal's spirit, no matter how many times she tapped her totem. Wally had similarly bad luck with his powers, as he was unable to generate enough speed to create the necessary tornados. All he managed was a light gust past Ruby's ear as she searched for the bug, barely enough to move her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Ruby's slap sent them spiraling towards Alex's couch, rather than the endless plains of hardwood floor that surrounded it. Nate landed first, catching Amaya against his chest. The speed of the impact sent both of them bouncing upward, ending with them laying a few feet apart, gasping for breath. Wally crashed down on the adjacent couch cushion, coming to a similar bouncing stop. He landed on his back, giving him an opportunity to see the shards of the jump ship crashing down onto the floor below. What he didn't notice was the piece that landed one cushion down from him. Fortunately, it contained the jumpship's cameras, which were now trained on the shrunken trio on the couch. This would allow everyone still onboard the Waverider to see everything that happened to them on this couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmaya and Nate rolled over onto their backs, gasping as they caught their breath and the adrenaline left their systems. They had heard only bits and pieces of Alex and Ruby's conversation around them, but now they saw Alex standing before them, dominating their full attention. From their spot on the couch, they were only at about knee height to the giant secret agent. They briefly thought she had finally noticed their predicament, until they saw the most terrifying sight they'd ever seen: Alex turning around. Her beautiful face was abruptly replaced with her shapely rear end, clad in her familiar black jeans. Nate gulped at the sight, turning to Amaya to see her looking just as terrified. He hated how powerless he was, wanting desperately to spare his girlfriend the fate he knew was coming for them. \"Alex wait! Don't si-\" Nate began, only to have the rest of his sentence swallowed up by Alex's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit oh shit.\" Wally said, watching his friends get enveloped by Alex's ass. He immediately knew he had to rescue them, though he had no idea if they were even alive under there. How much weight could they stand at their new sizes? He shuddered at the thought of Alex standing up, revealing only a pair of red puddles where his friends used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's face scrunched up for a moment, giving Wally a brief moment of hope that she had felt them under her butt. Instead, she just said \"Hmmm, this couch is lumpier than I remembered.\" before wiggling her butt in her seat, rolling the tiny people turned cushions back and forth under her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally was so horrified by where he was seeing that he wasn't even paying attention to the other giant in the room. He only noticed her again when he found himself covered by a shadow. Turning upward, he saw Ruby, the girl who had swatted down their ship. Or more precisely, he saw her sweat pants clad butt falling onto him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, that's gotta hurt.\" Zari said, watching as Wally disappeared underneath the young girl's butt. She wasn't worried about them being squished, having learned about a lot of the science of shrinking from Ray. Still, Sara wanted to confirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll be alright, won't they Ray?\" Sara asked, cringing as she watched Alex kick up her feet and Ruby squirm to get comfortable in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course!\" Ray answered enthusiastically. \"Shrinking makes us very durable. In fact, when I first invented the ATOM tech, Felicity accidentally sat on me during a test run.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough of a reassurance for Sara. If it was enough to survive Felicity's butt, she doubted anything could crush them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They deserve to get squished if they're not strong enough to stand up to some girls' asses.\" Mick grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah Mick? How about after the rest of us grow back we leave you shrunk and you join me in the Captain's seat?\" Sara threatened. This was enough to shut Mick up. Sara was an assassin, she could kill you with anything, and she didn't make idle threats. In silence, the team went back to watching the footage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2138076-DC-Arrowverse-Shrinking/map/144311\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a> &lt; * <b>How Ray survived Felicity's butt.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the three couch bound Legends were learning just how much power could be behind some giant butts. Amaya and Nate had ended up under Alex's left and right cheeks respectively, and between them they were responsible for supporting a lot of her weight. Fortunately, their superhuman abilities made them more resistant to injury. However, they were not enough to escape. Try as they might, their super strength was not enough to lift the secret agent's cheeks up off of them, or even to get back to watch other. When they tried to call out to one another, their screams disappeared into the mass of her ass cheeks. Their world was endless, monotonous butt weight, bearing down endlessly and relentlessly. Occasionally, one of them was granted a brief reprieve as Alex took a moment to readjust her weight, but this was always at the expense of the other temporarily bearing her full weight as she leaned all of her weight onto that cheek. The only plan either of them could come up was to wait and hope that Wally would come and find a way to rescue them. They had not even seen where he landed, but they were sure that wherever he was, it couldn't be worse than this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally had instead ended up under Ruby's crack, right between her cheeks. And since she was wearing sweatpants, they were riding up a little bit, pulling Wally up with them. He was no longer on the couch, he was suspended over it, pinned between soft, sweatpants clad cheeks. He tried to wiggle free, both to escape this embarrassing and painful situation, and also to get to the trapped Amaya and Nate. But this proved futile. To Ruby, he was just an annoying itch, resolved by an unconscious clench of her ass cheeks. Her squeezing cheeks emptied all the air out of Wally's lungs as her cheeks became tectonic plates, squeezing the valley he was trapped in out of existence with their movements. And all the while, she had no idea of what her ass was doing to him. She was far too focused on the movie and her ice cream to notice something as inconsequential as a superhero locked in battle with her butt cheeks. As he was chewed by Ruby's ass, he was almost jealous of Nate and Amaya's plight. He'd much rather be pinned under the butt of a hot woman like Alex than be trapped between a teenage girl's ass cheeks, even if it meant a little extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara arrived, and Alex takes her to the Legends ship (with Nate and Amaya stuck to her butt, and Wally still trapped under Ruby) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Alex and Ruby get bored of the movie, and decide to play a game of Twister instead, with the Legends still sticking to their butts (at least at the beginning of the game).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ruby finally feels Wally's struggling after adjusting herself a bit, and finds the tiny man under her butt with Alex right next to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex and Ruby were so engrossed in the TV that they didn't even notice Kara had walked in until she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls! Sorry to interrupt your movie, you both look very comfy.\" Kara said, unaware that they owed some of their comfort to the tiny superheros under their asses. \"Alex, you said you have something you needed to show me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's in my room, come with me.\" Alex said, slowly pushing up onto her feet. As Alex did so, Supergirl could swear she heard quiet gasping sounds, but she was quickly distracted by Ruby's much louder voice, leaving both girls unaware of tiny Amaya and Nate's current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about the ship we found right? Is it from some tiny aliens?\" Ruby asked, unaware one of those tiny aliens was cushioning her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no nothing like that.\" Alex lied. \"I think it might be a new drone from L Corp that got lost, and I am pretty sure Kara would recognize it if it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's boring.\" Ruby said, twisting back to the TV (and rubbing her ass along Wally in the process).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Kara.\" Alex said, walking down the hallway towards her room. As she did so, she unknowingly carried Amaya and Nate with her. The two tinies were stuck from pressure to Alex's black jeans, bouncing along with her butt cheeks with each step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ruby was alone. Or at least, she thought she was. As she sighed in frustration about being excluded, she kicked up her feet on the ottoman and settled deeper into her seat, unaware of what that was doing to the second fastest hero alive. As she sunk into her seat, there was less cushion beneath her, forcing the frame of the couch to push harder on her cheeks, squeezing them upward and inward and forcing them tightly around the tiny speedster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally couldn't take this anymore. He knew he had to escape, and there was only one way to do so: he would have to try phasing. He had never been particularly good at phasing, but it was the only option if he didn't want to spend any more time under this girl's ass. If he could phase through the couch, he could end up on the floor beneath it and run back upstairs to the ship. It was a risky plan, but he had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to vibrate, building up speed to begin to phase. Unfortunately, this was quickly felt by Ruby, who viewed a vibration under her butt in the only logical way: as an itch. Annoyed, she pressed her butt down harder against the seat, trying to eradicate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could not have happened at a worse time for Wally. Just as he reached phasing frequency, her butt pressed down, now without him beneath it as an obstacle. He effortlessly vibrated right through her sweatpants and panties, leaving him in the warm darkness of her ass. When he came to a stop, he was face to face with her uncovered butt crack, a giant squishy cheek pinning him from either side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" Wally yelled, banging frantically on the inside of the preteen girl's butt cheeks. It was futile though. She didn't so much as acknowledge him as she watched her show, and he dared not phase again. If he got it wrong again, he ran the risk of phasing into one of them, leaving him permanently embedded in a teenage girl's ass cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alex and Kara we're heading towards the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, Kara!\" Kara could have sworn she heard someone calling her name. She turned back to her sister, thinking it must have been Alex, but Alex just looked at her confused. Before Alec could say anything, she heard the voices again, this time noticing they were coming from lower down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move Alex.\" Kara said, shuffling around behind her sister and lowering her glasses to better use her supervision. What she saw was very surprising. \"Uhhhh, Alex, I think you were right about the Legends shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think that? You haven't even seen the ship yet?\" Alex asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara kneeled down behind her sister, getting a better look at Nate and Amaya. \"Well, two of them are stuck to your butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Alex practically yelled, starting to turn around. Kara caught her leg with her hand to keep her sister still, not wanting to shake the tinies off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay still Alex, I'll talk to them.\" Kara said, bringing her face somewhat uncomfortably close to her sister's rear. \"What happened you guys? How did you get so small, and what are you doing on my sister's butt?\" Kara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get us off of her butt and we will tell you everything!\" Nate shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sorry.\" Kara said. \"It's just that for us, something like this is a pretty typical Tuesday. Though I guess you are the first of her friends for Alex to sit on. At least, as far as we know of.\" Kara said with a laugh, before quickly realizing it wasn't the right time. She couldn't help it though, they were so cute at their tiny sizes, and they looked hilarious hanging off of Alex's butt. Still, she was Supergirl, and people needed her help. She gingerly plucked them off of her sister's cheeks, holding them on her palm as she stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the assist.\" Amaya said, stretching her legs now that she could use them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, ASSist.\" Nate joked, but a glare from Amaya shut him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely hear them at all Kara, their voices are too small.\" Alex said, leaning in close to her sister's palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened you guys?\" Kara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Waverider shrunk somehow and crash landed on your earth, and your sister found us and brought us home. She didn't say anything to us though so we were confused what was going on, so Nate Wally and I went out in the jump ship to investigate. That younger girl you were with thought the ship was a fly though, and swatted it down, where we crashed on the couch and got sat on.\" Amaya said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that...\" Alex said, embarrassed that she has subjected two superheros to her rear. \"Wait, you said Wally was with you? Wally West? Is he stuck to my butt too?\" Alex asked, glancing over her shoulder at her black jeans clad rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we believe he got sat on by young girl who swatted us.\" Amaya explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wally is under Ruby?\" Alex asked, unable to believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara couldn't help but out a tiny laugh at the thought of the tiny boy trapped under the tiny girl, but she quickly stifled it and put on a serious look under the watchful gaze of the tiny Legends. \"Let me see if I can see him.\" Kara said, looking out towards Ruby on the couch. She lowered her glasses out of the way, focusing her X-Ray vision on the couch. When she didn't see anything on the seat of the couch where she expected, she assumed Wally must have someone gotten away. That is, until she saw a bit of movement out of the corner of her eye. Focusing there, she saw something she never expected: a tiny Wally wiggling in between Ruby's butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see Kara?\" Sara asked, not letting her small stature detract from her position as Legends leader. \"Is Wally alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he's fine...\" Kara began, trying to choose her words delicately. \"It's just, he... Well he... Uhhhhh.... seems to have phased through Ruby's pants and underwear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you saying Wally is pinned under one of Ruby's butt cheeks?\" Nate asked, now feeling like Wally had definitely gotten the worse end of the deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly... It's more like he is between her butt cheeks.\" Kara said embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Wally!\" Nate muttered, unsure how they'd get him back without alerting Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara and Alex decide the best course of action is to wait for Ruby to go to sleep and save Wally later. They spend the rest of the evening trying to keep Ruby from doing anything too painful for Wally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Not wanting to tell Ruby about Wally, the Legends decide to attempt a rescue mission, with Amaya (given her flight and strength) volunteering to go into Ruby's pants and get Wally, while Kara and Alex keep her distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The girls tell Ruby that she was right, they are aliens, and there's a tiny one under her butt right now (they don't want to reveal Kara's superhero nature to Ruby, so they just go with aliens).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go already Barry! I can't wait!\" Iris said, practically jumping with excitement. They were standing in Star Labs, prepping to jump to Earth 38. Now that they were married and the invasion from Earth X has been quelled, they needed to get away from superheroing for a few days, and so Barry had decided to surprise Iris with the perfect honey moon location: A small Carribean island on Earth 38. It did not exist on their own Earth, making it a brand new experience for the duo. But more excitingly, it existed on a world without the Flash, where no one would expect him to show up and save the day. They would be 100% focused on relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir plan was to use the portal device to jump to National City, as it was hard to estimate the coordinates of a location that didn't exist on their own Earth. From there, Barry could run them to their island getaway no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm all ready.\" Barry replied, smiling at his beautiful wife. He was almost as excited as she was to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further hesitation, Iris pushed the button on the portal device, opening a breach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun you two.\" Caitlin said, waving them goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll hold down the fort until you're back.\" Ralph said, waving a comically elongated arm. Barry just laughed and shook his head as him and Iris walked into the breach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other side of the portal was unexpectedly dark. Barry felt the floor sink under his feet as he landed on an unexpectedly soft surface. Before he could figure out where he was, he heard a yelp from Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris! Iris where are you?\" Barry shouted, his eyes not yet adjusted to sudden darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down here Barry!\" Iris shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry realized he had landed on some sort of hill, whereas Iris had appeared just a little to the side and slid down it. He rushed over to the edge of the hill and looked down. He sighed with relief to see his wife standing below, on a flat white platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Iris?\" Barry asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be better if you weren't standing on top of Kara's butt.\" Iris said, her unhappiness clear from her tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara's butt? What are you talking about Iris?\" Barry said, finally taking a minute to examine his surroundings. The squishy hill he had landed on was covered by thin pink fabric. Turning away from Iris, he saw a matching hill exactly the same size and shape as this one. When he looked down the hill to his right, he saw a long smooth descent, ending in a giant bare foot. \"No way....\" Barry said, turning in the other direction. But it was true: there, in the distance, was a giant sleeping Kara's head, laying sideways on a pillow. Iris was right, be was standing on Kara's giant butt, meaning he and Iris had somehow been shrunken by the portal device mid trip. \"Sorry! Sorry! I didn't know where I was! I didn't even know we shrunk!\" Barry shouted down to his new wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm....\" Iris said, smiling now at her husband's embarrassment. \"Maybe when we figure out how to grow back, I'll grow back first and you can try climbing on my butt. I promise you'll know exactly where you are then.\" Iris said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry turned bright red at Iris's suggestion, shocked at how forward she was being. \"Well, the important thing right now is to figure out how to grow back. Do you have the portal device? Maybe we could just teleport ourselves back to Earth 1?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I have it, but it doesn't seem to be working. Seems like it got fried on the way over here.\" Iris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry considered their options. \"Ok, well then all we have to is to get Kara's attention, then she can help grow us back, either by bringing us to her friends or by giving us her portal device to use to get to Caitlin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably get off her butt first, don't want the Girl of Steel thinking you were misbehaving.\" Iris said, and Barry blushed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Barry said instantly, wanting to get out of this situation as soon as possible. He instinctively tried to speed down the giant butt cheek towards her face, but only managed to cause some tiny sparks as he ran at normal speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris could immediately tell something was wrong. \"What's the problem Barry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, my speed is not working the way I expect.\" Barry said. \"I can still feel the speed force, but I can't really control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the speed force is sort of calibrated based on your size?\" Iris said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's possible.\" Barry said, trying and failing to vibrate his hand as he searched for control of his powers. After a minute, he gave up. \"Don't worry about it Iris, we'll be back to normal size before we need to figure this out.\" He looked around for an alternative plan, knowing it would take awhile to get to Kara's head without his speed. He saw that there was a gap in her clothes where her pajama bottoms met her shirt, leaving the small of her back exposed. \"I'm going to go try and get her attention from her back, I should be able to make her feel me from there.\" Barry said. He began to head down the slope of her butt, her pajama pants providing some much needed footholds that would have been missing from the smooth flesh of her rear. Iris continued to watch from her position on the mattress, next to Kara's tremendous ass. Finally, Barry arrived at the small of her back, hopping down off the waistband of her pajamas. \"Sorry Kara.\" Barry muttered, before putting his hand down to her skin and forcing out a spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara stirred immediately, and Barry saw her giant manicured hand heading towards his position on her back. He sighted, relieved that she had felt him and sure they'd be back to normal size in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara feels Barry as an itch near her butt, and her scratching fingers drag him under her pajamas and panties and lodge him between her buns of steel. Iris is going to have to get Kara's attention on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara sleepily knocks Barry off of her back, sending him falling down to the mattress after Iris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara grabs Barry and picks him up to get a closer look at whatever is on her back, sitting up and on Iris in the process.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and I are close seconds though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, so what do you want me to do?\" Laurel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't tried the security system authorization process on anyone but Oliver William and I, so I'd like you to walk up to eye scanner here and let it ask who you are.\" Felicity explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm already inside your apartment.\" Laurel said, annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have scanners on every door that should function the same way as the one on the outside, so we can just do the test in here.\" Felicity said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, ok let's get this over with.\" Laurel said, approaching the device. Immediately, the robotic voice chimed in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, please state your name and purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I'm Laurel Lance, and I'm here to visit Felicity.\" Laurel said. She looked to her blonde friend, who smiled and gave her two thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice paused for a moment, before continuing: \"Laurel Lance is dead. Imposter suspected. Scanning to determine true identity.\" A beam of light came out of the camera, scanning along Laurel's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Felicity...\" Laurel began, but was cut off but the security system. \"Error, identified visitor as Laurel Lance, but cannot be Laurel Lance. Escalating to code red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! I forgot to program this thing to know about doppelgangers. And I haven't tested code red at all yet....\" Felicity said, tapping furiously at her tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now intiating security protocol 53 Krypton.\" The robotic voice announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is protocol Krypton?\" Laurel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a last resort!\" Felicity yelled. \"It summons a hero from another Earth named Supergirl. Or it's supposed to anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now initiating security protocol 27, Atom.\" The security system continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's bad...\" Felicity said, but before Laurel could ask why, a beam shot out of the wall and struck them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, the two women were no longer in Felicity's apartment. Instead, they found themselves in another, wholly unfamiliar apartment that neither had ever been to. And more surprisingly, it was enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's going on Felicity?\" Laurel asked, looking around the huge new apartment they found themselves in. \"Where are we, and why is it so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity sighed, knowing full well what had happened, and not at all excited to tell Laurel about it. \"It was the security system. Protocol Krypton opened a portal to Earth 38, but instead of summoning Kara to our Earth for help, it teleported us to Earth 38.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Earth 38 is full of giants?\" Laurel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're the same size as us. Well, the same size we normally are. Protocol Atom uses a shrink ray to miniaturize and neutralize potential threats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel's eyes widened with realization. \"So we are tiny on a giant couch on another Earth? That's a goddamn phenomenal security system you've built Felicity. No one will ever be able to break in and hurt you because you'll get yourself killed first!\" Laurel yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are definitely still some kinks to work out...\" Felicity admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinks! This is not a joke Felicity, we could be in serious danger here! We have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK, CLACK, CLACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel's yelling was interrupted by a rhythmic loud clacking noise, getting louder with every successive impact. The source of the noise was soon revealed, as a gigantic blonde woman walked into the room, dressed in a sweater, miniskirt, and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Laurel asked, trying to hide the fear in her voice. The giantess didn't look threatening, but her enormous size meant she could easily annihilate the tiny women under her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Supergirl, one of this Earth's most powerful heroes.\" Felicity explained. \"Her regular name is Kara though. She is super nice, I'm sure she will help us if we just explain what happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a superhero?\" Laurel asked skeptically. \"She doesn't look like she could hurt a fly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, she is stronger than she looks.\" Felicity replied. \"Now we just have to get her attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try.\" Laurel said, and before Felicity could cover her ears Laurel let out one of her signature canary cries. Felicity found it as deafening as always, but Kara didn't even blink, continuing to go about her routine by kicking off her shoes and placing her bag in her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that girl deaf?\" Laurel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I might be now.\" Felicity replied loudly, ears still ringing from the deafening sound. \"She actually has excellent hearing, she has to actively work to ignore all the random conversations happening around her. I think at our new size your canary cry is just too high pitched to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara reentered the room, this time heading towards the tiny girls. Felicity jumped and waved, calling out to her giant friend. \"Kara! Kara!\" Kara's eyes were clearly scanning the room for something, and they seemed to lock right onto the tiny woman. \"Oh Kara, I'm so glad you saw us....\" Felicity to began, only to have her hopes dashed as Kara grabbed the TV remote off the coffee table just in front of them. With the push of a button, the TV was on, and the noise from that drowned out any yelling they could possibly do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Laurel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butt!\" Felicity stammered, pointing up past Laurel. The tiny canary turned around to see what Felicity was pointing to, and just as she said, there was a giant ass hanging over them, blocking out the light like an eclipse. As Kara flipped up her skirt, the tiny girls got a good look at a pair of enormous pale butt cheeks, wrapped in a pair of pink panties. And then those cheeks were speeding down towards the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of the tiny girls took the brunt of a different cheek. Felicity was pinned right in the center of her left butt cheek, her face buried in the soft skin of the Kryptonian rear end, whereas Laurel was fortunate enough to have an admittedly thin pair of panties separating her from the world's strongest woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity tried to wiggle free, hoping she could slide out from under the giant cheek and get her friend's attention. This quickly proved hopeless though. The usually light Kara was far too heavy for Felicity to shift even an inch, and as she sunk into the soft butt flesh bearing down on her, every possible route of escape she could take was blocked by impenetrable skin. All she could do was hope she'd be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel made no attempt to escape. Given the choice between fight or flight, she had chosen fight, and was actively attacking the ass that was pressing down on her, scratching and kicking with what little freedom she had to move her limbs. What Laurel didn't realize was that to a Kryptonian, these strikes were effectively nonexistant. Kara couldn't feel a thing as she settled into the couch, excited to see she was just in time to catch the beginning of her favorite show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny duo spent 15 minutes struggling, sure that any second would be the one where Kara wondered what was squirming under her butt and found them. But it was becoming increasingly clear that Kara was not going to notice them, and they could easily spend all evening as cushions. Frustrated, Laurel let loose another canary cry, point blank against the giant butt. It didn't so much as make a ripple in her incredibly strong skin. In fact, Kara thought it was just a draft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, a little drafty in here.\" Kara mumbled. \"I should get my PJs on.\" Not wanting to miss a second of her show, she sped away at lightning speed, carrying Felicity with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity!\" Laurel yelled, but she had vanished, stuck to the giant Kryptonian butt cheek when Kara had rushed away. And then, as fast as it had disappeared, the giant Kryptonian's butt was back, this time covered by a pair of flannel pajama pants. \"Not again!\" Laurel yelled in frustration, just in time for a now pajama clad ass to slam down on top of her, once again pinning her under a butt cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity was even more overwhelmed. She had been dragged away when Kara stood up, felt a brief gust of wind as Kara removed her skirt and panties, and then she found herself in the dark. Then the avalanche of ass came down on her as Kara sat down. As Kara's butt flesh settled down on her again, she realized what had happened: Kara had changed into pajama pants at super speed, and she was now trapped inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled, happy she hadn't missed anything important. She shifted a little to one side, dragging her butt along the couch as she did so. This do much more than annoy Laurel, who hated having this giant girl unknowingly rub her butt across her face. But for Felicity, it meant sliding away from the relative safety of Kara's gigantic butt cheek and towards Kara's crack. She was now looking up into the dark depths of Kara's butt, saved only by her left arm which remained pinned under Kara's left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurel! Help me! I'm going to get pulled inside!\" Felicity screamed, her shrill cry reaching Laurel's ears despite the ample butt flesh in between them. Laurel was unnerved by the fear in her friend's voice. Felicity wasn't very strong, but she didn't scare easily, so she could only imagine what was going on inside those pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Felicity! I'll get you out of there!\" Laurel yelled, not sure how she could possibly do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Alex arrives at the apartment, and Kara scoots over to make room for her sister, allowing Alex to sit on Laurel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara puts her feet up and makes herself comfortable, drawing Laurel under her butt crack and Felicity deeper into her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara finishes watching TV and heads into the kitchen to make herself dinner, with Felicity along for the ride.</span></div></div>",

He may have been the Spectre now, but to them he was still the friend and hero who they had known for years. He had been an inspiration to them both, and now he was gone for good. Pulling themselves together, they walked solemnly back towards the remaining Paragons, rejoining their exhausted comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he's really gone.\" Barry said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seemed like a good man. And he died an honorable death.\" Kate said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah quit it with the waterworks.\" Lex cut in, annoyed at the outpouring of emotion for this man he didn't even know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it Lex.\" Kara said. \"Oliver was twice the man you'll ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, Ollie was a great man. He died fighting for us to have a new world, now we have to protect it.\" Sara said, turning to face the blackness off the edge of the platform that was the Dawn of Time. In the distance, she could see a tiny speck forming, the seed of the new world that Oliver had died for. In this new world, anything was possible. They knew it would be similar to their own, but anything could change. As Barry saw the brightness of the explosion, he wished he could just be close to Iris again. Sara was thinking of how hard it must be for Felicity with no one to support her now that Oliver was gone. And Kara was thinking of how much she missed her sister Alex. None of them knew what this new universe had in store as it exploded with a boom, beginning to rapidly expand. They were witnessing the Big Bang in person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, as the universe suddenly expanded around them and time began to race forward, space and time were not quite in sync by the time they reached the 7 paragons. The universe grew much faster than the paragons could hope to keep up with, and they were whisked away in the incoming wave of matter, unsure what to expect on the other side. They certainly didn't expect to wake up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. 1 millimeter tall, on top of a recliner in Felicity's new apartment in Star City where she is raising her and Oliver's Daughter Mia, just as she enters the room. Kara being the only one able to fly, escape's Felicity's falling bum when she goes to sit down and must somehow get her attention whilst no bigger than a gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. 1 centimeter tall, on the floor in Alex' apartment, just as her girlfriend Kelly returns from grocery shopping, taking it upon herself to do some exterminating, causing the Paragon's to flee, using their unique abilities to avoid being crushed by the gigantic woman before Alex comes to their rescue, interrupting Kelly mid-stomp after she corners one of the supposed bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. 1 inch tall, scattered throughout the apartment of a giant Iris as she was getting ready for work. This first chapter would focus on J'onn and Sara being trapped under her feet in her slippers and Lex being devoured as a piece of granola in her yogurt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kara Danvers, alias Supergirl, hurried into the office building where she worked, carrying a coffee in a cardboard tray. She walked into her boss's room and set the tray down on the desk. The lights were on in the skyscraper, but she was the only one on the floor right now. That would change sooner or later, she knew. One the few powers that she could use relatively freely was her x-ray vision, and with it she had seen some of her coworkers taking the elevator on the way up. But given that her boss -- the one and only Cat Grant -- had a tendency to arrive fashionably late, there was probably plenty of time to laze around before she arrived. While Supergirl was very publicly a hard and dedicated worker, Kara Danvers was practically invisible, a fixture in the office-place. As long as she was standing at attention at the proper spot when the boss arrived, and as long as she didn't break or steal anything, she had free reign of the office in the small hours. And so Supergirl turned her attention to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather aesthetically-pleasing sort of office -- with lots and lots of white. A couple of white lamps with white lampshades rested on the white desk (one on a white platform above the white desk), while on the opposite end there was a white vase filled with white flowers. In the middle was a white laptop, and behind the desk was a white wainscot. The rest of the room was painted in a dull shade of white. Practically the only bits of color in the whole room were the chairs and the televisions, which were turned off. However, as Supergirl walked closer to the television screens, she could just barely make out a faint red glow on the wall immediately underneath one of the sets. Whatever it was, it wasn't there before today. The Kryptonian tried to see what it was by pressing her face against the space of wall between the televisions, but the source of the red glow appeared to be on the back rim of the screen itself. Without really thinking about it, Kara went over to the offending television set and wedged her hand between the wall and the screen to see if she could remove the source of the red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers brushed against something sticky. A burning wave passed through her body, and it suddenly felt like every fiber of her was on fire. She withdrew her hand, and saw the glowing, reddish substance coating her fingertips. It had a viscosity vaguely like Jell-O, and had little flecks of what might have been some sort of stone sprinkled and suspended in the bright jelly. And it was incredibly painful for her to hold. It must be some form of Kryptonite, or possibly some other kind of radioactive substance. But what was it doing here? Who put it there? Why? Kara's mind reeled with questions whose answers wouldn't help now. The office began to swim in her now-blurry vision. The desk and everything in it started to spin in a confusing, disorienting, blinding whirlwind. Flash after flash of bright white light dazzled her eyes. Kara blinked and shook her head. She could barely keep her balance in her dizziness. Her legs turned to jelly, her knees buckled, and she pitched forward. She came to a sudden stop on something soft, a great big brown lump in the midst of all this madness. A big brown lump that was growing bigger and bigger by the second. Kara, with the last coherent bits of her brain, tried to rally and crawled on to the brown mass. Then her vision was eaten away at the corners and she fell against the seat of the chair, finally unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kara woke up, her first sight was of her curled legs, which she was hugging tightly. She slowly relaxed her muscles and extended her legs, getting out of the fetal position that she had unawaredly gotten herself into. Then she took stock of her surroundings. It looked like she was in a much, <i>much</i> larger version of Cat's office. Then she heard the elevator ding, and the general hubbub of people storming in, but at a magnified scale. She had shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard another sound; a massive BEEP, and then metal doors sliding open. Stylish high heels clacked on the floor, the noise getting louder as the giantess got closer; it was Cat Grant, Kara's boss, about to sit in the chair Kara was stuck on. Realizing her situation, the tiny Kryptonian got unsteadily to her feet and jumped upwards in an attempt to fly off. But instead of achieving liftoff, she fell right back down onto the fabric. She bounced once, twice, and then when she flopped down on it for a third time, the thick fabric of the chair embraced her, swaying in a motion too small to be perceived by the naked eye. Cat Grant was very close now. Kara quickly scrambled to an upright position, but she could do nothing. That... gunk... must have not only shrunk her, but also taken away some of her powers -- if not all of them, at least her flight. And unfortunately for Kara, the ability to fly was perhaps the one thing she needed the most right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat Grant pulled out the chair, took a quick step forward, and sat down. Kara did not scream as she saw the looming hindquarters of her boss suddenly twist above her before they plummeted downwards with her at ground zero on the brown chair. Instead, she fell back flat against the cushion, hoping most of the weight would be transferred to the seat instead of directly on Kara's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the diminutive Kara woke up, she found herself forced deeper into the small depression that she had made in the seat. Her boss's rear was slowly pressing down on her, but the pressure was evenly distributed across the chair. There was even just enough room for Kara to breathe. After she had gotten over the shock of just where she was, the shrunken Supergirl began banging her fists on Cat Grant's behind. But the affluent journalist gave no sign that she felt the barrage, if she even felt it all. Eventually, Kara had exhausted herself pummeling at her boss's gigantic rear. She slumped down further, defeated. Then it was Cat's turn. The unaware giantess began to shift and squirm minutely in her chair. The motion would be imperceptible to most onlookers, and was almost that way for Cat, but for Kara it seemed as though an entire third of what she could see suddenly slid along the fabric of the chair, making a light skidding sound in the process that to the shrunken Kryptonian was a deafening roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cat shifted in the other direction, and the loud, grating screech of fabric on fabric came back. Kara noticed that as her boss's immense rear returned and slid to the other side, it clipped the edges of Kara's little refuge, taking a small portion of the indentation and smoothing it out, forcing Kara ever so slightly closer to the crushing force of Cat Grant's behind. Then the giantess repeated the motion, and Supergirl came closer. And closer. And closer... Kara was now mere millimeters from the shifting, squirming mass. Any closer and she'd be in the blast zone. Shuddering at what she was about to do, Kara placed her hand firmly on her boss's behind and shoved with all her might. The tiny Kryptonian groaned and strained with effort. Miniscule beads of sweat started to form on her miniaturized body. She put her all into one enormous push...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat Grant, for the time span of about five seconds, was about an inch taller than usual, but she didn't consciously notice this seemingly-inexplicable feat. Instead, she felt like there was another, more pronounced lump in the center of her chair. To combat this, she gripped the edge of her seat in both hands and used them as leverage as she settled her rear further back in the soft brown fabric of the cushion. Even with her entire weight on top of the one miniscule speck, the lump managed to resist for several seconds before collapsing inwards along the line of the chair. Cat Grant wiggled a little just to make sure that it was gone, and crossed her legs. A brief thought flickered in her mind about that lump -- she'd have to check that chair eventually to make sure that there were not going to be any more of those pesky lumps in the future. The rich girl and unaware giantess shook her head almost imperceptibly, making a mental note to call for a repairman later, then disregarded all further thoughts about the lump. She scooted forward about an inch, leaned towards the desk, and set about her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara was defeated. Even though she still apparently had a measure of her superpowers left, what was left had been scaled down and was now useless to her, now that she was firmly embedded in the crater of her own boss's behind with neither escape nor respite in the foreseeable future. But that wasn't going to stop her from trying. Futilely, pathetically, the shrunken Kryptonian crawled forward, dragging herself slowly in a direction that she could only hope led to \"out\", knowing that if Cat even so much as leaned back she would be trapped. And so she inched along with quiet desperation, fervently wishing the wealthy woman would sit still for just a few minutes more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, far above, the aforementioned woman was in fact feeling slightly uncomfortable. Possibly it was that lump she had felt before. But it would undignified for her to stand up and squat at her desk just because she was feeling a little discomfort, especially since -- despite her best efforts -- anyone on the level could walk right into her office. She should just ignore the lump, and focus on her work. But on the other hand the lump really was beginning to bother her, and one small check couldn't hurt, right? The most powerful women in National City continued shifting in her chair, uncrossing her legs as she thought about the dilemma for a few seconds, eyes staring off into space. Then, as her mind gravitated back to Earth, she decided on a course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Cat continues sitting on the chair and Kara as she fulfills her duties as CEO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Cat feels something moving under her and finds Kara, deciding to reassign her to a new job.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Mon El awoke, he found himself in an unfamiliar environment. The last thing he remembered was approaching Kara at the DEO, wanting to speak to her about what had transpired between them. The memory ended abruptly with a sudden flash of light, after which he must have passed out. Now he was laying on a warm pale surface. Wherever he was, he could tell Kara must be there too somewhere, as he could smell the familiar scent of her body lotion nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're finally awake little prince.\" Boomed a familiar voice from above. Looking up towards it, Mon El found himself staring into a pair of gigantic blue eyes belonging to none other than Kara herself. Somehow, her face was now massive, taking up most of his field of view. And the pale surface he was standing on was her open hand, fingers unfurled to make a sort of platform. Somehow, he had shrunken. \"How'd you sleep?\" Kara inquired, a playful smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon El guessed by Kara's lack of reaction to his predicament that she was not at all surprised by his new stature. \"What happened to me Kara? How did I get so small?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy one Mon El. I shrunk you.\" Kara said, letting out a little giggle at Mon El's look of shock. \"I decided that you needed to be taught a lesson, and I'm going to be the one to teach it to you. You lied to me about who you are and where you came from, and despite being here for months, you never told me the truth. I'm supposed to be your girlfriend Mon El. We are supposed to tell each other everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon El knew she was right, and bowed his head in shame. However, that did not clarify why exactly he was tiny. \"I know what I did was wrong Kara! But why shrink me? How does that accomplish anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an easy one little guy. That lesson I mentioned earlier? I'm going to teach you how to be a supportive boyfriend. And the way I'm going to do that is by making you support me for a while.\" Kara said with a knowing smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by support you?\" Mon El asked anxiously, not sure he would like the response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question Mon El. In general, I basically mean doing whatever I ask you to do for as long as you're tiny. But for right now, I mean you'll be supporting my weight by acting as the insole of my right boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious Kara!\" Mon El yelled, looking nervously down into the gigantic red boot below. \"You're going to crush me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby Mon-El. You and I both know that it'll take more than my foot to crush a Daxamite like yourself. You'll be fine.\" Kara said, dangling her tiny boyfriend over the entrance to the boot. \"Of course, if I decide I like having you in there and keep you down there for a while, I'll have to be sure to take you out once a week or so, that way you get some sun. Wouldn't want your little solar battery to run dry.\" Kara teased, having no intention of doing anything that cruel. After all, angry or not, she was still Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mon El could object further, Kara released her grip on her tiny boyfriend, sending him careening downwards into the gigantic red boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider this a first step in learning to be a supportive boyfriend.\" Kara teased, wiggling her toes tauntingly over the entrance to the boot. \"Sure, you'll just be supporting my foot, but that's a pretty good start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon-El's shouting went ignored as his view of Kara's face disappeared entirely, replaced only with a rapidly approaching foot. His girlfriend's well pedicured toes slid gracefully downward into the boot, before turning to move forward towards the shrunken prince. He realized he ought to start running away as the 5 monstrous toes charged towards him, but he did so too late to make it to the toe of her boot in time. Instead, her gigantic toes effortlessly plowed through him, knocking him flat on his face as they sailed past him, leaving behind nothing but the endless pale wall of Kara's sole. It hung over him for a moment, taunting him with the knowledge of what was coming next. Then without any warning, it descended, pinning the tiny prince beneath the ball of his girlfriend's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.... You actually feel pretty nice under there Mon-El. You might not be much of a boyfriend or a hero, but you have the makings of a wonderful insole.\" Kara said with a smile, very much appreciating the power she felt over miniature Mon El. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Mon El had no idea she was smiling, and could only barely make out what she was saying. All of his senses were completely and totally overwhelmed by one thing and one thing only, Kara's foot. His face was buried in the ball of her foot, which was already coated in a thin sheen of sweat after a day cooped up in the heroine's signature red boots. Boots of which he was now an unwilling occupant. He tried to pull his face away, but there was nowhere for it to go. Behind his head was the well worn insole of his girlfriend's shoes, and in front there was nothing but the sweaty foot flesh of National City's superhero, pressing into his tiny body with unrelenting force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, these boots were made for walking though.\" Kara said, lifting her foot into the air slowly, wanting to savor her first step. For the tiny Mon El, he felt like he was on a roller-coaster that was slowly rising towards a peak, well aware that the relative calm was about to suddenly end. Her foot was no longer pressed against his face, giving him about a centimeter of air between him and sweaty Kryptonian feet. But then the foot began to descend, and the force of its descent pressed his face into his girlfriend's sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot struck the ground with a slap, smacking his back down into the sole of the boot once more as the avalanche of foot flesh overtakes him, her soft sole flowing around and enveloping him in foot flesh. His sense of smell was overwhelmed by the combination of sweaty feet and Kara's foot lotion, his sense of touch taken over by sweaty foot flesh pressed against every inch of his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was only the first of many steps. As Kara lifted her other foot, this put all of her weight on the foot Mon El was supporting, truly making him feel like he was going to be squished into the sole of the red boot. But before he met it, the foot he was under was the one being lifted, just to be slammed down once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kara continued to walk, taking a short break only to get in the elevator and ride up to the DEO roof. When she got there and was once again alone (other than her tiny boyfriend turned foot cushion), she spoke to Mon El: \"You're doing great so far Mon El. I think this is going to be the beginning of a wonderful arrangement. Unfortunately, I can't do my patrol on foot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon El gasped with relief as Kara's weight suddenly lifted off of him. He thought she was taking her boots off, but in fact she was the one taking off. She was now flying through the air, leaving the tiny Mon El in the strange situation of laying atop her now upside down sole. It was far from paradise, but the tiny Daxamite sighed with relief now that he could finally breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Kara spotted a bank robbery in progress on the street below. She was hundreds of feet in the air, but her super vision allowed her to see things going on on the ground with bear perfect clarity. Smiling at the chance to get some action in, Kara began a speedy descent, turning her feet towards the ground to prepare for impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer landing struck Mon El like a freight train. When Kara landed quickly enough, it often left boot marks in concrete. This time was no different, except that Mon El was there to feel the brunt of the collision. Her foot drove his head backwards into the dingy sole of the boot so hard that he instantly was knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kara was upset when she felt her little boyfriend pass out, she really couldn't blame him. It was his first day as an insole after all, and he was trapped under the sole of the most powerful girl on Earth. It would take time for him to get used to that. Ignoring him for now, she put on a stern face for the bank robbers who were now quivering in fear before her and began to advance towards them. They'd be going to prison for a long time, but Mon El would have traded places with them in a heart beat. He couldn't imagine a worse prison than Kara's boot. Unfortunately for him, Kara still had a few other ideas in mind for him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mon El awoke, where did he find himself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Still trapped beneath Kara's foot, but now in one of her heels while she works at Catco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. On the coffee table in Kara's apartment, sitting before a pajama clad Kara and Alex who were about to begin girls night (maybe they sit on him during a movie, make him avoid getting eaten with their popcorn, play some kind of dare game with him, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Frozen in an ice cube so that only his head was sticking out, and floating in Kara's drink at the alien bar.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours had passed since Mon-El passed out inside of Kara\u2019s boot, still his body spent a fair amount of time under the blonde Kryptonian\u2019s naked toes. Being stomp, stood on, and curled between her perfect feet. Even outside of her boot Mon-El was still able to detect the aroma of her Vanilla scented lotion as he regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side Mon-El was no longer trapped under Kara Danver\u2019s foot, however he quickly realised that he was no longer just Kara he was dealing with at his new size. After waking up on top of Kara\u2019s Coffee table Mon-El noticed not only Kara but also Alex Danver\u2019s sitting across from him on his girlfriends couch. They appeared to be laughing it up like two schoolgirls as Kara retold the story of how she\u2019d dropped Mon-El inside of her boot earlier and what he felt like fight back against her foot. Alex made a joke about how she thought her work boots for the DEO could use a new insole and Kara was quick to offer Mon-El the honor of filling the position. Of course that was before they realised Mon-El had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, you're up.\u201d Kara said, smiling down at the shrunken Daxamite as if she wasn\u2019t just offering him as an insole for her human step-sister. One thing he\u2019d noticed was that both Kara and Alex were in their Pajamas which most likely meant that Alex wouldn\u2019t be leaving anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to tell you this Mon-El but you failed your first test at being a supportive boyfriend when you passed out under my feet. Maybe I\u2019ll give you another chance tomorrow or even let you spend the day under Alex\u2019s feet instead.\u201d Kara announced, leaving Mon-El horrified. He already passed out once under her feet without getting injured and she wanted to put him right back under them so soon. Even worse she proposed putting him under her sister\u2019s feet without his consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways me and Alex are gonna have ourselves a girl\u2019s night and for lack of a better option we\u2019ve decided that you\u2019ll be joining us. Alex, any ideas?\u201d Kara asked, leaving Mon-El confused as he turned to the short haired brunette. He found her gaze focused on him as she stood up alongside Kara, making him somehow feel smaller than he already was now that he was forced to look up at both of these strong females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually\u2026\u201d Alex paused, looking down at Mon-El and then back to the couch her and Kara were just sitting on. \u201cI think I have a perfect idea for how we could kick things off.\u201d Alex smiled, holding back a fit of giggles as she whispered something in Kara\u2019s ears so Mon-El couldn\u2019t overhear their conversation, afterwards Kara laid down on her stomach on top of the couch smiling over at her tiny boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex turned to Mon-El and reached down towards the coffee table, scooping the shrunken Daxamite up with ease despite his best efforts to resist her. She closed her fingers around the tiny alien, creating a fist with him at the center. Mon-El bounced between Alex\u2019s fingers as he tried to escape, unable to see any light or find out what the girls were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without any word of warning Alex unfurled her fingers in one swift motion, sending Mon-El falling towards to couch. But that wasn\u2019t all, before he would reach the couch Mon-El noticed two pale moons in the form of Kara\u2019s ass clad in a light blue thong eagerly waiting to catch him. Mon-El bounced off one of Kara\u2019s ass cheeks, only to be catapulted onto the other satellite, sustaining no injuries on his way down. Now Mon-El was laying around the most powerful ass on Earth, having no doubts that he wasn\u2019t going to like whatever happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d Mon-El asked, still not seeming to grasp that these girls had total control over him and would do whatever they wanted. Even Kara\u2019s human stepsister was able to control him with ease given the immense size difference between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. I decided that the best way for you to apologize to Kara for passing out under her foot is too kiss her ass.\u201d Alex announced, leaving Mon-El horrified. Did she really expect him to do such a thing? Moreover was Kara expecting him to do the same as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way! Are you two crazy or something?\u201d Mon-El asked, thinking there was no way he\u2019d allow himself to be persuaded into kissing his giant girlfriends ass. Little did Mon-El realize that he didn\u2019t exactly have much of a choice in the matter with these two sisters towering over him. He looked to Kara for support but she seemed to be compliant with Alex\u2019s plans, what's more it looked as if she wanted Mon-El to kiss her beautiful butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would he comply and kiss her ass willingly to avoid punishment, or will Alex have to force him to kiss her butt?</span></div></div>",

Why don\u2019t you give it a try and find out, maybe you\u2019ll like it.\u201d Alex teased, motioning her hand towards Kara\u2019s exposed ass cheeks. She put her index finger on the back of Mon-El\u2019s neck and forcefully pushed his face into her sister\u2019s butt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does that feel Kara?\u201d Alex asked as Mon-El screamed into the doughy flesh of Kara\u2019s rear end, all while the shrunken Daxamite fought to escape the weight of Alex\u2019s finger threatening to break his neck. However his blows against Kara\u2019s ass were small and were hardly noticed by the gigantic Kryptonian as she and her Earthling sister made fun of Mon-El\u2019s situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels great honestly, better than I would have thought.\u201d Kara smiled, looking back over her shoulder at Mon-El on her ass. Even with her incredible hearing abilities she couldn\u2019t quite make out what Mon-El was trying to say. Instead she only heard his tiny screams muffled by her flesh, maybe that was a sign that she should lay off all the donuts and junk food. Not that she gained any weight as a Kryptonian on Earth that is, her body was in perfect form and now Mon-El was suffering because of that fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hear that Mon-El, you better keep it up or else I\u2019ll make you you regret not listening to us. Of course if you don\u2019t start kissing her butt I\u2019ll simply arrange for you to spend the movie inside of my stomach instead, personally I think the former is in your best interest.\u201d Alex announced, willing to go as far as swallowing Mon-El alive if he didn\u2019t obey her commands. The short haired brunette woman pushed her finger deeper into Kara\u2019s butt flesh, dragging Mon-El\u2019s face and most of his upper body along with it in order to emphasis her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get to work.\u201d Alex said as she pulled her hand back quickly, this caused Mon-El\u2019s to be bounced up into the air. However it was only a matter of time before gravity played its role, sending him falling back onto Kara\u2019s exposed butt cheek. The soft flesh absorbed the impact, causing his body to make several small bounces off her rear end as if Kara\u2019s ass was a trampoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d Mon-El muttered to himself so Alex wouldn\u2019t hear him, unable to believe that someone like him blessed with extraordinary powers on this planet could be so easily dominated by a normal human. Even if she was as tall as a skyscraper. Still he came to understand that upsetting her wasn\u2019t in his best interest and reluctantly motioned to kiss Kara\u2019s flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime and time again his lips pursed together to kiss Kara\u2019s naked buttcheek, after five or six times he looked over at Alex to see whether or not she was satisfied. He might have been doing this too Kara but in this instance her opinion of whether or not he was doing a good job was more important. However before he could lock eyes with the gigantic DEO agent he found himself faced with her middle finger held back by her thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember telling you that you could stop.\u201d Before he could say a word or move Alex\u2019s finger shot forward with a powerful flick, hitting Mon-El square in the chest and sending him flying. Although what caught Mon-El was not what you\u2019d expect, he thought for certain that he would have landed on Kara\u2019s other buttcheek. That way he could kiss that one as well, nevertheless he was still surprised when his body was caught not by Kara\u2019s soft flesh but an even softer surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fabric of Kara\u2019s thong that had caught him, ensnaring his arms and legs as he struggled to break free. This would prove to be his own downfall as he looked over to see that it was Alex who was holding Kara\u2019s thong away from the rest of her ass in addition to flicking him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for stopping, now you can spend some time inside of Kara\u2019s thong while we watch a movie.\u201d Alex announced as she pulled at Kara\u2019s thong even further, stretching out the fabric and giving Mon-El an aerial view of Kara\u2019s beautiful bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Mon-El it wouldn't be long before he'd return to the warm embrace of Kara's ass, although he quickly realised that he wouldn't be so lucky just to be resting on her cheek. No, instead this time he'd be spending time between the two mounds of flesh as Alex released her fingers grip on her sister's underwear. Before he even realised what was going on Mon-El\u2019s body was already on a collision course with Kara\u2019s butt crack. He tried to break free but it was already too late, the force of Kara\u2019s thong accelerated him right between The Girl of Steel\u2019s perfect butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, now you can kiss Kara\u2019s butt during the whole movie and if you even think about stopping I\u2019ll be forced to punish you and this time I won\u2019t be so gentle.\u201d Alex threatened, moving away from Kara\u2019s ass and body so her Kryptonian sister would have room to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gently pushed herself off the couch and rose to her full height next to Alex before pulling her pajama pants up her legs so that they once again covered her butt. With Mon-El safely tucked away Alex sat down on the couch first, wanting to watch as Kara sat down next to her so she could imagine what it must have been like for Mon-El as it happened. Then Kara motioned to sit down, unaware for the most part that Alex was watching every moment of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara allowed herself to fall onto the couch, bouncing off the cushion. Her doughy flesh attacking Mon-El from all angles, nearly threatening to crushed him to death. In fact, given Mon-El\u2019s current position under Kara ass between her cheeks one clench of her mighty glutes would surely do the job and end his life. That was obvious to all, most of all Kara who was the only one who could hear Mon-El\u2019s screams coming from underneath her full weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were right Alex, he feels great squirming around between my cheeks. Now hopefully he learned from last time and decides to kiss my butt willingly throughout the movie!\u201d Kara teased, raising her voice in order to ensure that Mon-El would hear her and understand that she wished for him to kiss her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful of what Kara's next move would be after sticking him to her thong and sitting on top of him Mon-El reluctantly began to kiss Kara's inner cheek over and over again, leaving five seconds to pause between each kiss. That way Kara couldn't complain about his pace and he wouldn't have to kiss her ass any more than twelve times per minute. But how long can Mon-El keep this up before he's no longer able to withstand the humiliation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery bounce, readjustment, and movement that Kara made caused her flesh to attack Mon-El with incredible might, it was all he could do just to avoid being crushed. Like being inside of a car compactor, one wrong move was all that stood between him and death. He could try pushing her flesh my kicking and punching but that would most likely only anger Kara more, what's more is the fact that he'd already learned first hand that his weak blows would do nothing more than keep Kara's flesh at bay for a fraction of a second, if even that. He'd have a better chance of breaking the Earth's moon into two seperate pieces with nothing but his fists to aid him. He continued kissing Kara's ass, that is until he could establish a better plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and Mon-El was still at it, kissing Kara\u2019s ass twelve time a minute for thirty minutes for a grand total of three hundred sixty kisses to the flesh of Kara\u2019s butt cheeks. The girls hadn\u2019t even been talking about Mon-El since the movie started, the only things they talked about were things happening on the screen. It was almost as if Mon-El wasn\u2019t even there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefiantly Mon-El decided that he\u2019d had enough of this foolishness kissing Kara\u2019s ass, opening his mouth again. Although this time he wasn\u2019t planning to simply kiss Kara\u2019s beautiful butt, instead he bared his teeth and sunk them into Kara\u2019s flesh. The colossal Kryptonian jumping up from her seat, using every fiber of her being to resist the urge to clench her rear muscles to crush Mon-El between her buttocks like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOww, the little bastard bit me!\u201d Kara exclaimed, catching her sibling off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is he stupid or something? I say it\u2019s long past time we teach him where he stands at that size.\u201d Alex says angry at Mon-El, at the while the shrunken Daxamite had no idea what fresh can of hell he\u2019d unleashed upon himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the girls have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. There's a quarter or so of movie left, so the girls throw him into their popcorn bowl and make him avoid getting eaten as they shovel it into their mouths without looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara pushes Mon El into her asshole up to his waist and tells him to keep kissing, promising to shove him all the way in if he bites her again (now he'll be suspended upside down as she finishes movie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara gives him to Alex for the night to teach him obedience as Kara's toy. Since she is much less kind than Kara has been. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mon-El woke up familiarly, rubbing his swollen forehead as he reminded himself of the situation at hand. He remembered being shrunk by Kara, dropped inside the superheroine's iconic red boots before he mysteriously passed out. Now, hours later, he finds himself contained within a type of glass room. Surrounded by some form of liquid, wondering whether or not Kara had returned him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that, look who finally decided to wake up! What took you so long, little guy?\" Boomed the familiar voice of Kara Danvers, sounding different than before, her voice was higher, and she seemed to be slurring her words. Almost like she was drunk or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just what I need,\" Mon-El mumbles to himself before he felt a shiver run down his spine, wondering why the room was so cold. \"Kara, can't we talk about this? Face to face?\" Mon-El asked, rubbing his hands together for warmth, able to see a blue wall in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, little guy. But, you do realize my eyes are up here, so you can stop staring at my boobs.\" Kara laughed, forcing Mon-El's gaze upwards to the sight of a gigantic Kara Zor El childishly laughing at him. Her size more than doubling since he'd last laid eyes on her, shrinking Mon-El to the tiny size of 1 centimeter tall to help alleviate her boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jvSDj-FCQc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jvSDj-F...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, he found himself floating inside of a glass of Aldebaran Rum, over ice, the only drink Kara has ever been able to get drunk off.  And somehow, she'd managed to trap him inside one of her ice cubes. Judging by the looks of the table and her relaxed demeanor, it was safe to say it wasn't her first glass of the night. Able to spot three more glassed to te giantess alien's right side, all emptied of their contents to the last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Kara? How did you even do this?\" Mon-El asked, banging on the ice cube to try and breakthrough to the other side. His fists not even able to crack the ice as Kara leaned in to watch the show, giggling childishly at the shrunken Daxamite in his newest cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you're so little and cute.\" Kara teased, folding her arms over one another and resting her chin on her wrists to look Mon-El in the eye? His vision of her face distorted by a mix of the glass, ice, and alcohol between them, making her out to look like an enormous monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to look so scared, I won't hurt you. Much.\" Kara laughed, flashing her pearly white teeth, and banging on the table, cautiously holding back her immense strength. Still, the force of the impact was more than strong enough to shake things up for Mon-El as the ice cubes clacked against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara then straightened herself out, sitting up tall over the table before she wrapped her fingers around the glass. Tilting Mon-El's entire world view as she lifted the glass off the table, continuing to enjoy her night out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara, what on Daxam are you doing?\" he asked, as Kara motioned him towards her pink lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, can't a girl have a drink around here without being questioned?\" Kara giggled, puckering her lips before taking a sip from the glass. Mon-El, stumbling inside of the heaviest ice cube, was carried by the current towards Kara's waiting mouth. Through his eyes, gallons then barrels worth of alcohol disappeared down the blonde Kyptonian's throat as he followed it up to her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught him between her lips, allowing him to watch as more alcohol rushed passed his cubicle prison, able to see inside her mouth as the warmth of her lips began to melt the ice around him. Fear creeping in as he imagined himself being eaten alive by his giant girlfriend. \"Kara, please let me out!\" he yelled, not wanting to be swallowed whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't help the situation any by opening her mouth wide enough for the cube to pass through her lips, breathing outwards, and fogging Mon-El's field of vision as her hot breath began to melt the surface of his jail. Even with his vision distorted, the tiny alien had a near-perfect view of the giantess's teeth and long pink tongue, with her uvula twitching at the back of her cavern-like mouth, almost like it was waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it would take was just one push, a simple movement from Kara's wrist, and Mon-El would disappear inside her mouth. Never to be seen again. She could crack the thin barrier of ice protecting the miniature man by shattering it between her teeth or using her tongue to smash him against the pearly white pillars. But she just giggled as the last drop of alcohol slid down her throat, taunting the diminutive Daxamite with a *gulp* followed by a sharp exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara then leveled her glass, allowing Mon-El to fall beneath the surface of her drink. \"Someone seems a little cranky, why don't you take a timeout, little guy? Maybe at the bottom of the glass.\" Kara said firmly, her demeanor changing after Mon-El's screams disrupted her good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for a straw M'Gann had left out for her, peeling off the wrapper and crumpling it into a ball before tossing it off to the side next to her glass. Leading Mon-El to wonder what Kara meant exactly, watching eagerly from below as Kara held the straw between her fingertips, pointing it in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon-El looked up puzzled, wondering what Kara meant by the word \"timeout,\" and what she planned on doing with the plastic straw. The answer quickly came to him as she abruptly thrusts the tip towards him, piercing the ice he couldn't even crack like a mighty spear. The tiny Daxamite fleed into a corner to avoid being hit, the straw landing in front of him with a base large enough for him to squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her powerful lungs, Kara could create a vacuum and suck Mon-El out of the cube with the intensive force of a hurricane, which would allow him to travel straight passed her mouth and right down her esophagus with minimal effort. However, Kara's goal wasn't to harm her shrunken boyfriend, playfully pursing her lips around the opposite end of the straw and blowing a steady air current into the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Mon-El, the Kryptonian woman had spent most of her life learning to control and restrain her otherworldly abilities, able to use the perfect amount of force even while she was inebriated. Her warm alcohol-infused breath whipped Mon-El along the frozen walls of his ice cube prison, sending him into a spiral as the pressure built up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, it became too much, and the ice shot from the tip of Kara's straw, sentencing him to the depths of the alcoholic beverage. Air bubbles rose to the top of her glass while Mon-El's container began to take on the alien brand Rum, weighing him down as it bounced off the curved glass, realizing he might drown it Kara didn't save him soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that outcome didn't appear likely as she laughed hysterically inside her booth, slapping her knee. Finding great satisfaction in Mon-El's torment, a quality that wasn't usually present in her personality, attributing it to the alcohol, and the fact that Kara was a lightweight, despite her resistance to Earth's alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*clink, clink, clink*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon-El bounced off the glass over and over again on the way down, all while alcohol rushed into the cube, weighing it down. Luckily, as the liquids rose to chest level Mon-El capsized, landing upside down and sealing the breach. Giving him some much-needed room to breathe as Kara calmed down, resting her chest against the table as she inserted her straw into her drink. Purposely dropping it in front of her shrunken boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the currents rush to her straw, as Kara intentionally ignored him, sipping quietly on her drink while Mon-El stayed silent. The ice above him slowly getting lower and lower as the minutes passed, making him feel as if the sky was falling on top of him. At the same time, his field of vision clear to reveal more of the bar. It was late, and the place was nearly empty, signaling that Kara was heading towards last call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked her drink dry, down to the last drop, but Kara continued sucking on her straw, trying to pull out more. She leaned back before releasing a powerful burp, shaking the table and drawing the attention of the other patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burrrp! Excuse me.\" Kara laughed, before turning her attention back to Mon-El, reaching down the glass and fishing out the ice cube he was inside. \"Now, whhat shhould I dooo with youu littlle-hiccup, little guy?\" Kara asked, slurring her words as she rolled Mon-El between her fingertips to examine him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMon-El froze, he realized the glass, liquor, and ice had distorted his vision of Kara, making her appear differently, but she was just as big now as she was before. Probably clearing over a thousand feet tall standing upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Kara do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Kara tells Mon-El that she's going to \"carefully\" break him out between her teeth, allowing him to spill out onto her tongue. But, after freeing him, and tasting the excess alcohol, will Kara be able to stop herself from sucking him dry, or will she accidentally send him on a trip to her stomach? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. While talking down to Mon-El, he slips through the hole in the ice, landing on the table in front of Kara. She wouldn't notice right away, giving Mon-El a chance to escape, but will it become more difficult once Kara notices him in front of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara begins to feel bad seeing Mon-el as he shivers inside the ice, offing to warm him up herself by tilting the ice cube towards herself and letting Mon-El fall through the hole she made earlier, landing between her tits. The massive orbs stopping his fall and serving as a means to silence his screams as she gets up to pay her bill and leave. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James Olsen was no stranger where putting his own life at risk for the greater good was concerned, first helping his best friend Clark Kent for years while he protected Metropolis as Superman. Then most recently helping Kara Danvers discover herself as Supergirl, protecting the citizens of National City from Alien threats and escapees from the Kryptonian prison Fort Rozz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as of late James Olsen was no longer content with just helping Kara and Clark from the shadows and donned his own Identity as a Vigilante operating inside National City without Kara's knowledge. With the help of his friend Winn Schott acting as his ally in his ear, Guardian has been fighting human criminals that went unnoticed by Supergirl and Alien threats that flew under the radar of DEO intelligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow James has established himself as a hero all his own to many of the people of National City, proving that humans although not as powerful as Kryptonians were still capable of defending themselves and their cities. With Kara fighting off larger threats and James clearing the streets of lesser threats National City appeared to have entered an short era of peace, that is until the next big threat comes along to endanger the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough there was an even bigger threat after Guardian himself, after having Winn patch his phone into the Police radio frequency to receive updates of nearby crimes James got an alert to a break in taking place at the bank only two blocks away. He almost decided to let the police handle it until he read the second half of the alert and saw that it was an alien breaking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the police might have trouble subduing an alien of unknown strength and abilities James suited up and told himself that it would only be a quick job, seeing no real reason to contact Winn on their private comms channel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later he arrived at the scene of the crime full suited up, the front window had been completely smashed in and there were two empty squad cars parked out front with their lights still flashing. Seconds later an alien woman with red skin and green eyes emerged from the bank wearing human clothing, a white shirt paired with a denim jacket, skinny jeans and knee tall boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared daggers at Guardian as her boots met the street's pavement \"Finally, I've heard about someone besides the Kyptonian protecting this city. Now I can finally get revenge for my brother.\" she said, clearing up that she was actually looking for James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your brother?\" James asked, he'd been responsible for locking up plenty of Aliens but non of which looked like she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now prepare to loss your life.\" She said, looking James directly in his eyes through the slits in his mask. Suddenly he felt off as if everything in the world was tilting sideways, it took all his strength just to remain standing. Slowly this feeling began to fade, only to be replaced with a new even more odd sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around him it quickly became clear what was happening, he was being shrunk. If he got to small then there no way he'd be a match for this women, he had already lost half his height when she started walking towards him. She would crush him like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily at that exact moment a sonic-boom could be heard in the skies above them, spooking the alien woman who ran through a nearby alley as James continued to shrink until he was only an inch tall. Then looking up, he watched as Supergirl descended towards the earths surface like some kind of alien goddess, even more now than before because of her increased size from his point of view. Not only was she capable of jumping a thirty story building, she was practically as tall as one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl of steels boots landed on either side of James with one following shortly after the other, it was dark out and even with the streetlights and the surrounding city lights James was unable to see underneath Kara's famous red skirt. Her face was unfathomably far from him but if she could hear a car crash from a mile away he still figured he'd hear his voice calling out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl, down here!\" He yelled, his voice still disguised by his mask. He waited a moment before Kara turned from left to right, using her X-ray vision to scan the area for whoever was calling her name. However it wasn't until she looked at her feet that she where the sound was coming from, looking closely it appeared to be some kind of human the size of a bug. Much like a man she met recently during her time on Earth 1 named Ray Palmer, he had a suit that allowed him to shrink and return to normal size at will. But that wasn't who was standing between her feet, no it was Guardian? How did he get so small? What was he even doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it for only a few seconds before reaching down to pick him up, it's not like she could just leave him to be stepped on or run over by a car. James didn't resist, he trusted Kara as her fingers gently wrapped around his body and lifted him into the air. She'd trained for years to control her unbelievable strength, so the threat of her smashing him to bits between her fingers was small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Kara do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Gently lift Guardian's mask off to discover it's James, starting off as angry that he'd do something so reckless. Telling him he could've been killed, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The sound of cop cars in the distance provokes Kara to leave the scene of the crime for now with Guardian in tow. Afterwards Kara asks guardian what happened to him and thinks of a way to solve his size problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara reveals that she has known for a while that Guardian was James all along and decides to bring him to the DEO to ask Alex for help in diagnosing why he's shrunk.</span></div></div>",

There waiting for her was she adoptive sister Alex Danvers, the Martian Manhunter J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz, and her long time work companion Winn Schott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's on the schedule for today? Raiding a Cadmus facility? Aliens running amok on the streets? Bank Robbery?\u201d Kara asked, anxious to see some action after spend all of her morning and afternoon in front of her computer typing up a new article for the CatCo newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Kara we\u2019ve come across some interesting Intel on Cadmus as of late, something I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree requires your attention.\u201d J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz said, still disguised as Hank Henshaw who they recently discovered was still alive and working for Cadmus under the code name Cyborg Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we finally know exactly where their base is, or where they might be holding Jeremiah?\u201d Kara asked excitedly, thinking that today might finally be the day that she gets to take down the anti alien organization once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, at least not yet.\u201d Alex said from the corner of the room, still hopeful that her Father could be dragged back onto the side of good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter your fight with Cyborg Superman the DEO was able to recover a piece of his armor that you managed to chip off his arm. From there I was able to hack into some of their files and discovered that their working on a way to track down any alien living on earth. That includes Kryptonians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let them come track me down then. When they do I\u2019ll be ready for a fight.\u201d Kara declared boldly before her team, preparing to leave before she was stopped by her adoptive sister Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand Kara!\u201d Alex yelled, standing up to the Girl of Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand?\u201d Kara said, taking offensive to Alex\u2019s worry for her safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith this program they can track where you live, they can find out where you work and who you really are. They could oust Kara Danvers as Supergirl and you\u2019re human live would be over. Not to mention the constant threat that they can attack you anywhere in National City, we already know that they don\u2019t care about civilian casualties if it means bringing you down.\u201d Alex explained, but Kara was stubborn as she was powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d was all she had to say before flying off into the sun setting sky towards her home where she could get some rest before tracking down Cadmus tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let her do this, if Cadmus is able to attack her at any point or place in the day then she could be hurt or worse, that goes double for civilians.\u201d Alex said, turning to J\u2019onn and Winn for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but we can\u2019t stop her. She\u2019s too powerful.\u201d J\u2019onn said, knowing that even he couldn\u2019t subdue Kara if she was that determined to go on as if nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if she wasn\u2019t, there\u2019s always the device in evidence locker #375-7J.\u201d Alex said, turning to J\u2019onn in the hopes that he\u2019d approve what she had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat device? There\u2019s a device that can beat Supergirl?\u201d Winn asked, surprised that the DEO had such a powerful weapon on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly not, It could weaken her considerably but not defeat her. We used it once to help contain the larger aliens that escaped Fort Rozz. Are you sure about this Alex?\u201d J\u2019onn briefly explained before questioning Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I don\u2019t think we have a choice. We can work on taking down Cadmus\u2019s tracking device in the meantime.\u201d Alex assured, confirming that she was willing to do whatever it took to protect her alien adopted sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, come with me then\u2026\u201d J\u2019onn said solemnly before leading Alex to retrieve the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Next Morning---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara awoke happily the following morning, ready to assume her alternate persona as Supergirl and take Cadmus down. However she soon discovered this was easier said than done as she struggled to get out from underneath her blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d Kara said aloud, recalling memories from her childhood on Krypton when she was a child. Back in those days she\u2019d struggle every morning to get out of bed, of course that was before the Earth\u2019s yellow sun gave her super strength and the rest of her incredible powers. Did this mean that she\u2019d lost her powers again, or was something else to blame for this strange phenomena?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer quickly shifted to the latter as Kara attempted to fly out of her bed, discovering that as she rose up her blanket continued to pull her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d Kara said under her breath, thinking that her blanket seemed bigger than it usually was for some reason. Although she soon after convinced herself that she must\u2019ve been mistaken, there\u2019s no way her blanket could have grown so dramatically overnight. Be that as it may Kara discovered after finally tossing her blanket to the side that something had caused the opposite to happen to her. Rather than her blanket growing in size, she had somehow been shrunk. The apartment she had lived in for years now made almost unrecognizable by its immense size, everything from her furniture to her socks dwarfing the shrunken Kryptonian. However her possessions weren\u2019t the only things surrounding her that were now gigantic when compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re finally up.\u201d said a familiar female voice, one that Kara had known for as long as she lived on Earth. Spinning around Kara came to the obvious conclusion that it was Alex Danvers sitting on her bed behind her. She was huge, maybe even as tall as the CatCo headquarters building that she worked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, what\u2019s going on here? Why are you so big, and why am I so small?\u201d Kara asked, placing her hands on her hips promptly expecting an explanation for her current size situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first of I\u2019m not big. You\u2019re just really small, and the reason for that is that I maybe, kinda convinced J\u2019onn to let me shrink you for your own good. Just until we take out the Cadmus alien detection satellite.\u201d Alex explained, hoping it would be easier for Kara to forgive her for shrinking her than it would have been to ask her to willingly go along with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u203d Are you kidding me, what made you think that I\u2019d be okay with this?\u201d Kara yelled, her face turning bright red as she attempted to scold her now giant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would, that\u2019s why I had to do it while you were still asleep. Otherwise you might have tried to get away from me and I couldn\u2019t have contained you.\u201d Alex explained, thinking Kara would understand why she had to do this soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean contain me?\u201d Kara asked not liking the way Alex phrased her last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that, we have reason to believe that the alien detection satellite can see through concrete, steel, and possibly even lead from space. However according to our calculations it can\u2019t detect alien DNA when surrounded by human flesh.\u201d Alex trailed off, preparing herself to say the part of her plan she was sure Kara would like the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you plan on putting me between your toes?\u201d Kara asked, half joking and half concerned that she might have been right. Looking down at her sister\u2019s socked feet, Alex was always wearing combat boots so she didn\u2019t imagine that they smelled very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, for this plan to work you need to be one hundred percent covered in human flesh. For that reason you\u2019ll be kept safe between my butt-cheeks.\u201d Alex blushed, looking towards Kara who had turned bright red, although for the tiny Kryptonian is was not a reaction from being embarrassed but rather a mix of embarrassment and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, there is no way I\u2019m going anywhere near your giant butt while I\u2019m this small.\u201d Kara said, attempting to fly away. Marking the end of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless Alex was determined to protect Kara and those she cared about, reaching out and grabbing Kara out of mid air in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you doing? Let me go!\u201d Kara yelled, finding herself unable to break free of Alex\u2019s iron like grip. Is this what she was like to normal humans? A powerful supreme being who can easily manhandle their species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about this but you leave me no other choice.\" Alex stated as she got off Kara's bed and stood up, unbuckling her jeans as the shrunken Kara fought from within her fist like an angry hornet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara only got a peek of what was in store for her as Alex quickly shoved her hand down the back of her pants, worried that Kara might successfully escape if given the opportunity. She then slammed her open palm against her bare right cheek, using her fingers to push Kara between her butt cheeks with ease, clenching them together as tightly as she could to keep her in place while she adjusted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large spherical orbs of butt flesh overcoming the tiny alien's might with overwhelming power, even after Alex had buttoned and zipped up her jeans they held tight around Kara's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Kara wasn't the type of Superhero to go down without putting up a fight, furiously she began attacking Alex's butt flesh while yelling out at her adoptive sister to let her out. Despite that fact she learned that her super strength would not help her here as Alex's flesh absorbed her blows one after another like they were nothing. Alex didn't admit it openly because she knew it wouldn't make Kara feel any better but it actually felt pretty good, almost like she was receiving a tiny massage from the once powerful Supergirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Alex walked towards the door, shaking up her butt with each step. This completely negated any progress Kara might have made in escaping her sister's butt, dragging her closer towards Alex's butt hole while she continuously tried her best to escape her massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Alex going?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex was granted time-off from her job at the DEO while she dealt with Supergirl, deciding to spend her first day off in her usual manner. Spending time with her favorite sister, not that Alex gave Kara much of an option in the matter after forcefully shoving the tiny blonde down the back of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have stayed at Kara's apartment, but for some reason, she didn't feel welcome after her disagreement with the Kryptonian living there. Deciding to take Kara back to her apartment for a change, where they could still do some of their favorite activities together, such as watching movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Kara would still have to stay between Alex's butt-cheeks, so more accurately, she'd be watching movies on top of Kara while sitting on her. The brunette woman laughed at the concept, fully aware that Kara would not be happy with such an arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kara was furious, still pounding away at her adoptive Earth sister's butt flesh with her tiny fists, assuming that she was the cause of Alex's sudden laughter. The short brown-haired woman's rear cheeks still confining Kara's movements to a single area within her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flesh continued to bully the shrunken Kryptonian with each step as if Kara was no more than a piece of butt lint, trapped until Alex decided to let her out. But, without sunlight, Kara was losing to strength to keep on fighting, and soon found herself overpowered by the twin spheres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was hardly surprised, expecting that something like this would happen pretty early on after shrinking Kara. Without yellow sunbeams to fuel her otherworldly powers, Supergirl would be as weak as any other human. Still, the brunette agent mourned the loss of her personal butt massager, now that her battery was running low, though it was nice while it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Alex knew Kara better than anyone. When backed into a corner, she always managed to find more power. She just needed some motivation. They weren't too far from her place at this point. Surely, Kara could go a few more rounds against the giant buttocks, as a favor for protecting her from the evil organization Cadmus, Alex thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street, Alex began to tighten her glutes around Kara, able to feel her whole body perfectly within her cheeks. She wasn't just doing it to be mean either, Kara had been attacking her flesh nonstop ever since she placed her inside of her buttcrack, this was simply a way for her to get even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kara certainly didn't see it this way, as she was entombed in Alex's butt flesh, the malleable cheeks filling every nook and cranny surrounding her tiny form. Kryptonian's still needed air to breathe, so she was left with two options, either continue fighting off Alex's cheeks, or suffocate within them until she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways one to fight an uphill battle, Kara pursued the former, clenching her fist tightly and landing a solid blow against Alex's left cheek, not that she could tell her lefts from her rights anymore. Provoking Alex to suddenly tense her cheeks up completely, not prepared for the tiny alien's moon-based assault. But the Girl of Steel would not go down so easily, using all of her muscles to fend off the encroaching walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to pay to much attention to her ass while they were still in public, Alex continued her walk home. Meanwhile, a reinvigorated Kara continued to furiously massage her Earth-born sister's butt with her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was pleased with herself, thinking of the torture as a little mischief between siblings. It also gave her a rare opportunity to teach Kara a lesson by show of force, if she doesn't want to be attacked by an eighty-foot-tall ass, then she should go picking a fight with it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex arrived at her apartment, taking a long sigh of relief as she closed the door behind her, leaving the Danver's sisters to their own devices. Allowing Alex the pleasure of talking to Kara, instead of just flexing her butt muscles around the inch tall Kryptonian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Kara, we're home. And I know it's a little unorthodox, but I'd still like to have Danver's sister night, even though you're so tiny and I'm sure that you're upset with me over this whole situation. Just know that I'm trying to protect you here, which is also why I can't let you yet. I did appreciate the massage you gave me earlier though, thanks for that.\" Alex joked, hoping to break the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Let me out of here this instant! I don't want to have to resort to more drastic measures! I don't want to hurt you!\" Kara yelled at the top of her lungs, her powerful voice tickling Alex's butt causing her to chuckle in response, covering her mouth so as not to embarrass Kara further. But will she see it that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Alex and Kara do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Alex upholds her and Kara's usual tradition of having Movie nights together, putting on some of Kara's favorites in the hope that she'll calm down after hearing the familiar sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kara decides that she's had enough of Alex's ass, using some of her other powers in an attempt to escape. Starting with Heat Vision, the only question is how Alex will react when Kara burns one of her butt-cheeks(Second Degree Burn)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kara continues to try and escape Alex's butt-crack using brute strength, nearly escaping before Alex has to use her hand to push the tiny blonde back into place, but she doesn't stop there, going as far to push Kara into her butt hole in order to keep her safe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Ms Luthor, are you sure this is safe?' Jess asks her as her boss sets up equipment to examine the blue gem like object found in the most recent of Lex's secret cashes. The artifact had been sealed in a lead lined box and only when inventory was being compiled did it get discovered. Once she heard Lena had it sent to L Corp and more importantly her office ASAP, as well as anything she'd need to properly examine and test the mineral<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Jess it's fine, there is a tiny amount of radiation leakage but it's less than a suntan so it'll be completely harmless' the scientist and CEO explained, hoping to calm her long suffering assistant, especially with all the recent activity that kept happening around here, she almost saw Supergirl more than her own assistant if that were possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Miss Luthor, just remember that if you miss lunch that reporter will make her frowny face and pout, seriously that pout should be outlawed' despite her complaint the smirk she as wearing made Lena happy her assistant was no longer at odds with the friend, that had been a big problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that wasn't the issue at the moment, now was her newest problem from Lex, this one was actually quite beautiful for a change, sapphire blue and cut almost like a gemstone Lena almost didn't want to damage the thing, so she did the less evasive tests first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material may not be a real sapphire but it was of a high enough quality to be considered a gem, the material was also highly conductive, which gave Lena some ideas if they ever managed to find more of this stuff in some of Lex's other vaults/ hideaways,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she said to Jess the radiation was extremely low level and on a very low wavelength, it couldn't do damage to any human being, but given her brother was the previous owner there was a chance another species could be harmed by it, after all the Kryptonian's could be harmed by a green rock, why couldn't something else be harmed by a blue gem (Also green lanterns are harmed by yellow so DC is weird when it comes to colors). The radiation signature didn't match anything on record but she did manage to find a few signs the gem had been synthesized which was good news and bad news: On the one hand it being artificial meant she had no way of knowing what the thing could do or if Lex had altered it's properties, but on the other if she could determine it to be harmless she could make enough to test all those ideas she had forming in the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scans she had taken at least proved it to be a solid structure with no little surprises hidden inside in case of it falling into those her brother and mother would deem the wrong hands (like her own or the DEO's most likely) which was good seeing as one such surprise blew up one of her researchers a couple months back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door snapped her out of her musings and she realized Kara had arrived with lunch, she should probably save Jess from the pout, but first to place the gem back into it's box, Kara may be a good person but she was still a reporter and she can't really say to the blond something is 'off the record' if it's sitting the right in front of her. Ensuring the seal was on tight Lena finally opened the door and Kara scrambled in with bags of food, Jess glaring at her with a face that screamed 'You owe me SOOOO much' and it was true, Lena realized she really needed to give that girl a raise, not just for this but for everything else too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Kara could eat so much and still look the way she did baffled Lena, she didn't even eat half as much as the blond and she has had to add half an hour to her exercise routine since becoming her friend. Curse you Kara pouts and her ability to find delicious cakes and other sweet treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation flowed easily between them, some days actually reminding her of days before Lex turned out to be a psychopath, when it was just the 2 of them against the world, wanting to make everything better. Sighing at broken dreams she casts a gaze on her latest bit of recovered strangeness from the man, a gesture which did not go unnoticed by miss Danvers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Lena what you got there?' she asks, Lena not knowing she had tried to peak into the box, but the lead prevented her from knowing anything but the dimensions of the box itself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You promise not to say anything back at CatCo? Lena asks, knowing Kara would never do such a thing but she was a paranoid woman who people were actually trying to kill, letting her have this piece of mind was the least Kara could do, and the young Kryptonian knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not until you either go public or mention it in one of our interview' she replies almost instantly making Lena smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then' she grins and hops up to her desk 'I don't fully know the full capabilities of this thing myself yet but the possibilities are endless once the tests are completed and we can synthesize more of it' she explains with an near visible passion, she really wanted to turn something Luthor made into a force for good and this was one of many chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't know was that while Kara had been following her just as eagerly, no doubt feeding off Lena's enthusiasm, the moment the lid was removed she felt a stabbing pain in her brain and acute loss of her usually perfect balance. 'Shit' Kara swears internally 'Kryptonite' she wonders how Lena could be unaware of how dangerous messing with that mineral was, and also what could happen to her if the DEO found out, but when she saw the blue glow coming from the box she understood: Green was the only really widely known color of Kryptonite, which makes sense given it was always green Lex used against Kal-El, the others being too unpredictable as far as Kara knew to be used effectively as a weapon, Lena simply didn't know Kryptonite came in a literal rainbow set, and it was coming back to bite Kara in the ass, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond known as Supergirl panicked when the world started to both recede from her and shoot up above her, it turned out blue was capable of size manipulation, which was news to her (just because she knew there were many different colors of Kryptonite doesn't mean Kara knew what they all did) so she was forced to just stand a little behind Lena as she dwindled away to just shy of an inch tall, at which point the disorientation seemed to dissipate, it seemed her smaller body had reached the limited range of Blue Kryptonite, or at least of a piece that size. Staring up her friend was practically a goddess now, this was not going to be a fun day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, did Lena see any of that? Did she see the effect blue Kryptonite had on Kara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She had been turned away at the time, so when she turns back to ask Kara that she thought the woman was 'gone' or at least that was how it looked (Kara has to try get her attention somehow)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She turned to ask her thought just as Kara began to shrink, the Kryptonian too disorientated to notice Lena watching her disappear, only when she reached a couple inches tall did Lena snap out of her daze/shock long enough to close the lid and stop the Kryptonite effecting her, because she realized both what her brother had made, and who her best friend was.</span></div></div>",

She then reapplied her other clothes, as while nice, the suit was also eye catching in a bad way at normal size, and if she was going to pull this off she needed to be normal size first, then shrink when she got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alex glares as she looks at the massive Luther..... L-Corp building. Kara seemed to think it's current owner was good, but you could never be sure with these kinds of people, always having an angle, waiting for the moment to stab you in the back. Speaking of back Alex chuckles a little at he mental joke before sneaking in the back door and moving swiftly until she reached the main elevators undetected by staff or camera. Knowing enough about places like this to know the boss was on the top floor Alex pushed the button, then once it was contently making it's way up activated the suit, The feeling of shrinking was definitely just as strange as she expected, but Alex was able to avoid any major issues as she had the elevator to herself until it dinged at the top floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was confused when the elevator doors opened but nobody stepped out, confused but as there was literally nothing she could do, Lena's PA went back to making sure her schedule actually could be accomplished and that the woman was able to sleep a number of hours for a normal person, rather than burn herself to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk/run from the lift to Lena's office was a pain at 1 inch tall, but Alex eventually made it,, panting a little but glad for one thing.... that due to the tools in the suit's hidden pockets including a grappling hook so she was able to shoot up to the chair that way rather than climb the thing. Still at least she was alone with Lena and undetected by a woman probably more paranoid than her and Oliver Queen combined. Plus this suit was awesome, everything was coming up Danvers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Luthor, Kara Danvers is outside your door with lunch, can I let her in before I start fighting her for the food?\" Crap, Kara being here is going to mess everything up, there was no way Lena was going to do anything bad around Kara, the girl was after all na\u00efve but not stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send her in\" Lena replies, standing just as Kara walks in the door with 2 bags of food, shaking the right one in the ravenette's direction \"Hello Kara\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Le, Jess says you're not eating enough or sleeping, so I decided to deal with the one I actually can do something about, by bringing you food\" the blond chirp, and Alex watches Lena smile before hugging her sister, this was still unhelpful, and also distracting as it wasn't until the shadow overwhelmed her Alex realised Lena was heading for the same seat she was on... and about to sit on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Alex isn't able to move in time and Lena's ass pins her to the sofa, with nothing to do but listen to the 2 on their lunch date. When Kara leaves and Lena gets back to work, Alex is forced to follow, stuck to Lena's ass like glue as she sways enticingly and goes straight to work<br>\r\n2) Alex manages to dodge Lena's rear, but misses something just as bad, Kara having removed her heels and her bare foot ends up catching Alex in it's grasp. Unable to escape Alex's day goes from trying to expose Lena's secrets to spending time with Kara's toes in her work heels and later Super boots<br>\r\n3) Alex dodges Lena's ass and hits the ground, but not without drawing attention to herself, both women first think it's a bug and soon after a tiny intruder/spy. This wasn't going to end well for little Alex</span></div></div>",

Just give up Supergirl, you're finished' Reign gloats, looking contradictingly composed and smug as she floats down to the crater she'd just formed with the blond's body, and she was just crawling out of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never, I will stop your plans, I will end you' Kara swears, throwing herself at Reign who smirks and catches her arms, proceeding to head-butt her repeatedly, until she was sure that once she let go Kara would fall. Once the hero's back hit the dirt Reign smirked and straddled Kara's hips, pinning her to the round, one hand holding her arms to stop her trying to escape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, now Supergirl, no need to squirm just yet' she taunts, reaching into her suit with her free hand to produce a vial of red liquid 'I didn't get a chance to use this on you last time, what with all the people around, but you dealt with that much more easily than I would have, so at least the humans live another day. Now open wide'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara glares before spitting in Reign's face, the Worldkiller twitches, places the vial on the ground by her hip and proceeds to grab Kara's head and slam it into the ground, until the Kryptonian was seeing stars, her head lolling around as her eyes and brain try to regain focus. During this time she feels Reign turn her head to face her as well as part her lips, allowing her to pour the entire contents of the vial down her throat. She could blame the dizziness on the multiple concussions (is that even possible) Reign gave her, but even her idled mind could feel Reign getting heavier, see her get larger... no Reign was staying the same, Kara was getting smaller<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go, not a problem any more' Reign whispers when the process ended, picking up the 4 inch Kara just before standing to her full height 'Weak, powerless, quite literally so in fact, it's not even really worth killing right now. At least you'll be able to witness your world desolated by my hands, only then will I kill you slowly, until then, well, you're about to be what a lot of humans consider a lucky bastard' she smirks at Kara's confused expression before it morphs into fear 'Exactly, now don't squirm too much, or you might wake up a hungry quim' she teases before pulling open the front of her suit, exposing her large breasts in a tight bra, shoving her in upside down so that most of her upper body was pinned under her right breast, and her legs were splayed by the brunette's nipple between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReign bites her lip as she readjusts her suit, she wasn't entirely honest with her new captive, yes she would love to kill her slowly, probably by crushing her limbs and eating the rest, but she did't have the time, she could feel Sam's subconscious fighting to return to the surface, she needs to make sure nothing is out of place besides some lost time, that way she can chalk it up to exhaustion and leave it alone rather than try investigate. Which was why once Supergirl was restrained she shot up into the air, heading straight for L Corp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>20 minutes later</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam woke with a start 'Ow did I pass out again?' she groans, rubbing her neck and wincing at the crick that had formed before checking the time on her laptop 'Fuck 3 hours? Why didn't anyone wake me? Lena? Jess even?' she rubbed her eyes and groans into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blinks cobwebs from her brain as she hears the sound of the giantess she was trapped on, only it wasn't Reign, it was her friend Sam, this is brilliant, the two got along rather well (not as well as either did with Lena but they still thought of each other as good friends) so there was no way she'd ignore Kara's pleas for help, she just needed to get Sam to notice her and free her from her nice smelling, fleshy prison. So going against Reign's order Kara began to wriggle and squirm, hoping Sam would notice quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Kara's wriggling gets Sam's attention, but also excites her. What could Sam possibly do with a helpless Kryptonian, that was just rubbing herself against her breast?<br>\r\n2) Sam remembers Lena invited her over for drinks tonight, a day away from work and Ruby (she made a mental note to text Alex a thanks for minding Ruby), so in her rush she doesn't feel anything, attributing Kara's attempts at getting her attention as her own movements. What follows is some heavy drinking by both Sam and Lena... is Kara really sure this is the best time or situation to make herself known?</span></div></div>",

Following the sound, she made her way into a warehouse, but instead of finding a girl she found a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This can't be good' she mutters picking up the doll, which then releases a high pitched shriek, bringing the Kryptonian to her knees and eventually causing her to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Some time later</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara groans as she comes to, surprised when she saw that she was being quite thoroughly restrained by regular looking cuffs and ropes, despite no kryptonite that she could see or feel. Tugging she was shocked and a little afraid when she couldn't even get any wriggle room, never mind shred it like it was made of wet paper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Try all you want, it's not going to work\" a female voice says through the darkness, the amusement clear as day before she steps into the light and reveals herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaqueline Nimball!\" Kara gasps \"But you should be in Van Kul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond chuckles \"True, but during the last rampage, you and Reign caused a portion of the building collapsed, allowing several inmates, myself included to escape rather easily. Now I have a very special plan for you doll, but first I thought you deserved an explanation. When some very powerful people managed to discover my plans, they were very interested and gave me something that would make sure I succeeded, I believe the robot called it, Gold Kryptonite\" Kara's blood ran cold, she knew exactly what it was and what it's effects were \"Anyway, while you were sleeping I put it somewhere safe on your person, and by the time anyone finds you, it effects will be permanent, no more Supergirl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tries to find something to hope for \"But the DEO will find me, quite easily in fact given I haven't checked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaqueline nods 'True, if I had planned to keep you here. Oh no, this is just the prep room.\" she says in response to Kara's fearful gaze, before pulling out a small device \"Now this grenade contains a very powerful paralytic gas, would normally work for several hours, but when I'm done with you the concentration should last a few days at least.\" she grins before putting on a gas mask and pulling the pin, a thick green smoke filled the room and Kara begins to wheeze and cough, closing her eyes to keep out the added pain. 'oh no you don't' even muffled she could still here Nimball \"You get to watch it all!\" she hears as her eyes are forced open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kara was incapable of conscious movement Jaqueline unties her and begins setting to work posing and prepping her, molding her facial muscles to form her signature smile as well as move her arms into her version of the Superman pose. Kara felt humiliated but it wasn't as if she had a choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There we go, the doll is complete.\" Nimball claps before stepping out of view, returning with a sci-fi laser and a plastic shell for a Supergirl doll, Kara not needing an explanation really to uncover the plan. It didn't surprise her (though against her best efforts did amuse her) when the laser gun had the classic sound effect when it fired, the beam shrinking Kara to the size where she'd fit perfectly in the doll case... as intended. She was glad Kryptonians needed less air than humans right about now as she was sealed into the container and dropped into Jaqueline's bag, darkness consuming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally released Kara noticed it was evening and they were in the toy store near her apartment, which only partly confused her until Nimball started talking again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this doll, all your perfect little sisters\" she coos, picking up a Supergirl doll from the display to show her, Kara hated to admit it but they had done a spot on job with capturing her likeness, just sucks it happens a little while before she becomes the size to be mistaken for one \"You know I like this one better, doesn't death glare me, I think I'll keep her.\" she puts the doll into her bag before looking at Kara again \"But we can't have the theft known, guess I'll be returning this one.\" she frowns just before placing Kara on the shelf alongside all her other doubles. Screaming in her mind to be set free as the new Toy Maker walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon morning arrives and Kara tries to make herself known, but the only thing she was able to move was her eyes which didn't exactly draw much attention unless they were looking directly into them. Just when she begins to lose hope she hears a familiar voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supergirl dolls?\" It was Sam, a mutual friend of Lena's that Kara had recently become friends with, she was a really good person, same as her daughter Ruby, they would help her, but her heart sank when she was picked up and rather than acknowledged was simply pressed against the brunette's chest as she made her way through the crowded store, paid for the shrunken hero and headed back to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, I got you something!\" Sam calls when she enters the house, grinning when she hears her daughter's thunderous steps from one end of the house to the other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mom, what you get me? Is it something cool?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiles 'That's up to you I guess' she says, passing Kara over to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you got me a Supergirl doll? Thanks, mom\" Ruby grins widely, hugs Sam and runs off into her room, tearing the packaging off her idol's doll so they can play together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Ruby decides Supergirl needs a secret identity so gives her a disguise (whether she removes the suit and see's her doll's a lot more lifelike than she should, or simply puts doll clothes over the suit like Kara does quite often, is up to the uploader)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) About a week later Kara begins to be able to move again but isn't sure she wants to return to her real life: sure being used by a little girl was embarrassing at times but she felt important. Plus both Kara Danvers and Kara Zor-El's lives sucked, they had so much pain with no end in sight. Ruby's Supergirl doll just had to pray she was played with most days so as not to get bored, no other responsibilities for the first time since she left Krypton Kara felt free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Kara is able to move again and surprises Ruby as she discovers her Supergirl toy is the real thing. however, Ruby still wanted to play with her and instead of letting her go forces Supergirl to play with her. Kara tries using her powers to escape but this somehow causes her to shrink further to 1 inch tall</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Ruby raced upstairs to her room with her new Supergirl doll under her arm, blissfully unaware that what she was carrying was the genuine article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, Dinner will be ready in 1 hour!\" Sam called from the kitchen, happy to see her daughter so excited by the gift she brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara tried breaking free of her constraints, but the elastic bands around her wrists and ankles proved more effective than she had anticipated at keeping her in place. At most she could turn her head, wiggle her toes, and curl her fingers into a fist, but she couldn't break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably for the best though. Sam told Ruby that they would be eating dinner within the hour. Kara only had to pretend to be a doll until then, after Ruby left her alone she could fly out the window and head towards the DEO. It wouldn't be all bad, but with the gas wearing off it would prove increasingly difficult to stay perfectly still and not show any emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Wumpth*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby slammed the door to her room, sealing Kara inside with the fifty foot tall Ruby. She jumped onto her bed, bouncing on her knees as she placed the box on top of her legs. Kara remained still, trying not to show any emotion as the giant preteen girl looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so cool! They got all the details right. She almost looks alive.\" Ruby said excitedly, peeling the top off of the cardboard box. Fresh air rushing into the packaging, washed over Kara and sending a chill up her spine. She didn't show any form of response, gritting her teeth while she continued smiling at Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These weak little rubber bands, can't hold back Supergirl.\" Ruby giggled, removing them one by one very quickly, even snapping one of them in the process leaving Kara shocked. In her shrunken state, she was so weak that she had trouble escaping a rubber band that Ruby could break without even trying. Was this twelve-year-old stronger than the Girl of Steel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get a better look at you now,\" Ruby announced, maneuvering her hand inside of the box around what she thought was a doll, making a tight fist around Supergirl's waist and abdomen as she pulled her out of the container. The young girl had a grip stronger than any alien Kara had faced before, making it difficult for the superheroin to breath as she tried to continue her doll routine. Unfortunately, it was not one she could keep up for long as Ruby's curiosity leads her to inspect her new belonging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They captured her face perfectly, and the body almost feels real,\" Ruby said aloud, glancing at all the little features on the six-inch tall Supergirl as she tried to remain tense until Ruby did something unexpected. Kara felt embarrassed as Ruby lifted the back of her skirt, revealing her plain white panties to the younger girl. \"That's weird. You think they would make these match the rest of her costume.\" Ruby said, delivering a swift flick to Kara's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you think you're back there?\" Kara asked loudly, coming to life suddenly and spooking Ruby into dropping her onto the bed. Her shrunken form bounced off the mattress, landing her smack dab in the middle of Ruby's shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you just talk?\" Ruby asked, confused by what was going on. Why was her Supergirl doll talking to her? Was it a toy robot or something? No, she moved to independently for that to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Ruby, I need you to listen to me. I'm the real Supergirl. I was shrunk to this size by Jacqueline Nimball, a villain who worked with the Toyman earlier this year. She escaped from Van Kull and captured me in an ambush yesterday.\" Kara explained, but Ruby was still awestruck by the fact that her idol was now smaller than her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how did you know my name?\" Ruby asked, followed by a moment of silence from the shrunken Supergirl. Unable to come up with an answer that didn't reveal her secret identity. Luckily, Ruby didn't dwell on this question for long before getting back to the issue at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, what can I do to help?\" Ruby asked, eager to be of some assistance in what she assumed was Supergirl's darkest hour. Ruby jumped off her bed, her feet hitting the wooden floor with a powerful *thud* that Kara could feel shaking the bed under her. Finally Ruby turned around, looking down at the tiny woman from an even greater height than earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara, unfortunately, was growing tired of being looked down upon, flying up to Ruby's head so they could have a face to face conversation. \"Ruby, it's too dangerous. You could get hurt. Just open the window, and I'll take care of the rest.\" Kara said confidently, at least with as much confidence a six-inch tall woman could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's the best idea,\" Ruby said, worried about Supergirl's safety in a world built for people several larger than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean? You can't just keep me here like this!\" Kara objected, interrupting Ruby before she could finish her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not it at all. I don't want to see you get hurt out there. I was going to say we should get Guardian to look into it. He could track Nimball down and figure out how to return you to normal. Then, wait a minute, are you, getting smaller?\" Ruby asked, stopping in the middle of a convincing argument as she realized that Kara was only two-thirds of the size she was earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at only four inches tall, Kara realized that Ruby was right as she started shrinking a second time. Watching from the air as Ruby seemed to double in size as she dwindled further to only three inches tall. \"What's happening to me?\" Kara asked in a panic. She hadn't shrunk in the last day, what was different now. Could it be that the box Nimball put her in was a containment field that kept her from shrinking more? No, she would have noticed it sooner. That's when it hit her, and Ruby who is a smart girl also figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's your powers! Using them must be causing you to shrink again.\" Ruby pointed out, while Kara continued to get even smaller. Now ruby was three times larger than when she first encountered her today, but she couldn't stop flying at this height. She'd fall to the floor at Ruby's feet, and with her Kryptonian powers acting up she might get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Ruby came to her rescue, laying her hand out under her and allowing Kara to land in the center of her palm like a firefly. Kara continued shrinking after that for a few moments longer, stopping at only one inch tall, only one-sixth the size she was when she arrived at Sam and Ruby's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now you're super tiny,\" Ruby said, amazed by how small Supergirl had become right in front of her. Though it hardly helps raise Kara's morale about her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but there's no way I can let you go now. You can't fly, and somebody might step on you if you try to walk wherever you're going. National City needs you, so until then you can stay with me and I'll keep you safe for a few days. Hopefully, you'll grow back given some time to rest.\" Ruby reasoned, it was a good plan, but it was also one the Girl of Steel couldn't accept lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't do that! I won't let you keep me here!\" Kara yelled, objecting as loudly as she could at her size. Standing up as she prepared to tell Ruby to release her out the window if she wasn't going to help her. Hoping that at top speed she could fly to the DEO and get Alex's attention before she became microscopic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Supergirl, you've given me no other choice,\" Ruby said, regretfully closing her hand into a fist around Supergirl. Squeezing her tightly without any attempt to restrain herself in case the shrunken Kryptonian was still strong enough to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, wha-what are you, doing?\" Kara asked, pausing between some of her words as she found it hard to breathe all of a sudden, struggling to move the giant girl's fingers apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to keep you safe, I promise I'll let you go at the end of the week if you get any bigger, But for now I'll keep you safe. And since I can't have you trying to run off, I'll have to keep you_________.\" Ruby said, shocking Kara with her choice of where she wanted to keep her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"...inside of my sock.\" Ruby slips off one of her socks and could either decide to drop Supergirl inside or stuff her between her toes thinking that might be safer for her. She could also put on a pair of sneakers or Ugg boots as an added layer of protection and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"...between my buttcheeks.\" Ruby knows this isn't a preferred spot for Kara, but assures her that it will be a safe and soft place to live out her days while shrunk where she can keep an eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"...here with me and my mom.\" Ruby brings Kara downstairs and tells her mom everything that happened. Telling her she wants to keep Supergirl safe, suggesting they call Alex. Will Reign take over before she gets the chance? Will she call Alex? Or Will she say that Supergirl should spend a few days with them first?</span></div></div>",

Anyway, Supergirl isn't really an FBI issue, she's not an anywhere issue\" for once Kara curses the DEO's secret organisation 'we don't exist' stick, as it was currently biting her in the ass, as was Alex heading to Washington to ask Marston to send help dealing with the Reign issue, preferably someone less of a dick than General Lane had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will we do then mom?\" Ruby asks, looking down at a Supergirl clearly lost in thought/her own head \"We can't just let her go, she'll get hurt, even more so now she's extra tiny\" she points out, Kara frowning as her size and vulnerability is once more brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nods \"True, we can't have National City's hero go out in the world all by herself\" she hums, picking Kara off of her daughter's hand and bringing her up to her face \"Hmm. I guess we have no choice but to keep her for now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that\" Kara partly soothes, partly begs Sam, but Ruby's cheers may have drowned it out for the most part, as Sam just grin at her and chuckles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Supergirl, but I can't in good conscience let you leave this house in your current condition. Therefore you'll be staying with us until either your height returns, or Alex comes back from her whatever, which is later in the week. Try escape and I will punish you\" she lays down the law, full mom voice and everything, Kara shivers and nods \"Great, now to explain what we're going to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Sam decides the best thing to do to stop escape is keep Supergirl close to heart, pinned between her large breasts and silky bra, Kara has nowhere to go. Sure if Reign bubbles to the surface of Sam's mind she was toast, but the supervillain was never the most regular of consistent of her enemies, so it is possible Reign doesn't show up for a couple days, she can only hope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Sam decides it was best for Supergirl and them not to treat Kara like anything other than another houseguest, besides stopping any escape attempts of course. During this time Kara is conflicted, they were basically keeping her prisoner, stopping her from helping people or getting grown back, but on the other, they were treating her like a normal, albeit tiny person, like she was a human, rather than a superhero<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Sam worries Kara's size problem won't just 'go away' on it's own, so she enlists the help of someone who might be able to do something about this condition, Lena Luthor. Is Kara about to get a helping hand from her friend, or will she be the missing ingredient she needed to find a way to deal with Reign?</span></div></div>",

They do.\" Red agreed before her eyes began glowing a brilliant shade of blue and the ship went up in flames. Only one being survived the explosion and Red, ignorant of the evil she'd just extinguished, was left to decide her fate. Going back to Kaznia, except to collect her books, was an unappealing prospect at best. Going to America had its prospects, though as a conqueror or a citizen she wasn't sure, but the obstacle of Kara Danvers was one that had to be dealt with and Red couldn't say that she'd win a straight up fight. She could just leave the planet outright. Find a new home somewhere else in the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as she flew over the Indian Ocean that the idea came to her. Flying off to one of Lex's hidden bases, she quickly found the information that she was looking for. A way to slide into a peaceful life and get rid of Kara Danvers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow day in STAR Labs of Earth-1 when a breach opened up and Red Daughter sailed out. \"Barry.\" She nodded \"I need you to contact the Atom. I need some shrinking tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but you know I'm Cisco right?\" The unamused meta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" The Kryptonian lied, cursing Lex's incomplete research. Still after forty hellish minutes (what sort of idiots could be late with a time machine?) having to take in STAR Labs' frankly bizarre smells, she had the technology that she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help?\" Barry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Red said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? I don't mind.\" Barry smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we can come as well.\" Sara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna take no for an answer are you?\" Red asked to which they shook their heads. \"Well Kara is very lucky to have you as friends.\" She said as her heat vision began to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Next Morning, Earth-38---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara let loose a yawn as she prepared to take on the day. As she woke up, she rolled over onto her front and got on all fours. \"Wait. That's not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is now.\" Kara heard a very familiar voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait whaaaaaaa-\" Kara trailed off as she came face to face with a gigantic version of herself. \"Who... what... are you?\" Supergirl asked as she floated up to the giant's eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't really know that,\" Red confessed \"But I'm going to be Kara Danvers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry what?\" The inch tall girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really. I hated all of Lex's rules and desired an easy American life. But you were in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEX?!\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I killed him. So I went to Earth-1 and got the tech to shrink you of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's to stop me from getting the tech to grow me back?\" Kara challenged, eyeing the breaching device on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I killed Earth-1 as well.\" She said it so casually that Kara had to do a double take. Unfortunately, this allowed Red to seize her miniature progenitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Kara asked, her shrunken down strength useless against Red's fully sized counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to know who to act like Kara Danvers. So you are going to tell me.\" With that Red pulled down her shirt. Kara gulped as she took in her doppelg\u00e4nger's gigantic bosom before she found herself stuffed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of here!\" Kara protested as she pounded and struggled against the soft flesh. Much to her surprise, the breasts were instantly pulled apart allowing her safe passage. \"Oh.\" But before Kara could do anything, the breasts slammed back into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misbehave. I slam my breasts into you.\" Red said casually as she got ready for a day at CatCo. \"Want me to do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Kara said bluntly. Shrugging, Red repeated the act. \"Again.\" Kara said, to Red's confusion. After a few more times, the clone got wise. \"You... you're getting some sick sexual thrill of this aren't you?\" The ex-Kaznian asked looking down into her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be Supergirl but I'm still a girl. I have needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I just won't do it.\" The clone smiled causing Kara's face to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops gotta run.\" Red smiled, snapping her shirt shut as she flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Red doesn't quite manage to stick the landing at CatCo, sending Kara tumbling into the front of her clone's panties, introducing Red to a new, and rather exciting, feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) As Red flies, an emergency calls her off-course. In solving the crisis, she gets turned upside down, allowing Kara to slide out. With her usual hang outs known to Red, Kara tries to sneak back to Midvale to hide.</span></div></div>",

Though it was not uncommon for the reporters to sometimes come in on the weekend, this was long past the usual hours they'd be around. But for this particular reporter, competing time demands had made it inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, Kara Zor-El massaged her temples as her aching body healed itself. She loved her cousin, she truly did, and she so happy that being on Argo allowed him to experience Kryptonian culture but did he honestly couldn't have chosen a worst time to leave the planet. What with the changes at the DEO, the White House, and the rising anti-alien sentiment, she had her hands full 24/7 as Earth's bringer of hope and defender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention having spent her Sunday night having been ruthlessly pounded by a steroid fuelled Aquarian. With everything she'd had to, she was days behind on her article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd perhaps more importantly, there was a steroid fuelled Aquarian running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7000 words and I've written 7.\" Kara groaned rubbing her eyes. \"And I'm not even at my desk. I'm at Nia's.\" She mumbled looking over at her desk, and all the documents she'd requested for her work. \"Why does Nia have speed dial on her phone? Who does she need to call in a rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObjectively, Kara knew she had to walk over to her desk but she was so spent from the fight that she had to rest for a moment. \"Just five minutes. Oh I wish I could just wake up tomorrow and not have to worry about being Supergirl.\" The Girl of Steel muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the old saying goes, one should be careful what they wish for lest they get it. Like how wishing for a break from the monotony can lead to spending three hours having your head being bashed into the pavement by a steroid fuelled Aquarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout nine hours later, Kara let loose a powerful yawn before she stood up, stretching out the cricks in her joints. \"Wait. That's not right. I was sleeping on a chair.\" Opening her eyes, Kara quickly saw that she was still on the chair. There was just one <i>little</i> difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything else was still exactly the same but she'd somehow dropped down to an inch in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this is not good.\" She muttered as she heard the elevator open and her gigantic colleagues walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Calm down. You've been through worse. Probably.\" She spoke to herself. \"Basic inventory first. Arms. Legs. Hands. All there. Now you just need to reverse this. Maybe try and call Ray Palmer. He might-\" Kara trailed off as her world became enveloped by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a lump in her throat, Kara turned around to see Nia Nal's meteor sized ass descending towards her. \"Oh you've gotta be-\" With force equal to a meteor, Nia's ass slammed onto the chair, knocking down the miniaturized Kryptonian. Disoriented by the impact, Kara had no time to escape the soft fabric of the chair giving way to the Naltorian's butt and herself sliding down into the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again. Been through worse. Probably.\" Kara chanted to herself as she placed each of her hands on Nia's cheeks and tried to take flight only to remain stuck in place, her tiny feet squished between the soft flesh and the gravity of the Naltorian interfering with her flight. \"Damn Nia. What size are your panties? Is this what happens to humans who spend their lives at a desk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara shook away the thought before she put all her energy into her arms, pushing the giant cheeks away from each other enough so that she could use her legs and have them plant themselves on the butt, pushing the massive cheeks further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Supergirl smiled as she prepared to take flight, only for both cheeks to violently slam back into her, burying her in their soft flesh. \"What the hell?\" Kara choked out as she pushed the cheeks apart again. But just like last time, the glutes resumed their initial position the instant she let go of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm strong enough to keep them apart but not fast enough to fly away in time?\" She whispered in shock. The thought was more than enough for her to start pounding Nia's buttcheeks relentlessly, all but begging the brunette to feel her and let her out. Unfortunately, all the brunette felt was a cold breeze across her behind. Something she rectified by subconsciously adjusting her skirt and cutting off some of the Kryptonian's light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" Kara cursed, leaning against the right butt-cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only about an hour after the workday started that Nia had the time to speak to James about Kara's absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen her since last night.\" The editor said. \"We should give her a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it.\" Nia said, pulling out her mobile before Kara felt a vibration in her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phone of course!\" She cheered, mentally smacking herself. In her haste unfortunately, she applied too much strength to the fragile device, shattering it in her pocket. \"No! That's like the eighth one this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not answering.\" Nia shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably broke it again,\" James waved off, far too used to seeing Kryptonians burn through their mobile devices. \"Let me try something else.\" He said as he pressed his Supergirl watch. For a few moments the two waited anxiously, taking no notice of Nia's shaking ass, but found a distinct lack of Kryptonian entering the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what it is?\" James realized. \"She's probably been called away to a parallel Earth by a CSI with super speed. It's usually no more than a three hour adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I believe you.\" Nia said flatly as she walked back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no reason to look for her, Kara's absence went unnoticed as she remained lodged in her protege's gargantuan ass cheeks. Occasionally she slammed into them, but soon realized that the Naltorian had so much blubber in her rear that super strength was inefficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at her size, freeze-breath didn't generate enough cold and Kara certainly wasn't willing to use her heat vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was the Kara that spent her Monday trapped in a butt. As Mondays went, she ranked this one as slightly better than normal. Made even nicer by the fact that Naltorians apparently didn't need to use the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Nia headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) With no crime, Nia goes to bed. As a result of the heat wave, she sleeps naked, allowing Kara a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) With Supergirl MIA, Nia heads out to fight crime for the evening, slamming Kara around her butt as she fights the Aquarian. Maybe she'll even fall out as Nia is tossed around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>***\"Hi, my name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. I use to be an ordinary forensic scientist working with the SCPD then one day an accident made me the impossible. Now I work in secret with the help of my new friends at S.T.A.R Labs using my speed to fight crime and help find others Metahumans like me. I am the Flash!\"***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a year has passed since the notorious explosion of S.T.A.R Labs Particle Accelerator which lead to the rise of countless Metahumans, but it also gave birth to Central City's greatest hero. Since then Barry and his team have neutralized threats to Central City such as Clyde Martin, Danton Black, and Kyle Nimbus. Every adversary forcing Barry to push his speed to greater and greater heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality Barry and his team understood little about his powers including what pushing them to their maximum could be causing inside his body, it's for that very reason that Dr. Caitlin Snow saw it fit to call Barry into the laboratory for a routine physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the Flash a routine checkup with Dr. Snow meant running a few hundred miles on Cisco\u2019s specialized speed treadmill clocking in about 657 miles per hour as a standard pace. With each battle Barry only seems to get faster and faster, which was the cause for Caitlin\u2019s alarm in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the better half of an hour Caitlin noticed no discrepancies in Barry Allen\u2019s health, his vitals were well within the parameters for someone like him. But since modern medicine had yet to study Metahumans Caitlin decided that prolonged tests were necessary until she could be sure that Barry\u2019s powers came with few side effects aside from an overclocked metabolism and the inability to get drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at the height of the hour S.T.A.R Labs experienced a power surge, much like the one that occurred during the Particle Accelerator event. However this time it was worth noticing that the water in her glass began to levitate in mid air, much like the scene Barry described the night his mother Nora was murdered. Caitlin turned to the screens in a panic, Barry\u2019s vitals were dropping faster with each passing second, meanwhile his speed steadily decreased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried looking inside the lab for visual confirmation that Barry was okay but saw nothing aside from a layer of white smoke fogging the glass. The bioengineer jumped to her feet and ran into the lab to check in on her patient, opening the door first thinking that Barry had completely vanished into thin air. Felicity was right, Barry had run so fast that he\u2019d turned to dust inside his costume, except for the fact that the costume was also missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meanwhile in Barry\u2019s POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Barry remembered was running tests for Caitlin Snow when suddenly the room was enveloped in a thick mist. He almost worried that Nimbus might have escaped the pipeline and was trying to kill him again before realizing that the mist was non-toxic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry jumped off the treadmill and made a run for the down, thinking only of saving Caitlin from the smoke before anything else went wrong. However he didn\u2019t realize that something far worse than a little smokescreen was going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard to door open and followed the sound of Caitlin\u2019s voice as she called his name \u201cBarry! Barry, where are you?\u201d she yelled, her voice piercing the speedsters eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin, I\u2019m right here.\u201d Barry answered, thinking Caitlin was only a few feet in front of his face. Little did he know that he was only partially correct in his assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarry, can you hear me?\u201d Caitlin called out again, seemingly ignorant to Barry\u2019s response to her concern. Then from the smoke appeared a shadowy figure in front of Barry, which he at first assumed was Caitlin walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin, there you are.\u201d Barry said, taking a few more steps before a gigantic foot appeared from the smoke, landing inches in front of Barry\u2019s face, the pale white toes wiggling on top of a wooden surface as the impact of an enormous high heel knocked barry onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin?\u201d Barry asked himself, his eyes working their way up a pair of long white legs that disappeared under a blue dress as the smoke exited the room through the door Caitlin opened. It only took a few seconds for the smoke to completely dissipate, revealing a simply gigantic Dr. Caitlin Snow to the newly shrunken Barry Allen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes stared up at his new friend with unblinking disbelief, shrinking matter had always be disregarded by scientists as an impossibility but this instance proved that it could be done. He just wished it didn\u2019t have to happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaitlin!\u201d Barry yelled in an attempt to get the towering woman\u2019s attention, estimating that he was about an inch tall based off of Caitlin\u2019s current height. Nevertheless his efforts seemed to yield results as Caitlin\u2019s eyes wandered towards her feet, in front of which stood a little red speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarry?\u201d she asked surprised, bending down to inspect what she suspected was a tiny Barry Allen. Meanwhile Barry was still awestruck by her incredible size, trying to resist his fight or flight instinct as her fingers reached down, pinching him between her thumb and pointer finger before lifting him to her face under the gaze of her hazel colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think this was possible?\u201d Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you run the heat you generate causes your atoms to separate, allowing you to move at greater and greater speeds. Prolonged use of your speed must have trigger pushed them to the point where they could no longer separate and forced them to rejoin thus shrinking you to this size.\u201d Caitlin explained, carrying Barry outside of the speed lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you reverse it, return me to my normal size?\u201d Barry asked, not wanting to be both the fastest and the smallest man alive for the rest of his life. He could hide his speed from Iris but something told him that he couldn\u2019t hide his size from her. That is if she even saw him before she stepped on him or sat on him accidentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I can, but not without the properly connected data about how closely your structure has been compressed together. If I over calculate it could tear you apart but if I underestimate the results you could shrink even further.\u201d Caitlin continued to explain, neither option seemingly appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you need, a blood test?\u201d Barry asked, not sure of how Caitlin intended to treat someone so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, any sample I took from you would either be too much for your body to handle losing or would require an electron microscope to view. So I'll have to conduct more direct tests.\" Caitlin stated, looking down at Barry with a concerning look in her big brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Barry asked, not liking the way Caitlin phrased her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is that in order to find out exactly how dense your body is I'll have to conduct hours of testing where me and you are in direct contact with one another. Otherwise my results could be miscalculated and we run the risk of you never returning to your normal size.\" Caitlin said, walking into her lab in the Cortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin, don't I get a decision in all of this?\" Barry asked, but he wasn't met with a verbal answer. Instead Caitlin choose to walk towards her desk, ignoring his question all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Barry, I promise that I'll try to keep this from getting as unpleasant as possible, first I'd like to test your density by ____________.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"...dropping you in my shoe while I'm out picking up supplies.\" Caitlin picks up a pair of worn sneakers from underneath her desk, taking off her heels and dropping Barry inside her shoe to act as her new insole while she's out of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"...putting you on my chair and sitting on you while I work, writing my findings down on scrap paper so Cisco and Dr. Wells don't think anything is up.\" Caitlin uses Barry as her own personal seat cushion, ignoring his cries for help as she brings her butt down on his puny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"...putting you (Caitlin's cell phone rings).\" A call from Cisco results in Caitlin needing to leave to meet with him, Iris, and Eddie at their favorite bar. Leaving her too make up an excuse for Barry's absence, hiding him in her bra cup for safe keeping while she begins drinking with their friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barry couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"Caitlin, you can't sit on me, you'll squish me!\" Barry yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain that won't happen.\" Caitlin said. \"You're definitely dense enough to avoid being squished. The question is mainly whether you pass out and how sore you are afterwards. Whether any of your bomes break will also be a good thing to know. Also the harder your body is the less comfortable I'll be.\" Caitlin began lowering him downwards, placing him gently on the middle of her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether any of my bones break?\" Barry asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be more than minor fractures, maybe a rib or two.\" Caitlin said scientifically. \"And with speed healing it'd be fixed nearly as soon as I stood up, but with enough time for measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Caitlin this is ridiculous, find another way!\" Barry yelled, but the giant scientist was already turning her back to him. From his position on the seat, he could see up inside Caitlin's blue dress, where he saw she was wearing a pair of red panties that hugged her butt tightly. He felt a little embarrassed for seeing this, but also realized those panties were working over time to keep Caitlin's butt from looking even bigger than it already did. His eyes travelled up the giant scientist's body to her head. She was looking down over her shoulder at him, lightly biting her lip. She was clearly exciting to begin the testing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Barry, but as your doctor this is what I've decided we are doing.\" Caitlin said with finality, and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry felt like he was staring down a tsunami as the wall of blue fabric came rushing down towards him. Unlike the tsunami weather wizard had summoned towards Central City, there was nothing he could do to stop this one. There was no way to avoid it either, he was trapped on the seat. He was powerless as her butt struck him head on, trapping him under her right ass cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow Barry, you're actually pretty comfortable.\" Caitlin said, leaning from side to side, alternating which of her butt cheeks she was putting her weight on to compare the difference. It definitely felt better to lean on her right side, where Barry was directly under her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Barry did make a comfortable seat, he certainly wasn't comfortable himself. He was pinned under the seemingly endless expanse of Caitlin's right ass cheek, separated from it only by her dress. He knew Caitlin wasn't that heavy, but her weight seemed excruciating as it bared down on him relentlessly. And if her dress and panties weren't there to hold her butt back, it would have likely been even worse. Barry was just grateful that it wasn't Iris or Felicity sitting on top of him. Caitlin had a big butt, but those two were on a whole other level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin's playful rocking back and forth only made things worse. She had started by rocking to the left, making Barry think she was getting up off of him nearly right away. But the decrease in weight he felt was soon replaced with twice as much as she focused all her weight on her right butt cheek, pressing him hard down into the firm seat. It was like the cushion of the chair and Caitlin's ass were in a fight for territory, each demanding to be pressed right up against the other, but Barry was caught in the middle, and clearly neither were happy about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Barry, I'm going to try and get some work done, I think I'll be able to check what I need from you in a couple of hours.\" Caitlin announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours?! Barry had not asked how long this test would take, but he assumed it would be minutes at most. He couldn't stay under her for hours! He immediately began to fight back, trying to use his super speed to get free. He thought maybe he could phase through the chair, so he began to vibrate his body. But his shrinking had scaled everything down, including his speed. He could vibrate, but nowhere near fast enough to phase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin felt it though. \"Oh, thanks Barry. I love massage chairs.\" Caitlin said, enjoying the pleasant buzzing beneath her bum as the tiny superhero tried to free himself. She had a feeling the next few hours would fly by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, Caitlin finally stood up. Barry had long ago lost track of time, and the sudden release of weight felt like a very welcome surprise. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to light again, having spent several hours in complete darkness beneath the scientist's rear. When he could see clearly, he saw the beautiful visage of Caitlin's face mere inches from him, her giant hazel eyes inspecting him carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you held up quite nicely.\" Caitlin said, turning her chair back and forth slightly to inspect Barry from different angles. \"Do you feel anything broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing broken, I am all good. Do you have enough info to grow me back now?\" Barry asked, still breathing heavily. Caitlin's little test had been ridiculous, but as long as she grew him back now he supposed it was mostly harmless. And as doubtful as it was, maybe sitting on him really was the fastest way to do this test. Caitlin was the scientist after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet Barry.\" Caitlin replied, smiling sweetly down at his place on her seat. \"We will have to do at least one more test first, since this one didn't push your body hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another test?\" Barry asked wearily. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the next test?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin needs to see how Barry holds up under repeated impacts, requiring her to bounce her butt on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Caitlin needs to see how he holds up under constant squeezing pressure, so she moves him between her butt cheeks before sitting back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Felicity walks into Star Labs. Caitlin had messaged her as soon as she started sitting on Barry, knowing she would be needed for the next test: how does Barry hold up under more pressure?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Caitlin could finish, she was interrupted by her ringing cell phone. She intended to ignore it, but when she saw Cisco's name scroll across her screen, she got worried that there was another metahuman emergency. With Barry still in her other hand, she picked up her phone and started talking to Cisco. Barry couldn't tell what Cisco was saying, so the conversation was mostly unintelligible to him until the end:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Cisco, I'll see you soon,\" Caitlin said, hanging up her cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Cait?\" Barry asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember Barry? We are supposed to go meet Cisco Iris and Eddie at the bar.\" Caitlin explained. \"I had completely forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shouldn't we cancel that given the circumstances?\" Barry asked, not wanting to be left alone in the lab or brought among giant drunken people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best we keep this situation between us until I've run some tests Barry. No reason to worry everyone.\" Caitlin began. \"So I wouldn't want to seem suspicious by having both of us suddenly cancel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the tests you wanted to run?\" Barry continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry Barry, I'm still going to be conducting the first round of our durability testing. I'm just gonna be having some fun at the same time.\" Caitlin said with a smile. Barry expected her to say more, but rather than do so she used her hand to pull the neckline of her dress down and to the side, revealing her bra-clad right breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Cait... What are you doing?\" Barry asked, not liking where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Barry, I don't have a purse or any pockets in this dress, so I need somewhere to put you. I also need to see how you hold up under pressure.  Specifically, I need to see how you handle a sustained 2-pound weight. As it turns out, that's exactly the weight of a C cup breast.\" Caitlin explained sheepishly, feeling quite shy about her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin you can't be serious...\" Barry said, the thought of being crushed under one of his friend's enormous breasts, not one he ever imagined he'd be having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Barry, if you want to get back to normal size, that means we need to run tests. The sooner we do that, the sooner you can get back to normal. And since I have to go out tonight, this is the best way to get started.\" Caitlin explained matter-of-factly, trying to focus on the science and not the awkwardness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry remained unconvinced though. \"But Caitlin, your bra? I mean-\" he began, only to be interrupted as her fingers suddenly furled around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin decided she wasn't willing to stand around talking any longer, and that any further talking about her breasts was going to make things more awkward. So without giving Barry another word, she wrapped him in her grip and plunged her hand into her right bra cup, Barry in tow. She quickly unrolled her fingers, allowing Barry to roll off her hand and onto the cloth surface of her brassiere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry rolled out of her hand, coming to a stop on his back on the soft but firm surface of Caitlin's inner bra. Opening his eyes, he found himself looking up at the tremendous wall of boob flesh above him, dimly illuminated by the light that had snuck into her bra along with Caitlin's fingers. These same fingers were still with him, just overhead, holding her breast at bay. Her boob didn't seem to like this, as the soft and fluid flesh was slipping through between her fingers, trying its best to get to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try and lay flat Barry. I'll take you out when I get home.\" Caitlin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Cait-\" Barry began, just in time for Caitlin's hand to begin to withdraw. No longer impeded, her breast flesh came down on him like a falling domino, covering more and more of him as her fingers slipped away. The squishy flesh covered his feet first, then crawled it's way up his legs and torso, making a beeline for his head. Barry could only watch his body slowly get swallowed up, until finally, her breast came to a rest on top of his head, leaving him in complete darkness. His face was buried in the soft white skin of her underboob, and he was overwhelmed by the overpowering scent of her usually mild perfume. Her skin was so soft and malleable that he practically sunk into it as her pert breast rested its weight on him, engulfing him in Caitlin on all but one side. As far as he could tell (mostly by touch), the skin on her breast was smooth and flawless, giving him no hand or footholds to brace against in his futile struggles against the overpowering mammary that had him immobilized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Caitlin barely noticed anything. She could feel an irregular bump beneath her boob, but if she didn't know better, she would think it was just a tag that had gotten itself tangled up in her cup. The fact that that bump was a superhero, dominated entirely by the weight of her boob, was almost too crazy to believe. She suddenly felt a slight wiggle as Barry squirmed beneath her breast. She smiled and took this as the sign that he was doing just fine, and readjusted her dress to conceal where she had placed him. As she checked herself in the mirror, there was no indication that Barry was trapped in her bra. She realized could keep him hidden there for ages, and no one would ever know.  Content, she began her walk out of the lab and down the street to the bar. It was only like a 15-minute walk, but for Barry, it would feel much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin had never been so conscious of the way her breasts moved when she walked. With every step, no matter how gentle or precise, her chest heaved upward before recoiling downward, being caught by her bra, and tossed upward again. She cringed as she felt the first few of these bounces impacting Barry, stopping after a few steps to ensure he was still ok. Relieved by the continued feelings of breathing and wriggling, she decided it was fine to just continue on for now. She reminded herself that while it was probably pretty painful for Barry to be squished under her tits, it was also part of his durability testing. \"Who am I kidding, it can't be that bad in there...\" Caitlin thought, \"Who could complain about getting up close and personal with my boobs? He's lucky he isn't under my toes right now.\" Caitlin was surprised that she had such a thought, but smiled nonetheless, convinced that Barry's situation was just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was not convinced. Caitlin may have noticed her bouncing chest, but Barry was experiencing it first hand. The gentle fluctuations of her bosom felt more like someone was dropping a boulder on him over and over again, ensuring it would strike again just before he had time to recover. As soft and smooth as her breast was, every drop was a strike not unlike a hard slap to the face, except that it hit his entire body at once, forcing him back against the cup of her bra and reminding him of his new place as the scientist's temporary bra padding. The rhythmic bouncing continued as she strolled to the bar, the sound of Caitlin's clicking shoes and beating heart all Barry could hear until she arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin is greeted by a smiling Iris and company and starts to let loose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Cisco nearly runs into Caitlin as he heads out of the bar, informing her there is a metahuman emergency </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Caitlin!\" Iris exclaimed with a smile, moving forward to hug her relatively new friend. Caitlin instinctively opened her arms to return the hug, not thinking about Barry's predicament until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWUMPF<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and Iris's chests struck each other with a fleshy thud, catching Barry in the middle. While Caitlin had opted to wear heels on her night out, Iris had opted for some more practical flats. As a result, Caitlin's chest was a few inches above Iris's, creating the worst possible situation for Barry. Iris's breasts came up to meet Caitlin's, uppercutting Barry into the pale mounds of flesh that had him so easily pinned. He screamed as his face was buried in Caitlin's boob, cutting off his air supply and reducing his yell to a soft buzzing sound that tickled the underside of Caitlin's boob. She would have laughed at the feeling if she were not so concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin held onto the hug for the minimum socially acceptable time before quickly pushing Iris away, worried Barry was suffocating at the mercy of four giant breasts. She panicked for a moment as she was unable to feel Barry, ready to head to the bathroom and take him out to make sure he was concious. Fortunately though, she felt a little wriggle under her right boob that let her know everything was fine. She made a mental note that Barry's durability was high enough for a boob to boob 5 second hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok Caitlin?\" Iris asked, concerned by her friend's strange behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah everything is fine.\" Caitlin repied, struggling for a lie. \"You had a bit of fuzz on your should that I mistook for a spider and I got startled is all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with this, Iris turned away to order the two women drinks. Caitlin sighed with relief, and gladly accepted the first drink she was handed. With the stress of Barry's new condition and her need to keep it a secret, she could really use a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she downed a cocktail, Barry was still catching his breath from the hug with Iris. The normal weight of her breast bearing down on him seemed much less substantial now that he had the hug to compare it to. As he laid in silence, he heard what sounded like a running hose turning on next to him. He was confused for a moment, until he realized what he was hearing was the sound of alcohol cascading down the giant scientist's throat. He shuddered at the thought that she could drink what to him was a waterfall's worth of water in seconds imagining how easily she could swallow him whole if she wasn't careful. He tried to shake this thought out of his head and enjoy Caitlin standing still while it lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Caitlin finished her first drink, she began to loosen up a bit. While she hadn't forgotten Barry, she became much less preoccupied with his predicament as alcohol began to lighten her mood. And when Cisco brought out a tray of shots, she didn't think twice about downing two. And then two more from the next tray. Before long, Barry was more or less gone from Caitlin's mind, and the titanic brunette's only concern was having a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry experienced this as Caitlin began to dance to the music, swaying back and forth to the beat. Barry found himself in a similar situation to their walk over to the bar at first, with her boobs rhythmically hopping up and down on him, testing his durability and his sanity all at once. But as she moved side to side with the music, he also had to contend with her boobs sliding left to right, dragging him along the bottom of her bra and steamrolling him under the pillowy soft mounds as they rolled over him, clearly unconcerned about his plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all, between Caitlin's dancing, the copious amount of alcohol she had consumed, and the relatively crowded bar, Caitlin began to sweat. It was subtle at first, with Barry unsure if it was him or her producing the salty liquid. It quickly became clear it was her though, as the entire underside of her boob became coated in her sweat. Barry did his best to keep his eyes and mouth shut, not wanting to ingest any more of his friend's sweat than he needed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he couldn't do anything about though, was the added lubrication that came with the sweat. No longer able to rely on friction to hold him in place, Barry began to slide along her boob as she moved, rather than it just sliding along him. He was dragged side to side as she shimmied, ensuring his body was rubbed along every inch of her underboob. And when she bent over to adjust her shoe, he found himself sliding forward and upward, out from under the crushing weight of her breast. He gasped for air at this newfound freedom, only to have his escape impeded by a sudden headfirst collision with her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin reacted by immediately standing up straight, the sensation of a tiny man against her nipple enough to briefly remind her of her tiny friend. As soon as she did so, Barry slid back down the steep slope of her tit, ending up right back underneath it where he'd began. She subconsciously gave him a little pat, wanting to confirm his position with her fingers. Of course, this drunken pawing did little more than further force Barry into Caitin's boob flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As Caitlin leans over the bar, Barry falls out of her shirt and into her fruity cocktail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Worried about Barry getting loose, Caitlin takes him into the bathroom and relocates him to between her butt cheeks, which she believes more secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caitlin decides to do karaoke with Iris while Barry tries not to fall down out of her dress to the stomping feet below<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caitlin continued to become more and more intoxicated as the night raged on, consuming several different types of hard liquor with each new beverage served to her at the bar. She was just finishing up her third drink and had already begun stumbling back towards the counter to order a fourth, of course, this didn\u2019t help Barry\u2019s situation one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this hot and crowded bar, sweat had begun to trickle down from Caitlin\u2019s face and chest, pooling in her cleavage and threatening to drown the shrunken speedster in the salty liquid. Barry thought he\u2019d caught a lucky break earlier when he tasted fresh air as Caitlin fixed her heels, but that freedom was short-lived as Caitlin stood back up. Trapping Barry once more under the full weight of her breast once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffering at the mercy of Caitlin\u2019s tits Barry decided on his own to make an attempt at freeing himself, he wasn\u2019t quite sure where he\u2019d go after escaping but anywhere was better than the living hell he\u2019d been forced to endure thus far. Using Caitlin\u2019s sweat to his advantage Barry slide further down Caitlin\u2019s breast towards the bottom of her bra, finding himself still trapped in the bridge of her bra between her tits. It gave him an awe-inspiring view of the young scientist\u2019s boobs and cleavage, the set of massive mammaries were comparable to two large houses hanging from Caitlin\u2019s chest. Bouncing off one another just long enough for Barry to peak his friend\u2019s face through her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the looks of things, she\u2019d all but forgotten about her shrunken friend predicament since she last felt him brushing up against her nipple, almost as if she didn\u2019t care what happened to him. She took her glass to her lips and down the rest of her drink, finishing a quarter of her cocktail in just a few moments while Barry watched from below. Afterward, she lifted her glass into the air with a hearty \u201cWoooo!\u201d, celebrating the completion of her third drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry took this opportunity to start climbing up Caitlin's tits through her cleavage, however with his friend being in perpetual motion combined with the constant stream of sweat trickling down her breasts this task was easier said than done. He used all his strength to push her flesh aside, placing one hand and one foot on each of her inner boobs so that the two mounds wouldn\u2019t easily overwhelm and crush him while he climbed upwards. He felt like a starfish holding her flesh at bay, stretching each of his limbs in a different direction as he literally inched his way out of Caitlin\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d Asked a female bartender, talking to Caitlin directly from across the counter of the bar. Great, just what Caitlin needed in this situation, more alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll..take a Straaaawberry Daiquiri. Please.\u201d Caitlin said, slurring her words worse than before. Still the bartender started making preparations for Caitlin\u2019s fourth drink, meanwhile, Caitlin sat still in front of the counter giving Barry an excellent opportunity to make progress on his escape. For some reason Caitlin had failed to notice the bug-sized speedster working his way up her cleavage, she\u2019d probably forgotten all about him at this point in the night as Barry reached halfway to his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, one Strawberry Daiquiri. I\u2019ll add this to your tab.\u201d The bartender said, walking away from Caitlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMmm smells yummy.\u201d Caitlin giggled, leaning over the counter to better inhale the aroma of her fruity beverage. The scent of strawberries and lime overpowering the smell of Rum in her drink. Little did she realized the effect her actions had on her shrunken friend currently climbing up her cleavage. Her breasts swinging open as she leaned over the counter, taking away and traction Barry had and sending him into a freefall over the counter and more importantly *Splash* Caitlin\u2019s new drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flailed about hopelessly before landing inside the glass of slushy pink liquid, his fall going completely unnoticed by his gigantic friend as he called out her name all the way down into her drink. The surface of which was so thick he had an easy enough time floating around, but swimming through the mass of her Caitlin\u2019s alcohol infused beverage was proving much more difficult a task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the smell of her fruity beverage Caitlin decided to see if it tasted as good as it looked, her eyes glancing down at the glass and right over Barry who was covered head to toe in some of her Strawberry Daiquiri. She grabbed her straw and pushed it into the center of the mush, nearly striking Barry into her drink along with it. She then bends forward and pursed her lips around the other end before sucking up gallons upon gallons of liquified strawberries, crushed ice, and rum into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d she moaned in delight, obviously enjoying herself as the mass Barry was floating on began to sink by centimeters at a time. Now to low to escape out the edge of the glass Barry was forced to find an alternative means of escape before Caitlin unknowingly sucked him up through her straw as well. Fortunately, there was a strawberry cut down the middle and placed on the rim of the glass, Barry could climb it and jump down onto the counter to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin finally pulled herself away from her drink, swallowing the contents she\u2019d stored inside her mouth all at once while Barry watched from below. He couldn\u2019t believe how easily Caitlin could have just swallowed him whole, having just ingested enough liquids to fill an entire swimming pool from his point of view. Putting such thoughts aside Barry started moving towards his means of escape, the strawberry at the edge of the glass. Luckily he\u2019d fallen in on the side closer to it and managed to reach it before Caitlin was ready for another sip of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was feeling just a tad bit hungry, eyeballing the strawberry in front of her face. She licked her lips and reached down, forcing Barry to watch as her school bus length fingers pinched the strawberry and picked up the truck-sized fruit with ease. He continued watching as Caitlin brought the juicy morsel to her pink lips, sucking on it as she used two fingers to insert it into her mouth. Soon more than three-quarters of the whole fruit was inside of Caitlin\u2019s mouth and in an instant she bit down on it, severing everything but the neck of the strawberry which she promptly placed on the counter next to her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, Barry watched as Caitlin continued to chew the strawberry to mush inside her mouth, knowing the whole time that if he\u2019d gotten to it a second sooner or if Caitlin hesitated in her decision to devour the red fruit that he would have shared in its fate. Within seconds the whole mass of the strawberry was chomped down to little pieces, small enough for Caitlin to swallow with ease. Barry gulped as Caitlin did the same, watching the bulge descending down her throat while he imagined himself descending into Caitlin\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin, down here! Help me out of here, please!\" Barry called out, hoping his intoxicated friend would notice him in her drink. Unfortunately, there wasn't much else he could do at this point, he was too small to climb out of Caitlin's drink by himself. And if Barry did nothing he would more than likely end up being swallowed through her straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the two options, dealing with a giant drunk Caitlin would still be preferable to having her accidentally eat him alive. Sadly, his friend was simply too big and Barry's voice too small, his words drowned out by the noisy atmosphere of the bar. Caitlin did, however, turn her attention back towards her strawberry daiquiri. Already missing the taste of strawberry and lime on her tongue, she began playing with her straw to mix her drink first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Barry was hit by Caitlin's plastic straw time and time again as she lapped it around her drink, each time the hollow plastic hit him it carried the weight of being struck by a car. Absentmindedly she forced him below the surface, nearly drowning him before leaning toward her drink and placing the straw between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch by inch she continued to suck down her drink, the surface volume falling with each moment that passed and Barry still had yet to resurface. He could feel the current dragging him down towards the tip of Caitlin's straw, attempting to swim through the slush in order to survive. Caitlin drew in her fill and pulled herself back, swallowing the contents left in her mouth allowing Barry the chance to rise up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he was horrified, Caitlin's drink was almost half empty and at this point escape was beginning to seem impossible. He only had one hope left at this point, climbing up Caitlin's straw to the edge of the glass. However, that would also prove to be the most dangerous place for him as Caitlin continued her drinking spree. Can he make it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Yes, Barry manages to grab on Caitlin's straw while she continues drinking. Using his whole body to climb out of her glass to safety, but where will he end up while his body is still covered in the sticky substance. Back down Caitlin's shirt, on a seat next to Caitlin for Iris to sit on, or somewhere else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No, Barry can't grab ahold of Caitlin's straw as she continues to use it to stir her drink. Eventually, she sucks him up the tube of her straw and into her mouth to be swallowed, can Barry survive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Iris comes over and tells Caitlin she's had enough to drink for one night, taking her strawberry daiquiri away. However, she doesn't see any reason why she can't finish it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barry knew his only option was to get out of this drink, and fast. Given how slick the walls of the cup were, that meant climbing up her straw. This was also a smooth surface covered in liquid, but Barry had two things going for him. One was that the straw was thin enough that by wrapping his arms around it, he could sort of cling to it, sidling along it like a sloth. The other was that the sticky daquiri residue helped keep him in place, preventing a sudden fall when the giant scientist moved her straw a bit to take a sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scariest times for Barry were when Caitlin was drinking. He had initially been afraid she would start stirring her drink with the straw again, something he knew he could not survive. But he underestimated how terrifying her taking a sip would be. First there was the fact that as she leaned down towards the straw, she opened her mouth wide enough for him to see straight down her throat. He could see her uvula hanging over the dark entrance to her gullet, seeming to Barry like a sign pointing the way down to a painful acid bath and a embarrassing demise. If he were to get swallowed, he'd end up right back in Caitlin's bra, but this time as part of the fat that made up her breast. And every time she took a drink, he was a little closer to the top of the straw, and get a better look at his potential demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse than the approach was the actual drinking. When her mouth reached the straw her lips clamped down on it like a vice, and he suddenly felt the rushing if liquid beneath him. The sound of the cold strawberry liquid rushing through the straw was far louder than he ever would have guessed, and the inconsistent flow made holding onto the straw even more difficult than it ready was. Still, slowly but steadily, he reached the edge of the glass, only to find he had no way down. His only hope was to get Caitlin attention before she inadvertently knocked him back into her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Caitlin! Down here! Look at me!\" Barry yelled, waving one arm while the other tightly gripped the straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second now, the giantess would look down and see him, and he'd be saved (from being swallowed at least). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Barry, he was so focused on Caitlin, that he failed to notice Iris walking towards her, with all the balance and grace of someone who had 4 drinks in the last hour. Without warning, Iris tripped and fell towards the giant brunette, causing Caitlin to spill some of her drink down her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's Daquiri soaked body plummeted downwards into what to him was an all too familiar destination, Caitlin's breast. This time though, he landed part of the way into her cleavage, crashing into the inner side of her right boob. Everything about his experience with giant boobs so far suggested he was about to be bounced into her left boob, and he braced his body for the impact. But it never came. Instead, Barry found that the sticky liquid of Caitlin's drink had gotten him stuck to her boob, leaving him hanging in the air, suspended only by the sticky force at his back. He was staring directly at her right boob hanging just across from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry Caitlin. I need to watch where I'm going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin just laughed her drunken laugh before leaning in and whispering \"Don't worry about it Iris. The girls were getting a little sweaty anyway.\" Caitlin joked, shimmying her tits tauntingly at Iris. Barry couldn't move an inch, but that didn't stop Caitlin's left tit from hitting him in the face, smearing her sweat and Daquri coated skin across his unprotected his face. He coughed and spat when it bounced away, though he could still see it undulating in front of him, reminding him how easily it could spring back at him. He began to plan how he could get out of this situation, when the DJ made a decision for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo I love this song! Let's dance!\" Caitlin squealed, pulling Iris towards the dance floor, bouncing Barry along for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow more than anything, Barry wanted to return to the safety of her bra cup. As soon as Caitlin began to sway on the dance floor, he made the mistake of looking down in between slaps from her left boob. What he saw was a seemingly 100 story drop, down to a hard and undoubtedly sticky tile floor. And even if the fall didn't kill him, the rhytmic stomping of Iris and Caitlin's heels would have no problem squishing him into non existence. So he found himself pressing back against Caitlin's boob and desperately clutching what little boob flesh he could grab with his hands, hoping that he'd be able to avoid plummetting to his death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Caitlin was dancing with abandon, seemingly not even thinking about the tiny man she thought was in her bra. She jumped, shimmied, and twisted, boobs haphazardly smacking and bouncing all the while. Barry felt like he was between a pair of clapping hands as her boobs smacked together over and over again, as though they were frustrated he wouldn't just squish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scariest moment was when after an especially hard clap Barry suddenly felt cool air on his back, meaning he'd been unstuck! He braced for a painful fall, only to find that what had unstuck him was that he was now adhered to her left boob, this time face first. His face was so stuck by the sugarly liquid that he couldn't peel it free, and he briefly had a flash of imaging the embarrassment of literally drowning in a drop of daquiri and boob flesh, but another powerful clap slapped him back where he belonged, back first on the right boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Caitlin seemed to jump and twist all at the same time, allowing her left boob to swing over and slide down along the edge of her right, picking Barry up in the breast avalanche that ensued. Broken free of the sticky substance, he slid along the sweat soaked surface of Caitlin's breast until with barely and resistance, he slid back into her bra cup, right back under her boob where he had started. A hard bounce as her boob fell down onto him seemed to punctuate his return, welcoming him back to the painful but apparently safe prison of Caitlin's underboob. He barely minded as her boob bounced up and down on him throughout the rest of her dance, well used to it from her walk to the bar and glad to be horizontal at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, one song was enough for Caitlin. The drunk girl was too dizzy to dance anymore, and noticing this, Iris did the responsible thing and called her an Uber home. Barry wanted to kiss Iris for ending Caitlin's, horrific night on the town, but the memory of being inches away from Caitlin's giant pursed lips as she sucked on the straw ruined that image for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uber ride home was uneventful for Barry, pinned as he was under her boob. The occasional bump in the road had nothing on the walk over to the bar or his treatment during Caitlin's karaoke number. The only thing that broke up the monotonous weight bearing down on him was the occasional prod from Caitlin's fingers. She dared not talk to him directly in front of her driver, but she felt compelled to make sure he was still where she had left him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caitlin finally got home, she kicked off her heels and flopped down onto her couch, inadvertently giving Barry one last powerful slam of her breast coming down on him. Feeling his reaction, she giggled before pulling off her shirt and reaching behind her back and undoing the clasp of her bra. But when the bra fell off into her hands, she noticed Barry was conspicuously absent from the cups. \"Where'd you go Barry?\" Caitlin said, temporarily confused, before realization dawned in her drunken mind. \"Oh, I guess you weren't ready to say goodbye yet huh?\" Caitlin said with a giggle before pawing at the underside of her breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was relived to see Caitlin's hand coming towards him, but rather than delicately grabbing him, it crashed right into his face, starting the boob he was stuck to jiggling chaotically in the process. He bounced repeatedly against her fingers as the boob jumped on top of him with every bounce while her fingers rubbed across it searching for him. Finally, they seemed to feel his repeated impacts and snatched him off the pummeling breast, pulling him up in front of Caitlin's face as her bare chest continued to jiggle below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Barry? You held up under just fine....\" Caitlin slurred, smiling drunkenly. \"And you held me up too...\" She said with a giggle, cupping her boob with her hand and giving it a lift before allowing it to bounce free from her grip. \"Though don't think I didn't feel you wandering a bit...\" Caitlin continued, tapping her nipple with her pointer finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin is horny from feeling Barry against her nipple, and pushes him back against it before escalating and bringing him down to her pussy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Caitlin puts Barry down on her bed to undress, but immediately forgets he's there and accidentally sits down on him to pull her pajama pants on, going to bed unaware of him trapped between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caitlin says her feet hurt from dancing, so she'd like Barry to start rubbing them.</span></div></div>",

I'll fix this shortly\" she grins and scoots over to Iris telling her she'd be gone and minute and watch her drink, then making a beeline for the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily there was nobody around as Caitlin puts her hand into her bra and plucks Barry from her underboob \"Wow, you're really sweaty there Barr\" she grins, patting his soaked hair with a fingertip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin please stop messing around, what you're doing might get me killed\" Barry shouts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin pouts and places him on the sink \"So you don't like spending time with my booooobs?\" she asks, purposefully extending the word as she shakes her impressive bosom from side to side, Barry's face turning as red as his suit before she stops and leans down so they're both at eye level \"Well then good news Barry, cause my dress clearly isn't safe for your tiny slippery form, well unless you were intending to pinch my nipple with your entire body, in which case we can discuss that in the morning\" she winks and Barry gulps \"no, I have a foolproof plan to keep you safe for the rest of the night, a safe space for shrunken speedsters so to speak\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, then why didn't we start with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Barry, my boobs are my best feature silly\" she rolls her eyes and sways, making Barry worry again, not helped when her hand grabs him and picks him up once more \"Now, this won't be as fun as being up here with my girls\" she gives them one last jiggle for emphasis \"but you won't be going anywhere, no matter how sweaty you and I get, ha\" she giggles, then brings her hand down, while her free hand pulls up her dress, then slips her thumb into the waistband of her panties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's jaw drops as he see's the expanse of snow white skin now on display, even as someone who grew up watching Iris develop her fine and bouncing booty, Caitlin's was still impressive, for one it actually looked carved from marble, perfectly smooth, flawless skin, respectable size but firm and toned, rather than just massive... it was still massive for his inch tall form, but it was perky at best for normal observer. It was then his brain kicked into gear and he realised what she was about to do \"Caitlin, please reconsi...\" her fingers released and he plummeted into her butt crack, sliding in quick deep down the sweaty crevice caused by her tight underwear. The snap from her releasing said underwear rippled through her cheeks like a shockwave, Barry feeling it momentarily crush him between the snowy hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin moans as she feels Barry slide deeper and deeper into her ass, the feeling actually even better than when he was under her boob, maybe it was the stereo like effect of him rubbing against both off her butt cheeks, or maybe it was just the alcohol, but either way, Barry was safe, she was now without worry, and she could go back to having great night out. Shimmying the dress back down over Barry's current hiding spot Caitlin giggles to herself and walks out with a little extra swing in her step, might as well let them both have a little fun while he's back there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Cait, you were gone a while?\" Cisco asks in concern for his friend, making Caitlin nod, sitting beside him to relax and enjoy her drink for the moment, smiling around the glass as she feels Barry squirm under the weight of her ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, just the dress got a little bunchy, had to set it right again\" she replies the engineer understanding and smiles, then they clink their glasses, to a good night indeed, everyone out and having fun, even if only she knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) With all the knocking around in a slick, damp environment, Barry unfortunately finds himself coming into contact with Caitlin's asshole, and it's happy to have a shrunken speedster for a snack, the rest of Caitlin not seeming to mind at all either ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Caitlin heads home, getting out of her dress and then retrieving Barry from her butt. In her still less than full mental capacity, she decides to reward Barry for putting up with her all night, by having a little giantess/shrunken plaything fun together, or at least try to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Seems despite what she thought was perfect logic, Barry falls out of Caitlin's panties, sliding down the scientist's leg and ending up in her shoe, now in a completely unaware situation and at the mercy of Caitlin's killer heels, does Barry stand any chance of surviving the night?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been a few weeks since Cisco learned that he was a Metahuman, and he was still trying to get a grip on his new powers. Strapping on his gloves and goggles to help harness interdimensional energy, which is the only way he can activate his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, computer, generate travel path using a random location generator,\" Cisco said out loud, training to control the ability to open breaches between distant places on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travel path generated.\" A female generated computer voice announced, prepping Cisco to start using his powers. \"Star Labs pipeline.\" The computer voice announced, prompting Cisco to open a breach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a vivid image in mind for exactly where he wanted to go, throwing a punch to open the wormhole. In the blink of an eye, the breach appeared, and while Cisco couldn't see where it led, he was confident that it would take him where he wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a leap of faith, Cisco jumped through the breach, landing just outside the Star Labs pipeline. The GPS signal in his visor updating, sending the next location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Central City Park.\" Cisco heard through his earpiece, taking less time and preparation to open the next breach, exiting the pipeline and landing on a walkway close to the water in Central City Park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis change in location sent the next one in the chain, encouraging Cico to pick up the pace. \"Diamond's Stadium.\" the computer-generated voice said, as Cisco was already mid punch to open the next breach, entering the vortex and landing on the pitcher's mound at the city's baseball stadium. Cisco remembered coming here with his family when he was a kid, dreaming of being on the field, even if he was never the athletic type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCisco jumped up, fueled by his past desire of being an athlete to put a little style into his teleportation, as the computer spat out the next location \"Caitlin's Apartment.\" already opening a portal below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Cisco regretted opening the portal. He had never been to Caitlin's, and doubts she would be very forgiving if he suddenly fell through her ceiling, especially if she was in the middle of getting dressed for work. Deciding to cover his eyes just in case, hopefully, Caitlin wouldn't be too upset with him if he couldn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Caitlin's apartment, the brilliant bio-engineer was taking a nice hot shower, her clothes for the day already laid out on her bed in the next room. A portal, approximately the size of a fist opened above her clothes, and a tiny Cisco came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes after noticing that the fall was taking much longer than he'd anticipated, surprised to see himself falling towards a gigantic bra. He'd pinch himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming if he wasn't in the middle of a real-life nightmare, unable to slow his descent or change his trajectory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could process what happened, Cisco banged his face on the underwire that would support Caitlin's tits, losing his goggles in the process. Sending the tiny nerd tumbling down the bra's right cup, meanwhile, his goggles landed outside the dark blue bra. Able to hear the shower turning off as Caitlin finished her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, that's going to leave a mark,\" Cisco remarked, feeling as if he'd just taken a punch to the face from Gorilla Grodd. Rubbing his cheek, Cisco looked for a way out before Caitlin returned to get dressed. Unfortunately, the soft walls padding her bra were too steep to climb, which was surprising given Caitlin's small bust size. Definately, not the kind of thing he wanted to bring up to Caitlin if she caught him like this, positive that it would only make her more upset with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic set in as Cisco heard a door creak open in the distance, the ground wiggling below him as Caitlin's approaching footsteps sent out shockwaves that moved her bed. \"Great, exactly how I pictured my day going. Caught in the middle of a Honey I Shrunk The Kids remake.\" Cisco remarked, making his usual movie reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped from making any other moves, Cisco helplessly watched as Caitlin appeared over him wearing nothing but a tower, hair dripping wet. Both luckily and unluckily, she hadn't noticed him inside her bra as unwrapped herself, allowing her towel to fall around her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to look away, but it proved more difficult than he cared to admit when faced with the largest pair of boobs he'd ever seen, that anyone had ever seen. The scientist's 32B cup breasts blown up to immense proportions through his tiny eyes, defying gravity itself with their perkiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to stand out in the open, Cisco ran towards the padded wall closest to Caitlin, peeking up at her strictly in the interest of making sure he wasn't spotted. Fortunately, she was busy putting on her panties first, serving as an efficient distraction for Cisco. Unfortunately, however, that meant that her bra would no doubt be the next article of clothing she'd put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Cisco felt a shock as Caitlin grabbed her bra, knocking him off his feet and onto his back. Watching anxiously from below as the enormous scientist unwittingly pulled her colleague towards her chest, forcing Cisco to call out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlin wait, no Caitlin sto...\" was all Cisco could say before he was cut off by Caitlin's flesh, her supple breast flesh overwhelming him as she tightened the hooks behind her back. Concurrently, Cisco was struggling to survive the torrent of oncoming breast flesh that sought to fill every cavity inside her bra, including the inch of it his body currently occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Caitlin was about to secure the hooks, Cisco was tossed around, rolling between her wet skin and the bra's padding. But where will he wind up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Cisco ends up pinned by Caitlin's nipple and is immediately felt, leading to a quick discovery by an angry Caitlin Snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Cisco slides between Caitlin's tits, finding his way to her cleavage, where he experiences a brief calm period before she puts on a tight dress, leaving him pressed between them with little space to move or breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Cisco falls beneath the full weight of Caitlin's right breast while she finishes getting dressed for her day off, running errands, going to the gym, you decide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barry Allen was a human struck by a bolt of lightning, sending him into a coma lasting 9 months. When he awoke he discovered he now possessed the ability to move at superhuman speeds, allowing him to protect Central City from other Metahumans like him. With the help of his friends at S.T.A.R Labs they\u2019ve tackled threats to his world such as the Reverse Flash, Zoom, and most recently Aliens after the invasion by a species known as the Dominators. Now he\u2019s living with his girlfriend Iris West, who has been the target of his affection since he came to live with her and her father Joe as a kid. He is the Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been almost a week since Barry asked Iris to move in with him on Christmas, and things have been going well for them as a couple. Barry in particular was so excited to go to sleep every night next to the woman he loved, and wake up next to her the following morning. Sometimes he even made her breakfast in bed if he got up early enough, but that all changed in just one morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry rolled over in a daze, the events of last night a mystery as he opened his eyes. The last thing he remembered was telling Iris he\u2019d meet her at home before he dashed out of the Cortex at S.T.A.R Labs to fight a Metahuman threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel a gentle breeze wash over his half naked body, one of the few drawbacks he could think of where living with Iris was concerned. She was a classic cover hog, dragging all the blankets to her side of the bed almost every night he slept next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as he looked to his right side Barry was able to quickly discern that this morning wouldn\u2019t be like any other he\u2019d yet to experience waking up next to Iris. He backed up in shock, woken by the sight of a large brown wall running parallel to where he had been sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on here? Where was he? What happened to Iris? So many questions were running through Barry\u2019s head, with no clear answers coming to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever looking further to his left Barry noticed long white ropes hugging the edges of the dark brown wall where it curved upwards. The design that the ropes weaved striking Barry as oddly familiar for some reason or another, he just couldn\u2019t place his finger on the reason why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his answer soon after looking above the brown wall to see framed photos of him and Iris, ones that he remembered hanging himself in their apartment. Finally his situation had become completely clear to him, he wasn\u2019t in some strange place far from home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was standing on his own bed and the long brown wall running parallel to his body was Iris\u2019s naked back. The white ropes he saw where the wall curved upwards were parts of Iris\u2019s white lingerie hugging her shapely rear end. Barry had been shrunk while sleeping next to Iris!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry tried to calm himself, knowing how much worse his situation could be. No matter the cause of his shrinking Barry was at the very least happy to know that he\u2019d shrunk around Iris. Who knows what horrible things would have happened to him if he\u2019d shrunk around some evil Metahuman while running around Central City as the Flash. He could just as easily be toyed with by Rosa Dillon AKA Top as she Induced mass Vertigo on the shrunken speedster leaving him unable to escape before she could stomp him out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the task at hand Barry looked over Iris\u2019s half naked body, he found the best way to climb and wake Iris would be to use her lingerie as a ladder to scale her butt before walking the length of her body towards her face to wake her. Barry then approached her gigantic ebony cheeks, a large percentage of which being clad in lacy white fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry only wished that he was still a proper size to enjoy Iris\u2019s bodacious curves, at his current size getting two closer to her brown cheeks could have a negative result. He imagined this result to feel similar to trying to break up a close quarters fight between King Shark and Grodd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting all mental images aside Barry proceeded with his plan to climb Iris, wrapping his fingers around one of the countless threads that made up her panties and lifting himself upwards. Her fleshy posterior providing an ample platform for Barry to climb, luckily his hands and feet were now the perfect size to fit between the small holes in Iris\u2019s lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry continued climbing for a few more moments before disaster struck as it often did when things appeared to be going well these last 3 years. Iris began rolling in her sleep back towards the direction that Barry had woken up, forcing him to drop from Iris\u2019s ass onto the mattress below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment before turning in the hope of escaping to a minimum safe distance to avoid the impact of her rear end on his body. Even in his shrunken state Barry believed himself to be more than fast enough to move a few feet before Iris turned over completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as her tried to run away Barry noticed minimal lightning behind him which soon disappeared, before he even realized it the world sped up around him and he tripped on his own two feet. The Speed Force in his system must have been reduced along with him body, meaning that he wasn\u2019t able to fully access or control his speed while shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Barry noticed a faint shadow surrounding him as Iris rolled over, reminding him that her butt was still a threat to his safety. Although without enough of the speed force in his system to escape to a safe distance Barry simply rolled over in the hopes of minimizing potential damages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris\u2019s brown cheek hovered above Barry for only a few moments before barreling down towards him like the blade of a guillotine, smothering his body under what was likely an actual ton of butt flesh. Still despite Barry\u2019s pleas for help under Iris\u2019s rear end she continued to sleep soundly, unaware of the pain she was causing her shrunken boyfriend. In fact if it wasn\u2019t for the speed force still in Barry\u2019s system rapidly healing his body it was very likely that the weight of Iris\u2019s ass would have already broken his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft as her brown backside may seem it did not to Barry\u2019s attempt to push her flesh off his body so that he might escape, instead it seemed to fight back against his efforts. When he tried to kick her butt flesh away it would increase the weight placed on the upper half of his body, and when he tried to use his arms the same happened to the lower portion of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so much back and forth activity it didn\u2019t take Barry long to find himself trapped between Iris\u2019s panties and her large bottom cheek. Unfortunately this happened at the precise time that Iris began rolling back over in her slumbering state, lifting Barry into the air along with her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris\u2019s panties successfully kept Barry pinned against her ass until the point where she reached the arch of her roll, freeing Barry momentarily but sending further into her panties rather than freeing him from their bindings. This gave Barry\u2019s body just enough time to fall between Iris\u2019s buttcheeks as she rolled onto her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Barry\u2019s chance, all he had to do was free himself from Iris\u2019s panties and walk the full length of her naked back. Then it would only be a simple matter of waking her up so she could see that he was shrunk. However Barry would soon learn that nothing was ever so simple while standing at an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry climbed on top of Iris\u2019s smooth bare right butt cheek, alerting her subconscious mind to his presence as an itch. Looking up Barry noticed a large shadow outside of Iris\u2019s panties, quickly dashing towards him. Barry ducked down and slid across Iris\u2019s rear cheek between the two hill as her hand slapped against her flesh exactly where Barry was only a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not entirely successful at eliminating the itch at it\u2019s source the sensation caused by Iris slapping her own ass was more than enough to bring her to a conscious state. She pulled at her panties, wedging them between her brown cheeks with Barry in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken speedster endured being pulled into Iris\u2019s wedgie while trying to keep himself as far away from Iris\u2019s butt hole as possible. Once her panties were secured Iris rolled over and sat up on her and Barry\u2019s bed, trapping his shrunken body under her incredible weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, are you home?\" Iris asked, her voice echoing throughout her and Barry's apartment several time over before she reached the conclusion that Barry must have left for the morning. Most likely to save someone from one kind of crisis or another, her superhero boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she realize that she was actually sitting directly on top of Barry as he punched and kicked at her massive butt, causing yet another itch that Iris's subconscious mind noticed well before she was able to fully able to register the source of the so called 'itch'. Her body quickly going to work on taking care of this itch once and for all, grinding her butt harder onto the mattress she had been sleeping on as she stretched her arms high above her head, putting an end to Barry's retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Barry in his shrunken state his body had become even more durable than it already was with him being a Metahuman, withstanding the onslaught of Iris's flesh from all angles without caving to the pressure of powerful rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess, I'll get started with my day.\" Iris said to herself, thinking nobody else was around to hear her speak. She turned on her bed and allowed her legs to hang off the side, bringing on the return of a certain 'itch' as Barry was dragged against her rear cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris goes for her morning jog, with Barry in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris heads to Star labs to ask Caitlin if she has heard from Barry <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Iris investigates the \"itch\" further</span></div></div>",

They began to squeeze his tiny body from all sides as Iris's full weight bore down on her already sizeable rear end, causing her buttocks to expand inward as her flesh attempted to fill every vacant space beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this wasn't a pleasurable experience for Barry. Iris's flesh continued its advance, sealing the shrunken speedster in an airtight space underneath her body's weight. It took all his strength just to hold off her soft buttocks, her mighty rear end absorbing each of his blows with ease. Compared to this, a fight with Savitar or Zoom would be child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the fight would not go on for much longer as Iris noticed something was amiss, she could feel something moving around under her. It was so smaller her first instinct was that it must have been a bug or something that crawled into her bed while she was sleep. \"Ugh, ew that's disgusting!\" She yelled, quickly standing up and shoving her hand down the back of her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid motion, Iris managed to pinch Barry's body between her fingers without crushing him, lifted him out from between her buttcheeks, and immediately flung him onto the ground in front of her bare feet. He hit the ground with his back first, rolling a few times before coming to a stop not far from Iris's toes. She was wearing red toenail polish across all ten digits, taking a small step forward to position herself over this perverted little bug that had just crawled into her ass. She was about to crush it out of anger, lifting her barefoot of Barry and bringing her sole right over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, wait! Don't step on me!\" Barry yelled as Iris's foot came down fast, he braced for the coming impact but felt nothing after a moment passed. He looked up and saw Iris's foot still hovering over his tiny body, he could see her face between her big and second toes looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry?!\" She yelled, confused as she retracted her foot and got down on her knees to investigate what was going on. Her knees hit the carpet on either side of Barry about fifty or so feet away from him each, causing small quakes as Iris reached down towards her inch tall boyfriend. She picked him up again, this time more gentle than before and cupped him inside the center of her palm. She then proceeded to bring him up to about chest level where she could have a little chat with him about what he was doing between her buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun this morning?\" Iris asked, teasing Barry as she looked down at him. \"I really wish you'd let me know you were gonna pull something like that beforehand, I almost stepped on you just now.\" Iris said, her tone changing slightly to scold Barry, though the overall mood of the conversation remained playful for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Iris. I didn't make myself small, I don't know how this happened to me honestly.\" Barry said, trying to convince Iris to take his situation seriously. But she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't. Bet you didn't climb between my buttcheeks either, right?\" Iris teased, changing her tone again to an almost baby talk voice as she belittled Barry. It then became clear that she was actually beginning to enjoy this scenario.  She probably thought Barry shrunk himself with some assistance from Ray Palmer, who's Atom exosuit was able to make similarly small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell down there accidentally, trying to climb you. Look, we have to get to Star Labs. Maybe Caitlin can reverse whatever happened to me.\" Barry said, blushing as he tried to get the words out. Even he wouldn't believe himself right now, so he couldn't really blame Iris for making light of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, accidentally? So you're saying you didn't want to be down there?\" Iris teased, giving her tiny boyfriend a question with no correct answer. He'd loved Iris's butt back when he was still the size of an actual human, but at his current size getting too close to her rear end actually put his life in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- well I... I mean that...\" Barry stuttered, trying to find the right words to explain to Iris the seriousness of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris smiled, giving her answer to Barry's nonsensical babbling in the form of a kiss as she lifted his body up to her lips. It all happened so fast that Barry didn't even have time to react, he threw his arms up in a futile attempt to stop her but was quickly pinned under her pillow-soft lips. They were so warm and wet, both smooth as silk and yet firm as they pressed down on him with the weight of a train car. At that moment Iris single handledly gave the term full bodied a whole new meaning, both with the size of her lips and the kiss she'd given Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmuah!\" Iris sounded off as she smacked her lips, pulling back to afford Barry the opportunity to catch his breath. Watching his reaction, after just one kiss Iris could help but giggle, unable to contain her laughter. She thought Barry was arguably cuter like this and wanted to have some fun before allowing him to return to normal. For the past three years, he'd been protecting her at every turn. First as the Streak and now as the Flash, now she could protect him from much smaller threats. Like loading clothes in the washing machine and falling in with them for the rinse cycle, or keeping him out of the carpet so he wouldn't be sucked up by the vacuum cleaner when she decided to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted these were rather small hazards, even for someone of Barry's current size. Still, Iris was more than happy to protect him. She believed that he didn't actually shrink himself, but she saw no reason to rush getting him back to normal. She could get used to wearing the pants in their relationship for a while. Maybe nobody would notice his absence for a few days. Then, after Iris finished having her fun she could bring Barry to Caitlin so she could return him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you cute, I can't stay mad at you when you are the size of a bug.\" Iris teased, pacing back and forth in front of their bed as she considered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still doubt you ended up in my ass by accident, maybe I should punish you.\" Iris winked, giggling as she offset Barry with her comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punish? What do you mean?\" Barry asked nervously, not used to seeing this side of Iris. Which was odd, considering he's known her most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe I'll have you rub my feet. They are feeling pretty sore.\" Iris taunted, mocking Barry as she looked down at the floor, grasping the strands of carpet under her between her toes. She was only joking of course, but then again it might be fun to follow up on. She imagined his little arms and hands would feel great against her bare feet for what could be hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry could do nothing but *gulp*, swallowing the spit inside his mouth as he imagined what it would be like. Iris always enjoyed a good long foot rub before bed, and normally he was quick to oblige her in giving one. But, that was before he was small enough to fit on her toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, I'll save that for later. We have other things to focus on first.\" Iris announced, pausing for a moment as she considered all of her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all so tempting, what did she decide to do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris decides on playing with Barry for the day and bringing him over to Star Labs. Choosing to drop him down the back of her pants since he so obviously enjoys spending time between her buttcheeks. She'd do this with the intention of putting on tight pants over his body, before heading out to get Coffee at Jitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris bring's Barry straight to Star Labs in her cleavage, grabbing Caitlin and pulling her to the side to tell her about Barry's little condition. Caitlin wouldn't believe her at first, prompting Iris to show her the shrunken speedster hidden inside of her cleavage. Will Caitlin be able to help Barry, or will she inadvertently make his time being shrunk even worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Iris becomes turned on by having Barry shrunk in the palm of her hand, kissing him, and teasing him, progressively building up to sexual advances on her tiny boyfriend. She could drop him on their bed and strip herself nude standing over him, she could tease him with her ass and giant body before laying down. Will Barry be able to survive?</span></div></div>",

Then tomorrow, I'll take you over to Star Labs and see what Caitlin can do about your little problem.\" Iris winked, teasing Barry about his diminished stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, this is serious! We can't wait that long. We don't even know what caused this.\" Barry objected, voicing his opinion on the matter at hand. Not that it was of any consequence to Iris who'd already made up her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll be keeping a close eye on you. So if you get any smaller, then I'll be sure to bring you to Caitlin right away.\" Iris said, unnerving Barry a bit with the way she decided to phrase her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean if 'you feel me get any smaller' Iris?\" Barry asked, knowing he probably wasn't going to like the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, it's not like I can carry you around out in the open. I need to hide you somewhere, and what better place than somewhere I already know you love.\" Iris said, bringing her hand down around her body towards her shapely rear end. Her large ebony cheeks clad in white panties, barely holding back the tonnes of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this Iris.\" Barry gulped nervously, remembering his last encounter with his girlfriend's voluptuous ass. \tHe was discouraged by his chances of surviving a second altercation with her sizable ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a crybaby Barry. I'll make sure that you're completely safe down there.\" Iris assured, unwavering in her decision. After feeling Barry between her cheeks earlier, Iris reacted too quickly. She didn't have any time to see if she really liked or enjoyed his struggles down there. This arrangement allowed her the opportunity to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind made up, Iris lowered barry towards her ebony cheeks, peeling her white panties from her skin with her free hand to reveal her ass in its full glory. Iris made sure to give her shapely rear end an extended shake, teasing Barry before tossing him towards the two mounds of flesh. Leaving him at the mercy of his girlfriend's sizeable ass once more, which like before spread just enough to swallow his whole body between her rear cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry landed headfirst into the massive hills, rolling between them as he tried to regain his bearings and steady himself. However, Iris made this increasingly difficult for him as she laughed and giggled far above Barry's new prison. Her ass shaking in every direction as Barry squirmed around to find his place between her asscheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Barry. I told you this wouldn't be so bad.\" Iris teased, clenching her cheeks together to help bring Barry's struggles to a grinding halt. She then proceeded towards the corner of the room, her flesh assaulting Barry from all sides as she took each step. Coming to a stop in front of a mirror Iris turned to admire her curves, biting her lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment, Iris realized how easy it had been to overlook the size of her ass in comparison to Barry's new smaller size. She couldn't even begin to imagine how large each cheek must have seemed from Barry's point of view. However, this wasn't enough to change her mind. Barry was going to stay right where Iris wanted him, sure the speed force in his system was still protecting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued walking past the mirror, picking out the clothes she'd set out for herself the night before. Having already showered last night she proceeded to change on the spot, undressing herself down to her bra and panties. Which had little to no effect on Barry for the time being up until the moment Iris tossed her discarded clothing into the hamper. However, that all changed the moment she started getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris picked up a pair of leather pants she wore once before when Team Flash was fighting against Mirror Master. She could still remember asking Barry if he thought they 'made her butt look big' while he was trapped inside a mirror. Which was unfortunately Ironic for Barry giving his current circumstances, Iris's butt was more than big enough at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost considered finding something else to wear, tiny or not Iris still loved Barry. She didn't want to risk hurting him in any capacity. Soon enough she'd convinced herself she was simply overly cautious because of Barry's tiny size. But he was still the Flash, surely he's dealt with Metahuman's a whole lot tougher than her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Iris made her decision to wear them after all. She stepped into each leg carefully, pulling them up towards her thighs with minimal resistance. That's when things started getting rough for Barry as Iris struggled to pull the leather pants over her shapely curves. Her cheeks bounced with the first few tugs, allowing enough slack for them to gently glide over her panty enclosed skin. However, Barry's troubled didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing such tight pants had forced Iris's buttcheeks even closer together, forcing Barry face first into her flesh. Sprawled out again one cheek with the other kept him in place by pressing on his spine and back. Then, with one final tug, Iris secured the band around her waist. She turned to face the mirror once again, looking at her butt in the mirror a second time. \"Hmm, maybe these do make my butt look big.\" Iris smiled, hoping Barry was enjoying the full effect of her ass. Able to feel every twitch and struggle his body made between her fleshy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her leather pants secured, Iris finished getting dressed with minimal collateral damage to Barry's body as she moved around. Afterward, she could focus on her first task of the day. Which was nothing more than getting a cup of coffee from Jitters 2 blocks south. Barry was a speedster so when he bought this apartment for him and Iris he focused on her needs. Being sure to get a place centered close to places she frequented like S.T.A.R Labs, Central City Picture News, and of course her former employer Jitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take very long for Iris to gather her things and head out the door, making her way down the stairs to reach the street. From there, things progressively got worse for Barry. First, her legs began to fall and rise back up momentarily as she rhythmically made her way down each step individually. The fleshy walls surrounding Barry doing the same, rolling over his body with incredible weight behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carried on for three whole flights of stairs, Iris's cheeks hardly separating for long enough for Barry to catch his breath as she turned to walk on the landings dividing each floor. At which point one cheek(her left or right, depending on the direction she was turning) broke free far enough that Barry could almost move freely. However, it only lasted a split second before gravity pulled the mass of flesh back into orbit, slamming into Barry with the force of a wrecking ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Iris reached ground level, wondering how much Barry was enjoying his time in her ass. Although for the shrunken speedster it was hard to view the experience as enjoyable, Iris's round rear end was working him over with the strength and delicacy of a meat grinder set to pulverize him. But at the same time, he couldn't be mad at her. He loved Iris, and her butt was one of her best physical features. But at his current size, it was simply too much for him to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris soon after left their apartment building, and the rest of the walk wasn't so bad when compared with what Barry had already endured. She arrived at Jitters about 5 minutes later and proceeded towards the register. It was uncharacteristically slow. Usually, the place was abuzz with customers looking for their morning fix of caffeine. Perhaps she simply beat the morning rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, how can I help you today?\" The barista working the register asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One Flash, please.\" Iris answered, holding back a fit of giggles as she remembered that she had the actual Flash between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up.\" the Barista answered as Iris proceeded to pay for her morning drink. She grabbed her cup and proceeded to a table to consider her options of what she could do next. She stopped over her seat, being careful not to sit down too swiftly. She didn't want to accidentally crush Barry or force him into her asshole while she was still in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her weight down gently and smoothly onto the seat, first placing her butt on the chair and then gradually increasing the weight placed on her rear until she was fully seated. She continued to drink her Coffee over the course of about 30 minutes while reader the newspaper articles of her co-workers like Linda Park, leaving the rest of her day open. She could go run down some leads of her own, or decide to take barry too S.T.A.R Labs after all. What will she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris heads into work to see if there are any open stories that might explain why Barry shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris, still worried about Barry changes her mind and brings him to S.T.A.R Labs for Caitlin to examine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caitlin calls Iris and tells her that she will be leaving Central City a few days(to secretly deal with her new Metahuman ice powers), prompting Iris to arrange a date night with Barry at his current size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a relatively normal day in Star Labs. There was no particular Metahuman activity to speak of, so things were pretty calm. Barry decided to use this unprecedented time off to take some time to experiment with his suit. Specifically, he was trying to replicate the ring stored suit the Reverse Flash used. He thought he had it more or less figured out, but he would need some help making the final adjustments. And with Cisco out of town, he'd have to resort to asking Harry. Fortunately, travel between the Earths was relatively commonplace now so he headed down to the Star Labs basement to breach over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on Earth 2, Jesse Quick was preparing to enter her own breach to go visit Earth 1. She had been a superhero on Earth 2 for a while now and had gotten pretty good with her speed powers. Even so, she often found herself looking to Barry for help with new situations. This was another one of those occasions, so she decided to pop over to Earth 1 and see if Barry was around. She too headed to her breach chamber, clad in her full Jesse Quick costume, and prepared to enter the breach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Barry, both speedsters entered their respective breaches at the exact same time. This had never happened before, and it had never occurred to any of the Star Labs team that this was something they'd have to worry about. As it turned out, it was not something that the Speedforce handled very well. In order to prevent the two speedsters from colliding, the speed force twisted and warped the corridors between worlds, fighting against the momentum of the speedsters hurtling towards one another. Unbeknownst to Jesse, she was redirected back towards Earth 2 by a forced U turn in the interdimensional space. This was still considerably better than what happened to Barry. Wanting to minimize his chance of colliding with anything, the speed force took him down a rather funnel-shaped path, decreasing his size along the way. Unfortunately, he reached Earth 2 before a corresponding path had time to grow him back, and only a few seconds before Jesse did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was thrown out of a breach, landing face first on a cold tile floor. He managed to climb to his feet to wonder about where he had ended up, only to be interrupted by-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as huge objects struck down on either side of Barry. He was thrown onto his back by the force of the impact and suddenly realized that these were not two objects, but two gigantic red boots. And high above him, where the enormous legs coming out of those boots met, was the titanic butt of fellow superhero Jesse Quick, clad tightly in the red leather of her costume. As she stood powerfully above him, he felt as though he was standing at the base of the statue of liberty, though this giant lady was red rather than green. He didn't know how, but somehow the breach had to spit him out shrunken on Earth 2. And it seemed Jesse was in the breach as well, though she seemed to make out just fine size wise. As Barry realized he would need to somehow get her attention, he was glad Jesse's costume didn't include a skirt. He didn't want to make this situation more awkward than it was already going to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jesse had no idea about Barry's presence on the ground. She was too focused on the fact that she had somehow ended up back on Earth 2. She'd never had something like this happen before. It's not like the breaches usually required you to steer or anything. She turned back to the breach to have another look at it, only to watch it begin to shrink before her eyes. Just like when Cisco closed breaches on Earth 1, it dwindled in size until it completely imploded, cutting off any connection between their two Earths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's weird...\" Jesse muttered, not really sure what to make of the situation. She took a step towards where the portal had been, but there was no indication it had ever existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was concerned about the breach's bizarre closure, but much more concerned about the giant red boot swinging over his head. He darted to the side easily, relieved to find he still had his speed. Of course, given his much smaller stature, he covered much less ground on each step. He still felt the shock wave as the boot slammed down in front of him, but he managed to stay on his feet. He quickly rushed in front of her, only now getting a good look at just how massive she truly was. Her gigantic legs and ass only made up the lower half of this Titaness, and she truly towered over him when he could see all of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse! Down here! It's Barry!\" Barry yelled, hoping to get the giant brunette's attention. Unfortunately, he was too small to have his voice heard at this minuscule size. If he was going to get her attention, it wouldn't be from yelling on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Jesse's metahuman alarm notifies her of a metahuman presence, and she notices Barry on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Jesse thinks Barry is a bug, and stomps on him with her full speed, causing Barry to phase in panic. He ends up phasing right through her boot and ending up pinned under her bare foot inside her shoe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. While Jesse is trying to figure out what went wrong, Barry decides to climb her to get her attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jesse! Down here! It's Barry!\" he yelled, practically overjoyed as Jesse turned her attention to the floor, spotting a red dot in front of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is that?\" Jesse asked aloud, bending her knees to get a better look. That's when she saw it moving, which gave her all the reason she needed to obliterate it under her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, it's a bug,\" she said calmly and thoroughly disgusted, quickly returning to her full height over the shrunken Barry Allen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no Jesse I'm not a bug!\" Barry declared, trying to speak as loudly as possible. Unfortunately, he was too late. Jesse's ears were well out of the range of his tiny voice, and she had already lifted her foot off the ground to crush him like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, I have to hide.\" Barry thought out loud, quickly looking around the room for a makeshift hiding spot. He noticed a lab cart carrying chemicals only a few yards away from Jesse, which was close to a thousand feet away at his current size. Luckily, he was The Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry quickly took off in a sprint, thinking he could hide out under the cart until he could think of a better way to get Jesse's attention. Preferably one that didn't involve her stepping on him. However, he quickly noticed that the shadow of Jesse's foot had yet to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick little guy aren't you, luckily for me, I'm pretty QUICK myself.\" Jesse teased, bringing her foot down hard at the mention of the word 'Quick' enjoying her play on words. She matched her speed to Barry's without even realizing it, not even noticing that Barry the bug was using the Speed Force himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, Barry looked up as the rubber sole of Jesse's costume came down to wipe him out of existence, bracing himself for the impact when suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot reconnected with the floor, sending out a powerful shockwave that made the very ground shake. She twisted her foot in a downward motion, making sure in her mind that the bug was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm a Superhero, not an exterminator. Dad better hire somebody to take care of any more bugs crawling around here, before they have to answer to me.\" Jesse announced, lifting her foot to see that there was nothing left of the bug either on the floor or her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Barry was still very much alive. In the split second, before Jesse crushed his body to a gooey pulp, he began vibrating his molecules which allowed him to phase right through her costume. Unfortunately, the impact of her foot still caused Barry to lose his balance, tripping over his own feet and landing directly under Jesse's naked toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the odor of Jesse's feet, Barry was still happy to be alive for the time being. But, Barry quickly realized that his situation hadn't gotten any better as he tried to phase out of Jesse's costume, unable to do so. Getting inside was easy, even effortless. However, escaping Jesse's foot was still impossible for the time being, he only hoped that she would take off the costume soon and that she'd be decent by the time he escaped so there wouldn't be any further awkwardness by the time he got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, since I can't go to Earth-1 right now I might as well go on patrol.\" Jesse shrugged, unaware that a second Speedster would be accompanying her around Earth-2's Central City. Then, something unexpected happened, while attempting to access the Speed Force Barry and Jesse's potential energy was enhanced tenfold, with Jesse as the benefactor. A side effect from clashing inside of the Speed Force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what's going on?\" Jesse asked as intense bolts of bright golden lightning ran up and down her entire body, starting at her toes and running up to the top of her head and back down again. The energy was incredibly potent, giving Jesse a desire to see what she could do with this new boost to her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this sensation is incredible. I feel, powerful. \" Jesse smiled, pausing for a moment as she looked at the clock, waiting for it to hit four o' clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Tick, Tick, Tick, Click*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a Flash of light Jesse exited the room, exiting the S.T.A.R Labs building in at a moments notice. Next, she decided to test her newfound speed on the streets first. Unfortunately for Barry, he was in the worst possible spot for Jesse's test run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath her toes, Barry was battered time and time again by the large appendages. Each of which was about as big as he was, except for her pinkie which was equivalent to about half his current size, and her big toe which was nearly two times bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach digit was relentless in their assault, pinning Barry to the bottom of her boot with each other step while scrunching his face in her toe cleavage every time she lifted her foot off the ground. All while forced to live in Flash-Time, he endured all of this in real time, slowly and painfully humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse was the fact that Jesse had already worked up a sweat, made even worse by her fast metabolism, causing her to sweat more than an average person. The salty liquid covered Barry's entire body, seeping through his clothes and getting inside his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was nothing when compared to her toe jam, the black gunk wrapping itself around his face like a mud mask, making it harder to breathe and forcing him to swallow bits and pieces of it washed down with a serving of the previously mentioned foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the contrary Jesse was having the time of her life. She never felt more alive than when she was running fast enough to break the sound barrier. Enjoying the feeling of wind rushing through her hair, lightning running through her veins, not to mention the excitement of riding a roller coaster for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly approaching the ocean, Jesse decided to try running on water, something she'd yet to try since discovering her abilities. However, something about this new surge in power made her feel invincible. Like she could do anything and everything she set her mind to and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Barry was busy enduring his own version of hell under Jesse's toes, unaware that things were about to get even worse. The skyscraper-sized Speedster leaned forward, trying to increase her speed further as she neared the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step she took on the sand was hard for Barry to ignore, her foot hitting the ground hard with the force of an earthquake, and while this had become normal the aftershocks that followed were an entirely different matter as Jesse's weight sunk into the sand. Before that, she'd only been running on solid surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. However, this secondary impact was just the catalyst Barry needed to finally free himself from Jesse's sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process repeated itself several more times until Barry was dragged beneath the ball of Jesse's foot where he was forced to endure the brunt of her full weight as she pushed herself forward. Luckily, it wasn't long before Jesse hit the water, saving Barry from ending up as a stain on the bottom of Jesse's foot. Although, it did come with a few unforeseen drawbacks in exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jesse was no longer sprinting on a solid or semi-solid surface, her footfalls meet with little resistance on the ocean's surface. This meant that there was no longer anything keeping Barry in place underneath her foot, allowing him to slide freely around the underside of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting at the ball of her foot, Barry struggled as he attempted to pull himself back to safety under Jesse's toes, heading in the opposite direction entirely. In a few short moments, Barry got well acquainted with Jesse's sole, learning it's every curve as he traveled along her soft skin, swallowing what felt like half a gallon of foot sweat along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jesse could feel that something was off as Barry was involuntarily tickling her foot on his way to her heel. Now she could have easily gotten off at the riverbed and crushed the source of the disturbance the moment her foot met with the solid ground again, but she was also curious to find out what was inside of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead she ran back towards S.T.A.R Labs, making barry trip under her heel a quick one before he was slingshot back towards Jesse's toes thanks to some impressive footwork by Jesse Quick. This time intentionally grasped by the massive digits as she followed the water back to her father's research building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse rushed into the building in the blink of an eye, stopping where she'd began and looking at the clock to see that it had just hit 4:01 PM, meaning that her entire run around the city had only taken her one minute. Though being stuck in Flash-time, it felt closer to an hour for the shrunken Barry Allen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooo, record time!\" Jesse yelled, jumping joyfully as she shattered her old record of two and a half minutes to complete a patrol. Turning her attention back to whatever was in her shoe, undressing down to her underwear in a flash. The entire suit needed to be taken off just for her feet to breathe fresh air, a drawback to being aerodynamic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a nearby chair and lifted her foot up, squinting as she looked between her toes to see what looked like a tiny red bug. However, upon taking a closer look, she realized what or more accurately who was between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry is that you?\" She asked, shocked by this development. Quick to put the pieces together with her genius-level intellect she figured out everything that happened to Barry, and that he was the source of her new speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Jesse brings Barry back to Caitlin on Earth 1, popping him into her mouth to protect him from any more negative effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Jesse gets a Meta-Human alert, not wanting to step on Barry again, she secures him between her buttcheeks before running off to fight the threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Jesse likes her new speed and tells Barry she will try to help, keeping him as her new pet instead.</span></div></div>",

She was alone as far as she could tell and enjoying a moment of relative peace. The Thinker had been off the grid for a while, giving the team plenty of time to relax. Feeling her phone buzz in her pocket, she stopped walking and pulled out her phone to see who was trying to reach her. It was a call from her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris began to talk on the phone, she was completely unaware of what was going on at her feet. There on the ground, at a mere two inches tall, was Ralph Dibny. Once again, he had been shrunken and was now at the unaware mercy of a giant Iris. He had been trying to figure out a way to get Barry out of prison, and was experimenting with the tech Caitlin had been working on to try and grow him and Cisco back when they'd first shrunken. However, with no science education of his own, he'd made a mistake and shrunken himself. He ran towards her, coming to a stop between her giant boots as she stood idly, chatting on the phone. \"Iris! Look down here!\" He yelled, hoping his teammate would see him. He couldn't help but be nervous looking at the giant boot next to him. It was, in fact, the very same boot that he'd been stuck to the bottom of the first time he shrunk, and he had no interest in being squished again. \"Iris!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was fruitless. Iris couldn't hear him over her phone call. In fact, he suspected that even without the phone call his tiny voice on the ground was not going to be enough to be heard. He looked up at the towering girl, but from where he was standing, all he saw was the gigantic tent of Iris's skirt. And at the top of that tent, he could see Iris's underwear. It was a red thong that covered her crotch but left little of her tremendous ass to the imagination. He could see her gigantic brown cheeks, each one big enough to obliterate him were he to be unfortunate enough to find himself under one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shake the sight out of his head, his fear of being squished overwhelming his attraction to the giant girl. However, he doubted he'd ever forgotten the sight of the biggest ass he'd ever seen. Not wanting to be caught in this compromising position, Ralph tried to stretch his arms out to wave for Iris's attention but found instead that his stretchy powers weren't working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ralph continued his futile attempts to get her attention on the ground, Iris was none the wiser. After several minutes, she finished up her phone call with a \"Love you dad.\" before hanging up her phone and taking a step towards the exit. As her foot hit the ground, she heard a familiar SQUISH. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris lifted her boot and checked the sole, silently hoping she was wrong about what she was about to say beneath it. What she found was a squished Ralph, splattered on her sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01a87f3de76dff773cf9800d6a6fc803/tumblr_p3egqw5nZK1r6vy8ho4_540.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/01a87f3de76d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ralph! How are you so tiny again?!\" Iris said, once again peeling him off her boot in disgust. \"And what are you doing down on the floor by my feet again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god you found me, Iris. I've been standing at your feet for like 10 minutes trying to get your attention.\" Ralph said, catching his breath after Iris's boot had squeezed it out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been down there for 10 minutes?\" Iris asked, suddenly self-conscious of the fact that she was wearing a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Iris you weren't noticing me....\" Ralph explained, not liking where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided the best way to get my attention was to stand on the floor between my legs and yell my name? Even after it wasn't working? Why didn't you use your stretchy powers?\" Iris asked skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My powers aren't working for some reason,\" Ralph answered, trying not to make eye contact with the terrifying giantess. This was hard given that her eyes were bigger than satellite dishes and trained directly on him. But it was true. He'd tried to stretch his arms to wave in front of Iris's face, but had found himself unable to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean your powers aren't working? I scraped you off my boot just a second ago! If you had lost your powers, you'd be a blood stain!\" Iris said angrily, now feeling confident Ralph was lying. \"You weren't trying to get my attention at all you little perv! You shrunk yourself so you could spy on me and Caitlin, and then when I came in here in this skirt you decided to try and sneak a peek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Iris that's not it at all. If you'd just lis-\" Ralph began, before being cut off by Iris squeezing her fist around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am done listening to you Ralph. You need to be taught a lesson. And I know just how to do it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Iris do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris licks her lips, deciding that Ralph would make a delicious piece of gum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris squeezes Ralph into a ball, before molding him into a skimpy thong. If Ralph wanted to look up her skirt, she was going to make sure he got a <i>really</i> good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Iris throws Ralph down on the floor, stomps him flat, then inserts him into Caitlin's nearby flat. She thinks he would make a perfect insole for the brunette scientist.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because you are the perfect size to help me out with a little problem I'm having, you see I forgot to pick up some gum on my way here. I've been chewing a lot lately to help take my mind off Barry until we can prove his innocence.\" Iris mused out loud, licking her full red lips while holding Ralph in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph quickly caught on to Iris's plans and immediately began to voice his concerns, though they weren't of much concern do Iris giving the immense size difference between the two. \"Iris wait! Can't we talk about this first?\" Ralph asks, causing Iris to pause as she brought her free hand under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nope. I need a piece of gum and your the closest thing here.\" Iris responded, lifting Ralph above her hand as she dangled his body by the arms. Gravity pulling him down towards Iris's parting lips as she flashed her perfect white teeth at the shrunken man. Every couple of seconds his arms would stretch by a few more inches, slowly but effectively bringing him even closer to Iris's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's eager to get this started. I'd have to be rude and keep you waiting, so I'll just let you go now.\" Iris teased, tilting her head back and giving Ralph a good look inside her mouth. Her perfect white teeth that caught his eye before, the slippery pink serpent waiting to make Ralph its unwilling plaything, and a dark cave in the back of her throat that appeared to go nowhere as it faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stayed true to her words and released Ralph from her grasp. Allowing him to freefall into her mouth, and without the full usage of his powers, Ralph was unable to stop or slow his descent.  He landed on her upper lip first, but the soft pillow-like surface absorbed his weight before pushing him back towards the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris quickly pursed her lips, ensnaring Ralph's legs between her lower and upper lips. She struggled to look down, wanting to see the expression on Ralph's face before what happened next. Soon after, Iris because sucking Ralph down like a piece of wet spaghetti, drawing him into her mouth as he tried to prevent the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph reached up, trying to grab onto Iris's nose as he felt his entire lower body stretch into the form of a long thin noodle ending at her tongue. 95% of his legs had already been scarfed down, shrinking even more as they were reduced to the width of string fibers. Even as his waist was being drawn in by Iris's wet lips, Ralph tried to ignore just how good it actually felt. Being on the receiving end of what was essentially a blow job from a 400-foot tall beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris giggled as she felt Ralph grabbing onto her nose, partly responsible was the fact that it actually tickled her. She smiled once more before tightening her lips hold on Ralph's waist, swirling her tongue around his legs and dragging him into her mouth. With one last breath wasted on screams for mercy from the black giantess, Ralph's voice was silenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly following this, Ralph struggled to gain his bearings inside of Iris's mouth. His entire lower body stretched across her massive tongue, the cave surrounding his so dark that he couldn't see where his own legs ended as they lead towards her throat. Clearly the last part of Iris's mouth he wanted to move closer towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Ralph could get his bearings and move in any other direction Iris's tongue suddenly jerked toward the right side of her mouth, tossing the shrunken man onto her molars. Beyond thoughts of mercy at this point, Iris saw no reason to spare Ralph any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw snapped upwards, pinning Ralph down as he headed for her top teeth at breakneck speeds for a person his size. He tried to raise his arms in a futile effort to defend himself from the inevitable outcome. Unfortunately, it was a pointless endeavor and Ralph soon found his body smashed into a gooey pulp between Iris's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SPLAT!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily his body was still made of rubber and curved into the shape of her molars. Not to say that the experience still wasn't both terrifying and humiliating for him, he was starting to feel like an empty container of toothpaste. But Iris still wasn't done with him just yet, she had only just begun to turn him into her unwilling piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began chewing on him gently at first, rolling him from the front to the back of her mouth in an effort to give all of her teeth the chance the bite the shrunken man. Despite the fact that his body wasn't being cut to shreds or torn into itty bitty pieces Ralph was still in considerable pain. Iris's canine's proved to be the worst to deal with, not because they impaled him or inflicted more damage but because of the way they hit him. It was almost like his was being turned inside out, being nothing more than a ball of goo and spit at this point he was fairly certain that he had swallowed his own arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with Ralph totally pulverized by her teeth, Iris didn't stop to hold back for a singular moment. She continued chewing on him as if he were an average piece of gum, with no real plans for what she'd do with him when she was done with him. She continued to casually parade around the room, doing something she hadn't originally planned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">* Pooof, Pooof, Pooof! *</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>^</b> Was the sound his body made as it was smashed between her teeth before Iris rolled him back onto her tongue and then behind her four front teeth. She poked her tongue into Ralph's back, or maybe it was his chest or stomach, even Ralph couldn't tell at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris pushed Ralph's body between her large full lips with her tongue, blowing a stream of air into the pocket space his form created, filling him up like a hot air balloon in the process. She wasn't even aware of what she was doing herself until Ralph's body swelled up to the size of a small marble outside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body continued to fill with air, stretching out more and more for a few moments as Iris became aware of what she was doing. She paused for a moment to giggle, allowing one of ralph's limbs to break free of her lips grasp. Quickly he deflated like any other bubble, guess he really was Iris's gum in every sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up resting on the tip of her tongue, just outside her mouth. His body slowly morphing back into its original human form, spitting out his own arm that had traveled down his throat. Just then a door opened in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris? What are you doing down here?\" asked a familiar female voice belonging to none other than Caitlin Snow herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Iris muttered, caught off guard. She didn't want Caitlin to find out what she was doing to Ralph, at least not yet. Perhaps she would reveal him to her alternative persona Killer Frost right away but she'd have to convince Caitlin about what she'd caught Ralph doing first or she might react in the wrong way. She pulled her tongue back into her mouth, flipping Ralph over and pinning him underneath her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Caitlin. Umm, I'm not really doing anything. Just got off the phone with my dad about finding a way to get Barry out of prison.\" Iris responded, coming up with the most believable lie she could on the spot. Her loud voice deafening to Ralph at such a close range. Luckily, Caitlin had no reason to doubt Iris nor any proof to say that she was doing otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay Iris, we'll get Barry back and stop DeVoe. Somehow.\" Caitlin said, unsure of their chances with only Ralph, her, and Cisco. Team Flash had never before operated without a speedster present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin asks Iris to help her with something in her lab, Iris takes this opportunity to spit Ralph out... onto Caitlin's chair before she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Caitlin asks if Iris would like to unwind with her tonight at a local bar to get drunk with her, Iris not wanting to reveal Ralph just yet makes an excuse to leave the room and forms Ralph into the shape of an insole for her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Very suddenly Cisco breaches into the room, accidentally startling Iris into swallowing Ralph. Now she must decide if she should tell Caitlin about what she was really up too or try to solve this new problem on her own.</span></div></div>",

She repeatedly dropped her foot onto him, covering the shrunken man in dirt and dust. He shut his eyes to shield them and braces for each time she crushed him. Finally, the foot lifted off and didn't return. He opened his eyes slowly and looked at himself.

He could see that he was still in the Cortex, and that he was behind the desks, and that he was being moved towards a red object. What--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to do great, Ralph.\" Iris pressed Ralph into something. Something stiff and slightly warm. He looked around as much as he could in his current state/ The sides of whatever structure he's in curved up above him. There was an arch running above him, shielding his eyes from the piercing lights overhead. His other senses returned slowly and he could smell a faint odor. It was... oily. A little off-putting. He sniffed deeply and his nose was assaulted slightly by a penetrating smell. He gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\" Iris's voice carried somewhere ahead. \"You are now the 'sole' proprietor of Caitlin's high heel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head rapidly. \"That--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stopped short. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Caitlin walks into the Cortex, her feet sore. She's leaving for the day and is looking for her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Iris thinks for a moment. She decides to pull Ralph out of the shoe and stuff him down into her own boots.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barry Allen had been putting overtime hours into his career as the Flash in his efforts to stop the Metahuman Killer known as Cicada to the citizens of Central City. He'd just finished a three-hour patrol of the city with his daughter Nora, from the future, returning to Star Labs while she eagerly pushed on to find a lead on the villain's whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for a moment to himself, Barry rushed towards the newly discovered Star Labs lounge, finding it empty upon his arrival, choosing the closest seat to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling tired, Barry decided to rest his eyes for a few moments, leaning back into his seat, and falling asleep minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed before Barry found himself waking up with a massive headache that reminded him of the hangovers he experienced before becoming the Flash. And as he sat up, it quickly became apparent that he was no longer in the Lounge at Star Labs, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer observation of his surroundings, Barry realized that he was still at Star Labs, it was just the room that had gotten bigger. Barry Allen had shrunk to the size of a fly, wondering how this was even possible without a soul around him to claim responsibility. Could it have been a side effect of overusing his powers lately? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of many possibilities before resolving to call for help, Barry was thankful that his suit had shrunk along with him, using his communicator to contact Iris for aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, I was just about to call you. Are we still going to have Nora over tonight for movies, I was wondering whether or not I should pick something up, she might be a little old for Alice In Wonderland and A Bug's Life.\" Iris said, unaware of the fact both movies could be related to Barry's current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, listen, I'm in trouble. Big trouble and I need your help right away. But first, I need you to promise that you won't laugh.\" Barry said nervously. Wondering how Iris would take the news that her husband was tinier than one of her bootstraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Barry, you know that I would never laugh at you if you were genuinely in trouble. Just tell me what going on. You're not hurt, are you?\" she asked, thinking he sounded just fine over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, at least not physically. But I'm definitely in danger.\" Barry said, looking around, realizing how easily a one-inch tall man could get hurt in such a big world. \"I've been shrunk, Iris,\" Barry announced over his communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean like how Cisco and Ralph shrunk to two inches tall last year?\" Iris asked, looking down at her feet to see that she was wearing the same boots she stepped on Ralph with last year. Maybe they were cursed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cisco and Ralph were shrunk?\" Barry asked, having not heard the story since he was in prison at the time. Drawing Iris back to the conversation at hand, \"Did they find a way to reverse it here? Barry asked, hoping science would save the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you want to try Harry's enlarging ray, which almost made Cisco and Ralph explode. Should we call Nora to come and pick you up, she can get there a lot faster than I can.\" Iris offers, making a good point. They had a daughter with super speed now, why wouldn't Barry call Nora over her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want her to see me like this. I'd much rather have her look up to me as a role model than to have her looking down at me like a tiny bug.\" Barry answered, prompting Iris to drop the article she was writing to go help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Barry, I have your location now, I'll be there in 10 minutes.\" Iris declared as she hung up the phone, leaving Barry alone in the quiet room, only to have that silence interrupted by the sound of a door creaking open and shutting behind someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry ran towards the center of the cushion, finding that his super-speed had been lost in becoming small. Turning in anticipation, looking over the chair's arm, Barry saw Cecile Horton walking into the room. She was carrying a stack of case files under one arm and holding a cup from Jitters in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering DA of Central City was looking to take care of some late-night case files in the secluded area of Star Labs, and Barry was there waiting to cushion her seat. The mature giantess casually strolling in front of Barry on the chair, paying no attention to the tiny speedster as he waved his arms in a desperate attempt to get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cecile simply turned away from him, bending over to place her coffee cup on the table in front of her, giving Barry a glimpse of her purple thong in the process. The thin fabric leaving little to the imagination as it receded into the comfort of the light brown cheeks. A loud bang forced Barry to cover his ears as Cecile dropped all her case files on the table with a resounding thud, forcing Barry's attention away from the three-hundred-fifty-foot DA for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Barry recovered it was already too late, the area surrounding him had darkened and Cecile was already in the process of sitting down, her gargantuan rear hurdling towards him from above. Even without his powers, Barry observed the entire exchange in slow motion, unable to do anything to stop the inevitable from occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he blinked, overtaken by Cecile's fleshy bottom in less than a second, forced deep into the forgiving cushion below while the orbs of flesh above sought to eradicate him. He struggled in vain, hoping she would notice his movements under her as she settled into her seat completely oblivious, grinding her butt in a downward spiral on the leather surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Iris finally arrived on the scene, horrified as she turned the corner to see Cecile sitting in the same chair she had tracked Barry's coordinates. Fearing the worst, she imagined how Barry would fair in a fight against the DA's larger ass, hoping that she hadn't been sitting on Barry for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Iris, Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be at home, spending time with Nora and Barry!\" Cecile said, noticing Iris standing in the hallway. Putting the younger black woman on the spot as she contemplated whether or not she should tell Cecile about Barry shrinking and possibly being underneath her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cecile's Meta-Human power interrupted her train of thought as she sensed Iris's distress, giving her an opening in the process. \"Iris, is something bothering you?\" the empath asked, pausing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, yeah. I'm sorry to bother you but I think I lost something in here earlier and I was sitting right there. Would you mind standing up for a moment so I can do a quick search?\" Iris asked, deciding to be nonspecific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Iris, of course. What is it? You didn't lose your wedding ring again, did you?\" Cecile asked, shifting from left to right on her seat to look for any small objects while Iris winced uncomfortably at the thought of Barry being smothered by her step-mother's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry. Let me get up so you can look for yourself.\" Cecile announced, standing up and taking one last look at her seat to see nothing left behind, besides the imprint of her fine buttocks, straightening out her skirt while Iris began to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journalist then lowered herself to examine the cushion, searching for any clues as too what might have happened to Barry, hoping he managed to get out of the way before Cecile made him her unwilling seat cushion. Beginning to worry that he wouldn't survive long in a drawn-out fight against the DA's powerful rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Iris, you seem distressed. Did you lose something important?\" Cecile asked, picking up on Iris's negativity and desire to find Barry before something terrible happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything is fine. Just misplaced something small is all, I'm sure it will turn up soon. But first, I need to make a call.\" Iris said, excusing herself as she hurried around the corner to contact Barry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry I'm at Star Labs, where are you?\" Iris asked, trying her best to keep her voice low despite the obvious panic the situation had put her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, I need your help. Listen I'm...\" Barry began to say before some overpowering force interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry, I'm glad you're okay. I was worried Cecile might have sat on you on accident. But I didn't find you on here seat, just tell me where you are and I'll make up an excuse to grab you.\" Iris said, peering around the corner to see Cecile bent over the seat searching for whatever it was Iris might have lost. \"Hurry.\" Iris urged, wanting to find him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecile did sit on me! I'm stuck to her thong!\" Barry yelled through the mic, wanting Iris too save him as quickly as possible. Forced to endure the unyielding assault of the DA's cheeks as she constantly shifted positions, searching for something that was already engulfed by her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris's heart sunk, looking in closely at the DA's butt wondering just how tiny Barry had become, unable to see so much as a red dot along the purple fabric swallowed up between her buttocks. \"Don't worry Barry, I'll figure out some way to save you,\" Iris announced, hanging up and trying to come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could always tell Cecile the truth, not like Iris could just casually walk up behind her and reach for her ass without a proper explanation. Then again she would prefer to keep Cecile unaware, not wanting her to feel bad about hurting Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris walked back around the corner, determined to find some way to retrieve her husband when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Cecile invites Iris to join her and Nora at the yoga studio, saying it might help her to relax and calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.Cecile says she has to go to work and leaves, so Iris calls Caitlin and Cisco to the cortex where they develop a plan to free Barry. Possibly with a new invention or Cisco's vibe powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Iris is forced to tell Cecile the truth before she can sit on Barry a second time.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't exactly let her husband get chewed up by her step mother's ass all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Cecile, I have to tell you something, but I need you to stay calm...\" Iris began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Iris, let me just sit down...\" Cecile said, beginning to lower her ass back down towards the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Iris shouted, startling the the older woman. \"Barry is in your butt!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile didn't respond, for a moment, too confused by what Iris had just said. \"What are you talking about Iris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barry shrunk somehow and was standing on that chair. He had called me to come pick him up, but you were already sitting there. I was hopeful that he had moved in time, but I just called him and he said he is stuck to your thong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\" Cecile said, immediately reaching back and lifting up her skirt. She used one hand to pull her cheeks apart, and the other to gently grip the fabric of her thong, pulling it out from between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry sighed with relief as he saw Cecile's hand coming towards him. As embarrassing as this was, at least it was almost over. He felt the grip of Cecile's cheeks on his body loosening as the thong was pulled further and further out of her ass, until he finally saw the light of Star Labs again. And framed by that light was the face of his wife, Iris West. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see him Iris?\" Cecile asked, trying to peek over her shoulder. Iris was kneeling behind her now, with her face level with Cecile's ass, looking for her shrunken husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've got him.\" Iris said, smiling at her tiny husband. She saw the look of relief on his face, and was instantly glad she had told Cecile the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God you saved me Iris.\" Barry said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet.\" Iris said, taking grip of Cecile's thong in her left hand, and then pinching Barry gently in her right hand. She tugged on her shrunken husband, trying to pull him free from the thing, but he didn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Barry?\" Iris asked, trying to ignore the fact that she was kneeling in front of Cecile's ass, talking to her boyfriend mere inches from the attorney's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all tangled up in the threads.\" Barry explained. \"I think you're going to have to cut me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris relayed this message up to Cecile. \"Oh Barry I'm so sorry...\" Cecile said, feeling absolutely terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Cecile, Barry is completely unhurt, looks like the shrinking process made him pretty durable.\" Iris said, trying to assuage the giant woman\"s guilt. \"We are going to have to cut him out though. Do you have any other panties to wear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile shook her head. \"Not at Star Labs. I'd have to get them from the house. Do you have any here I could borrow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, unfortunately not.\" Iris said, realizing what this was going to mean for Barry. She decided to break it to him gently. \"Ok Barry, we can't cut up Cecile's thong until she has a new one to wear, otherwise she will be walking and driving around without panties. So you are going to have to stay back there a little bit longer, just until we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry couldn't believe what he was hearing. Iris wanted him to stay in Cecile's butt for longer? \"I don't think that's a good idea Iris...\" Barry said, but Cecile immediately cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Barry, I know you're back there now so I'll be extra careful.\" Cecile's said, telepathically sensing the tiny man's anxiety. \"And look on the bright side, at least you're stuck on the outside.\" Cecile continued, causing both her and Iris to chuckle. Barry wasn't laughing though. Barry was imagining how easily he could get lost in Cecile's seemingly endless ass if he were to somehow end up inside her thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry tried again. \"Iris, it's just that-\" Barry began, trying to find words to describe exactly why he didn't think being trapped in a giant ass was a good idea, but this time Iris interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Barry, do you trust me?\" Iris asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do Iris, you're my wife.\" Barry answered automatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then let's get going.\" Iris said, releasing her grip on Cecile's thong. Barry's eyes widened as he felt the surface he was attached to shooting back towards his giant step mother in law's ass, the momentum causing her thong to slide a bit between her cheeks. \"The sooner we leave, the sooner we get you off of Cecile's panties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecile was still feeling very awkward about the whole thing, but she figured Iris was right about that last bit at least and dropped her skirt back over her ass. She was relieved to have her butt covered again at least, even if there was still a superhero trapped inside it. She had already decided that she would be wearing pants to Star Labs for the foreseeable future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry of course, was horrified. He had been so relieved to get free from Cecile's butt, only to be dragged back into the embrace of her gigantic cheeks. He struggled against Cecile's cheeks in protest, his hands hitting against the insides of her cheeks, but that did not have the intended effect. Cecile's cheeks clenched involuntarily around him, squeezing him in a sort of hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wiggle so much Barry! It tickles!\" Cecile said, feeling his frustrations with her abilities. \"I promise we will get you out of there as soon as we can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris just shook her head as she watched this insane scene. The world she lived in now certainly was crazy. As she watched Cecile, she could hardly believe her husband was trapped in that giant butt. In a way, it made her strangely jealous. She obviously didn't want her husband to be in anyone's butt, but if he had to be, she at least wished it was her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Iris and Cecile get in the car and head home without a problem, though Nora is there when they arrive (reserved). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Barry tries to free himself to avoid spending more time in Cecile's butt, but accidentally phases inside her thong. Caitlin and Cisco arrive at Star Labs before she can take him out, and she is too embarrassed to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Barry tries to free himself to avoid spending more time in Cecile's butt, tearing himself free and immediately falling down into Cecile or Iris's shoe without them knowing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iris was having a relatively quiet morning. She was sitting in her apartment, hard at work on a new story about how Spencer Young had used her phone to manipulate people into doing her bidding. She was also alone, since Barry was off on a several day mission on Earth 38. He normally wouldn't leave Central City for that long, but Supergirl needed his help and with XS here, he didn't have to leave Central City unprotected. Iris wasn't sure that XS was ready to try superheroing on her own, with Cisco out of commission and Caitlin also powerless, but Barry had insisted their daughter was ready to handle it and that Kara really needed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting hungry, Iris walked over to the fridge, looking for some leftovers she could heat up. As Barry and Nora could attest, she wasn't much of a chef, so reheating something Barry had cooked seemed like the safest bet. Before she could find anything though, a flash of light from behind her blinded her, and everything went fuzzy for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her vision cleared, two things were apparent. One was that she was no more than an inch tall, standing on her kitchen floor. The other was that her enormous daughter Nora was standing over her, strange device in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, what's going on?\" Iris yelled, unable to believe how enormous her daughter now was. As she stood on the floor before her daughter's enormous feet,  she couldn't but remember back when Cisco and Ralph had shrunken and she had accidentally stepped on Ralph. She recalled peeling his tiny body off the bottom of her heel and shuddered at the possibility that she could end up under her own daughters foot the same way. But since she wasn't stretchy the way Ralph was, she didn't think it would end as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's easy Mom. I decided I can't forgive you for how you secretly suppressed my powers for all these years, and since you decided to stand by your decision even without knowing why you did it, I have to resort to plan B.\" Nora said, her voice full of barely concealed anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Plan B?\" Iris asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan B is I force you to change your mind.\" Nora said with a grin. \"I shrunk you so that I could teach you a lesson. At this size, I can do whatever I want with you. I could pin you under my feet, suck on you like a piece of candy, or maybe tuck you into my XS costume so you can see what a good speedster I really am. And I intend to torment you like this until you swear you'll never restrict my powers in the future.\" Nora explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her own daughter shrunk her down to torture her until she got her way. Clearly metahuman tantrums were much more dangerous than those of regular children. If anything, this made her more confident in her decision to limit Nora's powers. Obviously this wasn't want she wanted to hear though. Deciding it was ok to lie if it would get her out of this, Iris replied \"Ok ok Nora I understand. I swear I won't limit your powers in the future, just please let me go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora paused for a moment to look at her shoulder, where the scar from her implant was still visible. After a few seconds, she turned back to her tiny mom. \"Liar! If you really change your mind, my scar will go away because you'll never implant me!\" Nora seethed. \"Clearly you won't learn your lesson until I have some fun with you. Just know that  whatever I do to you now, I'll do even worse to you once I go back to the future if you don't decide to see things my way. Now, what should I do with you ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"How about we have a little mother daughter heart to heart?\" Nora asks, before dropping Iris down her shirt and squeezing her between her boobs. Eventually she allows her to slip into her bra beneath one of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I think you need to see what a pain in the ass you've been\" Nora says, before pulling open her pants and slipping her mother down between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"I think you should see just how hard it is to be running around saving people all day\" Nora drops Iris into her XS boot, and allows her to get trampled at super speed all day throughout a day of superheroing<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nora bends into a squat, making sure to keep the bug sized woman directly between her bare feet even if just to keep her in direct line of sight \"So mom, seeing as you've been trying to force me to spend time with you since I showed up at Papa Joe's doorstep, how about I grant you wish\" Iris blood runs cold at the smirk on Nora's face, mostly because it reminded her of Killer Frost and Amianete, dark and foreboding \"In fact, maybe we should have a little heat to heart, get something on my chest\" the intentional slip up clued Iris into her daughter's plan and instinctually she tried to run, but with the size difference and Nora's speedster powers she never stood a chance, Nora plucking her off the floor between 2 fingers as she stands back to full height and pulls open her sleepshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite the occasion mom, you're the first person to see my twins uncovered, so good news, your daughter isn't a slut. Not that I could even if I wanted to, girls aren't interested in a woman with an 8 o'clock curfew\" Nora mutters with contempt, Iris wincing as she remembers the rather unsubtle jabs Nora had made at her controlling nature and can see her powers were just the most painful method future her had used. It also served as a momentary distraction, causing her to forget what was going on and where she was until Nora let her go, causing her to plummet into the cleavage of her daughter's lower C cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of what was basically an itch to Nora became a much more primal feeling knowing it was her mother struggling against her bosom \"Oh this is so shway, why did I never think to shrink a girl and make her my toy?\" she huffs, but decides thoughts like that were unimportant right now, tormenting Iris came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning her hands along her hips and up her torso they stop in order to get a good squeeze of tit, bouncing them around with her hands before pressing them together, moaning at the way the squirming increases as she presses harder on her inch sized mother \"You having fun?\" she taunts, grinning now \"I sure am. You may want to hold onto something\" the comment was useless and rally just made for fun, as Nora decides to use one of the skills learnt from the museum and improved with her father's training as a tool to torment her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a speedster Nora could do more than just run really fast, she could vibrate her body at speeds which blur her form, meaning Nora could perform a 'Reverse Flash' something she'd fantasised about doing to Iris when she'd first discovered her lies, but could also do it to other parts of her body... such as Iris' current prison, aka her breasts. Vibrating her hands (she was still new to this so needed a way to initiate other body parts) she cups her breasts then releases before her eyes roll back in her head at the sensation of her breasts jiggling faster than the human eye could follow. Feeling that was enough of that, for both herself and Iris she grabs her chest and they stop, though they still bounce a little at her panting. Pushing aside the shoulder of her shirt she frowns, the scar still taunting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris pants and groans as the class 20 earthquake she felt like she had just lived through finally stopped, it was bad enough when she found herself in a marshmallow vice, being crushed between her own daughters breasts was an experience she couldn't quite get her head around, but that, she never wanted to feel THAT ever again. Unfortunately for Nora Iris still wasn't backing down, the shrink gun was probably from her time period so there was probably a risk of this happening to her any way, but adding that to her speedster powers and that was a Hellish combination, there was no way she was letting this girl get allowed free rein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as things had quieted down, Iris decided to try her hand at escape, believing at her current size Nora wouldn't feel her as long as she couldn't see her. This actually meant at least in Iris's head that the better option for escape was to go down her top, which exposed her skin just above her navel, then run and hide in the sofa or whatever chair Nora had commandeered until Barry gets back, then they can discipline their brat of a daughter together and deal with this mess as well as force her to grow her back and admit Iris had been right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis entire plan hinged on a fact she didn't actually have: That Nora couldn't feel her movements. This was false as she knew Iris was moving the moment she started to walk across her skin, her frown becoming a scowl when the direction made Iris intentions clear, sneaking away while Nora wasn't looking and then hide like a coward. Nope, na ah, that wasn't something Nora was going to allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Iris still in her cleavage Nora pulls off her top and pressed her breasts together once more, then standing up and letting Iris drop into her waiting palm \"Trying to escape your punishment Mom? That's quite a bad example to set your kid, don't yeah think?\" Nora hisses, then that smirk was back \"I guess I'll need to make sure you don't go anywhere, I think leftie won't mind the company\" Nora unclips her bra, depositing a squirming Iris into her left cup before giving her a little wave \"Have fun\" she taunts, reattaching her bra and pinning Iris under her let tit. Dropping back into the chair she grins as her breast bounces before flattening her mother like a steamroller, sighing as she lets some of her anger go, the torture strangely cathartic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I can't keep you like this\" Nora finally speaks bluntly to Iris, not expecting a response from beneath her breast \"You need to be normal sized in order to sleep with Dad and have me, so I only have a little bit of time to convince you not to implant me. I suppose if not then when I get back Iris West-Allen will never be heard from again, but for the moment I'm going to get as much fun out of tormenting you as I can, and you get to have that mother daughter day you've been begging for since I arrived\" she palms her breast, grinding Iris into her malleable flesh \"You're stuck with me till Dad gets back, so enjoy it because I have lots of plans in store for us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nora has a little fun, running on a normal treadmill may do very little for a speedster but all that bouncing should make things pretty bad to Iris rather swiftly<br>\r\n2) Cisco calls to inform her of a meta attack, looks like Iris gets to see XS at work up close and personal<br>\r\n3) Caitlin pops in to check on the West-Allen's for Barry while he was gone, giving Nora a perfect opportunity to try a less direct but possibly more effective method of getting Iris to break: Shrinking Caitlin and forcing Iris to watch as she torments the brunette in her place.</span></div></div>",

Nora felt a rush of power deep inside of her, having her own mom completely at her mercy. Slowly, she walked over to the door of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris, meanwhile, was not having the best time. Nora had no regard for her comfort and constantly squeezed Iris as she shook her around, giving her intense vertigo. Iris couldn't see a thing until she felt the massive fingers fall away as she plunged down into darkness. Her face impacted onto a solid but oddly squishy surface. She wasn't injured, but she was definitely hurt. Shakily, she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be in some sort of dark tube. Her gaze turned upwards to the small amount of light that she could see from the tube's top end. All she could see was her ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entirely new sensation made itself known just then. A deep, pungent odor penetrated Iris's nose. She brought her hand up to her face but found that it was covered in a weird, almost wet substance. She sniffed it and recoiled at the whiff. A major new fact fell into place just then. Iris was inside of Nora's XS boot. She gasped and fell onto her ass on what had to be the heel of the boot. She apparently hadn't taught her daughter hygiene in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's voice was muffled but still boomed overhead. \"Hey, mom, a word of warning. The best place to be when I'm wearing these would be in the toe section.\" Iris's eyes grew wide. Nora wasn't actually going to <i>wear</i> the boots, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response, Iris saw what little light she had quickly fading. She looked up and saw 5 massive toes moving over the boot's entrance. A new and equally bone-chilling revelation came to her suddenly: Nora wore the boots without socks. Everything that was Iris's current world had been personally graced by Nora's bare foot, even when she was sprinting around the city. Iris couldn't imagine what her feet must smell like after a day of running, but she figured that she wouldn't have to wait much longer to find out. She quickly followed Nora's advice and ran to the toe section of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris found an imprint that must have been from the constant pounding of Nora's foot into the insole and curled up in it. The smell was far worse here, never having the chance to air out. The result was an ever-present thick odor everywhere that Iris was forced to breathe heavily. She groaned and kept her head as far away from the moderately-damp insole as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom, I hope you don't get smashed between my toes while I'm running around the city! This'll teach you to respect what I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris could hear the scrape of Nora's toes working their way into the boot. They finally settled on her, Iris being stuck in the gap between her big and second toes. They were relatively clean given the circumstances, but Iris bet that they wouldn't remain that way for very long at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, mom, you deserve this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Nora do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She goes to run errands around town, suddenly getting alerted that there was another meta-human on the loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She goes to S.T.A.R. Labs, imagining that Caitlin Snow would want to join in on the fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Alright, so this whole scenario is based on the Season 3 Episode \"Here I Go Again\". The premise is that Zari is caught in a time loop after being exposed to some temporal goo from the Waverider. This happens just after she has a huge fight with Sara.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's Outfit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cwtv.com/shows/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow/photos/3-311/02812680487\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cwtv.com/shows/dcs-legends-of...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari awoke rubbing her head and in a very bad mood. First she had got in a big fight with Sara after disabling Gideon to run some temporal simulations.  Then while she was trying to repair Gideon, she accidentally got exposed to some temporal goo from the engine, and next things she knew the ship exploded. She had been through many of these time loops, and the most recent one had ended with her being swatted with a newspaper by a giant Sara. She expected to wake up from the death the same as she had a million times, but instead she woke up this time to find herself on the floor of the command room, at the same shrunken size she had been swatted at. It also seemed like she had been flashed back to a few minutes later than her previous checkpoint, as Ray was gone and it was just Sara with her in the command room, still in her white disco outfit after returning from her mission. Sara was generally the last person Zari wanted to see right now after their fight, especially at 100 feet tall and walking directly towards her, completely barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara wait! Don't!\" Zari yelled, seeing the giant assassin's barefoot heading straight for her. But her tiny voice went unheard, and the giant bare sole of the blonde assassin dropped down on top of her. Zari was thrown down onto her back under the weight of the ball of Sara's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, nice to get out of those awful disco shoes.\" Sara muttered, ending her walk right on top of the shrunken Persian girl. She wiggled her toes happily, unaware of the tiny totem bearer being battered beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari was very aware of what was happening. She had fully expected to be squished again, just as she had under the newspaper. She was horrified to find this was not the case, and that she was merely pinned under the giant assassin's foot, face wedged right between the big and second toes of the ship's captain. Fortunately Sara was quite clean, but a night of dancing under disco lights in thick shoes had not gone unnoticed by the Sara's feet, and the entire front half of Zari's body was now coated in the giant blonde's sweat. She tried to wriggle forward out from under the enormous foot, but Sara's relieved toe wiggling began right on cue. Zari screamed  as she saw the pad of Sara's big toe hanging over her head. It seemed to purposefully pause above her face, as though purposefully taunting her. Had Sara actually known about Zari's position, she might have relished in the fear Zari was feeling as she looked up at her threatening toe. But of course, Sara and her giant toe had no knowledge of the pain they were inflicting with a normally innocent motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari's scream only stopped when the toe slammed down directly on her face, the sweaty flesh of her toe forcing its way into her mouth as it hammered down on her face like a nail, undoing some of the progress Zari had made as Zari was forced back beneath the sweaty foot. The sweaty toe briefly rubbed itself across the tiny totem bearer's face as Sara subconsciously questioned what exactly was underneath her toe, rubbing the sweaty flesh across Zari's tongue and nearly breaking her nose in the process. Sara apparently decided the sharp angles of Zari's face were little more than the corners of a pebble that had snuck its way onto the wave rider<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari barely had time to spit out the assassin's sweat before the toe came down again, hammering away. With each strike, Zari was sliding a little further beneath the assassin's foot. After 3 strikes, she was back to where she started before her attempt to get free. And the next strike slammed her face directly into the gap between Sara's toes, burying her face first in the disgusting between the toe flesh. She knew better than to scream, as she could still taste Sara's toe flesh in her mouth. But keeping her mouth shut meant breathing entirely through her nose, and no matter how clean Sara was, no ones sweaty feet smelled great at point blank range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sara's toes settled down, stopping their hammering assault on Zari. However, Zari's head was still hopelessly wedged between Sara's toes, and there was no escape from their grip. She couldn't scream, she couldn't move, she was completely at the mercy of Sara's foot. And when Sara raised her foot to take a step, Zari came along for the ride. Between the gripping pressure of Sara's giant toes on her skull and the sticky sweat on the underside of Sara's foot, Zari was completely stuck. She couldn't see anything but the skin between Sara's toes, but she could feel the cool air of the Waverider on her back as Sara's foot glided forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of the ball of Sara's foot touched down first, pinning and threatening to snap Zari's tiny femurs. Zari felt like she was being flattened under a rolling pin as Sara's weight rolled forward, crushing her hips, then her stomach and chest in turn. If Ray's shrinking process hadn't made her more resistant to being squished, she'd be a pancake on the Waverider floor by now. Eventually the rolling reached her face, the force on her skull increasing as Sara's toes flexed under the weight of Sara's step. Before her head was squished into paste though, Sara's foot lifted upwards again, preparing for a future step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step was just as painful as the last. Zari lost count after only a few, focusing her time in the air only on gasping for air when possible and assessing whether any of her bones were broken. She spent her brief periods on the ground trying to separate herself from Sara's foot, but the sweat and immense pressure wouldn't let her do so. She had no idea where in the room Sara was or what she was doing. Her whole world was the underside of the giant foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zari! Gideon's still not working!\" Sara called, annoyed that her ship was out of commission and there was nothing she herself could do about it. When she didn't get a reply, she angrily shouted \"Ugh, when I find that girl I'm going to stomp some sense into her.\" In her anger, she raised her foot for an angry stomp, completely unaware that Zari was stuck to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick rising of Sara's foot was enough to free Zari's face from Sara's toes, briefly freeing her mouth to scream. But her scream was snuffed out as soon as her foot started descending, throwing Zari's face back into the toes' grip and blinding her to the deadly fate she knew was coming. She felt a quick, sharp pain as the foot touched down on the ground, and then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari's tiny body was completely annihilated, leaving her unrecognizable on the underside of the captain's foot. Whatever resistance her body had from the shrinking process no match for Sara's full forced stomp. Sara didn't even notice the bloody stain on her foot as she strode out of the room, not having any idea just how much sense she stomped into her shrunken crew member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari gasped as she woke up once again, happy to have air that hadn't been tainted by Sara's feet. Speaking of which, she realized if she didn't move, she'd be right back under Sara's foot again. She quickly rolled to one side, only barely dodging the tremendous foot that had just squashed her out of existence in her previous life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sara notices the tiny Zari rolling out of the way, and recognizes her. And she fully intends to take out her anger on the shrunken woman, especially once Zari explains the lack of consequences from the time loop. (Reserved)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sara doesn't notice Zari, and leaves the room. Zari heads off to to Amaya's room to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sara doesn't notice Zari, but Zari hitches a ride on the back of Sara's disco pant leg as Sara heads back to her room to change our of her disguise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again Zari found herself caught in the same time loop she'd lived through a hundred times, and once again she found herself staring up at a hundred foot tall Sara towering over her. This time around however she took note of Sara's foot as it propelled itself into the air above her. Not wanting to end up trapped under and then squashed beneath the blondes foot Zari acted quickly, rolling to her right side for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, nice to get out of those awful disco shoes.\" Sara muttered, ending her walk directly over the shrunken Persian girl. She continued to wiggle her toes in delight, just as she had in the previous variation of the time loop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten digits drummed rhythmically on the floor close to Zari who hadn't strayed too far from Sara's gigantic feet. She figured if she could remember the path that Sara took around the room during her last reincarnation then she might be able to avoid ending up under them a second time. However, she had yet to notice that Sara had turned her gaze to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that, a bug? Mick must have left crumbs out again, and now we have ants.\" Sara announced, lifting her barefoot. Ready to crush Zari under her naked foot for the second time, though this time she would be bringing down her foot with the intention to kill, which would no doubt result in a quicker demise than last time. Zari then braced herself for yet another death under Sara's sole, although surprisingly enough the death from above she was expecting never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait just a second. Is that Zari?\" Sara's voice boomed overhead, sparing Zari from a second death by Sara's sole. Albeit was a relief for Zari at first she was hardly out of danger with her towering giant of a captain. As her foot pulled away, Zari could see that Sara was smiling in response to finding her at such a small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, looks like the shoe is on the other foot. You know what, this size is perfect for you. I can teach you a lesson about obeying your captain.\" Sara announced, lifting her foot above Zari. The shrunken Persian girl starting to believe it was her new destiny to die endlessly beneath Sara's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara wait! You already crushed me under your foot!\"  Zari yelled, not wanting to get reacquainted with the underside of Sara's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sara asked, holding herself back from stepping on the bug-sized girl a second time. \"Explain yourself?\" Sara demanded, her voice booming from Zari's point of view, serving to make the blonde assassin even more terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm caught in a time loop. Ray and I shrunk down to spy on you, after which you found and crushed us with a rolled up newspaper. Then after the time loop reset, I was still shrunk and you stepped on me. If we don't work together then the ship is going to explode in less than an hour.\" Zari explained, still looking up at Sara passed her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Sara asked in a singsong voice, pulling her foot back and placing it back on the ground. She leaned forward, reaching for the floor in front of her feet, stretching her fingers out around the tiny totem bearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZari panicked, she looked for a way out as Sara's fingers wrapped around her, unable to find one. Sara squeezed Zari between her thumb and index finger, squeezing tightly as they wrapped around her torso. She exhaled shapely, finding it harder to draw in breath with Sara's thumb pressing down on her breasts with about 200 pounds of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara walked across the room towards the captain's office, holding Zari at level with her breasts the whole time. It was clear given the look on her face that Sara was focused on looking for something, perhaps Ray's size changing gun so that could restore Zari's original size. However, this turned out to be nothing more than wishful thinking as Sara instead pulled a chair away from the wall with her foot and promptly dropped the tiny totem bearer on its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, what are you doing?\" Zari asked, not liking the way Sara was looking down at her, hands on her hips and a smile spread across her face. Answering the Persian woman's question by turning in the opposite direction, bringing her giant butt over the seat Zari currently found herself standing on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm teaching you a lesson in what happens when you disobey your captain's orders,\" Sara announced, waving her hips from side too side. Taunting Zari with the ass that had attracted the attention of many women throughout history. These numbers including but not limited to Anne of Austria, Queen Guinevere, and the entire female population of age in Salem, Massachusetts during her brief time there in 1693.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Zari thought out loud, realizing that Sara intended to crush her beneath her rear end, clad in tight spandex. She'd just told her angry captain that she was practically immortal and would reincarnate upon her death, looking back Zari realized this to be a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara took a short step to her side with one foot, increasing the distance between her feet before dropping her weight onto the seat below in one fluid motion. Meanwhile, Zari watched helplessly from below knowing she was destined to die yet again under Sara as the assassin's butt fell towards her like a falling meteor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat shifted as it took on the brunt of Sara's weight. However, it was Zari who was actually forced to withstand the majority of Sara's full weight as her butt came to rest on top of her. On top of that there was little to no padding on the seat Sara had selected, making the force exerted on top of the shrunken girl that much more severe to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had removed any trace of negative emotions for what came next, she already knew Zari would be reborn at the beginning of the next hour. Living with the memory of being crushed under her powerful bottom. What a perfect way to renew fear in the newest member on board the Waverider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the blonde captain chooses to smile. Lifting her feet off the ground Sara began bearing more of her full weight on Zari's tiny frame. She could both feel and hear the stain on her bones as the began to crack and break under Sara's massive buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sara decided to end things with a bang. She reduced the weight on Zari's body to nothing, lifting her butt off the seat a few inches into the air above her. Even with Zari being shrunk Sara knew the limits of her body quite well. The female assassin caused just enough damage to leave Zari immobilized in the wake of being sat on. She could only watch helplessly from the surface of Sara's seat as her butt continued to loom overhead. The tiny totem bearer was powerless, unable to so much a lift a finger against her captain as she prepared to finish her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Zari, hopefully, you'll learn something from this,\" Sara announced passively, coldly and swiftly starting on Zari's execution. Her full weight coming down centered on her enormous buttocks as they pinned Zari to the seat. However, Zari's body was too weak after her last run-in with the assassin's rear to handle any more damage. Instead, her body was instantly overtaken by Sara's ass and silently crushed to a pulp. Her screams muffled by Sara's doughy rear cheeks as she passed away under the blonde woman's bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Zari fair in her next life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Zari is reborn yet again right where she started but this time dodges to the left, going unnoticed by Sara. This allows her to travel around the ship looking for help from one of her other crewmates. Stumbling upon Amaya who hears her on the ground and wants to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Zari tries to outrun Sara's foot as she starts off a new life under the blonde woman's foot, getting caught between her toes and going unnoticed as she walks towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Zari starts her new life already able to tell something is amiss with Sara looking directly down at her on the floor. Apparently, the clock that she respawns at later times, putting her in a precarious position with Sara's full attention placed on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray sighs as he tinkers with his suit, just a little more and it'll be ready for his mission. Since Nora had turned herself in nobody had been allowed see her, Ray himself had been rather intensely stonewalled and nearly thrown out of the Time Bureau when he stunk away to find her cell and go visit her. He promised he'd visit her and help keep her sane while she served her time and he was a man of his word, even if he had to do it the Legends way: completely ignoring authority figures and doing it yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gideon, is the program ready?\" he asks putting down his tools<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mr Palmer, it should imbed itself into the cell's coding and enable you to control it from your suit, once it was uploaded to the correct room of course\" came the AI's usual even tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay smiles and starts putting on the ATOM suit \"Thanks Gideon, and if possible could you ensure the team doesn't find out about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find out about what?\" he jumps, nearly falling over onto his butt but instead turns and see's Sara standing at the door, looking curious \"What are you doing Ray?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did a few tweaks and upgrades to the ATOM suit, thought it would be a good time with nothing happening to give it a test flight, nothing wrong with that is it Captain?\" he asks, swallowing loudly and starting to sweat under her gaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sighs \"You are still a really bad liar Ray, but given how badly you want to keep this a secret I'll allow it...\" she then jabs him in the chest with her finger \"...but you better be back here tomorrow, or I'm sending the entire team looking for you, got that?\" she asks, though there was only one answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sara, I'll be back before morning\" Ray smiles and Sara relaxes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you're going to do, please don't do anything to stupid, at least not by yourself\" she warns, though there was concern in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it boss, no bad things for me\" he waves and Sara rolls her eyes but walks away. Once she left Ray put on the rest of his suit, as well as pull out the Time Courier he'd 'borrowed' from Gary to get into the Time Bureau undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the gateway opened he shrunk down to bug size, flying though and closing the breech behind him. Getting from the main office to the prisoner cells would have been a problem, except Mona was on food rounds, enabling him to hitch a ride through security and into the prisoner quarters. Nora's was surprisingly easy to find, mostly because she was the only human they had... and her name was on the security panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying through a vent Ray makes his way to the identical panel on the inside of the cell, mostly so it would take longer for any form of tampering to be noticed. Flying over to the touch pad Ray transmit his control code to the device, which beeped and flashed for a minute but besides that there were no problems, no flashing red lights or harsh sirens, he was pretty sure he was in the clear. \"And here we go\" he says mostly to himself as he pressed a button on the gauntlet and the force field drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, I really hope this isn't what I think it is\" Nora thinks out loud and she moves from her lying position, putting the book she'd been reading on the small table beside her and sat up, her bare feet padding against the floor as she moved to the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Nora looked so innocent there reading, even if it's a murder mystery, hey that's the same one Ava was reading maybe when Nora's free she can join book club. Or not, well anything's better than Mick's literary erotica'</i> Ray thinks as he watches Nora for a moment, the though of Nora reading Mick's book following a few other things he'd rather not think about, he'd had enough dreams involving himself and Nora, most normal enough, but some with him small enough to fit in her hand, between her rather nicely sized breasts, filling her pus... no! now it not the time for fantasising, this was a covert visit and nothing was to ruin that. Well except the force field glitching out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, Gideon what's going on?\" he asks, increasing the speed in which he shot towards the not so evil witch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear the first thing Mr Haywood had Miss Tomaz fix and upgrade was the security of the magical creature cells, it's fighting the virus\" Gideon explains, this didn't exactly help Ray's worried mood, especially when the energy field came back online at full power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BZZZZZZZZZZZ</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he crossed the threshold. Energy coursed through the ATOM suit, the system not able to handle this much energy at it's miniaturised size. With the suit fried though still retaining the momentum it had previously Ray was hurtling towards Nora Dahrk with no control or steering beyond rather uselessly flailing his arms and legs around like a crazy person, so this was not going to end well for him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Ray end up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He rather luckily ends up falling into Nora's open shirt, getting caught in her bra/cleavage, but also rather quickly noticed by the woman he'd just used the chest of as an airbag<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Ray hits the ground with a thump just beside Nora's foot, the startled and slightly disgusted woman thinking he was a bug that got in when the force field was down and tries to crush him. Ray has to avoid getting smushed as well as try get some less violent attention from his not quite girlfriend, preferably before people notice he's missing or that her cell malfunctioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Ray lands on the bed, Nora notices out the corner of her eye and after figuring out it was him and hearing what and why he did it, tells him that's the nicest and dumbest thing she's ever heard, but she's happy he's here to relieve her boredom, even if it means he's a prisoner just like her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray quickly found himself falling at breakneck speeds towards Nora's bed, unable to stop or slow his descent without his suit being powered up. He braced himself for a crash landing, his body rolling on top of Nora's bed like a boulder in an Indiana Jones movie before landing flat on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm okay!\" He shouted, knowing nobody could hear him. He glanced over to see Nora still wandering around inside the confines of her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't noticed him yet or sensed his presence, likely because he was as small as a Tic-Tac. What's worse is that after a few moments, Ray's suit failed to activate its emergency backup generator, making it the worlds largest, or in his case smallest paperweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A.T.O.M Suit would only be a hindrance to his goals if he wanted to get Nora to notice him at this size, opting to engage the emergency release. The protection the suit granted was little without its full capabilities, best to leave it behind so he can move quickly for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stood up, watching as Nora came towards him on her bed. Her massive body caused the ground and furniture to shake with each step, something Ray had become accustomed to after shrinking himself for four years. He began sprinting towards Nora's body as her tall shadow eclipsed his entire form, waving his arms and jumping up again and again, basically anything he could do to try and stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't occur to Ray that Nora wasn't just walking past her bed until it was already too late. In the blink of an eye, Nora planted her feet and twisted her hips, swinging her wide hips and butt over the inch tall Ray in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was admittedly quite the sight to behold, and if he had the time, Ray would have honestly enjoyed getting closer to his crushes rear end at this size. Though not to the degree he was about to be unwillingly subjected to as Nora heedlessly fell from the sky like some kind of human meteorite. Her behind eclipsing all light by the time he turned around to flee the oncoming assault of her leather-clad flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump, Squeak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's body landed with a bounce on Ray's tiny body, his size keeping him safe from being squished for the time being as Nora's leather pants stretched to cover the full length of her rear. In turn, this caused Ray's body to be pulled down, his body adhering to the leather, dragging him towards the densest area. Namely, this area was the spot where Nora focused the brunt of her weight, directly underneath her buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay struggled the best he could in an attempt to prevent this, but sweat stuck him to Nora's ass. It took all of his strength just to break one limb free for a few moments at a time, only to get stuck again whenever Nora shifted in her seat on top of him. Luckily, Nora became aware of his very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, however, Nora didn't leap straight to the conclusion that there was a one-inch tall man under her butt. In her mind, he was just another itch that needed to be eradicated. Her weapon of choice for this task was, of course, her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with a slow downward twist, grinding her weight on top of Ray in the hopes that friction would eliminate the itch. And while this was a mundane action on Nora's part, the same could not be said from Ray's perspective. For the one inch tall man these actions were comparable to being run over by, then backed over by a steamroller, several times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Ray was able to withstand the first onslaught of Nora's leather-clad flesh as she returned to a normal seated position on top of him. However, there was still the matter of her crushing weight to endure, prompting Ray to resume his struggles beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora glanced away from her book, annoyed that the lump under her butt would have the nerve to return so quickly. This time she would be sure to decimate the tiny bulge with her powerful rear. She closed her book, leaving the page marked to resume reading later before placing it on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began lifting herself off the bed, leaving Ray to watch as the black surface hovered over him, only about twenty feet away. Even so, her body was more than close enough to dominate his entire field of vision with relative ease. Nora paused for a moment before realizing that the itch had disappeared entirely, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the blink of an eye, Ray was experiencing some serious d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as Nora dropped her weight yet again. Leaving the tiny man with no warning to defend himself, nearly knocked unconscious while Nora bounced on top of him. Luckily, over the years his body had adapted to shrinking and become stronger, anyone else in his position would have likely been crushed to a pulp by the witch's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Nora asked, annoyed as she immediately felt the lump under her butt return for a second time, deciding to investigate further. She stood up, this time taking Ray with her after he became stuck to her pants by sweat. Swinging him through the air as she turned to examine her seat, not seeing anything out of the ordinary. At least, not until she leaned in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" She asked, noticing the familiar form of a tiny person in the center of her buttcheek's imprint. But if he wasn't on her seat now, then where was he? \"Ray, you idiot,\" Nora announced, reaching back and feeling her own ass up for the tiny man's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was overjoyed, hearing Nora call out his name meant he could finally get her attention. Her hand finally glazed over him, nearly knocking him free of her ass to the ground below before she could secure him between her fingers. She pinched his body between her thumb and pointer finger, lifting him hundreds of feet up to her gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! Just what did you think you were doing down there?\" Nora asked. The tone of her voice suggesting that she was annoyed by Ray's presence. \"Explain yourself before I try squishing you under my butt for real this time.\" Nora threatened, believe Ray was there for perverted reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Wait, Nora, it's not what you think! I came here to visit you and keep you company. They wouldn't let me in here at my normal size, so I tried to sneak in by shrinking down. I was going to mail myself here with some help from Mona, but I doubt that would work too well. Plus, I'd probably get stuck in the envelope seal. My suit got fried by the security system, and now I'm stuck like this.\" Ray explained in great detail, finding himself oddly scared of Nora at her gigantic size. But at the same time, he couldn't deny that being so tiny made it that much easier for him to appreciate her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such an idiot, but you're a sweet idiot,\" Nora said as she rolled her eyes, flashing an almost gentle smile. \"Listen, Ray...\" Nora started to say something. Before being interrupted by a distant noise from outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, someone's coming. You need to hide.\" Nora stated, looking left to right to see that there were very few places where Ray could be hidden. Then, acting on impulse, she surprised both herself and Ray. Swinging him back around the lower half of her body, stopping just above her shapely rear end. Pulling her tight leather pants away from her skin to reveal two pale moons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora?\" Ray asked, confused before the giantess witch released him without a second thought. His body slammed off of one cheek, and his back bounced off the other one until Ray found himself snuggled up tightly within her buttcrack. \"Just stay quiet down there and don't move,\" Nora warned, twisting her body to look down inside her panties for Ray. Thinking it was strange, she was too high up to make out his form, but she could feel exactly where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with feeling his squirms against her ass again, Nora released her pants and allowed them to snap against her skin. Just in time for an excitable Mona to enter the room, pushing a cart loaded up with supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nora, good morning, I mean not that you can tell in here. It's always so dark and gloomy, they should definitely consider putting in a window to let in light. And maybe a better air conditioner.\" Mona babbled, not grasping the concept that this was still a prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was talking Ray was busy trying to escape Nora's underwear, which was a prison all it's own that was also hot and void of light. Making it difficult for him to navigate his surroundings. Trying his best to climb up and out to freedom, leading Nora to feel a ticklish sensation on her hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you gotten to the part in the book where Harry has to fight a dragon and he has too...\" Mona started, almost spoiling another book's plot to Nora while her mind was occupied with Ray's movements. Deciding to bring his movements to a quick halt with a mere flex of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you quit it?\" she muttered, trying not to hurt Ray as he continued to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" Mona asked, giving Nora the chance to come clean about the one-inch tall man in her butt. Honestly, he had a better chance of getting back to normal if she gave him to Mona so she could bring him with her to the Legends. What should she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Nora decides to reveal Ray to Mona so that Mona can sneak him back to the Legends. Only Mona decides to hide him from the cameras in the same fashion as Nora, in the back of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Nora convinces Mona to leave and tries to use magic to teleport Ray back to the Waverider, but he lands on a plate of food in front of a hungry Zari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Nora comes up with an excuse that she's not feeling well and Mona leaves, allowing Nora to have some alone time with Ray after she uses a spell to disable the camera that is.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another successful night for Oliver Queen's club Verdant in the weeks following the grand opening in the Glades last month, Oliver back from his extra nightly activities as a vigilante decides to stop in to keep up with appearances. He walked out into the club via the basement entrance and staggered over to the bar where he noticed a familiar face dancing in the crowd. No, it wasn't Laurel or Helena Bertinelli or any of the previous faces he's used to seeing in his club, instead it was his younger sister Thea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough now eighteen years of age Oliver still thought his younger sister was too young to be dancing by herself in a club where alcohol was being served. Not only that, but judging by the way Thea was carrying herself Oliver was lead to believe that she was also drunk or under the influence of a drug in some way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try walking over towards her and talking some sense into Thea before she ended up doing something he was sure she'd regret the following morning. Oliver forced his way through the crowd, sliding between between dancing girls the best he could without making a scene before tapping Thea on her shoulder from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who let you in here?\" Oliver asked, ready to fire the bouncer who let an eighteen year old into his club, especially when that underaged girl was his only sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it to you? Not like you really care.\" Thea said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I care, your my sister speedy.\" Oliver said, hoping he could win Thea over to his side of seeing her here and get her to leave without making a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really because since you've been back we've hardly spent any time together. All you do is avoid mom, ditch your bodyguards, party, and ignore me. So don't play the brother card until you're ready to start acting like mine.\" Thea said, walking off in a huff through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver walked back towards the bar and poured himself a drink from the bar, Vodka. It reminded him of his time in russia working for the Bratva and helped him to think clearly. He dipped his head back and swallowed the shot, placing another shot from a different bottle down on the bar to have soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Oliver soon ingesting the last shot oliver began to feel weird, although it was not a cause of nausea brought on by the alcohol. Oliver had developed somewhat of an immunity to the effects of vodka after his aforementioned time in Russia, no this was something else entirely. The bottle, he'd been drugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver calmly tried to make his way to basement where he could take the miracle herbs from Lian Yu to cure the symptoms, but it was too late. The room began spinning, his vision made blurry by the drug as his eyes watered, everything around him seemly getting bigger in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, something's wrong.\" Oliver said to himself. In his previous encounters with drugs and poisons he was taught to focus on specific aspects of reality to convince himself that hallucinations were just that. But in this instance everything was growing at the same pace as he felt himself get shorter and shorter until only one possible outcome crossed his mind. This was really happening, Oliver was shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only could he confirm that what was happening to him was real but nobody else around him noticed it taking place, all his guests were either to busy drinking or dancing to pay any attention to Oliver as he shrunk below a foot tall. Now nobody would be able to help him as her got smaller and smaller until finally he stopped shrinking at only an inch tall in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything surrounding the billionaire castaway was nothing more than unbearable noise. The usually loud rave music playing throughout the club amplified to uproarious levels, resounding through Olivers eardrums with a deafening beat. The stomping feet of his guests as they dance with no knowledge that that famous Oliver Queen could end up crushed under their boot like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ladies night in his club, an idea Tommy had too draw in larger crowds on routinely less busy nights. So it was only natural that most of the footwear Oliver noticed around him were common to young females, such as college students and single women in their 20's. First was a pair of tall wedge heels, about two inches tall which greatly helped to increase her height over Oliver. Next was a girl to Oliver's left side sitting at the bar ordering drinks, she was wearing heels and had taken them off to play with while she was waiting for drinks, Finally was an intoxicated girl to his right side wearing a pair of pink converse sneakers and dancing with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver knew he would need help if he ever planned to get back to his normal size, but he also knew he had to pick carefully or his identity as The Hood could be revealed and his mission to save Starling City would be ruined. He was about to move towards one of the girls so he could climb them and ask for their help, but before he could move an inch a new foot appeared before him. However something was very different where this girl was concerned, she was wearing a pair of designer flats. Something not many people in Starling City could afford, few of which would be found in his club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver hoped he was wrong in guessing who the owner of these designer brand shoes were, however as he turned his gaze upwards Oliver saw none other than his own sister Thea looking down at him in disbelief. She had been watching Oliver as he shrunk from across the club after their little spat earlier and had a hard time believing that her eyes weren't playing tricks on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie?\" She said confused, finding it hard to distiguish her brother from a insect on the floor at her feet. Thea then bent down and reached towards Oliver, provoking him into fleeing before his gigantic sister caught him between her finger tips. Having no possible explanation to his sibling and the rest of his family that wouldn't reveal that he was the Starling City Vigilante.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Oliver given Thea's massive size she was all but impossible to get away from, soon pinching his tiny body between her fingertips tightly, forcing the air inside his body to escape through his lungs. Thea, not realising the pain she was causing her so called big brother lifted him off the ground up her body, up her leggings passed her blouse, and lastly in front of her billboard sized face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie, how did you get so *laughing* tiny?\" Thea asked pausing for a moment to giggle, clearly still intoxicated from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea, this isn't funny. Now I need you to take me to Queen Consolidated, there's a girl there named Felicity Smoak...\" Oliver said before being cut off by his now giant sized sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Thea asked, expecting a genuine answer from her inch tall brother for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you, but I think she might be able to help me get back to my normal size.\" Oliver said hopefully, thinking he could get Thea to listen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? So you can start avoid us again? No way, for the first time since you got back we're gonna spend some quality time together.\" Thea declared boldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea what are you talking about, how am I gonna spend any quality time with you like this?\" Oliver asked, certain that he wouldn't like what Thea had planned for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked...\" Thea paused, giggling as she looked around to make sure nobody had noticed her talking to her inch tall brother. Moving towards the bar to keep herself hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Thea have planned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"You're so used to running around behind our backs, so your gonna spend some quality time somewhere I can keep an eye on you. Under my foot.\" Thea sits down at the bar and removes her flat, dropping Oliver inside before putting it back so she can go dance with Oliver in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"Since you're so worried about me being in your little club, why don't I let you keep a close eye on me. A really close eye on me from my butt.\" Thea opens up the back of her panties and tosses Oliver inside so he can chaperone her for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"So you think I'm too young to be drinking huh. Why don't you try a shot then?\" Thea notices the Shot Oliver had laid out from the bar earlier and slides it over to herself, dunking Oliver inside a few times, eventually dropping him inside, and inevitably taking the shot with him in it.</span></div></div>",

Things flashed by in a blur, but when he came to a stop, he was staring at his younger sister's leggings clad ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem intent on being a pain in my ass Oliver. I guess is just a big brother thing. But since I'm such a good little sister and I've missed you these last few years, I'm gonna give you a hand.\" Thea continued, slurring her words in her drunken state while her free hand pawed at her ass. Only when her thumb successfully hooked under the waistband of her leggings and panties and pulled them back, revealing her pale white ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea no! You can't do this! Bring me to Felicity!\" Oliver screamed, horrified of the abyss of his younger sister's ass crack that he was staring into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Oliver. We're keeping this little problem in the family, which means keeping you between my butt cheeks.\" Thea said, releasing her grip on her brother's body as the last word passed through her lips and sending the tiny archer tumbling down into her awaiting crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver put out his arms to brace himself and stop his descent, but there was nothing to hold onto except the never ending butt flesh of his drunken sister. Her smooth cheeks had no handholds to speak of, but the friction against them as he descended finally brought him to a stop halfway down her crack, suspended by his arms and legs braced against her buttocks. He looked up to address her, but just got a quick glimpse of her smiling face looking over her shoulder before she released her grip on her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her tiny brother secured, Thea was ready to get back to some fun. She quickly downed another shot, having long ago lost count of how much she had had to drink. With a smile on her face, she strutted out towards the dance floor, giving her tiny brother his first glimpse of what it would be like to endure her hips on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing Oliver encountered on Lian Yu prepared him for the relentless onslaught of Thea's ass cheeks. The rolling of her hips with every one of her steps kept her cheeks on the move, rising and falling with everyone of her steps. When her right cheek rose, her left cheek would fall accordingly, pulling Oliver in two different directions at the same time. He felt like he was going to get pulled apart with each step as the powerful friction between her soft flesh and his own shrunken body and clothes caused him to be tugged and stretched. He frantically tried to squirm and kick against her cheeks, trying to escape their hold on him, but the fleshy mounds had him right where they wanted him, and they had no intention of letting him go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Thea got to the dance floor, she decided Ollie was ready for the main event. In her inebriated state, it didn't even occur to her to worry about her brother's safety. After all, he was a grown man, and she was just a teenage girl. He should be able to stand up to her soft, sexy ass all day long. Or at least, all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode onto the dance floor and immediately found the group of friends she was with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea! You're back!\" Oliver heard the drunken girls yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry, my brother was just up my ass about me being here.\" They said with a smirk, clenching her cheeks around Oliver to emphasize her little joke. Needless to say, Oliver wasn't amused. Not that he could have laughed anyway, considering every clench of her cheeks squeezed all the air out of him like a deflating balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever girl, let's dance!\" Another friend replied, just as the next song began to play. The girls immediately got back to dancing, and Thea didn't waste any time joining them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had gotten somewhat used to the rolling of Thea's hips as she walked, but her dancing was an entirely new situation. Rather than rubbing up and down on either side of him, Thea's cheeks now jumped from side to side as the brunette shook her hips on the dance floor, and they brought him along for the ride. Oliver's two dance partners immediately began to fight over him, jumping into action. But rather than pulling him back and forth, the giant cheeks were tossing him to each other.  The giant butt cheeks took turns slamming into him, one pummeling him while the other waited to catch him in its fleshy embrace. Oliver felt like he was caught between a giant pair of Newton balls, slamming him endlessly but never slowing down. If anything, Thea was speeding up. As she found her groove on the dance floor and lost herself in the music, the movement of her hips became more erratic. Sometimes the pattern would break, and one of her cheeks would be unable to resist taking a second smack at him before the other got its turn again. This was always balanced out eventually by a particularly strong smack from whichever dance partner got shafted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much fun she was having, Thea never lost the feeling of her tiny brother squirming for freedom in her panties. She didn't regret putting him there for a second. Oliver had abandoned the family for 5 years, and now he thought he could come back and boss her around? He needed to be punished, and her ass cheeks seemed to be the perfect method. She figured once he had been punished appropriately, she would allow him to start begging for her forgiveness. She figured he'd need to do some serious ass kissing to get back on her good side, and she did not mean the figurative kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the DJ pushed a single button on his console that turned Oliver's already miserable situation truly hellish. He changed the song, causing a sudden bass drop. Thea reacted to this the only way a drunk 19 year old looking to torture a tiny man with her ass could: she began to twerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instantaneous for Oliver. Thea's cheeks no longer had the patience to take turns with him. Her ass was now not moving back and forth, but in and out, her cheeks clapping around him over and over again as her ass rapidly moved back and forth. As she moved, Oliver was also dragged in and out of her crack, given brief periods to slide around as her cheeks spread between claps. Oliver tried to brace his limbs against her cheeks, desperate to steady himself. He managed to get a foothold, but this did little to stop the incessant clapping, compacting his entire body on every strike. At the same time though, Oliver knew this was his chance to escape. Her cheeks were spreading enough to give him a window, and she was lost in the music on the dance floor. He'd have to make a jump for the opening when her cheeks spread, then fight his way out of her panties. He counted down as he prepared to make his move, timing the claps of her cheeks, feeling the painful squeeze of every one. 3.... 2.... 1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Thea feels Oliver's escape attempt, and decides to keep him in check by forcing him up her asshole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thea feels Oliver trying to escape, and punishes him by hip checking the wall, hard. This knocks Oliver unconscious, and he wakes up the next morning in a sleeping and  hungover Thea's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Oliver escapes successfully, but falls out of his sister's underwear to the ground, landing hard on the dance floor. The impact breaks one of this legs, leaving him barely able to move at his giant sister's feet (probably death option)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been nearly four months since Oliver\u2019s return to Starling City from Lian Yu, In that time he\u2019d gathered a team to help him fight crime as the vigilante known as the Hood, started the finishing touches on his nightclub Verdant , and taken down criminals such as the Count, Deadshot, and the Dodger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a series of intense workouts Oliver prepared himself to go out in the field, having already selected another businessman from his father\u2019s list who made their fortune off the suffering of others. Tonight he\u2019d reform his criminal ways and return the money he\u2019d stored in his offshore accounts. At least that\u2019s what Oliver thought as he finished up his final set on the Salmon Ladder, his favorite form of exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped down from the ceiling prepared to dawn Yao Fei\u2019s hood and deal out his unique form of justice to those who had poisoned his city. However before this could be done Oliver began to feel strange, it was a feeling his body could never forget. The effects of being poisoned himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he rushed towards the crate he\u2019d brought home from Lian Yu, contained inside was several bags of Yao Fei\u2019s miracle herbs from the island. He opened one of the bags and immediately began ingesting the herbs, taking a drink of water to force it down before laying on the floor and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke about an hour later, still dazed by the effects of whatever drug had found it\u2019s way into his system. Although as Oliver sat up and examined his surrounding he found a slight hangover to be the least of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything surrounding him was now proportionally gigantic in size. Impossible as it might seem, Oliver Queen had shrunk down to an inch tall in height. However, unlike most people Oliver did not panic, he gathered his wits together and assessed the positives of his current situation along with the negatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side of things Oliver was fortunate enough to shrink while still in his hideout, which meant he was safe from usually dangerous opponents who would have no trouble at all killing him off at an inch tall such as China White or the Huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Oliver was also smart enough to realize the cons to shrinking in his hideout, while he was exactly where he\u2019d want to go for help he had no realistic way of getting help from Diggle and Felicity at his current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if on cue with Oliver\u2019s thoughts of reaching out to his team for help the entrance to the \u201cArrowcave\u201d as Felicity calls it opened, revealing the massive blonde herself as she walked down the metal stairs with a bag from Big Belly Burger in hand. Her high heels clicked against the steps twice with every step she took, <i>heel, toe, heel, toe</i>, each step louder than the last as she got closer to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached the bottom of the stairs, her high heels connecting with the solid concrete beneath her. Now her steps were a lot more powerful and easily felt by Oliver from a distance as she took a few steps forward into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver? Are you in here?\" She asked, taking a moment to pause as she noticed Oliver's suit was still in its case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's weird. I guess her took the night off. I didn't know Oliver Queen was capable of doing that but I guess even Playboy vigilantes need a night to rest.\" Felicity said to herself, unaware that Oliver was still in the room. She then proceeded to her desk anyways, no doubt planning to search for any leads concerning Walter's whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver watched in awe as she walked across the room, amazed by the incredible distances she was able to cover from his point of view in a single step. If he were still normal sized and Felicity was as gigantic as she was by comparison she would no doubt be able to clear entire blocks with a single step forwards maybe even two or three. At last she came to a stop in front of her desk, pulling out her leather chair and taking a seat in front of her computer systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Felicity stationary Oliver decided that this was his best chance to make his move and get her attention, he ran as fast as he could at his new size but even at his top speed it took him a few minutes to reach Felicity's desk. He didn't expect to be adding cardio to his workout tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver continued running forward under the back of Felicity's desk,deciding in the spur of the moment that it would take to long to go around. He jumped between plugs, climbing over and diving under a jungle of tangled wires. Then at long last he came out on the other side, greeted almost immediately by Felicity's open toes on top of her heels, each nail coated electric blue paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step back, analyzing the blonde IT from head to toe or rather toe to head was more accurate from where he was standing. Oliver continue looking for anything that might help him get Felicity's attention, but saw no opening other than climbing her entire body to her face. A challenging task that was easier said than done when looking up at the towering blonde woman, she was absolutely massive when compared to any living thing, easily as tall as the skyscraper that served as the headquarters for Queen Consolidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years ago Oliver would have jumped for the chance to climb a blonde beauty, but since then he'd learned self control and realized this was just dangerous. Felicity was as big as a mountain, one wrong move and he could easily end up flattened or squished under her body in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he know that he didn't really have any other options available to him, Felicity was his best hope of getting back to normal. Oliver had to climb her body no matter the risk. Luckily for him Felicity seemed very interested in whatever she was working on, her fingers coding on the keys faster than Oliver could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nowhere else to begin his climb Oliver started at Felicity's feet, using the thin overlapping materials of her footwear to greater increase his speed. Soon after he passed the arch of her foot, climbing to the top of her high heel before moving on to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to climb Oliver realized that the task was become more and more difficult, with no leg hair to grab onto Oliver was forced to use friction to maintain his grip on Felicity's bare skin. It certainly didn't make climbing any easier, if only Felicity hadn't shaved her legs that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued all the way up to her knees which lead to a steep incline as Oliver continued to climb her thighs, luckily for him this task only got easier over time as Oliver approached one of her famous mini-skirts. She constantly wore them, in fact Oliver couldn't remember a time where he'd seen her without one on, usually ending halfway down her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he grabbed onto her skirt and thought that the rest of his climb would be a breeze, not realizing that it had already come to an end. Without warning Felicity quickly pushed back her chair and stood up, knocking Oliver off in a random direction. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity saw Oliver climbing on her thighs but in the heat of the moment mistakes him for a bug, now Oliver is the target of her attention. Though not in the way he originally hoped as she tries to crush him under her heels while chasing him around the Arrowcave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity gets up to stretch, knocking Oliver onto her seat where he is promptly sat on by Felicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Felicity stands up to get her drink from a nearby table, knocking Oliver into a pile of Ketchup on top of Felicity's burger. Moments later she returns and places the top half of her bun on top of him before proceeding to eat her meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oliver arrived early on top of Laurel's apartment building for one of their secret meetings, dressed in his vigilante garb as The Hood. She'd called him earlier that night to discuss a new strand of Vertigo hitting the streets of Starling City, he told her that he'd look into it if she gave him her case files on the subject at 10:30 in the usual meeting location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, I already told you. I'm just gonna look into what she has to say and that's all.\" Oliver said in response to a nagging comment from Felicity about how inappropriate it was for him to be meeting with his Ex Girlfriend in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay on comms, I'll be back before you know it.\" Oliver teased, as her got into a position where the shadows would hide his face from Laurel's eyes. Not wanting her to accidentally recognize his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that every night, but then there's a bank robbery, next it's a car chase, followed by a mugging, then a...\" Felicity said fully prepared to list every kind of common crime committed in Starling City every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah Felicity. Then a weapons deal, don't worry. I'll be fine no matter what this city throws at me.\" Oliver assured, unaware of what would happen to him next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Oliver began to feel very nauseous, convincing himself that it was merely a side effect of him pushing himself so hard as a vigilante. Having recently stopped Joseph Falk from killing Roy in a live Broadcast while in the same week crossing five names off the list left to him by his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver put his hand over his face and rubbed his temples for a moment to clear his head, but when he lifted his head he immediately noticed that his surrounding had changed drastically. For starters the fact that everything surrounding him was now proportionally gigantic by comparison. He'd been shrunk, and only to an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Felicity, I think we have a problem.\" Oliver said, finding it odd as he put his hand to his ear that his earpiece had shrunk along with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Triad? The other Archer? Ninjas? Is it Ninjas?\" Felicity asking, half jokingly hoping Oliver hadn't already found away to get himself into big trouble. Little did she know that 'big' didn't even begin to describe the type of trouble he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, I'm small!\" Oliver shouted, wanting the Blonde IT to take him seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, a little too much information. I mean I never imagined that about you, if anything I imagined you would be above average sized. Not that I've ever thought about the size of your...\" Felicity rambled before Oliver finally cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I mean. Felicity, I'm an inch tall.\" Oliver said, just guessing at his height based off the size of his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, that\u2019s impossible. Even if you harnessed the power of a dwarf star alloy you wouldn\u2019t be able to shrink yourself.\u201d Felicity said, pulling up Oliver\u2019s location on satellite to see he wasn\u2019t there or at the very least not visible since she could still see his location on the map through the tracker in his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever what Felicity could see was the rooftop entrance to Laurel's apartment building opening up as Laurel herself walked out for her meeting with The Hood. The sight off which also largely caught Oliver's attention as the large metal door squeaked upon being opened to reveal is gigantic ex girlfriend towering overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was massive, like a skyscraper casting it's large shadow over him puny bug sized bug. She stepped out on to the roof, walking in Oliver's direction as she looked for the hood cloaked stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, I've got another problem here?\" Oliver said as Laurel came stomping towards her, the closed toe high heels she wore for her job as a lawyer at CNRI threatening to crush him like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver get out of there before she steps on you!\" Felicity panicked, prompting Oliver to get as far away from Laurel as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on it!\" Oliver yelled as Laurel's foot could be seen coming down overhead, his instincts kicked in forcing him to roll backwards. A few moments later the outsole of her heel landed only an arms length away from Oliver's body, with the top piece of her heel landing at at a similar distance behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you up here?\" Laurel's voice boomed through Oliver's ears and Felicity's earpiece. Oliver peeked out from underneath the breast of Laurel's heel, unable to see much nut the fact that her taste in underwear hadn't changed much in the last five years. Her panties were her favorite color, black with a lace trim surrounding the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Laurel asked herself, her eyes scanning every inch of her own rooftop, and every rooftop nearby. Every inch but the one under her feet that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens Next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Laurel takes a step back and notices something on the floor beneath where she was standing. At first she thinks it's a bug, but upon closer inspection comes to realize it's actually The Hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Oliver climbs out from underneath Laurel's heel and begins scaling her body from the ground up, made more difficult when she decides to head back inside to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Laurel leaves while Oliver watches, forcing him to rely on Felicity to retrieve him from Laurel's rooftop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The starting point for this chapter is this scene, Thea goes to the Glades to get her purse back: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7I4ralCyi0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7I4ralC...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea waited outside the door to Roy's home, wondering if he would really come back with the purse. Maybe he would just leave her standing out here all night? Little did he know what she had planned for him when he came back outside....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Roy opened the door again, bringing Thea's purse out with him. He handed her the black purse wordlessly, his face blank. As soon as she got it back, she began to search through it right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's all there.\" Roy said. He didn't blame her for not trusting him, but he really hadn't taken anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not worried about that Roy. I just need my..... Ah, I've got it.\" Thea said, pulling a small rectangular device out of her bag. Roy thought it looked like a taser, growing more concerned when she pointed it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Thea don't do anyth-\" Roy began, but Thea pushed a button before he could finish and he was startled into silence by a beam of light striking him in the chest. His view was obscured by the bright light, and when it faded he saw not Thea, but a giant black boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My face is up here Roy.\" Thea said, grinning at the tiny man standing on the floor. He was standing just inside his apartment, but now he was barely taller than a tube of lipstick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked up and what had happened became clear. Thea hadn't tased him, she'd shrunken him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck Thea? What's going on?\" Roy yelled. \"This isn't possible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly Roy. Everything is possible when you're rich.\" Thea said with a laugh. She bent down and snatched him off the floor of his home, before pulling the door shut. Now he was trapped outside with her, squirming in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had always known that was somewhat true, but he had thought the laws of physics would have set some limits on it. As it turns out, even those were no obstacle to this giant brat. \"But why shrink me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'd let you off so easily for stealing from me. I just figured that it was pointless to have you rotting in jail, when instead I could have myself a brand new little toy. I think this will be more fun for both of us.\" Thea said, emphasizing her point with a squeeze around his waist. Roy squealed in pain from the crushing grip of the giant rich girl's fingers. \"Ooo, I didn't know you were a squeaky toy.\" Thea teased, laughing as she carried him over to her purse. \"Now, since you like my purse so much, you can ride back inside of it.\" Thea said, before dropping Roy inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy landed with a thump in the bottom of the purse, crashing into the black leather that lined the bottom. He rolled over onto his back to see Thea's gigantic face looking down at him, smiling cutely. She flashed him a little wave, and then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZIIIIIIIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe purse was closed, leaving him in relative darkness. There was a little bit of light peeking in through the teeth of the zipper, which was enough for him to get a sense of his surroundings. There was a giant hairbrush, a tube of lipstick that was as big as he was, a giant wallet, a necklace, a pile of tampons, a pack of gum, and plenty of other random odds and ends. Before he could take further inventory, the world jumped into motion. Thea was walking back to her house, and he was along for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea didn't pay Roy any mind as she strolled back to her home, her purse casually swinging at her side. Her only focus was on what she would do with him when she was home. Her mind was racing with ideas, just as it had been all day. As soon as she saw him in the interrogation room at the prison she knew she wanted to own him, and now she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Roy was tossed around the chaotic inside of the giant purse, launched into the air with every swing as he bounced along with the contents, doing his best to dodge the giant objects around him. Her lipstick rolled back and forth like a log, forcing him to jump out of the way to avoid having his feet swept out from under him. He tripped on the now chain like necklace, only to fall on top of the giant gum packet. Before he was on his feet a stray tampon had sent him flying yet again, never giving him a moment's reprieve. He was already being tormented, and she wasn't even trying yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea ran up to her room as soon as she got home. She could not open her purse fast enough. Her eyes darted around the inside of the purse, looking for her newest acquisition, before spotting him tangled up in her hairbrush. She stifled a giggle as she reached for him, ready to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the ride Roy?\" Thea teased, pulling the shrunken boy out of the giant purse, disentangling him from the hairbrush in the process. \"Don't worry, I won't ignore you any longer. We can have some fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way Thea!\" Roy yelled. \"I don't want to have any 'fun', this isn't a game, and I'm not a toy.<br>\r\nThea responded to this with another dismissive laugh. \"No Roy, you're not. I don't know why this is so hard to understand. You are MINE. I OWN you. You are my PROPERTY. Thea said, emphasizing the point. \"You know, I think you parents might have made a mistake when they named you. They almost got it right, but you should never have been named Roy. They mixed up the first letter. From now on, I'm just going to call you 'Toy'. And now that I have my purse back, I have just what I need to play with you....\" Thea said, reaching into her purse and pulling out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A sewing kit. (Thea decides to sew Roy into the back of her thong)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A pack of gum. (Thea wraps Roy in a stick of mint gum and tosses him into her mouth, chewing on him lightly enough to avoid killing him)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A necklace. (Thea binds Roy's arms to the ends of a necklace chain, turning him into a living pendant hanging between her boobs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was passed midnight in Starling City and Oliver was out on patrol with his new partner Roy Harper, with Felicity Smoak on their communications channel feeding them Intel about nearby crimes. \"We've got a robbery at Starling City Jewels two blocks south of you, alarm was just tripped under a minute ago.\" Felicity said, speaking to the hood clad duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, let's move Roy.\" Oliver said, wanting to see if Roy's managed to get some form of control over the Mirakuru in his system. Saving something extra special in his quiver just in case he lost control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Roy said, eager to see some action as a Vigilante for the first time in nearly two weeks. He jumped from rooftop to rooftop following Oliver's lead until the sound of an alarm broke the quietness of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy jumped down into a nearby alleyway while Oliver pushed forwards, a tactic Oliver and Diggle taught him to cover extra escape avenues. He rolled forwards and noticed a man enter the lobby with a heavy looking sack hanging over his back, quickly the man noticed Roy and dropped the sack on the concrete behind him. He pulled out a gun and pointed it Roy \"Why don't you just keep walking.\" he said, trying to sound tough as he pointed it at Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of adrenaline Roy charged forward with his head ducked low, the man took a shot but it hardly slowed the endanger teen as it sparked off his shoulder and the deformed bullet fell to the floor. Roy grabbed the man and pushed him against a nearby wall, pausing for a second to look at at bullet on the ground behind him. If it wasn't for the Mirakuru in his system Roy might very well be dead, he leaned back and punched the man in the face. Following this he successfully landed multiple punches on the man's torso and stomach regions, leaving him battered and bruised as Oliver arrived on the scene after hearing the gunshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy! Roy! Stop it Roy!\" Oliver yelled, but the young man was in a violent rage. He wasn't even sure that mentioning Thea would result in him stopping this time, he reached into his quiver and pulled out a injection arrow filled with 20 milligrams of horse tranquilizer. He tailored the arrow with a higher dosage than needed for a normal human so the Mirakuru in his system wouldn't be able to keep him conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stood up and pulled the arrow from his back, he turned to look at Oliver and then passed out. He fell to the floor hard, lying down on his back next to the man he just ferociously assaulted. \"Felicity, call your friends at S.T.A.R Labs. I think we're gonna need that project and send Diggle our location for pickup.\" Oliver said, speaking into his earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed before the drug wore off and Roy was slowly able to regain consciousness, as he groggily got up on his hands and knees he noticed that he was resting on top of a large wooden surface. This was odd, Oliver\u2019s usual hideout didn\u2019t have any large wooden surfaces this big. Where was he, where had Oliver and his team brought Roy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re finally up.\u201d Boomed a familiar female voice, it was one belonging to Felicity Smoak. But why was she so loud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here Felicity, you don\u2019t have to use a megaphone you know.\u201d Roy said as he stood up and turned towards Felicity, only to fall back on his ass as he was faced with her at largely different proportions than he was used to. She was gigantic, easily close to the size of the Queen Consolidated skyscraper, if not maybe a little bigger from his perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity pulled out her rolling chair and sat down with a bounce before rolling towards the newly shrunken Roy, who could only watch what was happening around him in utter amazement. \u201cSorry about your new size and all but we have to be able to keep an eye on you until Star Labs can manufacture a cure to the Miracura inside your system. Till then we just had to shrink you so that I could keep an eye on you.\u201d Felicity stated, explaining Roy\u2019s situation to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I get taking me out of the field and everything. But why shrink me?\u201d Roy asked, not exactly fond of being towered over so easily by the blonde IT girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Oliver didn\u2019t trust you to be around Thea, so he told her that you were leaving Starling City for a few weeks so she wouldn\u2019t get suspicious.\u201d Felicity stated, looking down at Roy as if that fact should have been obvious to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, I would never hurt Thea!\u201d Roy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you said before you went out in the field about hurting bad guys, and now we have a jewel thief in critical condition at Starling General.\u201d Felicity said, scolding Roy as she pointed her finger down at him. Clearly upset by his actions earlier that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was an accident.\u201d Roy said, trying to defend his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how many more accidents have to happen before someone ends up dead?\u201d Felicity asked loudly, slamming her open palm onto the table and bringing her face in close over the shrunken teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m watching over you from now on and that\u2019s final.\u201d Felicity stated, clearly upset as she pulled herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Oliver\u2019s voice called out over the comms chanel \u201cFelicity, I have a truck full of weapons leaving the Glades, I need you to track it for me while I deal with these thugs.\u201d prompting Felicity to start her new job of watching over Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is how she plans to do so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity stand up and knocks Roy onto her chair before sitting down on top of him and rolling to her computer to assist Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity takes off her high heel and drops in on the desk next to Roy before walking off for a few seconds, telling Roy to climb inside. He would refuse to listen forcing her to drop him inside herself and put it back on with him under the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Roy tries to run away as Felicity reaches out to grab him, however after catching him she doesn\u2019t know where to put him. However a second call from Oliver provokes her to shove him inside her cleavage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I've got to get back to work.\" Felicity said, no longer caring about Roy's opinion on the situation. She stood up, now towering over him. He didn't appreciate just how big she was until she stood to her full height and looked down at him, her face visible over the mountains of her breasts. While Roy was marveling at her massive scale, he didn't even notice her hand rushing towards him until he felt it strike him. He was lifted off the table by the impact, spinning and flailing as he flew helplessly through the air. He saw the edge of the table sail past him and worried he was now going to fall all the way down to the floor. He hoped the Mirakuru in his system was enough to keep him from going splat against the hard tile floor. Instead of hitting the ground though, he found himself landing on a soft leather cushion. As Roy returned to his feet, he realized he was standing not on the floor, but on Felicity's computer chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity! What are you doing?\" Roy asked, watching the giant woman walk in front of the chair, her heels clicking ominously with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm teaching you a lesson.\" Felicity replied. \"You'll be staying somewhere where you can't hurt anyone, including yourself. And you will have plenty of time to think about ways to deal with your new anger issues. And if this doesn't work, I'm sure I can think of far worse punishments.\" Felicity punctuated her sentence with a turn, leaving her enormous butt hanging above the shrunken boy on the seat. Her tight dress clung to her ass, outlining its contours in exquisite detail. At his tiny size, Roy could still see it vibrating as it settled from her turn, like a plate of jello that had been prodded with a spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was more than enough for Roy to get the idea. \"No, Felicity, don't sit do-\" Roy yelled, only to be cut off by an avalanche of the tech wiz's booty. The wall of dress covered flesh steamrolled over him effortlessly, pushing him onto his back as it settled in on top of him. As she sank deeper into her seat, it continued to come down, pushing down harder and harder on him as her cheek came down on all sides of him, creating a starfish shaped indent on her cheek where Roy was practically buried in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Nice and comfy.\" Felicity teased as she felt her butt sink into her seat, her soft and fleshy right butt cheek effortlessly molding around the shrunken Roy. She could feel him squirming and fighting against it, but he was no match for even one of her tremendous cheeks. It felt good to put Roy in his place. She had liked him well enough, but the way he acted after the Mirakuru filled her with anger. This new Roy was no hero, he was a danger to everyone around him, innocent or not. He needed to be shown his place, and her butt was just the tool for the job. Either he'd shape up and learn his lesson, or she would be doing a lot of babysitting during her nights in the bunker. If his squirming under her continued to feel as good as it did, she wasn't really sure what outcome she was hoping for. \"How do you like it down there Roy? Think my ass is big enough to teach you a lesson or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to savor the feeling a bit, but right on cue, Oliver's voice burst into the bunker. \"Felicity, I'm going to need some help here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing into action, Felicity pushed off the floor with her feet, sending her wheely chair rolling up to her desk, now alert and ignoring her new seat cushion. \"What's up Oliver?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three Vertigo dealers are fleeing on motorcycles. Any ideas on how to catch up with them?\" Oliver asked from his own, slower motorcycle. He was hot on their tail, but the gap was widening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, no problem at all.\" Felicity said after a quick survey of the map on her screen. \"They're headed right for the Star City bridge, I'll raise it just before they get there, and they'll be trapped.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't the only ones Felicity had trapped tonight. And her first prisoner almost wished he had Oliver coming after him in a bike chase as opposed to Felicity's butt coming down on him with every ounce of her weight. While he had little to be grateful about, Roy was at least glad Felicity was no longer wheeling around. Her feet left the ground when she slid across the floor, focusing all her weight back onto her tremendous buttocks. Felicity was not an athletic girl, and her butt certainly demonstrated this. It was the softest thing Roy had ever come into contact with, but also completely impossible to fight. The doughy cheeks absorbed every blow or push he made against them, refusing to allow him any control whatsoever. As he futilely punched at the unimpressed wall of booty, he began to get angry. He hated being shrunken, he hated being trapped, and he hated being embarrassed to the point where he was being treated as little more than a seat cushion for the IT girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... That feels nice...\" Felicity purred, loving the spot Roy was currently hitting on her hindquarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, is everything alright there?\" Oliver asked, breaking Felicity out of her trance as she focused on her tiny ward turned masseuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sorry Oliver.\" Felicity stammered, not wanting to explain. \"Just one more second...\" Felicity said, punching in some last minute keystrokes. \"And... Up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity saw the little red dots that represented the thugs on her radar slow to a stop, realizing they had nowhere to go. They were trapped at Oliver's mercy. And they weren't the only ones. With a satisfied grin, she slid her butt to the side, rolling Roy from his position under her cheek to right under her crack. She gave her cheeks a squeeze around him, asserting her complete and total power over her prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not a small action for Roy. He was used to Felicity moving around on top of him, but this was a big movement, even for this gigantic ass. Rather than move back and forth, Felicity's cheek continuously slid to the right, dragging across his body until he was rolling over and over, like a log rolling downhill. He came to a stop on his back once more, just in time to see her ass settle back down on to him, one cheek on either side. This was actually much better than being pinned under a cheek, as much less of her weight was on him now. That is until she began to squeeze her cheeks together. The dress clad cheeks moved in on him from either side, determined to meet each other regardless of Roy's intentions. Even with his Mirakuru strength, he posed no obstacle to them. They easily overwhelmed any resistance and slammed together tightly, pinning him between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity had no concept of what it must be like for Roy as she squeezed him between her cheeks. She imagined it might be something like a very tight hug. She knew it was a punishment, but she had no concept of just how strong her clenching cheeks could be. If she had fully appreciated it, it only would have made her grin wider. She loved being in control for once. She sometimes felt like she wasn't useful enough, sitting in the bunker and waiting for Oliver to need her. But now she was tackling a problem all on her own, one Oliver was not equipped to deal with. And all it took her was a clench of her ass cheeks. As she watched the red dots getting picked off on the screen, taken out one by one by Oliver's arrows, she fought her own battle. With every dot that disappeared, she gave her cheeks another powerful clench, squeezing her prisoner as tightly as she could. She only wished she could feel him directly against her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were not hugs for Roy. Every squeeze felt like an attempt to push his organs out through his mouth like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube. If it wasn't for the Mirakuru, he was sure that he'd been a red splotch on her dress. He was seriously considering rolling back under her butt cheek next time she adjusted herself if only to ensure that he was only at the mercy of one of her ass cheeks at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Felicity. I'm all done here. Did you handle the Roy situation?\" Oliver radioed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Oliver, I've got Roy covered. I thought he might be a pain in the ass, but he actually has been great.\" Felicity said, nearly giggling at her double entendre. No one but her knew Roy was \"covered\" by her enormous booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to head home then. See you tomorrow.\" Oliver said, and the radio went silent, leaving Felicity and Roy alone in the bunker. It was getting late, and she should probably head home as well, but she had to figure out what to do with Roy. It's not like she could wheel this chair home with him pinned under her butt the whole way, much as she may have liked to. With a sigh, she accepted that she'd have to get up and slowly rose to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright my little cushion, it's time for me to go home.\" Felicity said, chuckling at the sight of the tiny boy gasping for breath in the crater-like indent left by her ass on the seat. \"The only question is, where should I keep you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity decides she ready misses her little Roy butt massages, and decides to stuff him between her butt cheeks as she heads home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Felicity thinks that Roy needs to practice losing to an opponent he cannot defeat, so she lets him wrestle her tongue while she drives home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Felicity traps Roy in one of the equipment cases with Sara's Black Canary costume. The only problem is when she shows up and slips into her costume unaware of her tiny guest.</span></div></div>",

In truth, there was only one person still sitting at the Verdant bar. That person was Laurel Lance, attorney at law. And she was drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a shot of whiskey. Like to end my night on the hard stuff.\" Laurel garbled, waving pointlessly at the female bartender. Sighing, the bartender poured the shot and slid it down to her, just in time for Thea to enter the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you've had enough Laurel?\" Thea asked, walking up behind the bar. She was wearing a tight blue dress and giving Laurel a disappointed look. She turned to the bartender who had given her the drink. \"Go home Maria, I've got this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to anger her boss, the bartender politely waved before scurrying out of the room, leaving Thea and Laurel alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm old enough to know when I've had enough Thea.\" Laurel said, staring at the shot glass on the bar in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know that's not true Laurel.\" Thea said, sighing. \"You know we're just worried about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to worry about me!\" Laurel snapped, glaring at Thea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Laurel, I just care about you.\" Thea said with a sigh. \"Ok look, I'm not going to force you, but I've got to go turn off the lights in the back. Just wait here and skip that drink, and I'll walk you home, ok?\" Thea said, giving a faint smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel glared at her with crossed arms, not saying anything. Sighing again, Thea walked away, quietly hoping that Laurel would come to her senses. Laurel scoffed, unable to believe she was getting lectured about drinking by Thea Queen. Thea had been a notorious party girl just a year ago. Now Thea was running a club, and Laurel was on the verge of getting disbarred. How had things changed so much so quickly? It was no wonder she wanted to drink more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel sighed and reached for her shot, not giving another thought to Thea's scolding. But as soon as she touched, the glass, the world started to blur. Well, it was already blurry, but it quickly got much worse. Laurel pulled her hand away and grabbed her head, covering her eyes to give her brain sometime to readjust. Then suddenly, she felt like she was falling. This was a familiar feeling for the drunken girl, but this time seemed different. When she opened her eyes, she realized why: she really was falling! She flailed helplessly as she plummeted downwards, trying to find something to stop her descent. She braced herself for what she was sure would be a painful landing, before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLOP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel suddenly found herself underwater. She was sure she had to be hallucinating at this point, but her survival instincts kicked in regardless. Frantically, she began to swim towards light, surprised by the dark murky color of whatever water she had landed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh\" Laurel gasped as she popped her head above the surface, gasping in air. Now that she could breathe and was no longer worried about drowning, her other senses immediately kicked in. First was the cold. Whatever she landed in was frigid, and she started shivering right away. Second was the overpowering smell of alcohol. And there was the glass wall surrounding her pool, distorting her view of Verdant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm in my drink\" Laurel yelled. She had no idea how it had happened, but somehow she had shrunken and fallen into the shot glass that had been sitting in front of her. She immediately swam to the side of the glass, trying to climb out, but the slick glass walls proved too smooth a surface to climb. She was going to need Thea's help to get out of this, assuming Thea was still normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurel? Are you still here? Laurel?\" Thea called strolling back towards the bar and wondering where her friend had gone. She would have had to move quite fast to disappear so quickly, which was surprising considering how drunk she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down here!\" Laurel yelled. \"In the drink!\" Her head still hurt a little bit, but falling into the cold liquid had helped her sober up considerably. Looking up at a giant Thea also helped with that. Her ex boyfriend's little sister was now a giantess towering over her, and Laurel really needed her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea came around the bar, looking around at where Laurel had been sitting. Her eyes scanned the bar itself, before settling on the shot glass in which Laurel had landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel sighed with relief, assuming she had been seen. Thea was looking right at her! Her hopes were dashed when Thea spoke next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She left her drink at least. That's a good sign I guess.\" Thea said, sitting down on the bar stool Laurel had been at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel was stunned at just how massive Thea was. Even sitting down, the giant club owner completely dwarfed Laurel. Thea's face hung far above her, no longer looking at the drink, but staring off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what are we going to do about Laurel. She's spiraling out of control.\" Thea groaned, completely at a loss. She hated seeing her friend like this, but didn't know what to do to help. She laid her head on her hand, looking dejectedly downwards at the shot they'd gotten into a fight over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no use wasting a drink.\" Thea muttered, before grabbing the shot glass off the bar with no regard for its tiny passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel's eyes widened as even her drunk mind realized what was about to happen. \"Thea no! Don't drink it I'm in here!\" Laurel yelled, waving one arm frantically while using the other to stay afloat. If Thea didn't see her, she was a goner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A bartender accidentally turns off the lights and startles Thea, causing her to spill the drink down her shirt. She heads home to shower, annoyed and unaware of the tiny drunk woman now struggling between her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thea brings the glass up to her lips but notices Laurel just before drinking it. Seeing that she is tiny now, Thea decides to help Laurel break her drinking habit, keeping her tiny as a form of rehab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Thea doesn't notice Laurel and downs the shot with Laurel inside. Laurel is swallowed and digested.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How much trouble am I in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea waves it off \"Don't worry, it was an accident and all it cost was a broken shot glass. I'll see you Friday, don't be late. Now get so I can lock up\" she lightly orders, the woman nods and leaves quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile for Laurel things were only marginally better than previously, sure she was no longer about to be swallowed by an unaware Thea, but she was now trapped between the brunette's boobs. Thea, Laurel is reluctant to admit much like Sara had bloomed into a very beautiful young woman, something she was reminded of as she was stuck to one of her respectably sized breasts, a part of her glad she hadn't ended up in her cleavage the tight dress made her believe she would have suffocated and died in the marshmallow hell, even at her minuscule size. She needed to find a way to get Thea's attention, but she had no idea how, not helped by the still drunk woman feeling queezy as her surroundings shook like jello with every move Thea made, only the stickiness of the alcohol stopping her from being thrown into the younger woman's cleavage, or bouncing off and plummeting to the ground and her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea sighs as she returns home, Laurel was a problem she really wished she didn't have, as it hurt her to see someone who had helped her less than a year ago going as far down the rabbit hole as she had, actually further if she was being honest. But that was something for another day, right now she needed to get these clothes off her, take a hot shower to get this booze off her skin and just go to bed, where things made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)While getting out of her clothes, Laurel is rubbed off and falls into Thea's bra, which she leaves on her bed before heading to her shower. While she does avoid potential drowning, she does need to get out of Speedy's bra before she puts it in the wash, not exactly something an inch tall drunk girl can do easily<br>\r\n2) Laurel ends up an unwilling addition to Thea's shower routine, the water shocking her sober while also washing her off Thea's boob in a matter of seconds. Her tiny size seems to have made fall damage non existent, which means she just had to somehow avoid being washed into the drain, something made easier when she ended up wedged between Thea's 4th and pinkie toes<br>\r\n3) Laurel's alcohol idled brain decides the simplest way to survive this nightmare and get Thea's attention... was to bite her. It sort of worked, as besides getting a slap that felt like she was run into by a car, little Laurel had Thea's undivided attention, as the bug who had the balls to bite her on the tit.</span></div></div>",

Don't swallow me! Thea?\" Laurel yelled, so small she couldn't be heard even when she was less than a foot away from Thea's eardrums, losing hope that things were going to go her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bottoms up,\" Thea announced, rushing the shot towards her lips and throwing her head back, washing Laurel alongside the edge of the glass. Screaming incoherently as her Ex-Boyfriend's little sister prepared to swallow her alive, rushing toward's Thea's upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer upper body collided with Thea's front teeth, nearly rendering her unconscious as she flipped upside down, landing on the tip of Thea's tongue. The rest of the shot attacking Laurel in a wave while she was reeling from the impact, washing the Lawyer's tiny body down the length of Thea's tongue, attempting to grab onto anything that would save her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea failed to notice these feeble struggles, gulped back the Alcohol, drawing Laurel closer to her doom, unknowingly enjoying the flavor she added. \"No, Thea, please, you can't!\" were the last words the tiny woman would ever speak outside the comfort of Thea's belly, carried away by the current of alcohol to the back of Thea's mouth, and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming helplessly, Laurel continued to fight back the entire way down Thea's esophagus, kicking and punching the walls as they closed in around her. Thea, feeling a catch in her throat, forced down the lump with an additional gulp, pinning Laurel's arms over her head and dropping her into Thea's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea, oh my god, no! Let me out of here! THHEEEEEAA!\" Laurel screamed, floating in Thea's stomach acid, which had already begun to eat away at her clothes and burn her skin.

After discovering Malcolm Merlin returned to Star City with Thea around the time of their friends' death Diggle, Felicity, and Roy convince Oliver to ask Thea again where Malcolm Merlin was, this time as the Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the night, he got into position on the rooftop overlooking Thea's apartment. From there he saw her, decorating for the holiday season. She looked so peaceful as she walked across the room, how could anyone believe that she was capable of killing Sara? But whether he liked the situation or not, Oliver knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed an arrow from his quiver, drawing it against the back of his bow before lowering it down to the arrow rest. In one fluid motion, Oliver released the nock of his arrow, allowing it to soar silently across the street. It pierced the bricks above her balcony door, creating a clotheslined cable for Oliver to zip line across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver jumped, latching onto the cable and swinging towards Thea's apartment. He had to know the truth about Thea's potential involvement in this, even if that meant interrogating her himself. A few moments later, he kicked his way through her balcony's glass door. Oliver faced his sister as an intruder, Thea still having no idea that her brother was the Arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thea Queen! Where is Malcolm Mer-\" Oliver started, but before he could finish his sentence a bright flash of light surrounded him on both his right and left sides. A security system installed by Merlin in case any of the League's members came after Thea. However, this security system utilized a prototype Molecular Hyper Compressor that Malcolm had stolen from Palmer Technologies. Which meant that its purpose was not to kill intruders, but instead leave them helpless in front of Thea, that way she could dispose of them herself. Oliver was about to get a firsthand experience of what that meant exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom, Boom!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath Olivers feet shock as he rubbed his eyes, his retinas still burning after being exposed to the white-hot light. 'What the hell is going on?' he asked himself. What could be causing these sudden earthquakes? Was this Malcolm's doing as well? Another part of his security system? Oliver's mind was racing with the possibilities, his vision beginning to return. But what he saw first defied all logic, it was his little sister Thea only 60 times bigger than she was a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM, BOOM!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea's bare feet met with the wooden floor below on either side of Oliver's tiny body, blocking off his escape. Somehow he'd been shrunk. Looking up Oliver could see that something inside Thea had changed. Her eyes were different. They used to be so sweet and calm, but now they were focused and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you could intimidate me huh? Thought I'd be some scared little girl? Well let me ask you something, do I look 'little' to you?\" Thea asked, raising her left foot off the ground and stomping it back down on the ground with a thundering slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver! What's going on? I'm picking up some weird telemetry from your suit. Is everything okay?\" asked a familiar voice in Oliver's earpiece, it was Felicity Smoak. Luckily all of his gear had shrunk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a great time Felicity! Thea's three hundred feet tall, I've been shrunk!\" Oliver replied while waiting for Thea to make the next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, shrunk as in 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' shrunk? That's not possible unless Merlin got his hands on a Dwarf Star alloy, but that's some seriously cutting-edge tech. Where would he even find that?\" Felicity commented, geeking out while Oliver stared down (or rather up at) his gargantuan sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I need your help. Find some way of distracting her so I can escape.\" Oliver said, relying on Felicity's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! Merlin must have taken the entire building of the grid. You're on your own Oliver. You have to run, now!\" Felicity yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Thea was preparing to end her tiny intruder's live. Raising her foot high above him, wiggling her naked toes, actually enjoying the power she felt over someone as small as an insect. \"Don't take this the wrong way. But, I have to kill you now.\" Thea announced, bringing her foot down hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot landed right where Oliver had been standing. Luckily, he had just enough time to evade her foot before the impact. \"Don't run away! I can't guarantee a quicker death like that.\" Thea teased, her personality pulling a complete one-eighty from what Oliver was accustomed to seeing from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, do something!\" Oliver yelled as he squared off for round two, noticing that he lost his earpiece while evading Thea's feet. With only his bow and his wits at his disposal, he'd have to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed another bow from his quiver and began running away from Thea. \"What's wrong, are you scared?\" she teased, lifting her foot again, it's shadow eclipsing his tiny form in mere seconds. \"Come back here! I want to introduce you to my toes.\" Thea teased, actually enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver waited until the shadow of Thea's foot stopped growing and used the cover to shoot an arrow through the gap between her big and second toe. The arrow pierced Thea's pants at her thigh, giving Oliver a grappling point. Activating his bow's automatic winch system, he evaded Thea's foot a second time. None of which meant he was anymore safe as Thea quickly noticed his deception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung down towards her thigh, not aiming for Oliver himself but the rope holding him up instead. She was attempting to make the Arrow her own personal Yo-Yo, grabbing the string and pulling it hard. This action launched Oliver into the sky and up the full length of her body, leaving him to fall back down from her head all the way down to her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Thea would never allow it to get that far. Rather than give her tiny opponent the chance to escape certain death a third time she decided to try and end things quickly. She stretched her arms out far to her right and left sides, then brought her hands together aiming for Oliver. Trying to squash him as if he was an annoying mosquito between the palms of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver saw this ahead of time, grabbing several arrows from his quiver this time. He drew them against his bow, not seeing the need to steady them with such a large target. He released his grip and allowed them to dig into Thea's palm \"Ouch!\" Thea said, the arrows inflicting just enough damage to get her to pull back. But the other hand was still coming and smacked Oliver across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed in Thea's kitchen, on the center of the island. \"Little fucker, you're gonna pay for that one!\" Thea shouted, surprised that someone so small could make her that upset. Killing him was no longer her intent. Instead, she was going to torture him until he wished for death, turning her attention towards the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver took notice of this. Realizing that he was no closer to escaping the brunt of Thea's wrath than he was getting back to his original size. She stomped towards the island, her feet creating shockwaves that could be felt by Oliver even at a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom, boom, boom!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've seriously pissed me off now you little worm!\" Thea snapped, raising her hand over the counter. Oliver, dealing with some potentially broken ribs struggled to stand and run away. She'd failed to crush the Arrow as if he were a cockroach and a mosquito. Now she was going to try smushing him like an ant on her kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Slap!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver stumbled away, escaping between Thea's fingers as her hand met with the countertop. Though for once Thea had let him escape death, moving him into position for her plans. She watched from above as he ran across the island, both of them realizing it was a futile effort. She laughed, raising her hand once more, high above the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bang*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea's hand slammed against the counter, her palm facing Oliver. Slowly she started moving her hand towards him like a bulldozer. He tried to run. But unlike the other times, there was no escape for him at this size. Thea was too powerful at her gigantic size, leaving Oliver with no remaining options to fight against her. Escape was impossible, but much to Oliver's surprise Thea didn't crush him then and there. Instead, she swung her hand over him and _________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ...Swatted him like a fly, setting him on course to land inside one of her knee tall designer boots. Meanwhile, Felicity listens in on Oliver's lost communicator. Potentially coming up with a plan to save Oliver while Thea puts on the boot with Oliver inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) ...Sends him flying onto her couch, where she is quick to introduce him to her ass. Sitting on top of him and using Oliver as a seat cushion as recompense for leaving a hole in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) ...Grabs him, bringing him under her gaze without unmasking him. Thinking about the many different ways in which she can torture him. (Writers Choice)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oliver fully expected his sister's hand to come down on him like a fly swatter, flattening him into a smear on the counter. Instead, he was relieved to instead take a hit from the side, sending him off of the counter entirely. As he flew through the air, dazed and confused, he fumbled for his bow, hoping to find a grappling arrow to save him from colliding into the hard apartment floor. There weren't any. Panicking, he realized there was nothing he could do to control his trajectory. Looking down, he hoped to see himself headed for a soft landing, like the couch or a plant. Instead, he saw something that might have been worse than the floor: the opening to his sister's boot. Unable to redirect his path in any way, he could do nothing but plummet headfirst into the beckoning boot, belly flopping into the inside with a quiet squelching noise as his impact squeezed some lingering sweat out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullseye,\" Thea said to herself, smirking as she headed towards her waiting boot. Unknowingly, Oliver's dropped communicator was laying on the floor, right in her path. And Felicity was still trying to use it in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oliver? Oliver! Come in Oliver!\" Felicity yelled, trying to find any sign that Oliver was nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she heard in response was Thea's stomping feet, getting closer and closer. She could hear the slam as the ball of her foot struck the ground, plus the little auxiliary taps as her toes struck down. Thea was a thin girl, walking barefoot. The thought that her footsteps could cause earthquakes like that made Felicity realize just how truly tiny Oliver must be. Felicity couldn't help but cringe as the feet got closer, fully expecting to hear a crunch as the communicator was snuffed out of existence. But luckily, Thea narrowly missed the discarded device, allowing Felicity to hear what came next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you like it in my boot little Arrow?\" Thea said, getting closer now to the boots that were imprisoning Star City's superhero. \"They're probably a little smelly. I've been wearing them all day for pretty much the whole week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oliver laid on his stomach, face down on the insole of his sister's giant boot, he fully believed they had been well worn. The cave he found himself in reeked of foot sweat. He groaned in pain as he pushed himself up on to his knees. He patted his chest, ensuring no ribs had broken on the impact. Like it or not, his sister's boot had decent padding. He could feel the insole beneath him vibrating though, in time with the echoing thumps of his sister's footsteps from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think it's bad now, wait till I put them on. You're going to have to wrestle my toes just to find some living space.\" Thea said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew she was getting close but had no idea what to do next. He turned to the opening of the boot, knowing it was the only escape and could see one of Thea's lamps, like a shining beacon saying \"Freedom this way.\" But as he pondered how to actually reach that high above the opening, Thea's face suddenly appeared over the opening. Her head obscured much of the light Oliver had been getting, leaving him only able to see a dimly illuminated version of her cruelly grinning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver fell back in surprise as his little sister's face suddenly appeared over the boot, grinning madly down at him. \"Oh wow, I can barely see you in there. I wonder if I'll even be able to feel you under my foot.\" Thea teased, loving the power rush. Her words echoed inside the boot, nearly deafening Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of here right now Thea!\" Oliver yelled, still unwilling to reveal his identity to his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? You're scared of a little girl's feet? Well then maybe you shouldn't go breaking into people's apartments. Luckily, I think we can help you get past your fear with a little exposure therapy.\" Thea said, before standing up to her full height. Her face was now seemingly two hundred feet over the boot opening, making it clear just how tiny Oliver really was. And yet none of that compared to the sight of her bare foot appearing over him, toes wiggling excitedly as they hung over the entrance to the boot. They were ready to play with their new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver began to run as his sister's toes began their descent, like a stampede coming right for him. Unfortunately, Thea anticipated this and tipped her shoe back as she slid the boot on. As she did, Oliver's run went from flat, to uphill, to a full-on climb. And without anything to grip on the smooth insole of the boot, he found himself sliding helplessly down towards the incoming avalanche of wiggling toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis descent only stopped when the ball of her foot touched down right in his path as her toes arced up over him. When her foot settled in, he was trapped face down against the insole of her shoe while her giant toes kept him restrained. He tried to push himself up off the disgusting ground, but her toes forced him back down with an effortless flex. There were five fleshy arches built around him, creating an unliftable ceiling of sisterly foot flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, you feel good under my toes little guy,\" Thea said, smiling as she felt the weak squirming beneath her toes. \"I wonder how long you can hold up under there though?\" She had sat down on the couch to pull her boot on, but now was the moment of truth. She rose to her feet, allowing her weight to roll from her heels, to the balls of her feet, and finally to her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver shouted as his sister's toes tightened their grip, but his only audience was the cruel digits inflicting his torture. He felt he weight bearing down on him more now, and saw the ball of her foot on his left sink down into the insole, leaving no visible space between them. He was glad he hadn't ended up under there, not sure if he could survive his sister's full weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the screaming meant he was still alive, Thea took a few trial steps across her apartment, gingerly at first, but when she was convinced that he could take it, she began to walk normally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing about the situation was normal for Oliver though. Every one of his sister's footfalls was an event to him. Every smack of her foot against the ground felt like a tidal wave slamming him into a rocky cliff. Except with the foot, the wave didn't stop. Once he was up against the insole wall, it didn't fall away. It pressed and pressed as hard as it could, trying to flatten him and squeeze him and destroy him. As her foot pressed into him, he was glad he wasn't any smaller. If he had been small enough, a stomp of her foot could have pushed him into a pore on her sole, dooming him to a life as the underside of a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thea walked across the apartment, 100% of her focus was on her new toe toy. She didn't even notice the communicator she stepped on, eradicating it from existence with a barely audible crunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity heard the crunch loud and clear, followed by static as the communicator went offline. She could not believe what she had just heard. Oliver was trapped in his sister's boot, being used as an insole for the young girl. At least she knew he was alive by the way Thea had been talking to him. She had to go save him, and fast. Who knows what Thea would do if she got bored with playing with him under her toes. Felicity immediately hopped out of her chair and headed to the elevator, wanting to catch Thea as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Thea was still enjoying her new foot toy. Gleefully, she squeezed him with her toes and lifted her foot a bit inside her shoe, pushing him forward all the way up to the toe of her boot. This wasn't her taking pity on him though. She just wanted to be able to play with him a bit more dexterously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was relieved for a moment to have been pushed forward, thinking he'd have less of his sister's weight to contend with. That is until his sister's toes sprang into action. Now that he was at the toe of her boot, the pads of her toes were upon him. His head was right under her big toe, which wasted no time pressing down on his face. He felt the calloused underside of her toe scrape across his face as it literally rubbed in just how completely she dominated her new boot pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like how your little face feels under my toe. If you don't get squished tonight, maybe I'll have you give me a foot rub in the morning. Your little body could hit so many sore spots.\" Thea teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Oliver felt like the pressure of her toe was going to break his nose, Thea relented, just before her talon-like toes reclaimed his body and pulled him back under them, snug under their arches where he belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only question now is what you and I should do together next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Thea lounges around her apartment, toying with Oliver under her toes until Felicity drops in. (Reserved)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thea heads out to Verdant for some working and dancing, confident her new insole will support her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Thea takes Oliver out of her boot, trying to decide what to do next. When Felicity arrives, she places him on a chair and allows Felicity to unknowingly sit on him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\">Back when Ray was still perfecting the shrinking process, there was still a few 'bugs' to work out in his live trials. However, like all of Ray Palmer's problems, he tackled the issues head-on. A fact that often got him into trouble as the world was dangerous for a man the size of a Tic-Tac. Welcome to the <b>Behind</b> the scenes story of how Ray Palmer survived his encounter with the ass of one Felicity Smoak.</div></font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Raymond Palmer, conducting miniaturization test number 17. Shrinking myself and the A.T.O.M or Atom suit, short for Advanced Technology Operating Mechanism.\" Ray announced, recording his work in Team Arrow's new secret hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simulations predict a fifty-two percent chance of success, with only a one percent chance that I will be shrunk out of existence entirely.\" Ray joked, placing his finger over controls. \"Miniaturization in three, two, one... *Click*.\" Ray declared, activating his suit before shrinking rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Ray yelled as his body was tossed into the air, the shrinking process reducing his body to the center of mass in his abdomen. Something he made a note of to fix in the future as a tall and surprisingly soft structure broke his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay stood up after taking the plunge, looking at his massive surroundings and jumping joyfully at his success. Sure his landing could use a little work, but he could finally shrink himself at will. However, Ray would soon come to realize that shrinking wasn't the only problem he'd tackle today as he tried returning to his former size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, going up in 3, 2, 1...*Click*.\" Ray said, closing his eyes for the regrowth process. However nothing changed, Ray remained tiny. He looked at his control panel to see that it read \"CRITICAL ERROR! Not enough power remaining for this function.\" realizing that he forgot to charge the suit before his test in his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by the sound of the Elevator stopping on this floor, the doors opening to reveal an absolutely gargantuan Felicity Smoak. She was carrying in one hand a bag from Big Belly Burger, and in the other her purse. The rhythmic sound of her heels clicking against the floor drawing closer by the second. The Vibrations caused by her feet, creating small tremors that made Ray's legs wobble as she came up the stairs, heading straight for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a pink pastel dress, with a mini skirt that flowed around her halfway down her thighs. Her steps occasionally granting Ray a glimpse of her black panties as she walked around the Arrow Cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, her size was even more impressive and intimidating. Felicity was like a living, breathing skyscraper, who's height rivaled Palmer Technologies. Even the tall structure he landed on only came up to the blonde CEO's thighs, making him wonder what he was standing on exactly. Turning to his right to see a wall one hundred feet high, made of the same material under his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it occurred to Ray that he was standing on top of a chair. More importantly, one designed specifically to comfort Felicity's wide hips. The ground pulled out from underneath him as the giant woman casually pulled out her chair for use, placing her purse next to her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay fell onto his back, watching as Felicity swung her giant ass overhead. Unable to waste any power on an escape attempt, Ray called out to Felicity for help. \"Felicity wait! Don't sit down, I'm down here!\" Ray yelled, waving his arms as his cries for help went unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I should really kick my addiction to Big Belly Burger one of these days. This is gonna go straight to my hips, again.\" Felicity joked, abruptly bringing her shapely rear end down onto her seat without even thinking to check her cushion. Her large moon blocking out all light, her shadow eclipsing Ray's tiny body within moments as he futile put his hands up to defend himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity's butt landed on top of the tiny Ray with the earth-shattering force of a falling meteor. Bouncing on top of him as she failed to notice anything out of the ordinary under her panty clad bottom, despite Ray's struggles underneath her. She weighed so much that Ray was surprised that he was still alive, though he probably had Felicity's rotund rear end to thank for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get to work,\" Felicity said to herself, sitting up in her seat, pushing Ray down with her full weight. From a scientific standpoint, Ray couldn't help but feel proud of his work. If he could survive under Felicity's giant butt while he was the size of a skittle, then there was probably little that could harm or kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ray's camera was there, recording the whole thing, zooming in on Felicity's butt while following his suit's tracker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Felicity notices the camera zooming in on her and gets up to check the footage, leaving Ray in the imprint left behind by her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ray wastes some of his suit's remaining power trying to get Felicity's attention through different means, such as attacking her, trying to lift her and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Felicity gets up an hour later, her panties dragging Ray into her buttcrack and forming a wedgie with him at its center. Felicity then heads home with Ray in tow.</span></div></div>",

As Thea discovers when she shrinks out of her costume down to an inch tall, luckily this happened to her in the 'Arrowcave' rather than on a mission, unfortunately, her only hope is getting the attention of Felicity Smoak, who has just entered the lair, missing her shrinking completely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Thea's violent outbursts are getting worse, the last of her accidental victims looking like they were mauled by a wild animal. With this on his conscience, Oliver makes the decision to '<i>borrow</i>' Ray's shrinking tech and reduce Thea to the size of a mouse, then leave her with the most responsible person he knows: Laurel Lance. This is just until they can find a way to stop the bloodlust from flaring out, but will this run smoothly, or are Thea and possibly even Laurel in for a rough ride?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr just have her shrink for some other reason, either after she gets cured of the bloodlust, or just in an unrelated incident</span></div></div>",

She had been in the bunker, arguing with Oliver, and then she'd felt a prick on the back of her neck. After that, it was all fuzzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her her head cleared, she realized she was not laying down. She was vertical, held up by some thick and unfamiliar restraints that wrapped around her entire body up to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're awake.\" Laurel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Laurel's voice gave Thea a jolt. It was loud, and coming from above her. She craned her head upwards towards the source of the voice, and was shocked to see only Laurel's enormous face hanging above her. As she scanned the giant woman, she realized that the \"restraints\" that were holding her were Laurel's fingers. She was trapped in Laurel's fist, with only head sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Laurel? Why am I so small?\" Thea asked, struggling against Laurel's giant fingers. Her struggling didn't move the fingers surrounding her body at all though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel tried to answer delicately, knowing that Thea wouldn't like the answer. \"Well Thea, the team decided that you've been out of control recently. Your bloodlust is making you dangerous and unpredictable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you shrunk me?\" Thea asked angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me. It was Felicity.\" Laurel said. \"But we all agreed that as long as you can't control your own actions, it was necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bullshit Laurel! I'm 100% in control of my actions!\" Thea snarled, her rage building. \"Put me down and I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know that's not true Thea.\" Laurel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you're just going to be my babysitter now?\" Thea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's not like that...\" Laurel replied, trying to calm her down. Trying to extend an olive branch, she placed Thea down on the desk in front of her before continuing to speak. \"You'll just have to stay with me for now while Oliver and Felicity look into ways to cure your blood lust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not staying with you Laurel! How would that even work? You're going to bring your tiny friend to work?\" Thea yelled angrily. \"Might get a few questions about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel almost cursed under her breath. To be honest, she did feel like a babysitter, stuck with this angry petulant girl, even if she was tiny. \"Obviously I couldn't let people see you Thea. You'd have to stay hidden somewhere in my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Thea said, backing away from Laurel's hands. Before Laurel could do anything to stop her, the tiny girl drew the bow off her back and quickly fired an arrow into the giant DA's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Laurel said, feeling the pinprick of the Arrow stab into her hand. \"Fuck Thea, this is the kind of shit I'm talking about.\" Laurel was no longer playing nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThea saw the change on Laurel's face and knew she had overdone it. She turned to run from the giant superhero, only to feel the familiar giant fingers wrapping around her again. This time Laurel's fingers came only up to her waist, covering her legs and holding her arms down at her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel flicked the tiny bow and arrow off Thea's back as the tiny girl angrily writhed in her grip, yelling with rage as she fought the giant fingers. \"Now I'm sure shrinking you was the right choice. You can't stay calm for a second! I was just going to keep you in my pocket, but it's clear that you can't be trusted with that much freedom. You need a time out to cool off, and I know just the spot....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Laurel going, and where will she keep Thea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. It's morning and Laurel is about to go out in to the district attorney's office, with Thea trapped in between her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. It's night time and Laurel is going to go out as Black Canary, with Thea trapped in her boot under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Laurel's going home to sleep, keeping Thea tucked between her breasts</span></div></div>",

Plenty of time for impossible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did you get so big?\" Kate asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you didn't take after the detective side of the old Batman.\" Alice teased. \"And round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' printed on it in large letters.\" Alice continued, explaining the situation in her own psychotic way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk me!\" Kate yelled, recalling the shrinking potion from the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland. Unfortunately, she knew that was possible, given that the Atom had least had figured out methods to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I slipped a little of that shrinking potion into your drink earlier. I took the label off though. I know how you love surprises.\" Alice said with a sneer. \"And now that you're tiny, I don't have to worry about Batwoman getting in the way of my plans.\" Alice explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, please, you're better than this. I know you're a good person still.\" Kate begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you, Beth is gone!\" Alice snarled. \"She died locked in that basement, and Alice was born.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that!\" Kate yelled, struggling in her sister's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Kate, maybe I need to show you what it's like to be trapped and isolated for a while?\" Alice said, a Chesire Cat like smile spreading across her face. Clearly, she'd thought of something diabolical, and Kate couldn't help but shiver at the look of joyful cruelty in her sister's eyes. \"And I know just the place....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Alice flicks Kate upside the head, knocking her unconscious. When she wakes up, she is trapped waist deep in some sort of pastry at a tea party with her evil sister. Her prison will be Alice's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Alice pulls down her pants and panties before bringing Kate down in front of her ass. Kate's prison is going to be being shoved up Alice's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Alice brings Kate to the Gotham miniature museum, trapping her in a miniature city while Alice destroys it as a giantess.</span></div></div>",

I suppose I should be a good sister and help warm them up first\" smirking unseen she closes her hand on Kate before she could risk her escape attempt, then maneuvers her into position in her hand while using her free hand to spread her ass cheeks, revealing her winking asshole to the tiny 'hero' \"How do you like your new home? Rent free, well heated and best of all, best roommate ever. You and Me, forever\" the crazy woman sing songs, as she moves Kate closer and closer to her hungry hole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth! This is enough! Just stop this game and we can get you all the help you need to deal with what happened! Just don't do this!\" Kate screams, while she doesn't want to admit it she was even beginning to beg, especially as despite her kicking, at her size Alice's ass cheeks were more well padded then the cells in Arkham. Supergirl might not have been able to fight her way out of those hams, what chance did regular human Kate Kane have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice bit her lip and sighs as Kate's feet is sucked inside her ass up to her ankles 'Oh yes, this was a good plan' she thinks as she continues the process<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, you can stop now! I get it, you're not Beth anymore, and I shouldn't be trying to make you go back to that. Please, end this game and I can help you find the light in Alice\" the shrunken girl cries out, but the thing in front of her continues to devour her, taking her knees and then thighs in as many flexes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anal as big a thing for lesbians as it is other people?\" Alice muses out loud, then moans and grunts, because I am loving this, my limited edition, Kate Kane original Batplug. Oh you were made for my fucking ass Kate and I love it\" she pants lowly then growls \"Damn it\" clenching her jaw she lets go of Kate and her ass, the latter doing a swell job along with her sphincter at keeping the former contained as she walks over to her full lenght mirror turns her back to it and looking over her shoulder, spreads her cheeks so her and Kate could 'chat'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to ruin a good thing didn't you?\" Alice hisses \"You and your narrow boy hips, I hope the rest of you isn't a disappointment, or I might just forget you up there when I'm done playing with you\" she growls, then bounces back, ass slamming the mirror, more for her own relief as she knew her ass was big enough she didn't actually slam Kate into the glass. Sighing deeply she relases her cheeks, letting them smack Kate around for a minute or two, before getting back to work putting and entire bat in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate had hoped this was where the torment ended, buried up to her navel in Beth's almost luminously pale ass, but while she had never felt so helpless and humiliated in her life, it wasn't over just yet. Alice's long fingers pinned her arms to her side, at least until enough of Kate's arms and torso had entered her there was no way for her to pull or maneuver them free anytime soon. From there, she was content to just pull Kate in, using her muscles to inch her way up Kate's chest and shoulders, like she was literally being eaten by the mad woman's ass. Finally only her head was free, as Alice had planned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words for now Kate?\" the blond asks, knowing she wouldn't hear them \"Guess that's it for now\" she grins as she presses her finger against Kate's face and pushes, feeling her mission completed as she buries Batwoman alive in her ass \"Thank you Kate, for giving me this wonderful feeling\" she sighs breathlessly, then bounces her way over to where her pants were, shimmying her hips as she puts back on her panties and tight pants, wondering just how bad it must be for Kate in there, and laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) After all that excitement, Alice decides she needs a nap, giving Kate the only chance she has in the near future to escape this terrible place and try get help <br>\r\n2) She did have some shrinking potion left, as well as the formula to make more, why not go get some new toys, either to torment Kate as she kills them like bugs or vermin while she watches helplessly, or to use as a dildo for her aching cooter, as having sex, or close as they can with the size difference, with her actual, blood sister is crossing the line even to someone like Alice. Butt stuff is ok, but Kate Kane is never going anywhere near her vagina<br>\r\n3) The crows raid her hideout and capture Alice, and while Sophie is questioning her about Kate's whereabouts, Alice considers bullshitting her or tell her the truth about what she did, it's not like she'd believe she put a person in her ass anyway</span></div></div>",
