            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early the next morning, Sakura Haruno fiddled with the back of her dress akwardly. \"Why do I have to ruin this perfect figure of mine for a stupid exam?\" the kunoichi lamented as she managed to zip up the garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA package lay at the foot of her bed, it was a box with a pair of cherry colored sweatpants and a plain white t-shirt in varying sizes. She scoffed at the idea of wearing something so slovenly. \"I'm not wearing that!\" she huffed, \"I may have to get fat, but I know for a fact that Sasuke likes girls with long hair and look good!\" Of course, this was only the recent gossip about Sasuke Uchiha, Konoha's official babe-magnet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired ninja bounded down the stairs, \"Bye Mom, I'm meeting Naruto and Sasuke at Ichiraku's!\" her mother merely smiled, \"Bye Sakura, and would you mind asking Mrs. Yamanaka how Ino liked those dumplings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sakura was already out the door, enjoying her lithe frame for as long as it lasted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki sat at the booth, \"Hey Mr. Chef!\" he ordered, \"Another bowl of Miso Pork please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly man nodded to his daughter and she began to get to work. \"So what's up kid?\" he leaned in towards the young ninja, \"You've been hitting the ramen pretty hard lately, even for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta gain weight for the Chunnin Exams.\" Naruto bluntly stated. He had been at Ichiraku's Ramen Shop all morning stuffing his kraut, and all he got was a stomachache! \"Gee... I don't know how Chouji puts up with this all the time...\" he sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know kid, you've practically grown up on our ramen, and you never gained a pound,\" Teuchi got the order from Ayame and placed it in front of his best customer, \"And far be it from me to drive away business, but I think you should start hitting up other places than just binging at our quaint little shop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could mull this over, Sakura's familiar shriek blasted his eardrums, \"Naruto?! Are you wearing those ridiculous sweatpants?!\" Naruto looked over and sure enough, Sakura was not far behind from her yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, aren't they cool?!\" Naruto grinned as he faced his teammate, \"So stretchy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked at the village idiot, his sweatpants were orange and blue where her's were red and white. \"Probably custom made...\" Sakura thought inwardly. Naruto's shirt was slathered in broth, leaving unsightly yellow and brown stains all over it's white fabric. \"How come you're not wearing yours?\" Naruto offered a seat to his pink haired object of affection<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" she corrected, \"They're dorky and uncool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you put it that way,\" a nonchalant voice came from down the street, \"they sound like a perfect fit for you both if you ask me.\" It was Sasuke, of course. Where Sakura wasn't wearing her sweatpants or shirt, and Naruto was wearing his, Sasuke had altered his out fit to fit his style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uchiha ninja stood proudly adorned in a black t-shirt with his clan's symbol on the back. His sweatpants were blue and white, but he had cut them off at the knees and wore his arm warmers. Sakura swooned, \"Even dressed like a slob, Sasuke is sooo adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sasuke, what's up?\" Naruto managed through a mouthful of noodles. \"Hi Sasuke!\" Sakura squealed. Sasuke snorted, \"Chef!\" the young ninja sat down at the barstool, \"One order of plain ramen and a friend egg.\" Teuchi smiled, \"Comin' up kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura joined her teammates, \"So you're both really taking this gaining thing seriously, huh?\" Naruto was the first to answer as usual, \"Of course, if it'll get me to being Hokage faster then I don't care what it is!\" she turned to Sasuke, hoping to hear something cool and dramatic. \"Meh, I could always lose the weight later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi placed in front of each of the boys, \"Order up boys, enjoy!\" Sakura watched as her friends at their ramen, Naruto slurping his down like a pig and Sasuke approaching it calmly yet quickly. The chef turned to Sakura, \"And you, little lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pointed a slender finger at herself, \"Who? Me?\" Teuchi grinned, \"Yeah! You're on the same team, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl thought for a second, \"Erm... one Chicken Dumpling Ramen please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowls piled up on the counter, villagers stared at the three gorging kids, and the occassional belch from Naruto was heard through the slurping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, Naruto finally stopped. He rose to his feet, his stomach was gurgling in pain. \"Oh man!\" he massaged his poor stomach, \"This hurts!\" Sasuke smirked, \"Loser.\" Everyone laughed as the blonde boy massaged his swollen stomach. \"It's not funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued treating his stomachache for another half an hour before Sasuke and Sakura each threw in the towel. Sakura looked at her bowl pile:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive bowls. She remembered that number. If she was ever going to get better, she was going to have to get past five bowls of ramen. She looked at Naruto's pile, 15 and even Sasuke's pile was 10! Sakura was shocked! She never knew Sasuke could eat that much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sloshed a full belly, \"Ah... nothing like a good ramen feast to get the training going!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to gain weight, Naruto.\" Sakura corrected, \"No training, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto squinted his slanted eyes, \"...Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wobbled back into her room. She was stuffed! Stuffed to the gills! Her dress tightened around her broth-and-noodle-filled stomach constrictingly. A whole day dedicated to eating, Damn Naruto and his stupid appetite! She sighed deeply, remembering the box she inched her way over to the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out a pair of pants from the bottom and unfolded them. They were so big! Sakura could fit into these three times over! \"How big does Kakashi Sensei expect us to get?\" she asked. Her stomach gurgled, Sakura had to admit though, the feeling of a full belly felt good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"I guess I could always lose the weight after the chunnin exams... and Naruto could always stay fat!\" she laughed</span></div></div>",

The one thing all three of them had in common was that most ofthe weight went to their waistlines. Naruto now weighed 190 lbs. His face was chubbier with a second chin. He also had to keep his jacket open to let his belly out. Sakura was also around 190 lbs. Her face was the same as Naruto's. Her arms andlegs were pretty chubby. Her bust also increased and pressed against her clothes along with her much bigger belly. Lastly, Sasuke had the biggest increase coming in at 210 lbs. Hisface was slightly more chubbier then the others with a bigger double chin. His fat arms were pressing against his sleeves as were his legs with his shorts. His belly was also big, making his shirt ride up, letting it droop down a bit.He was also developing man boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dramatic weight increase impressed both Kakashi and Sakura. Naruto on the other hand, was jelous. \"Fine, if he's gonna show off how fat he gets, then I'll do one better, BELIEVE IT!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stormed off, leaving a trailing cloud of dust in his wake. \"What's his issue?\" Sakura asked, to which Sasuke only shrugged silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kicked a flat rock down the dusty streets in frustration, mumbling an angry tiriade to himself, \"Stupidsasukealwaysdoingwhathessupposedtogettingsofathepopsoffthosestupidsho rtsandhemakesmesomadwhatajerkihopeh-\" Suddenly, the blond knuckleheaded ninja walked straight into a signpole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned as he staggered to his feet, his skull rolling. As his vision gradually refocused, he saw the familiar characters of his favorite ramen joint scrawled in ink on a sign posted on the pole. Quickly scanning the lines, Naruto loudly concluded, \"Awww alright, they're having a big sale! All you can eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto produced a small, wrinkled white slip of paper from one of hispockets, \"And I've got the lucky coupon that'll let me in for ramen half off tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eager genin pictured himself slurping up ramen by lamplight on a warm, peaceful nights. The empty dishes stacked up to the stars. As he slipped out of his daydreams, Naruto licked his lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he put two and two together, \"Hey now... I can eat as much as I want because of that new event in the Chunin exams. Kakashi-sensei won't care at all if I completely pig out and put on weight. In fact... that's what I'm supposed to be doing so I can show up Sasuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto bunched up, doing his hearty little giggle before thrusting a fist in the air, \"Yeah, I'm going to totally one up Sasuke! He may act cool and play games with chakra, but now he's in my turf. I love ramen, and eating is MY mainstay... plus, nobody's gonna scold me for letting myself go all out. Hehehe... We'll see who'll come out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a loud crash sounded to Naruto's side. As he spun around, he saw a crochety old man speed out of an ancient looking shop with a rickshaw full of books and scrolls. Dust burst out from out of the shop's dilapidated curtains and into the streets. The old man was cackling wildly until his own dust caught up with him, forcing him to halt his dash, instead violently coughing in a not quite stationary position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto caught up with the wirey haired fellow, helping him up, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe senior's eyes bulged wildly at the blond haired ninja before bursting into laughter, \"Okay? This is the happiest day I've ever had in fifty-two years! Hahaha! Katashi's been hoarding up his books for decades, and FINALLY that old crone's gone out of business! Aha! I've made off with a killing, a killing! So far I've picked more rare books and scrolls than I can carry- with no more money than it would take to buy lunch, mind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wrinkled his nose, \"Meh, what's to do with some dusty old scrolls, anyhow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man forced his face just an inch from Naruto's before knocking him in the forehead hard, \"Say, what kind of shinobi are you, anyhow? Don't you know that these scrolls contain the works of art in not only literature and poetry from over the course of hundreds of years, but the arts of NINJUTSU as well?\" he barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeeeahhh...\" Naruto blurted, having forgotten, \"But still, you're old and crochety, what are you going to do with ninjutsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man scowled and spat at the boy, \"Bah, respect your elders, you little brat. While I might not be as sprawling and flexible as I used to be, I can analyze these 'dusty old scrolls', as you put it, and write a book of my own to make a killing! Now, if you'll excuse me...\" he said, straightening up his rickshaw, \"I have to dump these off at my estate before I come back for the second load... urgh...\" he moaned, pulling it up, \"... I'll... go back and forth... taking as much as I can... why not take a look at what's in there, boy... urgh, you might learn a thing or two... you might run across an unheard of but useful jutsu you need in your training... because after today, mark my words, this place is going to the birds! Haha... the birds!\" he crowed as he rolled off to the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jutsu that I need... Naruto blinked. Hey, if this guy's been hoarding up books for so long, then maybe I can find something even Kakashi will have never heard of to help me stack on weight. That could be my secret weapon against Sasuke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if I want to take advantage of the sale at the ramen store, I really should show up early... even if there's not a huge crowd, I will get to eat more that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Naruto, he thought to himself, looks like you need to make a choice...</span></div></div>",

He looked it the mirror, HE WAS GETTING FATTER! His face got puffier with a new triple chin, His arms and legs were getting fatter, putting strain on his pants and jacket, his manboobs grew larger as his shirt rode up over his now huge, jiggly belly, even his feet pressed against his sandles! The once 190 pound genin was now a wopping 380 pounds of jiggling fat. His cloths didn't fit as well as they used to, showing off his humungous bouncing belly. \"YEAH, BELIEVE IT, I'M THE BIGGEST GENIN IN THE VILLIAGE!\" Naruto declared. The floor boards creeked in agony. \"Hmm, maybe I should use this on Sakura too, so that way Sasuke will weigh the less of all 3 of us!\" Just then his stomach growled. \"Or should I go back to the ramen stand?\" He said rubbinghis exposed belly.</span></div></div>",

Naruto had thrown away his black shirt and orange pants since they had ripped into shreads, so he was only wearing his orange and blue jacket, the first necklace and his green and orange boxers.  Kiab was in his grey and black fur jacket, his brown pants also thrown away, his boxers were red with black streaks.  Chouji wore his green t-shirt and grey boxers which could barely hold in his 800 pound body.  His bandages taken off to give his limbs room to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji smiled as he rubbed his stomach, \"So you guys are finally done huh?\"  Chouji couldn't help but smile at the fact that he won.

That is if you two aren't full.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned, his eyes wide.  He had heard legends of the amount of food the Akamichi Clan had at dinner times.  Naruto stood up and slapped his gigantic stomach gut causing it to ripple, \"Your kidding right!  This belly is like a bottomless pit!! I'M NEVER FULL!!!\"  Naruto placed his fists on his thick hips and had a victorious face on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned to Chouji, not bothering to pull from his chair, \"YEAH SAME HERE!!!\" Kiba said shaking his enourmous gut, \"But I should probably ask my mom first.\"  Kiba lifted himself from the chair and waddeled in the direction of his house, the two following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~30 minutes later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Chouji stood infront of The Inuzuka Clan's house waiting fro Kiba.  Naruto's gut let out a large growl, \"Damn it i'm hungry, whats taking Kiba so long?\"  Naruto turned to see Chouji eating a bag of chips, \"Hey give me some!\"  Naruto said, reaching out for the bag.  He didn't know when but somehow Naruto was on his back and Chouji was sitting on his stomach, munching on the chips.  It was a funny sight seeing the two like that.  Kiba emerged through the front gates and laughed at the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got permission to go and I left Akamaru home so my mom could feed him.\"  Chouji lifted himself up from Naruto's belly and waddeled towards his house, to busy eating chips to say anything.  Naruto had a hard time lifting himself up but was able to reach a nearby statue of a dog and pull himself up.  When the two reached the Akamichi Clan's house they were amazed at how large it was.  It was known to be the fourth biggest building in Konoha.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji, Naruto and Kiba walked inside to see Chouji's father Chouza eating at an enourmous table.  The last time Naruto and Kiba had seen Chouji's dad was at a sleep over a year back.  The two were curious to how much he weighed back then, he was at 496 pounds back then, but due to the recent announcment of the sumo wrestling test he decided to gain weight along with his son.  He turned to the three boys and smiled, lifting himself from the reinforced chairs.  He lumbered towards the three and Naruto and Kiba's eyes grew wide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza's body was gigantic, around 980 pounds.  He had three chins, the biggest breasts the two had ever seen and his stomach which was so wide and large it hung down to the adults knees.  The boxers he was wearing had ripped into shreds and layed on the floor around his seat, luckily his stomach covered his manly parts.  His ass was large enough to fit three chairs and hung pretty low.  He hugged his soon and turned to Naruto and Kiba, \"Hello boys, its nice to see you again, its been awhile.\"  Chouza walked forward and rubbed the thwo gennins starving bellies, \"It seems you two have been putting on weight, thats good.  You'll need it for the exams.\"  Realizing he was naked the older man waddeled to his room to put on a new larger pair of boxers.  Chouji called to his father, \"Hey dad!  Is it ok if Naruto and Kiba have dinner here and spend the night?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouza waddeled from his room wearing a new pair of Akimichi boxers, he tossed the three boys a pair each.  \"If they stay, theyll definitly need those.\"  That being a yes, the four men waddeled into the banquet room and began to eat everything in site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~2 hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table had been completly emptied and the kitchen had run out of food.  Naruto, Chouji, and Kiba all leaned back letting out a large belch each.  Naruto and Kiba took up two chairs  Chouza laughed, \"It seems you three are full, well then i'm off to bed.  Try not to put on to much weight without me you three.\"  Chouza turned the corner and dissapeared from the room.  Kiba's attention was caught when he saw a several skinny servant of the Akimichi's restocking the kitchen.  \"So, you guys never run out of food?\"  The dog asked/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji shook his head, \"We always have a fully stocked kitchen.\"  Naruto and Kiba grinned at the thought, but realized that their boxers had ripped into pieces.  Grabbing the ones Choui's dad gave them, Naruto found it odd how they fit so perfectly.  \"If your wondering about the boxers, they have a seal on them to keep growing with the wearer.\"  Chouji pulled his own on and pointed towards the bathroom, \"Lets check our weight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HECK YES!!!\" Naruto and Kiba yellped together and they waddeled off as fast as they could.  The bathroom was huge, Chouji entered first, \"KIba you go first.\"  Kiba stood on the scale and the numbers on the wall changed from 0 to 705 pounds.  Kiba pumped his arms in happiness causing the fat under his grey sleeves to jiggle.  \"MY TURN, MY TURN!\"  Naruto stepped on the scale, it went from 0 to 704 pounds.  \"Tough break Naruto.\"  Kiba said, a victorious smile on his face.  Chouji stepped on the scale which changed form 0 to 837 pounds.  Chouji was happy to know he was still the fattest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked into the grand living room where three servents had set up an amazing amount of jun food and three king sized beds.  The televsion had the latest Princess Fuun movie on and ready to play.  The three began to eat the junk food set out for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie ended Chouji turned to the other two, \"Hey guys, we should...</span></div></div>",

An excited expression came across Naruto and Kiba's fat faces at the idea. \"Yeah... we barely gained anything from just a meal, right\" Kiba asked, looking mischevious. Naruto and Choji were already moving towards the food, and got a jump start on Kiba. \"Hey, that's no fair you guys\" he exclaimed, rushing over as fast as he could, shoveling the junk food into his mouth.  Just as they started to get low, Choji got up and opened a concealed fridge along the wall, stocked with more food than they'd eaten for dinner and just then combined. Kiba and Naruto's mouths watered, rushing at the fridge, but Choji had already grabbed two armful, which for someone of his size is quite alot, and began to stuff himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Three hours later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, Naruto and Choji held their distended bellies with greed, none of them full yet. They had not only cleared out the fridge Choji had shown them, but nearly half the kitchen.  Choji continued to reach for bags of chips from the cabinate next to him on the floor. Kiba sucked down ribs faster than either of them had ever seen before, and Naruto was busy making a vat of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Two hours later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest was finally over. All of the food in the house had been eaten, and they were as close to full as they were going to get.  \"Okay guys... ready to see who won\" Choji asked, useing the counter to help his enormous self up. He offered both naruto and Kiba his hands, but only Kiba took, while Naruto was helping himself up faster than Choji could have and rushing back to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, of course, got on the scale first.  The read-out went from 0 to 850, a number he was sure assured him victory. As Choji and Kiba entered the room, however, he wasn't so sure. He obviously hadn't gotten the best look at them before he waddled off to the bathroom, as they were both massive! Much more than he, surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba strode onto the scale, trying, to no avail, to hold his belly back and see the read-out.  Choji read it off, \"930!\"  Naruto looked shocked. \"B..but..how\" He exclaimed, holding his head.  Kiba stepped off and let Choji on, who didn't even try to hold back his gut to see the read-out. Naruto covered his eyes, and Kiba read it off. \"1100,\" he exclaimed, \"Amazing, choji!\" He patted his bare belly, none of them wearing anything but the expanding boxers now, the three fat ninja near belly to belly. Choji made a triumphant fist motion upward and exclaimed \"I just can't be beat!\" as he shook his massive belly, rubbing against both Naruto and Kiba on the way back to his bed.  The three lay back down, Naruto looking cross. All three of their bellies spilled out the sides of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning....</span></div></div>",

He made his way over to Chouji and patted his stomach, \"I see you three had fun last night.\"  Chouji lifted himself up as best he could and smiled, \"So did you.\"  he said, poking his dad's bigger stomach, it was obvious that he had also put on weight that night.  Naruto and iba stirred in their sleep, Naruto mumblingsomething about Sakura feeding him ramen and Kiba dreaming about thousands of steaks.  Chouza waddeled over to the two and shook Kiba's belly, \"Wake up you two, its breakfast time.\"  The last two words caused Naruto and Kiba to jump from their beds and move as fast as they could to the banquet room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was filled with nothing but vats of sumo ramen and the ramen man and his daughter Ayame stood there, \"Chouza-san asked us to bring you three this great feast.\"  The man said, Naruto and Kiba rushed over to the tabel.  Naruto's ass took up about three and a half chairs, Kiba's four and Chouji's five and a half.  The three began stuffing themselves like they did last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~three hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three all leaned back happily, their bellies stuffed more then yesterdays.  Chouza slurped the remains of his bowl and set it downm \"Why don't you three go check your weight.\"  They all rushed to the bathroom and Naruto stood on the scale.  The numbers '970' appeared before him, Naruto pointed at Kiba, \"Take THAT dog boy.\"  Kiba stood on the scale and Naruto's eyes grew huge as he saw the results, '1425 lbs.'  Kiba looked and smiled, \"Take what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji stepped on the scale and Kiba read it, \"2...2498 pounds!!!\"  even Chouji couldn't belive it.  He looked down and his belly which sagged past his knees and protruded out far.  Chouza walked in and snapped his fingers, three servents came in and measured around the three bellies.  They stepped back to Chouza and handed him the results.  He smiled, \"Naruto: you weight 970 pounds and have a 88 inch waist.  Kiba: you weight 1425 pounds and have a 138 inch waist.  And Chouji my son, you weigh 2498 pounds and have a 210 inch waist.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them smiled and slammed their guts against each other.

Choji stroked his belly, sucking soda through a straw.  Kiba was busy knawing on an enormous stake, and Naruto was slurping down bowls of ramen right and left.  Chouza walked in, smiling, looking no bigger, as Choji, Kiba, and Naruto had taken all the food for themselves.  The kitchen was suprisingly spotless, as the servents cleaned up any trash as soon as it was left.  \"How are we fairing up here?\" Chouza asked, kneeling down between Choji and Kiba, resting his hand on their bellies.  Choji finished off the soda and asked \"You have any more?\" Chouza chuckled as he shook his head as he said \"I'm afraid you three have cleared us out untill tomorrow!\"  The three looks both proud of themselves and disapointed at the same time.  An idea sparked in Naruto's head, hoping that he may finally beat Kiba, and he waddled off to the bathroom, his belly brushing against the extra-wide door.  He hopped on the scale, causing the floor to shake just as the other two followed him in.  Kiba read off the scale. \"One ton,\" he said, looking unimpressed. Naruto stepped off, looking hopeful. Kiba stepped on as Choji waited in the hall, unable to fit past the door anymore, and Naruto told Kiba his weight.  \"T...two thousand..a..and nine hundred...,\" Naruto exclaimed, shocked.  \"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CHEATING\" he exclaimed, pushing his hands through Kiba's rolls, searching for something concealed that might bring up his weight so much, but found nothing.  Depressed, Naruto and Kiba squeezed their way out of the bathroom, Kiba carrying the scale with him.  He went into the living room and plopped it down on the floor, beconing for Choji to step on.  He did so, and the scale shot up. \"3,700\" Kiba exclaimed, patting Choji on the belly. \"Amazing work, dude! You're going to win for sure,\" Kiba said, leaning up against a wall. \"So.. my dad said this place is all out of food... what do you wanna do now,\" Choji asked, taking a seat on a reinforced couch, his belly touching the floor.  Naruto shouted out \"GO GET MORE OF COURSE! I'M GONNA CATCH UP TO YOU, MARK MY WORDS KIBA!\" \"Well well, aren't you excited,\" Kiba said, \"I guess we should...\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto, Kiba and Chouji waddeled into town, determined to fill their guts.  The first place they came across was a  steak house.  This didn't interest Chouji and Naruto too much but it did KIba so the went in.  The place smelled of cooking meat and this made Kiba's mouth water.  Nobody was there and the buffet was ful of different flavored steaks.  Kiba took aim and began chewing through the tough meat like it was paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~one hour and thirty minutes later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiab leaned back against the wall and belched, causing the ceiling to shake.  Chouji and Naruto only at eaten one booth empty where as Kiba had eaten twelve.  With the place empty of food the three left, a few minutes later the manager came into see the place empty.  Kiba stroked his half full stomach as they wakled through town.  Naruto saw a ramen buffet and ran in, Chouji and Kiba were kinda sick of regular ramen but when they saw Ichiraku wa selling sumo ramen the hurried in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~four hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once full ramen buffet was now empty.  Kiab and Chouji sat there in the booth, their stomachs folding onto the table.  Naruto was sucking down the last of his ramen before letting out a belch.  The three were covered in broth and a few noodles here and there.  They lifted their gigantic selves up and were about to leave when the saw that the buffet had been restocked.  They all looked at each other, grinned and jumped at the oppertunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~seven hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the store was empty and the three were full.  They were sitting in a circle and were about ten feet from each other but there bellies were smooched together.  They left and went to the next place, the one that interested Chouji the most, the ice cream buffet.  The three entered and began eating everything greedily scrafing down as mmuch of the frozen delights as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~five hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto layed on the floor, asleep and full.  Kiba was sitting against the hot fudge machine, letting the warm goo fall into his mouth, filling and warming cold fat body.  Chouji was eating gallons and gallons of ice cream.  He would finish one in about ten secodns and moved onto the next.  All three were covered in ice cream and extremly happy.  Chouji threw the last craton to the floor and licked away the ice cream on his lipds and stomach.  Kiba continued eating the hot fudge while rubbing his gut and Naruto had woken up and was using the whipped cream machine like how Kiba was using the hot fudge.  Chouji waddeled over to the caramel machine and began to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~three hours later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machines finally stopped running and the three sat there licking hot fudge, whipped cream and caramel from their gigantic bodies.  Kiba looked to the others, \"You guys still hungry?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!!!!\"</span></div></div>",

As they got there, the waiters started to motion them all towards the same room. \"Uh, hey, sorry, but can we each have our own room,\" Kiba asked.  The waiter looked dumbstruck, but took them each to their own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach room was stocked full of buffet tables of all different kinda of food.

Suddenly the door to the room opened and was shocked to see it was a jonin from the villiage, Asuma.  The bearded man had his trademark cigarette in his mouth, it was lit as always.

Kiba slid the door open to see that his joke wasn't a joke anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was laying there on the floor asleep, his face in a bowl of mashed potatoes that he hadn't finished.  Kiba and Chouji did their best to keep themselves from laughing at the blonde.  Chouji walked over and poked the side of Naruto's fat gut, feeling to see how full he was, \"You've gotta be kidding me?!\"  \"What?\" Kiba and Asuma both said at the same time.  Chouji looked over to them, \"He could have only eaten about a one-fourth of the food in here before passing out.\"  Kiba laughed, \"What a lightweight!  I could have easily eat three times whats in here!\" he said slapping his gut in pride.  \"We should have ditched him!\" and thats when Kiba got an idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish smirk spread across his fat face, \"Hey Chouji... Naruto barely ate anything in here right?\"  \"Yeah why?\" Chouji asked.  Kiba stepped towards one of the twenty tables, \"Well, we need to get fatter to win this sumo round in the exams...RIght?  So, how about a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji looked puzzeled, \"A challenge?  What kinda challenge?\"  Kiba looked around, \"Simple.  You and I eat all the food in here before Naruto wakes up.  Theres no prize at the end, just the satisfaction of having eaten all of our friends food.\"  Chouji smiled, \"Your evil Kiba.\"  Kiba put his hands on his hips, \"And DAMN proud of it!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji looked over to Asuma, \"Sensei, would you tell us if Naruto wakes up?\"  Asuma had flipped Naruto over onto his back and was using the blonde genin's 4,000 pound gut as a headrest.  His arms were behind his head and he had taken off his shirt and unbuttoned his jeans, allowing his masisve boulder of fat to flow from its confinds.  He took another drag from his cigarette before looking at the two, \"Sure just save four of five tables for me as a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Chouji smiled when they heard him say that.  Their gigantic stomachs shook and growled in unison like two hungry beasts about to attack their prey.  They moved as fast as they could to devoure everything in their paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji started eating the fattest food there.  Not a piece of pepperoni pizza or a crumb of a chocolate chocolate chip cookie was spared as the 4,523 pound teen ate.  Unfortunatly for him, Kiba was getting more food into his 4,924 pound belly then Chouji was.  His gigantic arms placing just about everything into his compactor of a mouth at once.  If Kiba was paying attention to what he was doing he would have noticed that he had eaten a few chicken bones and napkins while he sucked everything into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma threw his burnt out cigarette into the trash and had already finished the five tables of food that Kiba and Chouji had saved him.  He decided to take a nap, surprised that Naruto's gut was an incredibly soft pillow.  Chouji and Kiba continued to guzzle down everything in their sight as the Jonin slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~One hour later~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Chouji layed there back to back, patting their guts as they looked around the room, trying to find even one scrap of food they might have missed.  Kiba sighed as he stroked his fat.  His belly let out the same growl as before, obviously wanting more food.  Chouji's did the same, \"There, there little one,\" Chouji said to his fat, \"I'll find you more food.  Kiba this sucks...\"  Kiba sighed, \"Tell me about it.  My bellys not even fifteen percent full.  We need to find more food, quickly!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted in his sleep as he lifted his head, which had been cleaned off by Kiba and Chouji as they ate.  He felt a slight pressure of his flab and looked to the side, \"Asuma-sensei?  Why are you sleeping on my fat?\"  Asuma laughed, \"I needed a place to rest my head and you were passed out so I thought...why not?\"  Naruto shrugged it off and turned his attention to Kiba and Chouji, \"You guys are huge!!  How much did you two eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled, \"We ate everything in both of out rooms, and what you left behind in here.\"  Naruto looked shocked, \"WHAT?!  I WAS GONNA EAT ALL OF THAT!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji laughed, \"To late now.\"  Naruto growled at them as Asuma helped him up.  Kiba used Chouji as a lift before pulling him up.  Asuma pushed his now larger gut into his shirt and buttoned it up along with his pants, \"So...you guys ready to find out why I'm hear.\"  The three shook their heads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma smiled, \"I'm here by order of The Third Hokage...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be back in a month to check you out of here so you can move on to the next stage, though it won't be ready untill then,\" he exclaimed, leaving the room shortly after they all said their goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. Choji, I know Naruto hasn't gotten any bigger, but you and I sure have... let's check out if the scale here can handle us,\" Kiba exclaimed, much to Naruto's dismay, as they both went off to the wide-framed bathroom, stepping onto the scale and reading off each other's weights.  Kiba helped  Choji first as he got himself up onto the scale, reading it off as \"five thousand, six hundred pounds! Nice going, Choji,\" though Kiba felt sure he must still be bigger.  He got up onto the scale and Choji read off his weight aloud \"five thousand and two hundred.  Aww, guess you fell back behind, huh, Kiba,\" Choji asked smugly, rubbing his belly, which was already beginning to growl again. Kiba tried to take it well, knowing that he would have another chance.  Naruto headed into the bathroom excitedly.  \"So what'll it be? Should we go hit the pool first and go swimming, where they'll bring us food, or should we go for the food court,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiba smiled, \"Then the pool it is!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three had split up and headed to their rooms.  Naruto pushed through his door and was surprised to see his room.  The bed was huge with a flat-screen T.V. infront of it.  There were multiple tables full of bags, bowls, boxes, and cases of sugar filled, high calorie snacks, but, that wasn't what he was most interested in.  The gigantic bowl of sumo Ramen that took up half of the room was sitting there waiting to be eaten.  Naruto stepped over to the bowl, drooling, and picked up the note that was attatched to it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>Naruto,  I felt alittle bad that your falling behind in your weight.  While Chouji and Kiba were eating all of your food, I had a waitress call up Ichiraku and have them whip this up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Enjoy, and happy gaining.<br>\r\n          ~Asuma</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had a huge smirk across his face and jumped into the vat of Ramen, eating as quickly as possible so that he could get bigger then Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Fourty Minutes Later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was floating in the water of the crystal pool, his red and black swim trunks were surprisingly comfortable and he was enjoying this.  It was around sunset and the pool was lit by many strunk lanterns and tiki torches.  The waiters were cooking up a buffett made for a king(or three extremly fat genin) as Chouji was laying on a titanium reinforced lawnchair getting a back massage from a very pretty waitress.  Kiba looked up, \"Hey Chouji, where do you think Naruto is?\"  Chouji shrugged as the massager worked on his back, her hands sinking into his back fat with every massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stepped out in a pair of orange and blue swim trunks, only there was one difference.

Choji slid into the pool between Naruto and Kiba, making the water in the pool spill out over the sides, leaning back on his elbows, watching with a watery mouth as the waiters brought the food right to them, perhaps even ready to feed it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady, guys?

Naruto could only look, and say, \"How could you eat more then me?!\" Choji only shook his fat head, and got on the scale, for it to read, \"6972.\" 'YES!\" he said, pumping his fist in the air in victory. \"I'm still bigger then the both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the obese ninjas went back over to the pool, when Choji got a brilliant idea. \"Guys!\" he said, \"I think I have an idea that you two would like!\" \"Let's hear it,\" Naruto said. \"Come on! I'll show you!\" Choji said, waddling down a different hallway. Kiba and Naruto looked at each other, shrugged, and waddled over to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed Choji over to a HUGE swimming pool. It looked big enough to hold 5 dozen olympic-sized pools. Kiba and Naruto looked over at Choji, and asked simultaneously, \"What're we doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji told them, \"Okay, listen to this. Imagine if this pool, instead of water, was filled up to the top with sumo ramen!\" \"Where are you getting with this?\" Naruto asked. \"Well,\" Choji replied, \"We could dive in and eat the whole pool-full!\" \"AWESOME!\" Kiba exclaimed, \"Can we do that?\" Choji said, \"Well, this is a gaining hotel, right?

The gigantic pool, once filled with ramen, was now completely baren. Any ramen that was once in the pool was now in the huge stomachs of the three blobby ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the most amazing sight of all was the ninjas themselves. Each of them was huge enough to fill up the pool that they were in before. Their gigantic stomachs were now perfectly round from being stuffed to the brim with ramen, and would have to be picked up if the ninjas had any hope of staying mobile. With how huge that the three of them were, it was a miracle that their swimming trunks stayed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started to haul themselves up to see how much they weighed, all three of their stomachs gurgled, and they all gave a great, big, \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!\" The force of the group belch was so strong, it shook the windows, peeled paint off the wallpaper, and jiggled their immense forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lasted for a good 30 seconds before they stopped. When it was over, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto all laughed as hard as they could. \"My god!\" Naruto said inbetween chortles, \"That was a huge one!\" \"Yeah,\" Kiba managed to giggle out, \"I guess it was!\" \"Come on guys,\" Choji said, guffawing like there was no tomorrow, \"Let's go check our weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid 15 minutes of trying to go through the hallways without their huge bodies bumping into anything, they finally got to the scale, which could even hold up THEIR enormous girths. Naruto was first to get on, and the scale read, \"10,534 pounds.\" \"WHOA!\" Naruto exclaimed, taken aback by his gain, \"Beat that, dog-boy!\" Kiba got on the scale next, which read, \"10,534 pounds.\" \"Hey,\" he said, \"We tied!\" \"Awww,\" Naruto whined, \"I wanted to beat you again.\" Choji got on the scale last, and it read, \"10, 534 pounds.\" \"We all tied,\" Choji said, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them started to waddle over to the buffet to resolve this situation, when a wave of pain went over all three of their bellies. \"Ugh,\" Naruto groaned, clutching his gigantic gut, \"Too full...\" \"I can't eat anymore,\" Kiba said, rubbing his stomach with both hands. \"What do we do now guys?\" Choji asked, massaging his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them thought about it for a second, and Naruto said...</span></div></div>",

This could go on for a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*20 minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud belchs erupted from the two. Sasuke's side of the table had about 23 empty bowls and Naruto's had about 25. If they were big before, they were even bigger now. Their arms and legs were so chubby, that their shirts (or jacket in Naruto's case) and pants were ready to rip and snap any moment. They had like three chins and very plumped up cheeks. And finally, they're bellies had gotten ENORMOUS. And as proof that they had gotten heavier, their seats suddenly broke with a loud 'CLUNK', making them fall on ther huge butts. Now, they were just groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugggggh... Can't... let... the dobe..... win...' Thought Sasuke with a sleepy look, his hands resting on his huge abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'*Groan* Did I.... win yet?' Thought Naruto, his hand rubbing his huge stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was about to lift another bowl, but then he dropped it. Next he led out a giant belch, and fell backwards, his hands rubbing his overgrown belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as a sign of forfeit, Kakashi walked over to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like the winner is Naruto.\" Said Kakashi, with a somewhat proud tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and shot his arms into the air, which caused his arms' fat to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOOHOO!!!! I *BUUUUUUUURP* did it!!\" Cheered Naruto, falling backwards as he burped. Sakura looked amazed; she never thought Sasuke would lose. Suddenly, an idea sparked inside her head. And idea that would help her and her team gain all the weight they needed to win the sumo matches. Slowly, Sakure waddled over to her two overstuffed teammates and helped them stand up. (Which took a lot of work.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, I just remembered; I know someone who can help us with our training!\" Said Sakura excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught both Naruto and Sasuke's attention.

Let alone weight gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get going.\" Smiled Sakura as she began to waddle towards the exit door. She got stuck at first due to her overweight body, but got out with little effort. Of course, since Naruto and Sasuke had just pigged out big time, they had a lot of trouble going through. Eventually, they broke the wall surrounding the door and fell out. They got up (with help from Sakura) and began to waddle through the streets of Konoha. As for Kakashi, he had to stay behind and pay for the broken door. The three super obese genin continued their march towards their new destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A few minutes of walking later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pant* *Pant* *Pant* Come oooooooon. Are we there yet?!\" Whined Naruto feeling out of breath. After all, walking in an overweight body for miles can really have its toll. Sasuke was sweating so much that his blue shirt was wetting through the armpit sides, but he showed no signs of tiredness. Sakura was also panting a bit, but kept a determined look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're....*pant*...almost.....there....\" Replied Sakura still going forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke then looked around where they were. They were in a part of the village that they had never gone before. Their thoughts were interrupted when they bumped into Sakura's fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" Sakura said with a big smile on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke looked up and their jaws fell in awe. Right infront of them was possibly the biggest mansion with a tower that was as big as the hokage tower. Right infront of them were two gate doors that looked like were made for the biggest, most overweight people in the village. The giant gates slowly opened, and inside was a giant and long hall. Sakura began to walk in. Naruto and Sasuke followed afterwards, the gates closing behind them. They walked (with Naruto and Sasuke looking around) for what seemed like more minutes. They finally approached another pair of doors at the end of the hall. Sakura stood forward and knocked on the door three times with her pudgey fist. The doors suddenly opened in a flash, as if a very powerful wind had blown them open. The three obese genin (Naruto and Sasuke staring in amazement) walked into the office-looking room, the doors closing as soon as they stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAAA!!!! IS THIS PLACE RUNNED BY GHOSTS OR SOMETHING?!?!\" Screamed Naruto in a terrified, comical manner, his shaking causing his body fat to jiggle with vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to scream in a person's private quarters, kid....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke stiffened at the deep, baritone voice that sounded ALMOST exactly like Itachi's voice, only more darker. (Think of Mephiles The Dark from Sonic The Hedgehog.) They looked ahead to see someone sitting in a very comfy-looking chair behind a desk, the person's image covered by the newspaper he was reading. Naruto stared nervously, while Sasuke stared without fear. Sakura stepped forward with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Zoharu-senpai!\" Sakura said as if she knew the person from child hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?! YOU KNOW THIS GUY, SAKURA?!?!\" Cried out Naruto in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figuer known as Zoharu suddenly closed his newspaper with all his might, which caused the lights to go out for a brief second. Then, an airwave suddenly knocked Naruto back. As soon as Naruto's back hit the floor, he yelped in surprise, his whole fat body jiggling wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that it's rude to scream in someone's private quarters, kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was struggling to pull himself up. After a while of struggling, Sasuke and Sakura finally helped Naruto stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. It seems you kids are participating in the Sumo event of the exams..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Sasuke, and Sakura stared at the person sitting behind the desk. Naruto and Sasuke were amazed and surprised big time. Right infront of them, was a teenager who looked to be about 17-18 years old, and was gothic looking; he wore a black, unzipped tight jacket with red linings, a black shirt with the symbol of death on the front, black fingerless gloves, black pants with red linings too, and black, reddish boots which, unlike other ninja shoes or sandals, did not expose his toes on the front. He had silverly, dark purplelish hair which reached the back of his neck. And the most interesting facts; he had blood red eyes like Kurenai, only with slitted pupils. And he had a super ANOREXIC build. But he still had muscles showing. Naruto stared in utter awe, but Sasuke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. This bag of skin and bones is supposed to be our trainer? What a waste of ti-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoharu instantly appeared before the obese Uchiha and poked him on the huge belly. Sasuke suddenly saw his stomach expand a little, then he was floating in the air. Then, he fell to the floor face down, the whole mansion shaking upon impact and making Naruto, Sakura, and Zoharu jump about four feet into the air. Naruto looked shocked and amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOAA!! That was so......COOL!! How'd you do it?! What kind of jutsu?! Can you teach m-\" Zoharu cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, this is the third time I tell you to lower the volume of your tone. Second, I'm a telekinetic, I don't rely that often on jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura waddled over towards Sasuke and help him stand up. She then turned towards Zoharu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you already know why we're here, Zoharu-senpai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoharu sighed and looked at the three fat ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never have believed that the sumo matches would begin this year. Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand to the side of his head and cracked his neck a few times, causing the overweight genin to wince. Zoharu looked at them straight, and they started feeling nervous as an eerie and creepy atmosphere formed around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, how should I blow you kids up?\" Zoharu said, sounding like the most sadistic person ever alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Sakura, and even Sasuke gulped. They were in for some serious weight gaining training now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoharu finally chose his method. He chose to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the room around the three obese ninja and anorexic instructor changed; the room got bigger with more space and the desk in the middle turned into a VERY long table filled with almost all types of food imaginable. However, they noticed that it didn't have healthy foods such as fruits or vegetables. There were sweets, meat, soups, ramen, all kinds of food that would make the human body gain a lot of pounds in just one sitting. Naruto and Sakura stared wide-eyed with drooling mouths, and Sasuke had a somewhat determined look. Zoharu suddenly clapped his hands together to get their attention. It only got Sasuke's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turkeys stuff yourselves like tomorrow is the end of the world. We'll move on to the next stage depending on how much you've gained by then. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some matters to attend to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Zoharu vanished in a blur, leaving the three overweight ninja alone with the miles-long table and buffet. Suddenly, Naruto jumped onto the table and started stuffing whatever he could grab into his mouth. Sakura soon followed. Sasuke simply walked calmly to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meanwhile*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructors of the Rookie Nine were at a private hang-out relaxing; Kakashi reading his orange book, Asuma enjoying a cigarette, and Kurenai sitting next to Asuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, Shikamaru dropped from the exam, Choji already qualifies, and Ino seems to be getting into it.\" Asuma said, explaining his team's progress on the sumo event. Kurenai closed her eyes and sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My squad is neutral about it. I'm thinking of not entering them if this keeps up.\" Said Kurenai, a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that reminds me. Kurenai, my squad is currently being trained by a certain someone you're close to.\" Kakashi said without glancing from his book. Kurenai looked at him confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By someone I'm close to? What do yo-\" The doors opened quickly, a figuer stepped in, and the doors closed automatically. Asuma and Kurenai looked up and were shocked at who they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about me?\" Asked Zoharu in a quiet tone. Kurenai got up from the sofa and stood infront of him, looking at him wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoharu? Is it really you?\" Kurenai asked, nearly on the brink of tears. Zoharu sighed and tilted his head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you for two years and you're not gonna embrace me, Onee-sama? I'm crushed.\" Zoharu said with a small smile. Kurenai gasped and instanly warped her arms around her younger brother, whom returned the embrace slowly. After a few moments of silence, Kakashi cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I'd hate to break the heart-warming moment, but I'd like to know how my squad is doing, Zoharu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai and Zoharu sat on the sofa. Then, Zoharu pulled out a watch from his pocket and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.... it's been about 10 minutes since I left them. If they're eating in the manner I think they are, then they should be done right about.................now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was an echoing sound that sounded close to a belch from afar. Zoharu sighed and put the watch away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's my cue.\" Said Zoharu, vanishing as soon as he bid his older sister goodbye for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*With the weight gaining ninja*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they were BIG before, they are HUGE plus GIGANTIC now. Groaning and burps could be heard from the dining room the ninja were in. Interestingly, their clothes were not ripped out. Infact, their shirts and pants (and jacket in Naruto's case) seemed to be growing with their bodies so that they wouldn't get 'exposed'. The bellies were still showing though. They also had about 6 or 7 chins and super-mega plump faces. Naruto and Sasuke looked to be about 760 lbs and Sakura about 730 lbs. Without a doubt, the three looked like sumo wrestlers already. SUPER Sumos, even. Right now they were lying down on their backs, hands rubbing their overgrown bellies. Another combo of burps and belchs erupted from the three genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghhhhh...... soooo......*BUUUURP*.......full.....\" Groaned Naruto, rubbing and patting his stomach in ectasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooh..... I feel like I'm gonna blow.......*BUUUURP*\" Came the reply of Sakura, who was also rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke didn't say anything. He just rubbed his overgrown gut with one hand and looked like he could fall asleep any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their legs started to rumble, causing their fat to jiggle and vibrate wildly. Then, without warning, a loud ripping sound insued as their feet suddenly broke through their ninja sandals, destroying them completely(The wrappings around Sasuke's ankles broke as well) and exposing their overgrown fat soles. In other words, the sumo fat ninja were also now barefooted. Naruto groan in ectasy and twinkled his fat toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhh... that feels sooooooo *BUUUUUURP* good....\" Naruto smiled. Sakura soon followed in his actons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeaaaaaaah.... my feet were getting so *BUUUURP* tight....\" Sakura then closed her eyes and began to drift off. That is, until the doors suddenly slammed open, the lights went out, and the metal sound of a kunai being drawn was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYBODY FREEZE, THIS IS A BUST!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura screamed, their sleepy feeling disappearing altogether. The three ninja tried to stand up but due to their humongous size, they were completely helpless. The figuer took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAHHH!!! W-W-W-W-WAIT!!!!! IT'S NOT *BUUUUURP* FAIR!!! WE'RE JUST BLOBS OF FAT AND YOU'RE A SKINNY KILLER WITH A KUNAI!!! PLEASE DON'T *BUUUURP* KILL US!!!!\" Wailed Sakura, completely terrified like she's never been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-YEAH!! THAT'S *BUUURP* RIGHT! IT'S A COWARD'S TACTIC!! I'M NOT EVEN HOKAGE YET!!!\" Cried ou Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it all!! I'm so helpless in this state!!' Cursed Sasuke in his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then....\" The figuer whispered and vanished. This caused Sasuke to try and get up in a more frantic way, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, WHERE'D HE GO?!?\" Cried out Naruto in fear. Sakura trembled as though she were freezing to death, which caused her whole body fat to jiggle as well. She then yelped as she felt two solid boots step on top of her giant abdomen. The top of her plump face turned blue as she saw the shadowy figuers red eyes staring at her. In a flash, the lights went back on. Naruto and Sasuke turned their heads and saw.... the anorexic figuer of Zoharu standing on top of Sakura's giant stomach. There was silence for five full minutes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Z-Zoharu-senpai? I-Is that y-y-y-you?\" Whimpered Sakura, completely scared out of her wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Yo.....\" Zoharu whispered. A vein popped out of Naruto's head and he tried to stand up to strangle Zoharu, but all he could do was wiggle on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE (Bleep) MAN!!! YOU ALMOST GAVE US ALL A (Bleep) DAMN HEART ATTACK YOU *BUUUURP*!!!! WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I'LL-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoharu's eyes flashed red for a brief second in Naruto's direction. Naruto lost all his color and quickly shut his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, swear in my face again and I'll make you so fat, your heart will explode....\" Zoharu hissed with venom in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked like he was going to wet himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, have you noticed that your clothes, other than your shoes, haven't ripped themsevles when they should?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. It feels like our clothes are growing a little...\" Sakura admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because when I made contact with Sasuke an hour ago,  actually affected all three of you at the same time. I casted a jutsu with my telekinesis to affect your clothes, that way you won't be stripped down to your birthday suits if you out-grow them.\" Explained Zoharu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true, then what about our shoes?\" Questioned Sasuke, motioning to Naruto's, Sakura's, and his own barefeet. Zoharu looked down at Sakura's plump face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......fan service......\" He muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura perked up. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because shoes aren't strechable, aren't they?\" Zoharu replied. \"Anyway, let's put all that behind us. It's time to-\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hinata was steadily becoming nervous about the entire ordeal.  The idea of intentionally getting fatter was an entirely foreign concept to the young girl.  Hinata had put herself on a strict diet soely to appeal to her crush of one hyperactive orange idiot.  Despite all of the harsh diets, she had hardly gained his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I gain weight, he'll ignore me even more.' sadly thought the poor girl as she made her way down the lower district.  With her head low, she accidentally bumped into an unknown figure.  The young Hyuuga felt herself falling towards the ground when she felt two firm arms catching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Hinata!\" exclaimed Naruto as he quickly caught her.  The girl felt herself becoming flush as she was thrusted into an akward embrace by the very one she held close feelings for.  Naruto quickly released the embrace, yet he still held onto her shoulders loosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, are you alright?!\" worrily asked the fox-boy.  He hadn't meaned to almost hurt his friend.  He was still quite worried ad het face was a bit red and she had yet to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Im fine.  I'm really sorry for bumping into you like that.\" said the girl as she looked away from her object of affection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not your fault.  It's totally mine.  I should have watched where I was going.\" hastilly replied the boy.  Naruto hated this little habit of hers.  The young girl would always apoligize for things that were simply not her fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" was all that was said by the girl's soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know it's kinda late, but would you want to go get some ramen with me?  Y'know to make up for this whole little mess.\" said the boy in a cheerful tone.  He knew that ramen would definently raise her spirits.  After hearing his offer, the shy heiress went into a bit of shock.  She looked up to the boy with a soft, cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, I would like that.\" quietly responded Hinata.  The fox-boy felt himself grow extremly happy and gave his shorter friend a quick hug.  Red-faced and her heart skipping a few beats, Hinata returned the friendly embrace.

She had ACTUALLY gone out with Naruto (and at one point had a ramen eating contest [of course he won.]). She hopped up with glee, but had found it was somewhat difficult. She looked down at her belly to see that a small strip of creamy white skin was revealed. Hinata poked her slightly squishy belly and almost collapsed out of seeing herself not the skinny girl she usually is. She checked her weight and saw that she was 16.4 pounds heavier than two days ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do she got dressed. None of her old shirts would fit her, except the XL shirt that she got at the previous festival. It was still large on her and it went down to her knees, but she could wear leggings.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, Hina-chan.\" said a feminine voice behind Hinata.  She turned around with her mouth filled with a cinnamon bun and sweet frosting covering her face.  Hinata saw her friend Ino who called out to her and Chouji.  However Hinata noted something really different about them.  The two friends seemed a tad bit \"fuller-looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her usual garb of her purple ninja shirt and standard purple mini-skirt, she was currently wearing a plain white t-shirt and grey sweats.  The Hyuuga-girl noted to herself that the blond haired girl looked as she had added an extra 40 pounds to her figure.  Ino's formely lithe stomach had been covered in a layer of jiggling fat.  Her fatty gut poked out from under her shirt and caused it to ride up a bit.  Her breasts had gone up a cup size and rested on her bulbous belly.  The girl's formerly lean and long legs were enveloped in a heavy layer of softness.  She had now attained a pair of thunder thighs that stretched her sweat pants across each meaty leg.  Though Hinata could not see it, Ino's bum had lost all tone and absorbed a great deal of her increased fat.  Each cheek grew round and soft.  Even Ino herself noticed that her butt would now jiggle with each of the girl's heavy steps.  Ino's rounded face smiled at the sight of her friend.  The blue-haired girl even noted that even the fat on the other girl's face jiggled.  Hinata had also noticed the normally chubby Chouji had looked like he had packed on a great deal of weight too.  He now sported a gut even large than Ino's and was larger in all of his other areas.  Fattened limbs, a greatly fattened face and tighter clothes were now new parts to his characteristics.  Both of the genin looked like they had just eaten by the look of their distended bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah, hello I-Ino-chan, Chouji-kun.\" greeted Hinata in her normally timid voice.  Ino simply laughed at the girl's shyness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hinata, looks like you're feeding yourself well.\" teased Ino as she went over to Hinata and the girl's pudgy stomach.  Hinata immediatly blushed.  \"Relax, you're not the only one who's been pigging out lately.\" stated Ino with a frown as she jiggled her own belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's been great!  Everyone's been getting so fat, now Im not the only one anymore!\" exclaimed Chouji with happiness as he began to snack on a bag of chips he pulled from a plastic bag.  Ino pulled a few chips from his bag as well and began to munch of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid test, it's totally ruining my figure.\" complained the vain girl as she quickly finished her snack.  Feeling a bit of pressure coming from her belly, she lowered her sweats a bit to allow her belly to surge further out.  \"Ah, that's much better.\" sighed Ino.  \"Anyway, I saw you and Naruto together last night.  Did anything exciting happen?\" asked Ino.  Her gossiping habit was getting the best of her and she needed to know if anything juicy happened between the two teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ano, nothing h-happend.  We just went out for ramen and he walked me h-home.\" quickly replied Hinata as her face exploded with a shade of deep red.  The embarassed girl convientenly forgot to mention how they hugged tightly when they bid each other goodbye.  She could still remember how warm his hold was and his distinct smell.  Her thoughts began to drift and she had a soft smile on her precious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, earth to Hinata.\" said Ino as she waved her hand in front of the other girl's face.  Hinata quickly recovered from her stupor.  \"A-Ah, sorry,  I was just thinking of something.\" replied Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that look on your face before tells me that something did happend last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, nothing happened, nothing at all!\" exclaimed the girl.  She was beginning to reach her embarassment limit and anymore she would pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I believe you.  I was just teasing you a bit there.\" said Ino as she smiled brightly to her friend.  \"Well, me and Chouji should go.  We gotta go meet Asuma-sensei for a meeting bye.\" The blond girl gave Hinata a quick hug.  Chouji simply waved at the girl and walked away with his teamate.  Hinata remained at the same spot wondering how embarassing the whole situation was.  Hearing her stomach growl loudly, she thought it was best to get a bite too eat.  She needed to keep her weight up after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\Later//<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was so good.\" moaned a visably full Hinata as she left the restaurant she had eaten at.  He belly was swollen and was a bit hard to the touch.  The girl gently rubbed it as she walked down the streets of Konoha. It was still around Noon and Hinata had a hard time trying to figure out what to do next. Due to preparing for the new exams, training had been postponed for each entrant for gaining purposes.  She had no idea what to do with all that free time!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what Naruto-kun is doing right now.' thought the girl to herself.  She couldn't help of always having the fox-boy in her thoughts after that wonderful night.  The girl then sighed.  'I need to stop thinking like that.  He was just being friendly, he doesn't share my feelings.' sadly thought the girl.  Suddenly the girl felt two arms from behind her wrapping around her bloated midsection.  She felt herself being pulled into a kind embrace.  The shocked girl looked down at the arms and noticed that the person hugging her and rubbing her swollen gut had orange sleeves.  'O-Orange sleeves?!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata-chan.\" softly whispered Naruto into the smaller girl's ear.  Hinata felt shivers going down her entire body.  She felt as if electricity itself was coursing through her figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto-kun.\" was all the girl said.  At that moment nothing mattered to her except the very boy holding her in such a caring gesture.  She leaned into his embrace, closed her eyes and sighed contently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've been enjoying yourself lately.\" said the boy as he softly rubbed her pale tummy.  The girl's face lit up with a soft blush but she remained silent.  The two remained like this for a few more moments. Hinata felt as if her very heart would explode form her body at any moment.  This all felt like a dream to the blushing girl and she prayed that it was all real.  Naruto soon released his hold on the girl.  Hinata slowly opened her eyes and turned to look toward her object of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Hinata-chan,\" began the orange clad boy, \"last night was really amazing.  And I just couldn't stop thinking of you since then.\"  He then noticed the girl's beautiful violet eyes.  He noticed as if they shining with hope themselves.  The boy stopped hesitating and took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is that would you want to be together?  Y'know, like a couple.\" The boy felt his heart going crazy. He had faced insane ninjas, all kinds of thugs and even the wrath of the Hokage herself, but he had never felt as nervous as he did now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun, do you really mean that.\" softly said his younger friend. Her eyes were fixated on the ground.  She couldn't help but focus on something other than the very boy who had confessed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Hinata-chan.  I wouldn't lie to you like that.\" stated the boy as he gently cupped her slightly full face and raised it up to look towards her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" sliently replied the girl.  \"Yes! Yes! I want to be with you Naruto-kun!\" Without warning she glomped the unsuspecting boy and drove both of them to the ground.  Naruro laughed with happiness and hugged the girl tightly.  He felt all of the weight of the girl's full belly on his own stomach and the girl nuzzling her face into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto-kun...' was the only thought in the girl's mind.  She was glad that she had been wrong...         </span></div></div>",

Seriously, I don't care about this whole \"new exam\" thing, but atleast you have Chouji to help you.\" Ino had to admit, Shikamaru had a very good point, \"Ok, whatever, I'll do it.\" Ino admitted her defeat.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finding out that she needed to gain weight for this exam, Ino figured her first course of action would be eating large amounts of food as quickly as she could. She figured her first stop should be Ramen Ichiraku, something cheap that she could stuff herself with was exactly what she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this challenge, it' gonna completely ruin my figure, but if I pass it and can choose Sasuke to work with me it'll all be worth it\" thought Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ino walked into the ramen shop she noticed it was particularly empty today. \"Guess I lucked out. No one will have to see my make a pig of myself\".<br>\r\nShe took a seat at the counter and ordered a typical chicken ramen to start things out. Although one would think someone as vein as Ino wouldn't enjoy food all that much, but she actually did enjoy eating good food and Ichiraku Ramen had some great stuff. \"Maybe this won't be so bad after all, if it means I can eat like this all the time\" Ino thought happily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off the 1st bowl of ramen, this is the normal point where Ino would have stopped eating but she needed to pack on the pounds if she wanted to compete in these sumo exams. \"Might as well order two bowls at once this time, I'm gonna be here for a while anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the 2nd bowl Ino could tell she was starting to reach her limit. \"Ugh who knew ramen could be so filling. But I gotta keep eating.\" She finished off the 2nd bowl of ramen quickly and set the bowl down with a loud thud. Leaning back in her seat and rubbing her stuffed belly, she prepared herself for what would surely be way too much food. Although it took much longer than the first two bowls, she finished off her third bowl of ramen in what she considered her first successful stuffing session, ending it with a rather loud belch. \"Oh boy I thought I may have way over done it for my first time\". Before getting out of her seat to head back home, Ino made sure to unbuckle her headband from her waist to make as much room as possible to digest all that ramen. As she did so her belly surged just a little further out, appreciating the extra space she made. Now she just had to make the trip back home and take a nice relaxing nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made it back to her room, she flopped down on her bed almost immediately. Still overly stuffed with ramen, her belly wobbled with the sudden movement she made, causing another loud belch to come from her lips. \"Ugh man I'm so full! I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to keep up with an eating regimen like this...\"</span></div></div>",

Garra stared emotionlessly into the blank wall of their hideout, pondering. Temari sighed out loud, \"And to think,\" she said, \"I have to give up my perfect figure for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Baki insisted. \"What?!? *sigh* fine.\" Temari had no choice. \"Kankuro, what about you?\" Kankuro sat up. \"Well, If it'll make Temari feel better, I'll do it.\" \"Good.
