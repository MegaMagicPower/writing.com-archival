The molten giant she had been fighting during the raid had sent her flying into the wall and cracked her equipment. Her raid leader wasn't too happy, her being one of the tanks in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid giants,\" she cursed. \"Stupid Alfas. Damn night elf has an advantage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga was a dwarf warrior, and a short one at that. Her fiery red hair was done up in two long braids, keeping it out of her way while she fought. She was well geared, with the best plate equipment her money could buy for the raids in Molten Core. But, for some reason, every time she tried to tank she would get sent flying by the larger creatures in the lava-filled caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Helga,\" said the human mage leader of her raid, Valonos. \"Oof. Heavy repair bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those giants are going to be the death of me,\" Helga sighed as she dropped her anvil's hammer to ground. \"Sometimes it sucks being a dwarf, Valonos. I'm a pint-sized ball of metal that the monsters can knock around like a toy ball. You don't see Alfas having any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage chuckled and leaned on his staff. \"True. You are quite short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks fer noticing...\" Helga let a little bit of her accent slip out. \"By the ancestors, I wish I was just a little bigger. Maybe then I can actually do my job in the raid as a tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're looking for some help in that department, you can always try the guild alchemist...Or maybe I can assist in that. There's also that creepy warlock fellow, Dagon, if you want something risky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga decided to...</span></div></div>",

Near the underground lake was where the shadier sort of people lingered, namely the rogues and warlocks. Helga kept to her torch as she wandered along the decrepit houses, looking for the apartment that belonged to the new guild warlock, Dagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found it at last and shuffled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asked a human in the back of the hovel with a black cloak and fel aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dagon Darkheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to know?\" the warlock looked up, revealing his missing eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Helga. Helga the Heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. You're the tank who kept getting sent flying in last night's raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga crossed her arms and grunted. \"Thanks fer noticing. I'm actually here about a solution to that problem. Can't tank if I can't keep my feet on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too true. It's hard enough keeping track of curses, let alone have to deal with an angry giant when he should be attacking you. But what can I as a humble servant of darkness do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I need you to inbiggin me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inbiggin you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me bigger. Taller. Weighter. I don't care what, but I need more mass if I'm going to tank for our raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. True,\" the warlock tapped his chin in thought. \"I think I have just the things. Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led her to the back of his room, where there was a black chest. He leaned over and produced two objects that emitted their own sinister air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he held up a necklace with a large red gem. \"Is the Amulet of Absorption. Upon wearing it and pressing your palm against an entity, you will begin to drain their life force and add it to your own. I can alter the draining effect to be physical mass instead of life force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga thought about draining an unsuspecting victim of all their height and weight. She knew a few elves who could stand to be knocked down to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he gestured to the other object in his hand, a large pouch. \"Is fel powder. It empowers a user with dark energy, giving them more demonic appearance but also expanding their size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf pondered what she would look like with horns like a demon. She knew the dangers of making deals with demons, but if it meant more power she might be willing to take the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want in exchange for one of these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Passing on loot would be fine with me. But choose carefully, I'll only part with one of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga decided...</span></div></div>",

It could lead to some big problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Helga wasn't listening as she stepped out the door, staring into the heart of the ruby like it was a giant apple. She stumbled out of the cave district of Ironforge into the more crowded, but still largely empty, halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the dwarf tossed the gem in the air a few times before tying it around her neck. \"I don't feel that different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recalled the instructions given to her by Dagon and looked for her first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany people in the city were gathered in their own clusters of groups, so Helga had to focus on those who were off alone in the corners of the great halls. Her eyes wandered to one particular woman between the building crafting something. She was a low level priest, from the looks of it, and a human. From a glance, Helga guessed she was doing that silly cloth quest for the quartermaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" Helga said, with a surprising amount of enthusiasm. \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young priest jumped. \"Oh, hi! Am I in the way? Sorry. I'm just trying to get enough money for my first mount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy,\" Helga rolled her eyes. \"I remember my first mount. But you know, you're not going to earn much doing that stupid quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue frowned. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Helga reached into her pocket to produce a few gold. \"Want to earn some easy money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends. What am I doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart girl. I just need to borrow a bit of your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a foot for starters. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest rubbed her chin and shrugged. \"Sure. I mean, it won't really matter when I'm healing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Helga with a smile. \"Now hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf warrior pressed her palm on the priest's arm as the necklace began to glow. Helga noticed that the human seemed to be getting smaller and her robes were starting to appear a little too big on her. Conversely, she could feel her armor tightening. The dwarf's eyes widened in surprise as her already large breasts billowed out of the neck opening of her chestpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter holding down on the priest for a few seconds, Helga was a good head taller than she was before with her dwarven curves also bigger. Conversely, the priest looked diminished, with even her breasts seeming less well endowed. Though, she was still taller than Helga, if only barely. Despite feeling like canned food trapped in her armor, Helga felt really good and powerful. It was like she had been given a blessing of fortitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure doing business with you,\" said Helga as she paid the priest her due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah,\" replied the human girl, adjusting to the fact as how big the gold looked to her with her lost height. \"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga bumbled through Ironforge, content with her new view. Things looked so much smaller now and she felt strong. Fat poked out of the cracks in her plate armor as she walked proudly down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this,\" she giggled as new parts of her attempted to jiggle free of her armor. \"Might need to improve the fit of this though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Helga ran into someone from her guild. It was...</span></div></div>",

What in the name of Elune happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe druid studied the once short dwarf, bringing her hand up to her head and then measuring where she came up to on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Elune, you've grown almost a foot in height! What have you been eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating nothing, lass,\" Helga held up the red amulet that she proudly wore on her exposed chest. \"Look at what I got from Dagon. It's a fancy life draining necklace that's been converted to take people's mass instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why on Azeroth would you want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I\"m tired of being like a flipping pinball during raids,\" Helga crossed her arms. \"What? Are you going to try and talk me out of it? Say it's immoral or some bollocks like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf had a coy smile on her face. \"No, not at all. I think it's brilliant. Boz will be happy to hear that his raiders taking things seriously. Who did you drain first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some poor sap looking for gold for a mount. I only took a foot from her though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? You should see what you can get away with.

I mean, there's no telling if this thing is permanent or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it. It will be just like using Noggenfogger elixir. Besides, I'm a healer anyway. I can be your literal pocket healer in the raid if this thing can do what I think it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure...I don't want to hear Boz complaining that I've shrunk our raid healer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf chuckled and motioned for Helga to follow her all the way to the main district of Ironforge. There, the two entered an inn and Moontra led the dwarf all the way to  a bedroom she had rented in her travels away from her homeland. It was a small room, but quiet and out of the way. Perfect for this sort of private work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said the night elf as she began to undress. \"You might want to remove your armor. It's looking a little tight on you already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga undid the tight clasps holding her equipment together. Her flabby breasts and belly were like a jack in the box bursting out in a explosion rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" the dwarf muttered as she rubbed where her skin had been compressed. \"That smarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you've gained quite a bit of weight too,\" said Moontra as she pinched the warrior's side with a smile. \"Interesting. Well, what are you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga had to avert her eyes as the druid stood over her completely naked. She pressed her palm directly on Moontra's belly. Within an instant, she could feel the same sensations as before start up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, my,\" moaned the night elf as she shrunk at a rapid rate. \"This is actually quite enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Moontra lost her great stature, Helga swelled up to gigantic proportions. She cupped her bosom as it filled her free hand entirely, reaching a cup size that was well beyond normal. Her width increased as her hips ballooned to thick meaty thighs. As her weight increased, her height slowly raised. Within seconds, she could see over the top of Moontra's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf was now pint sized in comparison to most of her kin. She had probably lost almost half of her original height. Her eyes were closed as began to fondle herself and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" asked Helga as she pressed her friend down to size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she admitted, grabbing Helga's hand to bringing it to her breast. \"Shrink me more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga obeyed, adding even more mass to her substantial gain. She was already well past the height of any night elf and looked properly swollen in all directions. Moontra grew smaller in her hands. She only stopped when the night elf was a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" she said, when she finished playing with herself. \"You're huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And you're tiny. Sorry, Moony. I think we both went a little over board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize! I've wanted this,\" she replied as she grabbed Helga's palm. \"Here, lift me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did a quick comparison of each other. Helga had gained a lot of extra mass in her breasts and hips, and was now seven feet, nine inches. Moontra, on the other hand, lost whatever curves she had and stood at only half a foot tall. She was big enough to fit comfortably in Helga's cleavage, where she insisted on staying while the two wandered around and adjusted to their new sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to find some armor that fits,\" Helga said, rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one of the mages can enchant your gear to match your new size,\" came the reply as Moontra wiggled around in the literal valley of breasts. \"We should get ready for raid though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, something was about to happen that would change the nature of the amulet...</span></div></div>",

The blacksmith didn't even notice the fact that the druid was hiding in Helga's chest, poking out her head in the open area below the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice of him to fix up your gear for free,\" said Moontra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it had more to do with the fact that I'm twice his size,\" chuckled Helga. \"The poor bugger looked terrified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we got a few hours before the raid. What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Helga could answer, she was truck with some sudden wooziness. She leaned over on the side of the hall and clasped her head.

I'm slipping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga looked down at her breasts as saw Moontra looking slightly bigger than she did before. She had to hold on just to not fall down into her cleavage.

Moontra, however, remained unchanged. She looked quite quizzical, as she pondered what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the effects of the amulet are only temporary.

Still being 6 inches tall, the gemstone was almost as big as she was. She had to steady it with both hands, her waist still in Helga's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought. This is a high elven make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This is an old artifact known as a blood crystal. They used to use these in summoning demons and empowering them. This one looks like it has been tampered with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoontra fiddled around with the tip of the gemstone, twisting the screw that kept it held together. She gestured to a symbol at the top that Helga hadn't noticed before. It looked like some sort of rune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has made the effects purposely temporary. There's no way I can undo that unless we remake the crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Helga frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...It may be possible to drain the power of the gem itself.

Swallow it whole, Helga,\" replied the druid as passed it into the dwarf's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Helga grabbed it and forced the gem down her throat. It was a little hard, considering how big it was, but with her extra size she managed to do it just fine.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a hidden workshop somewhere in the mountains of Dun Morogh, tinkered around a little gnome named Nindal Bizzcup, who was working on an old gadget that one of her colleagues had left behind after a vicious troll attack. Nindal had looked over the few blueprints there was, but nothing really seemed to explain the gadget\u2019s purpose, so carefully she tried to twist and turn it in various ways to see how I worked. It happened when she shot a high voltage of electricity through the gadget with some cables, and the gadget suddenly spinned around like firework, and suddenly exploded! Out came a lighting ball that with high speed bounced around the room, like it was searching for something, and then got absorbed into Nindal\u2019s body as soon as it hit her. A shock went through her body, which made her fall to the floor. <br>\r\nShe shook her head and grunted as she got up on her tiny legs again, and checked her shortstack body for injuries, she wore her blue work coverall which seemingly had gotten no damage from the lightning  ball. Afterwards she looked around the room, but nothing was touched beside some tipped over books, tools and gears.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, she then felt a rush go through her body, like a sensitive touch, which made her quickly straighten out her spine and whimp a slight \u201cEIP!\u201d sound! Her breathing became quicker, as she looked around and then down her body, the blue coverall felt tighter than before. Another rush, and the seams began to rip, either her cloth became smaller, or she was swelling in size. She tried to walk over to the chair at her workbench, but then painfully noticed that her shoes where uncomfortable tight as well and bent over in agony by the unexpected hurt. She tried to shake her shoes off, but they were completely stuck, but suddenly the front of the shoes ripped. She gave a sigh of relief as her toes burst out of the small footwear, and then continued walking towards the chair now that some of the pressure was taken off. Eager to sit down quick, she did a backwards jump towards the chair when it was in range, and with a plump bump, the chair creaked, and the bottom of her blue coverall burst open. A surprised \u201cuh!\u201d escaped her lips, as she reached down to inspect the damage. The jump had made her ass split open her behind, exposing a bit of her panties and cheeks, she groped them, and didn\u2019t recall them being so squishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention away from her plump butt, as she suddenly felt another rush course through her again. This time her feet exploded out of her shoes, as they have gotten too wide and massive, and her butt made the hole in her blue coverall even bigger. However, Nindal was more concert about her chest now as she now had a hard time breathing, it was like a sandbag was pushing against her and her clothing. Her fingers where at the buttons, and she tried to puff out her chest to open it. It broke, and out bounced Nindal breasts who where still maintained in a small bra, to the best of the bra\u2019s ability, because it wasn\u2019t sandbags that were close to suffocate Nindal, but her otherwise modest tits which now had grown in size and overflow the bra cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself in absolute shock and surprise, then looked at her hands and then the room, and realized that the clothing was not getting smaller, it was her who was getting bigger.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nindal Bizzcup smiled after this realization and giggled in delight: \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d Nindal was always ignored and never taken serious because of her height, people always had their way with her, whenever it was cutting her off in line or pushing her away she was in someone\u2019s walking path. Right now, she wasn\u2019t much taller than a dwarf, BUT the possibility excited her, and soon she would have her fantasy come true.<br>\r\nAnother rush shot through Nindal\u2019s body, and she began growing again while sitting in her chair. <br>\r\nBeing fully onboard to the upcoming changes, Nindal relaxed and leaned back into the chair while feeling her growing shortstack body. She wiggled her toes as her chubby legs stretched out from the chair and stroked her bloated little belly which as expanding against her coverall. Her breasts strained themselves against the bra, snapping and groaning. Her fat ass got wider and meatier, her panties covering less and less behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steadily kept on growing as another rush stimulated her growth. It made her entire body jump in size, tearing up her blue coverall, as it could no longer contain Nindal\u2019s chubby body. She lightly shoved the blue, tattered, clothings off her and stretched her nearly naked body, it felt really good. She laid back in the chair, which was creaking loudly now, but Nindal didn\u2019t care, she kept sitting with spread legs and arms behind her head. Her legs stretched half across the room now, and gears and books where pushed away in their growing wake. Further up was Nindal\u2019s stretched out panties who hardly could covered her hairy crotch anymore, the panties rubbing her growing nether region made Nindal itchy and she sent a hand down to lazily scratch her scruffy pussy. Her massive butt consumed the entire chair and more now, like a big, overbaked muffin turned upside down, and it kept getting bigger and bigger. Her round and chunky stomach was doing likewise, a decent sized chub from eating too many cookies but not exactly fat compared to the rest of her body, however with her hips it was getting pretty wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stringy bra snapped and spilled out her beasts down her body. The size of her round breasts where getting out of tune with the rest of her body, they seemed to be growing faster. Slowly they began to slightly sack, and the nipples where starting to be pulled invert as her areolas swallowed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so good!\u201d Nindal happily moaned as she scratched her back with her left arm, exposing the armpit hair under it. The weight was now so immense that the chair broke behind her, and Nindal fell that little short distance to the ground with a big bang that made everything in the workshop jump a little from the shake. With wooden pieces between her spread legs, below her stout belly, Nindal giggled at the result of what her new figure was capable of. With both hands helping her up with grunting effort, she managed to get her wide, plump shortstack, naked body back up, she really wanted to know how big she was. <br>\r\nHer mildly hairy legs walked over to a measurement tape, which was plastered on to one of the workshop walls, here she leaned up against it, and hold her hand on the measurement tape where the top of her head reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c7feet tall!\u201d she chuckled; she was bigger than the average night elf! Never will she be pushed around again, or get her requests ignored, in fact, she would be demanding to be heard from now on. Nobody should ignore such a big, wide and plump body such as Nindal\u2019s, but then Nindal realized that she was now too big to get out of the workshop. She looked at the door which was in gnome size, she couldn\u2019t possible get out of that, was she stuck here now?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her back was up against the wall and the feet laid across the room, it was only a matter of time before she would grow again.<br>\r\nMeanwhile she thought about what she would do once she got out of here, perhaps find some clothes, it was after all cold in Dun Morogh, but that wouldn\u2019t fix the problem she might would have with the others, it was not normal for a gnome to be this size.<br>\r\n\u201cAh screw them!\u201d Nindal said: \u201cI can do whatever I want now, they can just try to fight me. And if I can\u2019t beat them, I will just retreat to the mountains until I have grown big enough to take them on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs on cue, she grew bigger with another rush going through her body, making her fill up the room a bit more. Yes, grow big enough she thought, that\u2019s what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then what? She would become their new queen of course, their new, giant, naked and plump queen. Under her rule they would finally be able to eradicate the trolls and troggs plaguing their lands, she would simply stump on their huts and bodies to kill them. Nindal thought back to the time where the sheer size of a troll scared her greatly, such a big, brutish beast that she only reached the knees to had made her afraid to wander off too far in Dun Morogh. <br>\r\nBut now she was bigger, and those trolls would not even reach her ankles! They would only be able to stare up towards her big, hairy vagina and massive tits with a little cheeky face staring between what valley her cleavage allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew again, this time her feet reached the other side of the room, shoving items away in their path, her back stretched up the wall too. Fuck yes, imagine stumping down troll villages with her big feet, toes the size of steam tanks, wiggling in the destroyed mess and her belly and tits jiggling as her feet hits the ground with all it\u2019s might. Laughing at the troll\u2019s demise, making her tits and belly fat jiggle even more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe bent her legs, as the grew again, her head was touching the celling soon, but her thoughts where far away in her revenge fantasies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNext she would march towards Gnomeregan, and demand Thermaplugg\u2019s surrender. He would of course hide in this little, underground fortress, and Nindal would then get on all four and dig up its halls and tunnels with her bare hands like it was sand. She loved the thought of the pudgy fingers reaching down and inside the rooms like it was a doll house, trying to find that little worm Thermaplugg. His minions cowering in fear, looking up at this mountain of a gnome as they watched hall after hall getting destroyed. And after Thermaplugg was found, and smashed between her fingers, she would make a massive throne where Gnomeregan once was for her great ass to sit on. And she would sit in it, until she one day had grown so much it would crack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking had gotten her sweaty and horny, she had grown even more and was now getting pretty stuffed inside the workshop. However, with struggling effort, she got a hand down to her wet, gnomish, pussy and began helping herself to an orgasm. But it got more and more difficult to stimulate herself as the workshop got more and more crammed by her chubby body, however Nindal was stubborn, she wouldn\u2019t not be ignored, and her pussy demanded attention! <br>\r\nShe applied more and more force so she could rub herself, grunted and roared in her endeavor, making the workshop rumble! Her bloated, overgrown, shortstack body fill the entire room now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you could suddenly see two giant feet sprut of the front of the workshop, and a giant, moaning, red-faced head popping off the top of the roof. Two arms brought down the left and right wall side of the workshop, collapsing big parts of it. The front door fell, revealing the biggest, hairiest, pussy ever seen, soaked in its own juices. Nindal didn\u2019t care about the wreckage, she was too close to cumming, both her hands quickly returned back to rubbing, and Nindal bent over forward moaning in satisfaction. Her boobs tore down the remaining front fa\u00e7ade of the workshop like two giant wrecking balls, as she did so. Finally free to touch herself she sped up with two working hands on the job, the feeling on sitting in her former workshop between her butt because she was too big made her finally cum, releasing a stream of wetness in front of her and a final, deep, relieved roar she felt back on her back wearing a silly and blissful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid there with her big, wide and chubby body in the ruins of her former workshop, in the snow landscape of Dun Morogh, with a soaked rainforest cunt, breasts bigger than her head and hips nearly as wide as she was tall and with an ass that functioned as a big, comfortable pillow to sit on.<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her wand reverberated a deep light inside her travel bag, gleaming out the top flap through the slips up top. She wasn't paying any mind to it, as it hasn't caused any issues on her journey quite yet, and she didn't want to fiddle with it earning a bolt of fattening magic. She trotted down the broken cobblestone path with a pep in her (hefty) step. Ryhane was excited to learn what she could about this wand, it's even in one of the greatest elven cities ever made! She almost skipped down the path in giddy joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyhane passed through the ancient woods, starting to see the ancient ruins off in the distance. However, as she walked past a runestone of some sort, her bag gave a loud chime, a pleasant note, but unexpected. Another chime was heard from behind her, as if in answering. Ryhane twirled around to investigate, only to be met with even more chiming runestones. An entire ring was circling the path, the ancient stones continuing their little song. \"I need to take some notes!\" She scribbled down on her notepad quickly, marking her location on the map, she decided it'd be time for off road exploration after she's in good shape again. As she continued down the path, she was met with a force holding her back, just as the wand did. She tried another path, but again, anywhere leaving the ring blocked her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyhane panicked, something wasn't right about this, she up the flap on her bag and pulled out the wand. It was bigger than before and more intricate, it radiated more power, perhaps absorbing some of the ancient rune's power... in any case it levitated back out of her hand, \"Oi, get back here... you!\" She shouted trying to grab the wand before it has the chance to do anything. There was nothing she could do but jump up and down, but it didn't do anything but set her whole body jiggling. The wand charged up again like before, pointing the end straight at the night elf. She threw her arms up as if pleading with it, but it was too late, a powerful beam struck into her belly at a constant stream, the crimson energy from her first spell pouring straight inside her. This time didn't feel the same though, it was warmer and worked faster. Within mere moments, the pounds were piling onto her already bulky frame. Inches were being added everywhere, she watched on in terror, but she couldn't take it, it was too intense and the elf passed out cold, falling down on her plump rear...</span></div></div>",

But as she looked down at herself, she felt oddly unsatisfied. She was slim and trim, toned even. For some reason, Ryhane felt rather sad at this revelation, a rumble of hunger growing inside her. Another strange note the mage made was that she wasn't her usual self, she was someone else; light skin and a lavishly gold trimmed dress, leaving little to the imagination. But even with all these strange occurrences, Ryhane only had one question for herself, \"Do I never eat? I'm hungry beyond belief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't entirely sure why she said that, but it was on her mind. She heard feet behind her, adjusting herself to see who was coming.

What if I never come back here, oh this is all that Spirit's fault!</i> Ryhane imagined all the possible scenarios in her head, cursing the spirit for glorifying this obesity. It might've felt nice, but the social implications were just too much to bear for her.<br>\r\n\"Miss, I really need to talk with you!\" The voice called, it seemed to be in more of a panicked tone than a serious one, and a bit higher than a regular night elf.<br>\r\nShe wondered if it was even a guard at all, but nevertheless she responded, \"I just need to get some clothes on, please be patient!\"<br>\r\n\"WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR PATIENCE, OPEN THE LIGHT FORSAKEN DOOR!\" The voice hollered immediately after Ryhane was finished.<br>\r\nRyhane, startled by the voices sudden tone shift, felt that opening the door would be a good decision.

Oh, blast, I forgot his name, but he's like this Night Elf looking guy, who's red and transparent!

I think I know who you're talking about, but he's gone now.\"<br>\r\nThe Gnome didn't look any calmer, in fact, he was even more freaked out than before.<br>\r\n\"Oh, NO! NO NO NO! This is not good, if we don't find him fast, all of Azeroth is DOOMED!\"<br>\r\n\"Doomed? Doomed as in how?\" <br>\r\n\"Ugh... let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~5 hours of explanation later...~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And that's when I trapped the sucker in the Ruins, and left without ever looking back! I made the labyrinth SPECIFICALLY to keep people from finding the hiding room of the Spirit, but apparently you found it with quite ease.\"<br>\r\n\"So, basically he's a Spirit who fattens up women to death?\"<br>\r\n\"Precisely! However it appears as if he's just up and left you, but I'm certain he shall return. If he does, no matter what, do NOT let him take over your free will! Keep him from making you any fatter! In fact, let me weigh you right now...\"<br>\r\nThe Gnome pulls out a Gnomish Weight Machine, and plops it on the ground. Ryhane steps on it, and it instantly shoots up to 450 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Goodness Gracious! Well, it's good I found you when I did. If you reach 600 pounds of weight, he'll have full control and fatten you up to no end!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, my!

She lumbered down the steps if almost in a spell, lulled on by the idea of stuffing herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana walked into the kitchen and opened the larder, glad that she stocked up on Azerothian snack-food the day before. \"Mmmm... what to have, I wonder...\", she tapped her plump finger on her pouted lips, stomach growling hungrily. She grabbed as many sweets as she had; a bag of Dwarvish Cream puffs, a box of Stormwind Cream Cookies, Darnasian Spider Cakes, and a family sized box of Gnomish Chocolate Puffs. She arranged her smorgasbord of junk food before her, licking her lips and giving her larger gut a shake, \"This looks like a start, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana tore into her junk food with extreme gusto, shoving whole handfuls of the decadence at a time, no longer in fear of embarrassment from onlookers, she could care less how she looked. Within a few minutes, the last button on her tunic popped off, leaving her middle completely bare, her bra holding onto a tiny bit of her decency. She decided her pants were much too constrictive for her meal, pulling them down in a huff, her underwear once preserving modesty now looking like a tight band of fabric over her plump bubble of a rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour, all of her sweet snacks were stuffed in her gullet, leaving her a bit stuffed, she gives out a belch, licking her fingers clean. \"Almost as good as my dream..\" Sikana thought.</span></div></div>",

She decided to indulge herself in Human food, as it was the most filling and her favorite since coming here. She was getting closer to the front of the line, strategically scouting out which food will land on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana mapped out her plates, a bit of Wolf Steak here, a bit of Meat Pie there, some large Elwynn sausage links, and a large pile of Lordaeron fries. But she wasn't one to skip out on dessert, oh no. She burdened her final plate with a full chocolate pie, in memory of her chocolate gorging the previous night.<br>\r\nShe sat down and arranged the plates in front of her with a look of bliss in her eyes, \"Cutting back certainly would have been an awful mistake!\" giggling before digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a woman possessed, Sikana greedily tore into the food, hardly giving herself the chance to breath. Each mouthful a new sensation, eager to try the next. If one of the patrons were to look closely, they could notice the draenei's stomach stretching to contain her meal, wich was quickly disappearing. With only a second of thought, Sikana got to work on her pie, eating it quicker than the cake the night before, the dwarf who greated her watched on with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, Sikana truly couldn't eat another bite, buffet patrons looking at the stuffed draenei in confusion, never before seeing one of her people at such a weight.

Part of her was starting to question what was going on, it seemed almost unnatural at this point, before she had managed maybe a dozen pounds every other week... but this? Something surely must be acting on her from somewhere. But she dismissed those thoughts at the idea of getting new clothes, these were just dismal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana heard of a new boutique in Ironforge that was having a rather large opening sale, that might also have the clothes big enough for her. She left her house in stride, unnaturally well on her hooves, given her size. Every inch of her new figure shaking and jiggling every which way, noted by the murmurs of passing citizens, The draenei made her way to the dwarven tram system, to luckily find a train had just arrived. She seated herself on two of the(notably small and gnome sized) chairs, the sides of her rear going over either side, plump tail laying out lazily (Even her tail ring had grown too small for the expanded woman, having popped off in her sleep last night).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey still took a god two hours, even at the quick speed the Gnomes managed to create, it still traveled half the continent after all. The rather bored draenei drifted into a nap part way through, just as vivid as the last few, her dream was of the same fair, fatter than she was, eating delicious food and the like. But this one was slightly different, as there seemed to be a pair of hands feeding her and rubbing her belly, she couldn't tell who it was, but it felt heavenly... before waking to a loud buzzer as the tram screeched to a halt at Ironforge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little effort, she got up from her seat and followed her map to the Dwarven boutique she originally set out for. Along the way, as has been rather common lately, onlookers ogled the strange sight in front of them, 'That's a HUGE lass!', a dwarf noted, 'By the light, that's a big goat!', a human pointed, 'Someone's certainly well-fed...', another mentioned. None of these insults seemed to bother Sikana as she strut to her destination, aptly arriving with minimal confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her was a rather large two tiered store, with a dwarven woman greeting the draenei as she entered, \"Our... plus size section is upstairs, come to me if you have any questions.\" She nodded, skipping past the 'skinny' section on the bottom floor and going straight for the plus sized bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, perfect...\", Sikana eyed the garments all around her, happily seeing a wide array of clothes, from elegant gowns to lounging robes. Still shocked they're in her size, she made a quick bee line to the comfortable clothes, thinking back to her dreams, a smile appearing on her face. \"Oooo, they even have that new 'gnomish elastic band' clothes!\" Hanging several sizes over her fore-arm, she shopped knowing she'd grow in the near future, grabbing clothes for now, and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe splurging and shop-happy Sikana made her way to the payment desk, laying out several full outfits ranging from large to, well massive. \"Are you sure you want bigger sizes, these first few should be more than fine for your current physique?\", asked the lady at the counter, wondering if she was making a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'll be needing them soon enough.\" Sikana dismissed her and paid for her clothes, walking out the store with her spoils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Go home for a quick snack and rest, perhaps find out who the stranger in her dream was?<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else entirely!</span></div></div>",

She heard a voice in her head, 'You may not know who I am, but I've been watching your arrival, with... interest, since you arrived here in azeroth.' The figure came closer into view, only about a head shorter than the draenei, with a similar build to her old body, toned and well managed, clearly someone who took care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who are you, stranger? Do you have anything to do with what's been happening to me?'

I've been helping you along with these strange dreams you've been having, and the consequences there of. I have an interest in you, actually'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'An interest, of what kind?'

She stops in front of the draenei with a slice being brought up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've been watching me, wh-' Sikana is cut off by the cake being stuffed in her mouth, which she chews quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, living as long as I have, very few things excite me anymore, and I'm in search of something new to toy with, which you look like a perfect candidate for' She pauses to cut another slice, happily feeding it to the draenei as Sikana's dream-body grows with plumpness after each bite. Growing from thin and toned to chubby with a potbelly and thick love handles, much like she was at the inn, not too long ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sikana was fed, she could hardly protest to what was going on as the stranger continued, 'I'd like to see you larger, much larger! I've never had the chance to do anything of the sort, but you certainly seemed open to the idea after the first dream I've given you.' She gave the draenei yet another slice, plumping her up a notch bigger, pot belly and bubble butt blooming to a gut and large backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been giving you these dreams and imbuing you with magic these past few days, I'm sure you've noted how unnatural it is to gain so much in such a short time?' Half the cake now inside Sikana's belly, she was looking about the size she was this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, what do you say?' She tilted her head at her with a smile. She simply replied with a nod, the taste of the dream cake almost impossible to resist. 'Good then, I'll see you tonight after your nap, no?' She shoves the remaining half of the cake inside Sikana's mouth, ballooning her to double her size, sitting on a massive rear, smooth to the touch, a belly pinning her to the ground and a chest that she couldn't see past...

She had just plowed through every bit of easily accessible food in the pantry, there's no way she can eat too much more.. right? The chubby draenei grabbed a serving plate and strolled up and down each lane of freshly prepared goodies, getting quite the stare as her little extra pudge was sticking out like a sore thumb. She told herself inwardly, 'Nothing too heavy just yet.. start light, small..' Nodding to herself as she paced herself to the more modest options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the breakfast platters were still quite well stocked, the blue skinned woman leaning forward on her hooves to see each option, a subtle puff coming as she settled with stacking a few fluffy pancakes along the center mass of her plate, finding it'd be a crime not to at least get a waffle with them.. Grabbing a serving fork, Sikana skewered a few hefty links of breakfast sausage, the perfect bit of sear to them, she could hear the things crackling enticingly on the gnomish hot-plate. Following down the line, she set up a good helping of toasted Dwarvish rye toast and Night Elven tarts, lightly sugared with plums, pears, and lemon zest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with her plate, the draenei affirmed herself with a nod, bringing the piled high plate to her table before politely settling in with a napkin tucked into her collar and a look of almost.. poshness on her face, quite happy with herself for being so well controlled.. despite eating anything and everything without prejudice not too long ago..</span></div></div>",

Appetite. Was that meal you had truly filling for a Draenei of your size?\" The hooded figure asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I do believe so.

How?\" Sikana wondered.<br>\r\n\"Simple.\" The Warlock takes out a small Skull with horns jutting out just above the eyes, \"This is a Dreadlord Skull. But within it lies the Soul of a Demon.\"<br>\r\n\"A demon?\" Sikana gasped, no longer so sure about this idea, \"B-b-but those are forbidden!\"<br>\r\n\"Just hear me out. I make sure that all of these Demon souls are nothing more than Imps. I just use the Dreadlord skull because it looks cooler. Anyway, if you rub the head of the Skull, an Imp will appear and grant you whatever wish you desire.\" The Hooded Figure explained.<br>\r\n\"So, I'd be making a deal with a Demon?\" Sikana asked.<br>\r\n\"Not entirely. The only catch is that you can only ask Three. No matter how large or how small the request, and once the Spirit has granted those three wishes... Well, don't worry too much about that. It's just an Imp, what harm could one small, weak imp cause?\" The Hooded figure cackled, \"Even the simplest of simpletons could defeat one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana laughed alongside the Figure, her belly jiggling as she did, She got a hold of herself, and continued talking, \"Alright, this sounds fine to me.

Sikana nodded, and prepared herself for the challenge the Stranger gave her. She rubbed her taut belly in hopes of calming her overstuffed gut, and tried to imagine that she didn't just eat all the food in her kitchen just an hour or two ago, on top of the meal she just had.<br>\r\nSikana noticed that people were clearing out of the buffet, most likely the Stranger's doing. Maybe she paid off the owner to look the other way while they conducted the bet, or perhaps some form of Mind Control. Sikana would never truly know for sure, but all she could hope is that whatever it was, it wasn't illegal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the place cleared out, the Cashier left their station to go and flip the Open sign to \"Closed\", and locked the door.<br>\r\nThe Warlock whisked herself back into her spot, placing herself down on the opposite side of Sikana and smiled, \"There.

It would only make her more anxious and scared, which would not help her in the task. She began to wonder if all of this was even worth the struggle, it was a Demon after all. It might come with some crazy catch that the Stranger refuses to dish out.<br>\r\nSikana struggled over this for a while, but before she could come to a conclusion, the Stranger returned to place various dishes out, piled with a variety of foods from all the tables. She even had some cups of Water and Milk, to help with eating and to ensure she doesn't choke on the food.<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\" The Warlock smiled, and sat on the opposite end of the Table, but was unviewable from Sikana's side.<br>\r\nSikana took a deep breath, and started working on eating. She was eating like she'd never eaten before, grabbing handfuls of mashed potatoes, steaks, even salads, and shoving them into her maw. Her clothing became even more tight as her belly began to fill up with food, she barely even had time to taste the deliciousness of just one type before another handful of food got shoved in. The sounds of linen ripping and buttons popping. all of it was worth it, however, and she was determined to get that Skull.<br>\r\nShe stopped midway through to take a large gulp from multiple cups of milk, it was a pleasant break in between the stuffing.<br>\r\n\"Please, do not overwork yourself,\" Stated the Warlock, who was now visible from after Sikana was finished with half her meal, \"If you are unable to continue, just tell me. I don't want anyone getting hurt.\" She followed that up with a wink, which made Sikana a bit worried, but she didn't bother with it and continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate for what felt like an hour, stuffing the last bit of food into her mouth, panting wildly. Her belly was distended beyond belief, rubbing up against the table, her belly complaining that she was in no more mood to eat anything else, not even the smallest pea.<br>\r\nThe Warlock clapped, \"Good job, I'm amazed at your skill.\"<br>\r\n\"Huff...

I dunno if I can do that..\" Her eyes heavy, body working her into a partial food coma just sitting there.

I assure you.\" Rubbing her palms once more, she motioned for the draenei to stay seated as she stood and hurried over to the buffet line that she intentionally didn't touch for Sikana's meal. Piling up plates with various decadent and delicious desserts; settling on grabbing the entire tub of gnomish icecream, a stacked human fudge cake, several pies from all around Azeroth, Dwarvish donuts, elven spider cakes.. all of it and more.<br>\r\nAll the while, Sikana was left cradling the massive thing as it's overstuffed apex (or apexis, am I right?) curve having ripped the front of her pants clean open, and her shirt wedging under her breast. Giving a low grown, she couldn't even watch the woman pile it the plates high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the preparations were set in stone, the warlock almost skipped back to the table, all giddy with anticipation. \"Are you ready for the last course, dear Draenei?\" Coaxing her on as she slid the various plates in her direction, an overwhelming sweetness filling the air, almost intoxicating.<br>\r\nforcing herself back up, Sikana gave a low grumble, nodding her head as she slowly pulled a plate of cheesecake closer.. \"I hold no promises..\" Grabbing a slice of the stuff and topping it with a scoop of icecream before cramming it down her maw, starting to work her pace back into that blurred speed; to out-eat her brain before it forces her to stop.<br>\r\nEach plate started to blur together, every dessert topped with icecream to help it down and chip away at the tub of the stuff. Pressing two donuts in at a time, cramming entire slices of pie at a time, stuffing in spider cakes.. it was hardly recognizable at this point as Sikana devoured everything in sight, her pace starting to slow down again mid dessert. Groaning, she laid back for a breath, panting like mad with a burp following. Before her laid the fudge cake and the half melted bottom of the tub of icecream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe warlock watched on with bated breath..   </span></div></div>",

Her round pot of a belly, chunky thighs, well fed chest; it all looked like quite the oddity, and it's no wonder it struck a certain onlooker's eye. Picking up on the slightly agitated tone Sikana was dishing out, the onlooker cracked a smile, \"Eager as they come.\" Once the waiter was out of the way, they made their move. Standing up from a metal stool, the figure held a tightly wrapped cloak; revealing the seemingly female form below.

It had a similar structure as every other house in Stormwind does, the only thing that was different was the sign outside that read \"Mel's Bakery\". It didn't have that fancy a name, but then again, wasn't that fancy a place. Sik entered, and saw a Human Female wearing an apron that showed off her cleavage running the stand.<br>\r\n\"Hello, welcome to Mel's Bakery, how may I-\" Mel began to greet, until she realized who she was talking to, \"Oh, hello Sik.

This was no problem for Sikana, and she began eating them right away.<br>\r\nThey were very good, it came as such a surprise to Sikana that she began eating them as rapidly as the Waffles from earlier.<br>\r\nMel recorder her data on a piece of paper, enjoying what she saw.<br>\r\nSikana didn't realize, but there was an enchantment on the food she was eating. Well, two actually. One made her have lower standards for food, making her think anything edible was as delicious as chocolate cake, and another that made her metabolism lower, so she gained weight more quickly. This was all part of Mel's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana finished the cupcakes, and licked her fingers, \"Ah, how delicious. Was that it?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not.

And a sweet deal too, the treats she prepared got pre-loaded and lowered on command, giving Mel a superb chance to watch her handiwork in action. She leaned over the feeding console to get the closest possible view, her grin growing wider and chuckling like a madwoman.

The food ranged from your average sweets to the far more exotic. To blatantly unsweetened carbs that looked like cookies.

Fresh out the oven!\" She cheered, selecting the sugary treat on the console's menu and hitting 'send'.

Or show me, that works too.\" She giggled over the mic before shutting it off, returning to her viewing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana devoured everything and anything Mel sent her way. It took a good two hours for the 'baker' to empty her stock, feeding every last scrap to the fat draenei. \"That's all I've got, my friend! You've cleaned me out. But I must admit, it's very clear that you've loved everything I sent your way.\" Her voice grew as cheery as it was fast paced. Sik's belly was positively round, stretched full with all variety of sweets. Mel didn't dare send something less tasty... at least not yet. \"Your debt is paid and your free to go as you please! But remember, come back any time!\" She switched a lever on the far side, the table razing back up, and the chair forcing Sikana to her feet... err, hooves.  </span></div></div>",

This was a dream come true.<br>\r\nSikana ordered double of what she got yesterday, and the Gnome smiled and got right on her order.<br>\r\n\"I wonder why Mel is going through all this trouble to make me happy... it's as if she wants me to fatten up.\" Sikana pondered, but then she shrugged, what's a few extra pounds gonna do, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana got her meal, and the Gnome smiled and flew off to another table.<br>\r\nThis time, Sikana got two plates of towering Waffles instead of one, and there were Chocolate Chips inside, too! This was too good to resist, and she began eating the two piles at the same time, her belly growing once again.</span></div></div>",

She really didn't mind though, her clothes were fit for just that purpose, she was grabbing eyes left and right. Her top and pants were perfect, and since that dream she FELT perfect. She couldn't help but admire her physique as she waited, she felt like a goddess, just as she was. And the meal she ordered was one fit for a goddess too. She pinched and prodded at her soft tummy, giving a playful giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bar... once again... a hooded figure sat in watching. This one a bit more curvaceous and tall than Sik's last visit. She watched Sikana very similarly to how Mel did, dressed in similar clothes. The figure returned to their drink, waiting instead for Sikana to at least be occupied with her meal. Whoever it was, it had to be connected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever set up the deal with the gnomes must have gotten extra because they came out double time, taking 4 gnomes to bring out all the food and deliver to her table. The draenei looked on with wide eyes; an impressive serving, even for her. As soon as she was free of their presence, Sikana  dug straight in with no abandon, with more furiousity than ever before. The drugs Mel gave her certainly didn't wear off... driving Sikana into an all out feeding frenzy. The generous portions started their disappearing act. Her belly already growing rounder and tighter by the minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stood from her stool, the target well engrossed with her meal and prime for approach. As she stood, her height rivaled that of Sik, and her legs bent in a very similar fashion, a little white tail coming out the back of her tight armor. Her walk was for more elegant than that of the stuttering Mel, and lead to more of a saunter. She took a seat right next to Sikana and introduced herself, \"My name's Nalaa, and I know you as Sikana.\" She bluntly stated to the feasting draenei beside her. The stranger's eyes shown bright through her hood, as every draenei's did. \"You can tahnk me for the free meals today... and for the foreseeable future.\"</span></div></div>",

Sikana put the journal back where she found it, innocently smiling at the thought of such a cute person. Whatever Mel was doing, she was sure it was only for the best. If she were to flip a few more pages however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 9:<br>\r\nThe feeding chamber is finally ready. those damned gnomes got it down quick, and I honestly can't complain. Managed to lure one of the installers in before they left, got a good test out of it. She tried to refuse at first, but I managed to ensare her with my magnificent charm *Wink*. The little one tried my food and loved the first few batches, but got too stuffed to continue. Had to let her go, sadly. I need something to keep em comin back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 13:<br>\r\nI hired some draenei alchemist to help me out with that formula I thought up. She seemd to enjoy the idea, too. I didn't tell her what it was for, but I knew she suspected something (Those space goats really are pesky?) but I can't let her catch on... what if she tells someone? Ugh, this is making me queezy... I think I'm due for another test. **And by that I mean on the alchemist. Just for clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 17:<br>\r\nFinal stalk-I mean tracked down that alchemist. Turns out she was at home the whole time, the tricky wench. But anyway, I staked out her porch and waited for hunger to inevitably settle in, when she had to leave her dwellings in search of sustenance. So here's what I did, it's pretty genious so follow long; I stuffed a doughtnut in her mouth and knocked her out with that blackjack I built yesterday. Testing starts tomorrow! Bright and early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 18:<br>\r\nPrimed and ready to go for stage two of the operation. That slithery draenei is strapped to the chair with those new cuffs I installed (did it myself, yep.) and there's no way for her to escape! My secret is safely hidden here.

It was a tad confusing, but Sikana had a feeling Mel had a good reason. She'd have to ask about it later.<br>\r\nIt hadn't taken Sikana long to realize the area Mel chose wasn't kept in that great condition. It was mostly wooden, and seemed really... makeshift. It was amazing how Mel could afford to allow a single Draenei free meals at a restaurant, yet can't afford a good looking bakery. Heck, the room she was fed in looked better than this.<br>\r\nShe took a look inside the Kitchen, and noticed most of the equipment in there was old, as well. Seemed like it hadn't been used a day in it's life.<br>\r\n\"How can a Bakery have fake food, and not have use for even an oven for this long?\" Sikana thought aloud. This was getting weird, she hoped that, when Mel returned, she'd have a reasonable explanation for most of these questionable things she was spotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she found something very interesting.<br>\r\n\"A potion...?\" Sikana wondered, and she read the label: \"HUNGER ENHANCEMENT\"<br>\r\nThis was some damning evidence that something was not right at this Bakery, if it even was one at all. Sikana became very worried, had Mel been playing her for a fool this whole time? Did Mel use this on her?

Those seemingly 'cute and innocent' pleas for customers were hiding an obvious dark side. Behind the awkward girl mask had to lie someone far more devious... right? \"Maybe she just has... personal projects?\" She shook her head, there's not exactly an easy way to rationale these sort of findings. One thing was certain, she had the means to build a feeding chamber and produce these academical additives. Racing back up to the front of the 'store' or whatever it really was, Sikana slipped the leatherbound book back out and flipped open to the pages she skipped, tracing her fingers under each line, quickly getting the story behind Mel's hidden alter-ego... at least she hoped it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading up to the section about the gnome worker was enough to make Sikana's spine shiver, but upon reading the bit about an alchemical project was enough to make her heart race. She quickened the pace, eager to hear what happened to the poor alchemist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 19:<br>\r\nDidn't get any sleep last night. Waaaay too much excitement! That draenei really proved her skills in that formula! It worked like a charm; after four helpings of doughnuts jam packed with the stuff, her stomach was growling 24/7, begging for more! Guess it really enhances the flavor too, because I hardly had to sweeten them. Once I fed her that cake... it was on! I put the highest dosage in that baby and let me tell you... ohhh that metabolism was non-existent! Anything that went in after she was finished slowly grew on her frame right in front of my eyes! Poof, she was getting fatter! Those are some good results! More to come tomorrow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 20:<br>\r\nBarely got a nap; had to bake some more stuff. She outpaced me, no matter how subpar the food was, she'd eat ANYTHING I lower in there. No use having her restrained now either, I don't think food ever lost space in her mind. Maybe I shouldn't put so much in like that... No matter, the oaf wrote it down before her unfortunate 'disappearance', as it was written in the papers anyway. It's easy enough to replicate. Wish I could compliment her on it, but well, she's too preoccupied to take note. More tomorrow, hopefully a littttle break of action for some sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 21:<br>\r\nDid some digging on the lass. Looks like she's got quite the pretty penny stashed in her house. Alchemy is booming these days; I wonder who farms for her? But anyway, the good news is that I can run my shop for a good few years now, plus supply all the food and hunger supplements I need.  Speaking of which; the next time I bring a test subject, I need to make sure and limit the dosage. It's no fun if food's the only thing on their mind... though it makes for quite the spectacle. (Oh that belly of hers...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 22:<br>\r\nI can't keep up with all this cooking, buying, crafting, etc. This alchemist is getting to be really high maintenance, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. Gotta find a 'permanent solution' for her before I'm dry. Drugs are great miss, but you failed to warn me of the side effects. *Sigh* This is why you ended up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 24:<br>\r\nSorry journal, I had to skip a day on account of the search to rid myself of the test subject. I'd have liked to been friends with her, but she knew too much, and the dosage was really getting to her. For security reasons however, I can't disclose what happened to the fatty; no way I can get someone reading my journal and learning this secret, nope!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 27:<br>\r\nFound a new potential subject... one I won't mess up on. She was eating at the local tavern last night and peaked my interest. You'll like this one, journal; a real looker she is. Ate like she hasn't seen food in years! Followed her to her bed after she waddled to her room. She didn't notice me, but I DID get to inject that mood altering stuff in her; help her enjoy the big things in life; like big plates and dinners and such. Hopefully something comes of it!</span></div></div>",

All I do all day is just walk around telling idiots where to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana was a more dark-skinned Draenei than Sikana, her face was covered by the Helmet she had to wear for duty, but underneath was a smooth face, with long tentacles, and wild, pointed hair.<br>\r\n\"So, that whole diet didn't work out after all, huh?\" Zeyana laughed, poking her sister's belly.<br>\r\n\"Not entirely... I got roped into being a Taste Tester, but I have a feeling the Chef is trying to fatten me up, in a Bad way.\" Sikana explained.<br>\r\n\"Well... shouldn't this be a dream come true?\" Zeyana asked, confused.<br>\r\nSikana shoved her face into her palm, and handed over the Journal she had.<br>\r\nZeyana read the entire thing, and when she finished, she was surprised.<br>\r\n\"By the Naaru... you were right to inform me about this, Sikky. Can you show me where she lives?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"No! I can't take you there, she'll know it was me, and she might...\" Sikana trailed off.<br>\r\n\"Do what?\"<br>\r\n\"...N-nothing, I know she works at the Bakery in Old Town. Go there, and you'll probably find her.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'll bring over a few of the guards to this Mel's place and we'll make sure everything's fine.\" Zeyana patted Sikana on the back, \"Don't worry, after this is all over, I'll help you get back on track with your diet.\"<br>\r\nSikana hugged her sister, \"Oh, thank you, Zey! I knew that you'd help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana, for the rest of the day, was in a pretty good mood. While she didn't want to lose her belly entirely, she felt that the overeating had to stop.

Hopefully it was Zeyana, coming to tell her the good news; Mel was finally locked up and given due punishment! She smiled in anticipation, practically skipping to the door. \"One moment!\" She called, unlocking the several new bolts she applied to her door (She got a bit paranoid when she moved into such a big city) and swung open the door.<br>\r\nThe sight she was greeted with was not expecting. Before her was her sister, the part she did manage to guess, but the whole bit about capturing Mel didn't seem to pan out... Zeyana wasn't looking like her normally fit self... She looked far softer, chubby even. An obvious pot belly was poking through the gaps in her armor, and her breastplate looked like it was about to burst off. She held her helmet under her arm and looked rather pissed. \"C-Come in, sis.\" She gestured to her couch and opening the door wide. Zeyana obliging with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I owe you an explanation.\" She huffed, sitting down on the couch in more of a crash. \"And even if I don't, this is what happened, and if you laugh?\" She looked her sister dead in the eyes, \"I'll destroy you.\" She leaned back and gave a large, angry sigh. \"To start with, all the guards were out on a bust in Old Town. Big stuff. I cold skip out, said I had a personal call to investigate. They let do it and all that, but id be going alone. Stupid me though, and I underestimated what I'd find.\" With another sigh, Zeyana lifted her feet up on Sik's table, her sister taking a seat across.<br>\r\n\"So, when I get their l, I'm face to face with a 'Out on errands, be back soon' sign. And naturally I thought it the perfect opportunity to check things out, snoop around and all that...\" She rubbed her temples in irritation, \"I see what I assumed to be that chamber she described in her journal. Now... I know it sounds stupid... But the smell was unbearable in there... But in a good way. On the table was a moooound of cakes, never seen so much sugar in my life!\" Her voice begun trailing off, \"Something compelled me to take a little bite, see what all the fuss was about. And before I knew it I was shocking it all down until the plates were cleaned. And by that, I mean I licked em clean.\" Zeyana looked ashamed, trying to avert her sisters gaze. \"Maybe it was a security measure... Or something...\" She slumped back in her chair.</span></div></div>",

She was very popular on Draenor, Mel must've gotten a hold of her while she was in town. But with this, we can find out where she lived. If she ran a business, no doubt this marking should be on her building.\" Zeyana explained.<br>\r\n\"Ah, so it's an adventure!... Oh, but it's a bit late for that, don't you think? Let's start up fresh tomorrow, huh?\" Sikana asked.<br>\r\nZeyana nodded, \"Of course. I just wanted to make sure you were up-to-date with current information. Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana waved goodbye to Zeya, as she got ready for bed. But something that was unknown to the two Draenei, is that Mel had once again stalked Sikana home, and knew all about their little plan. However, Mel had a few tricks up her sleeve. She swore to herself that, this time, when Sikana entered her Bakery, she'd never leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana woke up the next morning feeling the same as she did yesterday. Feeling as if something were off, but this time it was a bit more apparent. There was a note left for her on her bedside, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Dear Sikana,<br>\r\nI came by earlier, but you were asleep, so I decided not to wake you.

She got out of bed, only to notice her belly was much larger. The digestion made it fat, and jiggly.

Sikana found herself shoulder to shoulder with many of the street's pedestrians. The sidewalks were rather cramped as is, but with an extra 'oomph' added to her figure, Sikana was having to force herself into pretty much anyone within 3 feet of her. Gnomes didn't see it coming as her doughy belly bumped straight into the backs of their heads, humans treated to a faceful of cleavage, or a bit of a sink into Sik's love handles. As she walked, countless people brushed past her or outright crashed into her, but it couldn't be helped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStormwind was a busy place full of impatient denizens, but Sikana managed to get through it in one piece. As she got through the gates, she pulled off to the side, off the road bustling with mounts of all varieties, carts, and wagons. \"Why do you even ride your Gryphon on the ground?\" She fussed, seeing a bunch of half bit adventurers riding their flying mounts on the ground despite their obvious wings... she turned and left, cursing under her breath and giving her hair a flip, moving off to the clearing just off the road that the note had drawn on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of traffic was still present, but not a soul was within sight, the treeline blocking out any prying eyes... perfect for Mel, who laid in wait just over a small hill. </span></div></div>",

But all she was greeted with was a smiling face of Mel, who she now could see was standing in front of many hooded figures.<br>\r\n\"I suppose you'll be wanting an explanation... well, it's a long story.\" Mel stated coyly, \"But I won't get into it now. Let's just say that I didn't open up this bakery to make a profit off of delicious treats. Well, it was at first, but after a while I had to make a few, let's say, adjustments?\"<br>\r\n\"Mel... why are you so interested in making me fat?\" Sikana asked, even though she knew the answer wouldn't be pretty.<br>\r\n\"Why? Well, let's just say after I, heh, had my fun with that Draenei Alchemist, I grew a lust for it. I loved feeding people into helpless piles of fat. What I do is fatten people up to impossible weights with the Potions and Machines my colleagues have given me, and then I capture their soul to work for me, and the process repeats.\" Mel states, gesturing to all the hooded figures.<br>\r\n\"So all of these hooded things are...?\"<br>\r\n\"Souls. The Souls of those I've fattened up, and robbed of their lives.\" Mel finished Sikana's thought.<br>\r\n\"What do you do with the bodies?\" Sikana asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, they're kept alive in a state of constant hunger. Magic is certainly helpful to create a constant stream of food, I occasionally revisit them to play with their heaping piles of fat. It's like a giant mountain of gelatin, it's so fun!\"<br>\r\nSikana felt very dirty after hearing that, and didn't want that to be what remains of her on this planet.<br>\r\n\"Zeyana will come and save me, I just know it!\" Sikana stated.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's very unlikely. At this point she's probably halfway to that old Alchemist's place, and we have a little surprise for her there, as well.\" Mel laughed.</span></div></div>",

Considering that it was her who drug both of them into this... Strange and fattening case. Though with or without her laze of a sister, the draenei had to get there and find out what happened. With a huff, the draenei hopped on her guardsman's steed, adjusting the plates and mail of her armor so that they didn't pinch her newly acquired pudge. \"Hiyah!\" She shouted, snapping the reigns and kicking her hooves back. The mount galloped full speed down a cobblestone path, her location marked on her map...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly an hour, but Zeyana managed to make it near her pinpoint. All the while she was wondering what Sikana could possibly be doing to warrant her not showing up... Maybe she was captured, kidnapped, attacked? She threw around the idea back and forth, but the house she was looking for was right in front of her, forcing her to focus on the mission at hand. Appeared to be a semi-large farmhouse design. A large botanical greenhouse attacked on the side. The brush and overgrown crawling plants were already claiming the domain. A door looked like it was forced open in the front, and based on the plants creeping in; its been a while. Whoever broke in sure didn't mind waking the alchemist at an unreasonable time... Or breaking and entering. The draenei hopped off her mount, tying it to a hitching post out front.</span></div></div>",

You've fought worse foes than this, don't let these planks of wood get in your way!\" Zeyana roared, but it was no use. She'd have to find another way in.<br>\r\nKnowing this Alchemist on Draenor, she always kept her Greenhouse door unlocked. Zeya would have to hope and pray the same principal applied on Azeroth.<br>\r\nThankfully, it did, and she was able to enter Greenhouse. It was actually quite larger than the Greenhouse she had on Draenor, with all sorts of different plants she'd never seen before. Strangely enough, though, it seemed like that the Greenhouse had been kept in good condition despite nobody living here for several weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana continued to walk through the Greenhouse, searching for a door somewhere. As she did, she noticed the labels of different plants on Azeroth that the Alchemist had collected over the few weeks she was able to collect, she had plants such as Khadgar's Whisker, Peacebloom, Goldclover, and many others.<br>\r\nBut something strange was happening, the vines around the Greenhouse began shifting around. They began to take a strange form, that of a humanoid figure.<br>\r\nZeyana was enthralled by the strange plants, and was curious as to what was going on.<br>\r\nThat's when the figure began to speak. It's eyes glowed a deep evergreen, and spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draaeeenneeeii...\" It spoke, in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" Zeyana responded, feeling weird at the situation.<br>\r\n\"Wwwhhhaaatt aarreee yoouu dooing heeerreee...?\" The Plant questioned.<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for any signs of an Alchemist who lived here, do you know her?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"Ssshhheee iiisss nnooottt heeerrree... Aannnyymmooorree...\" The Plant answered, creepily.<br>\r\n\"Um... do you know what happened to her?\" Zeyana asked, now a bit more worried.<br>\r\n\"Lllleeaavvee... thhisss... pllaacceee...\" The Plant told her.<br>\r\n\"Not until I see what's inside!\" Zeyana stated.<br>\r\n\"Ttthheeennn tthhhiisss pplaaaccee... shall beeee... yooouurr toooomb...\" The Plant roared, and sent vines grasping at Zeyana's limbs.<br>\r\nZeyana evaded the Vines, and used her sword to cut apart the vines.<br>\r\n\"Yooouu cannot escaaaaapppeee!\" The Plant threatened, and began shooting balls of liquid poison at Zeyana, which she deflected with her shield.<br>\r\nShe charged at the living plant, ripping it to pieces. The last thing the plant did, was sputter out, \"Yooouuu... shhhaaalll... jjjooiiinn... heerrr... sssssoooooonnn...\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that about?\" Zeyana wondered.<br>\r\nShe thought no more of it when she found the door allowing her access inside the house, so she could investigate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Zeyana didn't see though, was an Arcane Eye viewing her actions within the Greenhouse. It was Mel's, and the living vines was one of her traps.<br>\r\nMel wasn't scared, though. She expected Zeyan to get through the first trap, she had many more planned for her along the way. After all, this tower was large! She had plenty of opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana entered the Tower, and saw the entrance. Vines that were holding the door shut were now lying dead on the floor, withered.<br>\r\n\"At least I can get out now, but that'll have to wait. I have to search the rest of this house...\" Zeyana stated, and looked around. In front of here were two possible directions, up a spiral staircase that lead to various rooms on the way, or directly in front of her was a doorway that lead to different rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana decided she'd start...</span></div></div>",

The Door in front of her seemed viable enough, and didn't look like it was going to blow up at a moment's notice, \"Alright, I take a quick check through here, see what I can find and book it back!\" She decided, inspecting the room she was standing in. The connecting hallway was lit with the warm glow of a torch, potted flowers and vines lining the walls, \"Makes sense for an alchemist... I suppose.\" Zeyana shrugged, turning around some, a wall of scuffed up frames, pictures of a dark skinned draenei posing in front of various landmarks (at least the ones she could recognize from her time on Azeroth) and plants with a smile on her face. The sight of the missing alchemist made the guardswoman frown a bit, seeing such a cheerful person just up and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding this room was as safe as she'd get, Zeyana noted to return here after each round of exploration. \"Alright... here goes nothing!\" The draenei gathered herself in a defensive stance, readying her shield for whatever could be on the other side. With a gulp she reached her arm over and pulled down on the handle, the click sounding fairly normal, slowly pushing the door open with a cliche creak, \"Damn...\" She muttered under her breath, seeing a torch light up... well whatever it was she was looking at, the vague shapes of the room not amounting to much at first glance. Putting one hoof forward... still clear... Zeyana gave a sigh of relief, pulling her shield down some and stepping into the room, just as the whistling of darts came shooting out of the darkness, \"WHOA!\" The expertly trained woman pulled her shield right back up to feel hard tinks and thuds crash and bounce off her steel. A full volley heading her way, a bead of sweat dripping down her forehead as the stream slowed down, a stray dart shooting straight at her leg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana gave a loud gasp, looking down in horror in what might be here last moments on this earth- but quickly breathed easy, the dart sticking straight out of her plate leg guards. \"Whew... thank the Naaru that didn't hit,\" She cooed, the whisking of arrows and darts coming to an abrupt halt. Zeyana pulled the dart out of her legplate with a loud huff, the thing a good 3 inches long and sharpened to an outrageously fine point, \"The vines were at least semi-interesting!\" She panted, still recovering from the near heart attack rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all imediate threats dealt with, Zeyana got a better look of the room now that she was actually inside it, \"Wow, this is quite the lavish...\"</span></div></div>",

It was quite beautiful.<br>\r\nShe had to search around for any clues, and be careful in case any more traps could be sprung. It was honestly a surprise for Zeyana that this Alchemist would keep her house so protected, a Vine Guardian, a Dart Trap? None of this seemed right for such a cheery, bright individual. It's as if someone didn't want her in here, to find anything.<br>\r\nShe searched through the cupboards, and only found baking supplies, normal for a kitchen. She searched in the oven, and even the Refrigeration device, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Except for the Fridge, which had nothing inside and wasn't working properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana was just about to call this place a bust, when Mel placed her next trap. The Oven began heating itself up, and the scent of a delicious aroma began filling the air.<br>\r\n\"Hm... odd, I don't recall seeing anything in the Oven. Wait, why is it turning on anyway?\" Zeyana wondered, heading over to the Oven. She opened the hatch, and saw a perfectly cooked Turkey. It seemed like it was coaxing her to eat it.<br>\r\nZeyana glowered, \"If you think I'm going to fall for your tricks, you crazy... House! I'm not.\" Zeyana yelled into the empty house. She left the Turkey sitting there, as she walked off to the door.<br>\r\nBut the door locked behind her.<br>\r\nZeyana tried to burst open the door, but it was a fruitless task. She was certain the door was open earlier, but somehow it managed to close and lock itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on...\" Zeyana groaned, \"This house is going to be the death of me!\"<br>\r\nJust then, the house began to shake momentarily, which triggered her to yell, \"I DIDN'T MEAN THAT LITERALLY!\"<br>\r\nZeyana looked behind her, and some smoke faded on a counter.

Besides, I didn't have time to eat before I left today.\"<br>\r\nZeyana went over and took the Turkey out of the Oven, looking at it's perfectly cooked meat.

She chewed, swallowed, and let out a satisfying \"Mmmm... That's good!\"<br>\r\nShe began eating it more swiftly, actually thinking the Turkey to be delicious. When she finished, she patted her stomach, leaving nothing but the bones.<br>\r\nZeyana let out a belch, and asked, \"Alright, Oven. Is that all?

Her keen eyes watched carefully as her hand slowly reached out... curling her fingers around the handle-and throwing down the hot door and ducking her head below the edge of her shield, half expecting some sort of food monster to come out and suck her in the oven. But luckily it was just the hearty scent of a perfectly grilled meat, the draenei peeking over the curve of the steel to inspect the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was exactly what the smell promised; a succulent, tender, mouthwatering Elekk steak... glistening like a beautiful untouched gem, meat perfectly cooked to Zeyana's exact specifications. As though it could read her mind... But before the guards-woman could question the strange contraption, she put aside her sword and shield, slipped on the oven mitts, and grabbed that masterpiece out the oven. The scent alone was calling to the draenei, \"By the Naaru... if that isn't the absolute... -perfect- cut of elekk..\" Her mouth watered just looking at it, forgetting her stomach was still visibly full from that whole turkey. The steak even had a knife and fork stuck in it, as if it just invited Zeyana to eat it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that she did. The draenei digging in like a ravenous beast, cutting off massive swathes of the monster steak, easily weighing a good 7 pounds, \"Mmmmpphh; oven, you sure do know how to... grill a steak?\" She thought for a second; \"Why would an oven be able to grill such a damned good bit of meat?\" But the thoughts were fruitless, resulting in a quick shrug to resume her feasting. \"But don't think we're on good terms, you key holding...\" Zeyana grumbled through her steak, nearly finishing the whole thing already, her stomach packing past it's normal full limits, looking almost humorously round on her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before she knew it, Zeyana had conquered the oven's second champion, dropping the fork and knife on the plate it came on, tossing it on top the one the turkey came on. The draenei licked her fingers clean of all that juicy goodness, patting her stomach, *Urp* \"Well fought steak, but I win this round.\" She returned her gaze to the oven, \"Have you another challenge, or are you just gonna sit there like a hunk of junk?\" Pointing accusingly, and as though in response, another cough of black smoke poofed out the cracks of the oven door...

My stomach hurts so bad, I can't keep eating like this!\" Zeyana spoke in a pained voice. But then she remembered, she had a vial of a strange potion with \"HUNGER ENHANCEMENT\" on the label.<br>\r\nShe checked, and there was a small amount left in it.

The fat began digesting into her weight, and she began just gaining weight as quickly as she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her delicious dessert, and fell down onto her now fat rump.

With a slight grimaced on her face, Zeyana planted her hands on them doughy hips, \"Mmph, well I won't let a few extra pounds slow down this Stormwind Guardswoman; nope!\" She nodded her head resolutely with a huff.

There had to be something this house was trying to keep her from finding, and Zeyana would find it.<br>\r\nShe began climbing the stairs, each step causing the wooden planks to creak. She wasn't sure whether this was due to her weight, or the age of the stairs, but she could feel the steps under heavy pressure. It made her worry they could give way at any minute, and the longer she walked, the more dangerous the fall got.<br>\r\nIt seemed like the Tower steps went on forever, maybe it was like Karazhan Tower, where it was bigger on the inside. Either way, she had been walking for nearly thirty minutes with no sigh of a door or a floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, after what felt like an eternity, she found a stone platform that lead to an entrance to a different room. She wiped her brow, thanking the Naaru that she didn't need to keep walking up these stairs.<br>\r\nThere was no door, it was just a stone doorway, with two styled pillars on either side. On the top was a label of what room she would be entering, and it read, \"Potions and Elixirs\".<br>\r\n\"Well, this should be an interesting room.\" Zeyana said to herself, and entered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the room, there was exactly what she expected; Rows upon rows of Potions, each of them labeled and, which many were similar color, each had a different shade of that color. No two potions were exactly the same, some had green with purple swirls, and some had strange particles within them.<br>\r\nZeyana rattled off a few names as she passed by them, \"Elixir of Dragon's Breath, Potion of Water Breathing, Potion of Masterful Intellect... This Alchemist really had a lot to pick from.\"<br>\r\nZeyana reached the end of the lines of Potions and Elixirs, and finally reached the end. There seemed to be a gap in between two potions, and realized that's where the Hunger Enhancement Potion was meant to go. What was strange, is that there seemed to be a button on the spot the potion would be.<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Zeyana thought, and took out the empty Potion Vial. She placed the potion on the button, but nothing happened.<br>\r\nZeyana felt that was a bit unfulfilling, she thought it would've done SOMEthing. She looked at the back and saw a plaque, another riddle:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Once all the Vials are filled to the top,<br>\r\nThen the stairs ending will soon show up.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Top and Up rhyme...\" Zeyana mentioned, noticing the strange form of riddle.<br>\r\nShe didn't think much of it, because it did tell her what she needed to do. She had to refill the Hunger Enhancement potion, and she didn't think it'd be as easy as filling it up with water. It probably meant the actual potion it stated.<br>\r\nSo she removed the vial and took it with her downstairs, which actually took only a few seconds. She must've truly been going up an endless staircase, and this was the only way to rectify it.<br>\r\nShe went back into the Greenhouse, in search of a cookbook of potions and elixirs to learn how to make this potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged through the dead vines, once a beautiful vine Guardian, now nothing more than a heaping pile of grass. She kind of felt bad, it just wanted to protect the Greenhouse from intruders. Zeyana promised herself she'd make up for it once this was all over.<br>\r\nZeyana kept looking around, and soon she found it. The Alchemist's Cookbook. She flipped through the pages, and landed on a page that seemed to be the Alchemist's handwriting, must've been her own unique recipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel, looking through the Arcane Eye, noticed that Zeyana had found the Cookbook, this is what she wanted.<br>\r\nMel decided to lay another trap for Zeyana, in an attempt to get the Cookbook and collect the Hunger Enhancement recipe she so desires...</span></div></div>",

Hmmm...\" She tapped her fingertips together, hoping an idea would come, \"OHhhh! Oh oh!\" The human gasped, \"I know! I'll pump that little weed full of arcane go-go juice and take that draenei captive! Or just leave her... details details!\" Mel readied her spells, looking through the arcane eye in order to direct the energy. The valves for watering the plants slowly opened up, a light sprinkle of water pouring through the shower-heads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana felt a sudden spray of water from above, tossing her shield above her as quick as her body would allow, \"Back beast! I'll tell you what's what!\" With a shout she waited for a returned roar, blood curdling scream, disgusting gurgle; anything really. But none were to be had, leaving the bloated draenei to lowering her shield and watching the 'automated' showerheads water all the plants, luckly the book was covered under a cover tarp, the table staying perfectly dry. Zeyana walked back over to the book, scanning over what she needed. \"Ahhh, so a bit of this...\" She scanned around the place, hoping she could recognize what each plant looked like. \"You!\" She called, reaching over to snip a few leaves of kingsfoil, \"Some of yoooouuu...\" The draenei turned around, plucking a stem of Fireweed, bundling it with the other herb. \"A few sanguine hibiscus and...\" The guardswoman kept up with her scanning and plucking, trying to gather up all the herbs she needed, which was honestly quite a lot. \"Suppose if you need something that makes you... need a lot of something, you need a lot of something to go in...?\" Zeyana shook her head, leaving the thoughts of an alchemist to an alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Zeyana was oblivious to the pile of vines she chopped up earlier, their shriveled husks blossoming back to life. Mel had poured arcane energy straight into the empty dead vines before starting the watering process, giving the blossoming creature a far more empowered structure. The vines gathered to form it's humanoid shape once more, though looking more like a chubby female than anything else, the freshly watered plants giving it an added boost to size, \"Oohhhhhh drrraaaeeeeneeeeiiii....\" The voice spoke, coming off stronger than before.<br>\r\nZeyana turned her head around fast enough to almost snap her own neck, \"What did you just say, you...\" She gulped, seeing the vines back to full strength, the entire side of the greenhouse engulfed in flowering vines.<br>\r\n\"I tooooldd yooou you woould finnnd nnnoottthhing...\" The creature gave a deep laugh, lashings of vines balling up.<br>\r\n\"Y-You shut your trap, you overgrown weed!\" Zeyana dropped her herbs, pulling her sword and shield out, ready for the attack.<br>\r\n\"Yooouuuuu willll beeee miiinnneee!\" The vines hissed, a rope of them lashing out to strike at Zeyana's primed shield, a large thunk of steel n heavy bark.<br>\r\n\"Not in your dreams!... You don't even dream!\" The draenei shouted, an undercut slash coming from under her shield, lopping the head of the vine off and stomping forward at full force, her added bulk making for a lot more draenei to charge, sending her jiggly bits bouncing all over, not to slow the rage filled warrior though. \"RAAAaahHHh!\" She shouted, swinging her blade every which way, some connecting, others slashing at the air, it made no difference for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine creature was actually caught off guard, finding itself pulling back to escape the draenei's 'weedwacker stance', balling up vines to protect herself, trying to send a rogue vine to creep around the advancing warrior.<br>\r\n\"I'll show you, you... you over-glorified defense system!\" Zeyana was nearing the chubby plant itself, \"Submit now or face my fuurrrry!\" She shouted, practically frothing at the mouth, her blade inches away from the Vine's 'neck'. Because despite the creature's willingness to attack her, she didn't want to cut the thing down without a second... third chance. \"Help me make this potion, and we can go our separate, not dying ways!\" She shouted as her final offering.</span></div></div>",

Accept it's offerings and you will be free.\" Her head dropped down, a groan escaping her lips, \"Ohhhh come ON!\" She shouted, crumbling up the note and throwing it aside, \"I don't have time for this crap...\" Zeyana mumbled under her breath, fumbling for her key from before. \"Hmm.. where'd I put that..\" She searched her satchel and belt pouches, scraping at the bottom of every one; no key to be had, \"I know it was here somewhere...\" The draenei patted down every inch of her clothes and armor, even checking down her cleavage for any sight of the key. \"You've got to be kidding...\" Her heart sank, she must have dropped the key back in the greenhouse when that beast pulled her down! Zeyana snarled, pulling out her sword, \"No more games, house!\" She roared, striking at the door- but instead of splinters she was greeted with a magical barrier, deflecting her blow, sending her sword flying out her hands and planting straight in a wooden beam. \"House... you're starting to get on my nerves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zeyana fruitlessly charged into the door over and over with her shoulder, the oven started up it's magic once more. The draenei fell right back into the same trap she fell for the first time, seemingly resting like a bad record player. With a loud weaze, the oven popped out another belch of black smoke, signaling the first trial was to begin. \"Zeyana, why did you ever get in this mess?\" She shook her head, looking up at the ceiling, the smell of freshly cooked meat taunting her nostrils. \"Mreaah, fine! I'll play your stupid game for now, you hunk of junk.\" The blue skinned woman tossed a pan in frustration, kicking her hoof into the wood floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the oven the pudgy draenei went, as though it were the walk of shame, pulling down the oven door and taking the 5 pound roast out the oven, \"First course is served, right?\" She bemused, taking her time to sadly cut the meat. though as she took her first bite, the taste was enough to crack a smile on her lips, nod her head up and down a lil and say, \"Mmm...\" And before long, the draenei was tearing through every last ounce...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA satisfied belch echoed through the Kitchen, Zayena wiping her mouth clean on a nearby napkin. Her stomach lightly distended from the meal. Apparently the hunger potion from before had the adverse effect of permantly stretching her stomach's capacity. \"Okay oven, just get it over with and send me your next round of torture!\" Zeyana taunted, tapping her hoof impatiently. </span></div></div>",

It seemed like the machine was going through a ton of stress, trying to push out what it needed to.<br>\r\n\"What's going on...?\" Zeyana wondered, moving over the the Oven to see what the problem was.<br>\r\nShe couldn't see through the choking smoke, so she had to stand back and wait for it to be done with... whatever it was trying to do. It seemed like it was clogged or something...<br>\r\nBut then, something began to form through the smoke. It didn't look like a steak, though, as she expected it to be... it looked like something else.<br>\r\n\"What on Azeroth is that?\" Zeyana wondered, watching as the smoke cleared.<br>\r\nFrom the Oven, a large hunk of meat was squishing its way out. It looked much more massive than anything Zeyana had seen before, and it was forcing itself through this small Oven.<br>\r\nMore of the large steak became visible as she watched the Oven shove it out with all of it's might, and when the entire thing came through, it was nearly twice the size of her standing up!<br>\r\n\"You want me to eat THIS?\" Zeyana asked, \"That's insanity!\"<br>\r\nZeyana took out the Hunger Enhancement Potion, \"Unless I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This potion has caused me nothing but problems, I can't drink it again! Even if, I'd need to down this whole thing if I wanted to get through this goliath of a steak.\" Zeyana argued.<br>\r\nZeyana looked around, hoping she might find an alternate escape route. Another door, a window... But her luck was naught.<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't seem like there's any other option...\" Zeyana stated dismally.<br>\r\nSince she had no choice, she popped the top off the potion, and downed the entire thing. It reacted poorly in her stomach, causing it to jiggle ceaselessly. She grew hungry, and a ravenous look grew in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Must... Eat...\" She slobbered over the giant steak, and then dove in like a hungry dog. She ripped it apart, taking apart large pieces with just her teeth and hands.<br>\r\nHer armor began tightening to the point of pain, and popped off of her naturally, leaving her in her leather clothing beneath. She didn't let this deter her, she wasn't even halfway through the whole steak yet!<br>\r\nIt was a juicy, tender steak that didn't require much work to eat through. It was made deliciously perfect, and Zeyana loved its flavor. Thus she ate even more.<br>\r\nHer body, just like before, expanded with fat quickly. The sheer size of the steak would cause anyone to put on a significant amount of weight, but paired with the Hunger Enhancement potion, you've got a recipe for large pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana finally finished the massive steak after a good hour of eating, and like before, she fell down on her butt, resting against the wall next to the Oven.<br>\r\nShe looked down, and was dismayed to see her new, massive body. She was large enough to probably rival Sikana's new girth.<br>\r\n\"Please say that was it... I can't handle any more, this is already going to take so long to work off...\" Zeyana pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Machine sputtered and coughed, and...</span></div></div>",

But either way, the draenei took her situation for granted. It coulda been much worse, after all. Though the next problem came with the issue of size. Her leather gear was practically painted on, stretching thin to cover her chest and legs, doughy belly having grown the msot and popped off the piece originally covering it. With a grunt, the guardswoman, clutched at the side of the oven, using it to help her stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheew, I knew I shouldn't have poked fun at my sister...\" Zeyana planted her hands on the meaty hips she now sported, \"Karma always...\" Turning around to inspect her rear, the draenei wasn't exactly sporting the same tone and slimness she once was, two large doughy cheeks packed tight into her leather leggings, \"Comes back to bite you in the ass...\" With a frown, Zeyana kicked aside her armored plates, all she was left with now was her shoulderplates, gloves and shin guards, and even then they were on there last straps. \"Okay Zeyana, keep your head on straight, it's just a few extra pounds.\" With a deep breath for composure, she refocused on leaving this accursed kitchen for good. \"Alright oven, good riddance!\" Zeyana hissed, kicking the side of the thing with a chubby leg. The thing grumbled for a moment before coughing out more smoke-dozens of keys shooting out the front at the draenei in response, \"Ooo, ouch! Damn, alright alright, sorry!\" She groaned, walking away from the thing before it took her ankles off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZayena took a moment to pick up her shield off the ground, her belly doubling over in two distinct rolls as she did, \"Can't forget this... or this...\" The draenei walked over to the sword skewered pole, pulling back on the hilt till it wedged free, \"Ooof...\" She clutched the sword in her hand, noting her chubby digit's new grip. And with that, Zayene made her way back to the door, unlocking it with a satisfied \"Aaaah\" And stepping into the wide open hall, careful not to step over the pile of glass that the arcane eye once animated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Zayena was still as clueless as when she started.

She heaved her weight around as best she could, working up a good huf and puff, \"Shelves... shelves...\" She brushed her fingers against each row of potions, the room surprisingly long. \"That eye can't -huff- lift anything..\" Zeyana moved through her thought process to eliminate any options, \"So anything with a lid... a drape...\" So far nada, the boxes she did see were only small crates at best, likely only able to hold a gnome; even that idea stretching the bounds of actuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, come on come on!\" Zeyana raced, her plump tail waggling back and forth behind her, nearly smashing over glass vials and potions. \"A cabinet, a trunk... -hurff- anything!\" She mumbled under her breath, hearing the fumed taunts call out just an earshot away from the entrance to the room.<br>\r\n\"RRaaagh! I'll make you fatter than your bovine of a sister!\" Mel called through the arcane eye, \"Make you regret the day you learned to walk on two feet... hooves... whatever!\" The 'baker' yelled furiously, the magic device buzzing through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe draenei didn't have much time, and if she didn't find something soon, that eye would certainly do... whatever exactly it intended on doing. Zeyana lumbered down the room even quicker, her steps rattling the alchemical vessels clink together subtly. That's when she spotted it! A large pile of packing blankets, laid out on the floor in the corner, looking dusty enough to have not been touched in a good half decade, but it was Zeyana's only option! She made a b-line for the southwest corner of the room, quickly picking up as many as she could and moving them aside, trying to make enough room for her to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eye buzzed past the frame of the storage room, only to quickly turn around after realizing it hit it's destination. \"Alright porky, where're you now?\" Mel hissed, the eye slowly entering the room and scanning the adjacent walls of potions.<br>\r\nLuckily the eye didn't quite excel at hearing, as Zeyana frantically tore the last blanket away and slid down on ground, panting heavily and tossing the dusty blankets right on top of herself, and if she was lucky, her bulk would easily pass as a pile of scarcely used storage precautions. The draenei settled in and hushed herself as best she could, trying to keep deathly still, despite the massive pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel's arcane construct slowly rounded every tall stacked shelf of potions, because despite only being broken an hour ago, she had no idea Zeyana packed on so much weight, figuring the girl was chubby at best and could still hide in far more space conscious areas. \"Hmmm, are you in here love?\" Mel groaned, quickening her eyes pace through the maze of small boxes and glistening potions... checking behind every nook and cranny in search of the draenei who fooled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana just tried her best not to sneeze or breath too hard, as even the slightest movement at the wrong time would surely result in an angry orb of magic prowess. She stayed still, unmoving and silent, despite not hearing or seeing anything for a good long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good time waiting... and then some... Zeyana was certain the eye had moved somewhere else in search of her. And just as she was about to sneeze and pull off every blanket, she heard Mel's voice ring out, \"Baaaah, she's not in here?!\" A loud buzzing flying right past her and off in the direction she came in, a sigh of relief pushing past Zeyana's lips.</span></div></div>",

Otherwise, this whole tower was a waste of time.\" Zeyana told herself, as she placed the potion onto the button. The potions all lit up the room in a glorious purple hue.

The wall began to spit in two, slowly forming a doorway into a long, dark corridor with a single Torch near the entrance.<br>\r\n\"Well that's not ominous.\" Zeyana said sarcastically. She headed over and grabbed the Torch, this doorway seemed to be much larger than the Storage Room's door, as if it was meant for someone of Zeyana's size. That said, it was much easier for her to make her way through this corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of her hoofsteps echoed through the long and empty hallway, there didn't seemed to be any visible end to this, but there had to be something.<br>\r\nShe kept walking, hoping at some point she'd reach and exit. The corridor was old, moss-filled, and dusty, as if it hadn't been used for many years. But Zeyana hadn't even been on Azeroth for more than a month, this had to have been made by a previous owner.<br>\r\nBut that said, what was at the end of this? It seemed strange, and somewhat scared her. Nevertheless, she kept on walking. She didn't want to come back to Stormwind empty-handed after the things she's seen and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on waddling down, her weight beginning to be more and more of a burden on her. She tried fanning herself, but she was so tired and sweaty from all the movement.<br>\r\n\"You've had years of training on Draenor... Don't let a little weight pull you down...\" Zeyana forced herself to keep moving. But she knew that this weight wasn't very 'Little'. She was a whale, an overweight whale. Even the Whales would call her a Whale as an insult.<br>\r\nZeyana felt discouraged, but still pressed on. Maybe she could find a Weight Loss potion on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter continuing down the corridor for what felt like hours, she finally found something different. It was a bright light, much more bright than anything she'd ever seen in her life.<br>\r\nShe shielded her eyes, but kept walking forward, staggering her way closer and closer....<br>\r\nHer eyes soon became adjusted, and found she was inside a glowing, sparkly room. It reminded her of the Exodar, with many different gems and crystals jutting out of random places, the Draenei architecture. It seemed odd why this Alchemist would keep herself so separated from her heritage.<br>\r\nIn the middle of this room was a giant, blue obelisk. Something that Zeyana has never seen in her life, it had many strange markings on it. Zeyana studied them, but had little time to, for she heard the sound of a portal opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case it was danger, Zeyana hid behind the Obelisk, and waited to see what appeared from the Portal.

The hum of the otherworldly draenic technology that Zeyana hadn't seen in who knows how long. It all felt rather homey for the warrior. Her eyes eventually adjusted to the bright light though, her eyes clearing up and growing wide-eyed. So much to look at! The obelisk was at the top of her list however, as even though her people used crystals to power their technology, it didn't look to be of that origin. The hefty draenei looked it up and down as the silhouette appeared, slowly walking towards her. It was definitely female, that much was certain... draenei features...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't quite expecting any guests...\" The voice eased, a smooth, but heavily accented draenei spoke, \"You must've found the way through the traps... falling prey to a few of them as well...\" She trailed, clearly looking Zeyana up and down.

No need to use such stiff terms with me.\" She dismissed with a wave of her hand, \"But you should be quite safe here, I assure you.\" The woman gave a warm smile to give show of her welcoming tone. \"But back to your previous inquiry, because after all, you -do- deserve a bit of light on the situation...\"</span></div></div>",

Curse my pride, I had to see if I could do it.\"<br>\r\nThe portal showed Mehlaa stuffing herself full of food, she was way more massive than either Sikana or Zeyana combined.<br>\r\n\"So... How'd you escape?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"I didn't. This is just a Mirror Image I cast, I told Mel, that monster, that I'd go grab the Recipe for her, but instead I created this labyrinth within my own home. I intended Mel to go through this trap house, to teach her a lesson, but... I guess you beat her to the punch.\" Mehlaa explained, \"In fact, this is also a trap. I just have to give the word, and the Obelisk will exchange the weight from me to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Well.. please don't do that.\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think it's our only option now.\" Mehlaa said.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Zeyana roared, \"No, absolutely not! I don't want to become an obese blob!\"<br>\r\n\"Look, it won't be permanent! There's someone else in here with me, If you can distract here with the Arcane Eye she summoned here with your immobile flab, we can jump her!\" Mehlaa explained. Zeyana had a feeling she was referring to Sikana.<br>\r\n\"But... What if something goes wrong?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing will. I just need you to trust me. Let me transfer the fat of us to you, and when this is all over I'll work on a Weight Loss potion for you.\" Mehlaa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much consideration, Zeyana...</span></div></div>",

And you're a Stormwind Guard, no?\" She asked, pointing at the ill-fitting shoulder and wrist guards. \"You'll be doing good for the people of Stormwind.\" The dark skinned dranei eased, \"As there's the possibility she has even more people under her thumb!\"<br>\r\n\"You make a good point, Mehlaa. I'd shake your hand, if you weren't a trick of the eyes.\" Zeyana's doubts were finally dispelled, she'd do what no one else could!... and grow impossibly fat! \"And one last thing! My sister is likely the one with you, if anything goes sour, at least make sure she makes it alright.\" The draenei gave a final set of nods, \"Do your thing, Mehlaa!\" Zeyana struck a heroic pose, looking up at the ceiling in wait for... the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMehlaa's mirror image walked to some sort of arcane power console, fiddling with it's knobs and switches, the mirror image tapping away at instruments the guards-woman couldn't see. The portal showing Mehlaa's true form still wide open, giving Zeyana a perfect view of the show about to go down, \"Now, do be ready for... quite the jolt...\" The alchemist mentioned before typing in the final sequence, a countdown tone slowly ringing out.<br>\r\nZeyana gulped, \"For my sister... and the good of the people...\" She winced for a moment, giving a hard gulp as the final 5 digits came ticking down, peaking her eye open to watch the portal, as an instrument from the ceiling folded down, a funnel on the end of it.<br>\r\n\"The funnel is just a way to focus all the energy, don't be alarmed and let it do it's thing, Zeyana...\" The dark skinned woman warned, her image starting to fade, \"Good luck, and watch the portal!\" She called, her voice slowly fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing in front of her hummed up, glowing pink and purple, fixing just inches from her face. Zeyana did her best to watch on the portal, instead of the arcane thing in front of her. Regardless, the end started to hum to life, the final number sounding off... and with a mechanical buzz, a line of pink light shined right at Zeyana, spreading a hot warmth right over her; still striking that heroic pose as a boost to confidence. The heat spread over every inch of her body, a light layer of sweat on her already porked up frame. The warmth reached it's height, before a new buzz came out, a new line of purple energy spreading over Zeyana, the effects starting to make themselves known almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue skinned woman felt a growing sensation, but kept her eyes glued on the portal, seeing Mehlaa's frame slowly but surely start to melt away...</span></div></div>",

She didn't enjoy it, but she'd have to face this to save everyone, \"How much longer...?\" Zeyana asked, sitting on her now immense rump.<br>\r\n\"I'm still pretty large, and we still need to account for the other Draenei in here...\" Mehlaa explained.<br>\r\n\"You mean Sikana?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"Wait, you know her?\" Mehlaa asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes... She's my sister. She got caught up in this nonsense to begin with, and it doesn't make it any better that she had a Eating Problem.\" Zeyana explained, but then laughed, \"This might at least keep her from eating so much... Hopefully.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Zeyana. Once I reach my thin self, I'll search for your friend, and then you'll have to be the siphon for her weight as well.\" Mehlaa stated.<br>\r\n\"I understand. I just hope I don't outgrow this place, it'd be social suicide for me to be seen in public like... this!\" Zeyana pouted, slapping her now massive fat-filled belly. Zeyana was now easily twice the size she was earlier, and wasn't even halfway done with the transfer.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Zeyana. I know it seems bleak, but I'll get us through this without any unwanted pounds.\" Mehlaa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Zeyana was a quarter the size of the room she was in, but wasn't overflowing or breaking anything. Her belly was very squishy, and could fit an entire Ettin, if it were sitting down. Her butt, each cheek was the size of Mehlaa. But the good news is that Mehlaa returned to her normal weight.<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you very much, Zeyana!\" Mehlaa's projection bowed.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever... Just find Sikana and then stop Mel!\" Zeyana yelled down, her head on top of a mountain of fat.<br>\r\nMehlaa nodded, and the image began to fade.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the Eye, Zeyana!\" Mehlaa stated, \"She'll never find this place, trust me!\"<br>\r\nZeyana nodded, as Mehlaa's Image faded entirely, leaving Zeyana alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMehlaa woke up from her slumber, back against a cold, iron wall.<br>\r\n\"Good job, Arcane Me!\" Mehlaa smiled, picking herself up. Thankfully, the chains were meant to fit her fat body, and slipped right off her. But now it was time to search for Sikana's chamber, it couldn't be too hard. Mel couldn't have that many races locked up, right?<br>\r\nShe pulled out her hairpin, and used it to unlock the door. She went through, and saw she was only one of many races Mel had locked up!<br>\r\n\"How could she do this...?\" Mehlaa wondered, looking at the rows and rows of similar looking doors, only labeled by different races and gender.<br>\r\nBut when she looked inside some of them, she saw that they were empty. Obviously, Mel was planning on taking this operation farther. She saw that her Cell was unique, as it was labeled \"FIRST SUBJECT\".<br>\r\n\"The first, and the last, Mel...\" Mehlaa stated dramatically.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't exactly sure what she'd find, but the room was certainly dark and vast, lavish draenic carpets and decorations. \"Mel themed the rooms...?\" Mehlaa felt a shiver down her spine upon realization that it was likely the same story for all the other rooms, save hers. She couldn't see the entire interior of the room, but couldn't see Sikana either, forcing her to have to go inside. The alchemist pulled the deadbolts back and unhinged the chain locks, \"She really doesn't want her coming out of this one...\" She grumbled, fiddling with all the restraints; the more she looked at Sikana's room and precautions, it became obvious that Mel had been upgrading the newer cells while they were still thin enough to possibly escape, while Mehlaa was already too fat to even move in her previous living situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few minutes undoing all the locks, the draenei could finally open the door, pulling back with all her strength on the heavy iron door. \"Grraahhh...\" She grunted, finally able to wedge it open far enough to slip past. The mage was feeling her mana start to slowly flow back, snapping her fingers to conjure up a flame bright enough to at least light the vicinity, giving her a more clear look at the room itself. It appeared to be a stone, prison-like room, just decorated with tacky draenic furniture and rugs. Any real draenei could tell it was just cliche. From the back of the room however, Mehlaa heard a faint munching, \"Sikana, is that you? I'm here to bust us outta here!\" The alchemist hissed, \"Your sister is helping us!\" She called, walking down a while longer till she found the source...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana was in fact in the cell, though looking quite tubby. Sitting on a mount of draenic silk pillows, large tray of sweets stacked up high beside her, the draenei eating away as though she didn't have a choice, \"Sikana, it is you, right? Your sister didn't exactly give me the perfect description...\" The mumbled, looking up and down the draenei's form with wide eyes. She wasn't as fat as Mehlaa was, but if she could guess, the girl wasn't looking like she was going to start a sprint any time soon... </span></div></div>",

I want to be thin again!\" Zeyana demanded.<br>\r\nMehlaa nodded, and began the transfer once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeyana felt a small growth as the transfer commenced, but she barely added any weight to her already massive figure. But, internally, it would still be a ton to work off.<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're done! Let's go find Mel and stop her!\" Mehlaa announced.<br>\r\n\"But... I must eat...

Eat...\" Sikana repeated, she began eating the food again, causing her body to once again bloat up in weight. Mel must have a new way of fattening up subjects, and is no longer in need of her potion.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I'm going at this alone. Mel may be a monster, but she's not fighter.

I need you to distract anyone who comes in here from Sikana, and make sure Sikana keeps on stuffing her mouth. Understood?\" Mehlaa asked.<br>\r\n\"So you want me to ENCOURAGE her to eat more?? How, even?\" Zeyana asked.<br>\r\n\"It's our only option. I'll keep the link between here and my tower open, and you just need to act as a voice in her head pushing her to eat even more to keep her mouth shut. Don't worry, I won't be gone for more than an hour.

I don't want to have gained all this, made my sister grow, AND leave Mel around to do this to more people...\" The guards-woman sighed, watching Mehlaa run back the way she came and close the door behind her. Whatever her plan was, it had better work... Because the feeling of the added weight was already starting to bear on her, and if it wasn't gone relatively soon, she wasn't going to be happy. However, her attention was brought back to her sister, Sikana. She was still thin (thinner than she'd ever been, truth be told), but Zeyana wasn't sure what exactly Mel did to her. She looked a bit absent, as though she wasn't really there, hypnotized, mind-controlled, whatever it was, it wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSikana munched on a massive slice of cake, shaking her head slowly, \"Must... tell... Mellll...\" She groaned, whatever had tricked her was compelling the draenei to report the intruder.<br>\r\n\"No no, Sik. You need to stay!\" Zeyana quickly spat, trying to ease her sister into sitting back down, \"Just take a seat and relax, okay?\" She tried to keep her voice low and easy, but it was a bit hard seeing her sister in such a condition.<br>\r\nSikana didn't really slow down however, \"Mrpph... intruders!\" She groaned, her eyes glazing over.<br>\r\nZeyana's mind bounced all over, how could she keep her in one place? \"If you leave, you won't have anymore food to eat!\" She called, watching her sister stop to think about it for a moment, swallowing what was left of the massive slice of cake.<br>\r\n\"Food?\" She questioned with a tilt of the head, \"I can't eat if I go out there...\" She reasoned, slowly returning back to the pile of pillows, ploping back down on her backside and grabbing another slice.<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Zeyana reassured, \"How is it, hmm? It looks pretty tasty!\" The draenei tried to sound as calm as possible. Plus, if she were being honest, that cake did look pretty damned good. \"Chocolate, yeah?\" Zeyana licked her lips, looking up and down the cake through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... It's good.\" Sikana manged, scarfing down a few big bites, one hand reaching down to massage her rounding middle, \"Chocolate with strawberry *urp* filling...\" Sikana stifled a belch, taking no tiem to return to her treat.<br>\r\nZeyana bit her cheek, \"Good! Just keep on eating in then, yeah?\" She had to do her best to encourage Sikana to eat, by the looks of it, she'd get up and run if her mind ever snapped out of a full food focused mentality. As her sister ate, Zeyana noticed Sikana already gaining back some of that weight that was only just added to her immense frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sikana was done with the cake, she was already looking a bit pudgy around the edges, thighs rounding out and squishing together, rear bloating up and getting all doughy once more; the definition it had previously melting under a layer of fat. Her stomach getting the largest proportions, sticking out in a round pot, squishing over her thighs softly, rounding chest resting pert on her growing mound of a belly. Overall, she seemed rather pleased to have Zeyana encouraging her to eat up all the sweets, happily munching up the cake with a slight smear over her lips. </span></div></div>",

Like Atlas, she had her arms and back pressed against the celling, as burst after burst made her green, sweaty muscles grow and grow. She grunted and moaned, as dust and pieces of stone began falling from the ceiling. The right side of her big, meaty leg bend the cell bar with a snapping cling and clang. The helpful troll was now completely buried in her cheeks, but he remained calm about the situation. The whole room was rumbling louder and louder, as Kuran expanded and swelled with roaring effort. Suddenly the celling gave away in a big crash, stone, mortar and brittle exploded in a thick, dust cloud, and out of it rose a giant, panting, green head with a half-shaved haircut, and clenched tusks in anger. <br>\r\nThen her arms and chest came into view, these muscular, long and wide arms were tight as she had folded her hands into fists, swelling and pulsing with anger, her chest was bloated, modestly big for her size, and had two dark green, nipples hardening on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she smelt the fresh air and felt the sun on her bare skin, she roared and threw her fists up into the air, angry and sweaty, she was finally free from her tight prison. And as she climbed out of her newly made hole into Stormwind\u2019s streets, the citizens watched as a giant and slightly hairy green leg plowed into the cobblestone payment and so did two, green, giant arms as well, so a huge and muscular orc, could raise her last leg and size up from the prison cell.<br>\r\nShe was finally up, and rose to her giant new stature, having grown to 40 feet now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked, first down at her big, long, sharp nailed toes, then up at her muscular, wide legs who got wider and more muscular as they went up to her broad, green hips. Between them was a barbaric, wild, untamed, black rainforest of a crotch, whose black trail led to a well-toned, six packs abs, which stretched over her big and nice stomach with a giant belly button in the middle. Then came her chests which were not enormous for her size, but nicely round and perky and with piercings at their dark green nipples, fit for a warrior like her. Her broad shoulders swelled with muscles down along her arms, who were now as wide as cartwheels and strong enough to break one in half too. She looked down at them, disgusted, snarling, with her teeth clenched, winkle marks at her nose and narrow, dark eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYOU'RE ALL ANNOYING BUGS!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stepped on a nearby, stunned Stormwind citizen, which made the payment go boom, and the citizen\u2019s bones crack. A mass panic spread, people flet, guards didn\u2019t quit know what do to but tried to stand their ground with their weapons drawn towards her. She roared at some, and swung her fists down at some guards, crushing them in a hail of dust and pebbles. This convinced the others to flee, and she began chasing them, however they ran through a gate to the mage quarter, which was too small for Kuran to fit through. She immediately tried to get on all four and reach her arm inside the gate, weaving it around to catch any humans in range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFINE!\u201d Kuran roared as she got up from her attempt: \u201cHide behind your little walls, behind inside your little houses! I will break all like the giant, hungry wolf I\u2019m!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began kicking the wall to the mage quarter, and unknown to her, she had been steadily growing the entire time since her escape. <br>\r\nShe even barley noticed in her fit of rage, as she got bigger and bigger, that her kicks where making a greater and greater impact, she could even see above the wall now. Roaring and panting, she finally broke through the wall, and the inhabitants of the mage quarter covered in fear as a giagantic, sweaty, green orc, stomped her way into the area, she was 80 feet now, twice her original size, as she emerged from the dust.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBUGS!\u201d Kuran wasted no time, she stomped her big, sweaty, feet down at any person she could spot, they had gotten really dirty now, as grass, pebbles, blood and dust covered her entire sole bottom.<br>\r\nEither she did that or she crouched down, to smash them with her giant fists. At the corner of her eye she saw a group trying to flee through the other gate of the mage quarter, which quickly made her jump down at them, like it was a wrestling match, splatting them out with a giant, earthshaking boom, under her massive, heavy and sweaty body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe got up again, some flat husks of skin of her now former victims stuck to her body, she roared into the air, and began now to wreck the surrounding houses as the quarter was empty for people. This felt so good! She had always dreamt of treating the alliance as the vermin they were, she even began eating them now, as her giant fingers reached inside the house for hiding citizens. She munched and smashed and grew, until the entire mage quarter was a ruin, except the tall mage tower in the middle of the quarter itself. <br>\r\nKuran was now 100 feet tall, she stumbled towards the mage tower, the last remaining structure in this quarter, it now only reached to her hair crotch, which felt itchy after all this killing. <br>\r\nKuran wondered what to do with it.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The idea excited her, gobbling up Stormwind in her fat, savage vagina, how humiliating, that such a great city should fall subject to her hungry and demanding pussy. She began rubbing her scruffy lips, moaning loudly. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d muttered Kuran: \u201cYou will all be devoured by my giant, growing, hairy, cunt!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe placed herself above the tower and adjusted her pussy above the tower\u2019s spire, she then used the spire to scratch her itchy, wild snatch. Black hair engulfed the top of the tower as Kuran happily moaned by the sensation of her itch being sated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foreplay was over, and now she began to crouch down and sink her lips down along the tower. Oh, it was so big, filling up her girth capacity completely, Keanu led out a loud moan, this was going to be good. She grew even more during this attempt to insert the mage tower into her, which made it easiere for her to slide it in. She moaned and grunted as her expanding cunt now could handle the mage tower much better now, and slowly she began to ride it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooOOOOoohh, fuck yes, get into my cunt! That\u2019s all you humans are good for, working hard to build giant structures that can satisfice our savage desires!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to ride it even harder, the bricks now cracking and groaning during this rough treatment, the entire tower was now slippery with her jucies, making it easiere for her to slide it in and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became violent now, Kuran moaning louder and louder while pinching and fondling her breasts, a sweaty hunter who was dominating its prey, until it showed submission to its giant master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she broke the tower off its foundation with little effort, and her muscular, broad back laid down into the ruins of the mage quarter, where she with thick, spread legs high into the air, began railing the tower back and forth into her needy cunt, every thrust making the structure weaker and weaker. She grew bigger still, close to cumming now and her moans had turned into roars as she flexed her body and clutched her free hand into a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant eruption of wetness exploded from Kuran\u2019s massive vagina, as her entire body flexed and harden at the release, oh it felt good, and Kuran let go on everything she was doing. Her legs felt down from their flight with earthshaking booms, crushing walls, and trees on impact, her hairy snatch looked like it was slowly melting, liquid kept boring out like it was a fountain, creating a big pound between her massive, green legs. Inside was the crumbled bricks and crushed planks that remained of the mage tower, it stuffed her out, looking like a broke dam where the water was purring out of the cracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt back, relieved and relaxed, with her head lying down in the ruins of the mage quarter, same as her arms.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her shoulders got broader and her arms swelled longer and stronger, Sila led out a grunting noise as she struck a pose with her growing arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman looked at Sila broad, big feet whose sharp nailed toes Sila wiggled in the dirt as they grew longer and longer, he then looked up at their growing calves who just now burst out of their braces, her long and muscular legs rose up to even more wide and muscular hips, fit for a fertile mother as herself. Between them where an immense, growing pussy, covered in savage, black, bushy pubic hair, her lips where puffy and seemed to be growing bigger down there while being soaked in juices. And then there was the belly, big, bloated and was groaning while growing forward, it was humongous and a ripped eight pack stretches over it. Resting on to of it where Sila\u2019s breasts who now hung above the pregnant belly liked a overflown muffin top, it was ridiculous, the slushed and churned with milk, getting bigger and fuller by the second as Sila grew taller and taller, they were crowned with dark green giant areolas and nipples who now was the size of the shaman\u2019s head. And on top of it all was Sila\u2019s big head, still with her barbaric half shaved haircut, and tusks sticking out of her mouth. She looked angry as she ripped off her bra which was hanging around her left arm, who now where wide as ancient totems and strong enough to take one up and throw it. She then grew a few more inches and stroked her pregnant belly while moaning happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, shaman.\u201d Sila groaned as she grew another few inches: \u201cNow I can make sure that this tribe will get a big and strong chieftain to lead them one day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the green, naked, fertility goddess walked out of the shaman\u2019s cave and back to he village.

The night elf was caged inside a supplies room. Upon Jael entering the room, the night elf instantly was struck with fear in Jael's huge size.<br>\r\n\"You bastard! You injured my sub commander!\", The night elf male rogue didn't care and spoke \"Did that fat ass of yours shield him from that blast?\", \"What did you say you tiny worm!\", the night elf wasn't looking too brave now, Jael was directly outside his cage and towered above him. \"N...nothing\". \"I see I be playing nice tomorrow mon\", then Jael punches the elf in the face knocking him out.<br>\r\nNightfall came...<br>\r\nJael was laying inside her personal cabin in the far center of the base thinking off what she will do to the night elf.<br>\r\nIn the morning Jael entered the storage closest to begin interrogating her prisoner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tava Smallhoof was something of a midget in terms of tauren size. Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad, she wasn't three feet tall or anything, but everyone had to admit that compared to a typical female cowgirl she was on the tiny side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite constant attempts at binge eating and twenty different kinds of diets, Tava still remained thin as a stick. She didn't even have much in the way of breasts, let alone hips or thighs. To top it all off, she stood a good foot or so shorter than most of the ladies of Thunderbluff, making it hard to pick her out in a crowd. No one really made fun of her for her appearance, after all any tauren was considered a gift from the Earthmother, but she still couldn't help but feel neglected somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at her age most tauren girls looked into getting married and bearing a calf or two for the tribe, Tava spent most of her time focused on her calling as a shaman. No young bull would be interested in a malnourished girl like her, the promise of an heir would be too slim as Tava's body certainly wasn't built for bearing children. So there she was, stuck as a novice shaman studying in the Spirit Rise in hopes that one day she might become skilled enough to go adventuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Smalls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTava grunted, opening her eyes from her attempts at meditation. \"Hello Sarga...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarga, who was standing in front of her, grinned like a maniac. Tava held back a glare but stared at the brown cowgirl with a look of envy. If there ever was a polar opposite to Tava, it would most certainly be Sarga. She stood slightly taller than most of the other girls, and was big and busty to boot. More than once she found herself on the other end of a proposal from a hopeful bull, all of which had been turned down so far. For some stupid reason, Sarga decided to also focus on her path as a shaman, much to Tava's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha doing?\" Sarga asked, with a bubbly tone that was absolutely sickening to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mediating...Or trying too anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Can I join you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always tried to do this to Tava. She always tried to get chummy around her, but Tava wanted nothing to do with her. \"No, I think I'm done for today. I'm going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me walk with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be stopping to a do a few chores though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do them with you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Just no, okay? I need to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTava stomped off in a hurry before Sarga could give another dimwitted reply. These attempts at being friends, coupled with that revoltingly sweet bubbly attitude, annoyed Tava to no end. Why couldn't she just leave her alone? Why was she even trying to be friends with someone like Tava? And most importantly, why was Tava so jealous of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked along the outer rim of Thunderbluff, the sun setting in the distance over the orange Barrens, Tava pondered and pondered why Sarga bugged her so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like she isn't friendly to me...But why doesn't she just leave me alone? Why do I hate her so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past a small puddle from recent rain fall, Tava paused and took a deep long look in the reflection. A scrawny and sad looking black furred tauren looked back at her. Tava tried to envision the reflection with a few more added pounds, particularly in the chest and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate being so tiny...I wish...I wish I was as big as Sarga. No, bigger. That way maybe she'd just leave me alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTava kicked a few rocks at the puddle before moving on back to her home. She had another long day of training again tomorrow with her and Sarga's master, she'd need her rest if she was going to put up with Sarga all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the distance, hovering near the horizon but just in hearing range, was a wisp of cloud of an unusual blue color. It slowly followed Tava's shadow, almost like it was watching her. A voice that boomed like thunder spoke softly enough that no one would hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A possible beneficiary, envious too. How quaint. Just the shaman I've sought, perhaps I shall pay her a visit in the eve...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Tava woke up...</span></div></div>",
