            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day, Ella is walking through the town market, looking over various items. She looks like a very ordinary girl (but pretty), dressed in her white blouse and belted-on blue skirt, carring a small cloth bag. Things, however, are not as they appear\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove It!\u201d Booms a large, muscular man carrying a crate through the crowd. He means it for everyone in front of him, but Ella suddenly stiffens. Anyone with magical perceptions would have heard a slight twinkle. Quite unwillingly, her feet propel her quickly around a corner, away from her destination. You see, Ella suffers from the \u201cgift\u201d of obedience, which makes her have to obey everything anyone tells her to do. This gets her into loads of trouble, especially, as now, when her \u201cgift\u201d takes things a little too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u201d she goes as her autonomous feet propel her into a man walking through the street. They both hit the ground, and she can hear some glass breaking. She gets to her feet \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be!\u201d He tells her, glaring. He\u2019s a youngish man, in his early 20\u2019s, dressed in travel clothes with glasses on his nose. He continues: \u201cThat was a valuable potion, it took me months to go into the forest and find it. Now look at it!\u201d Ella\u2019s head jerks downwards and she sees the pink mess with large pieces of glass in it. The man doesn\u2019t notice: \u201cNow I won\u2019t have any test subjects.\u201d Ella looks at it in regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could try to get it up\u2026\u201d she suggested, really wanting to leave. He shook his head impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no, it\u2019s effects will fade when it\u2019s out of the glass. However..\u201d he looks at her sharply, \u201cmaybe you could be my test subject!\u201d At this, Ella\u2019s head snapped up, and she looked at him, a protest on her lips. After years of experience, she had a sense for when an unwanted order was coming along. The man faltered for a second, then shrugged inwardly. She can always refuse, he thought to himself. \u201cThe effects should still be fully potent,\u201d he continued, hoping that she was dumb enough to do this. Gathering his courage, he ordered \u201cLick it up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla stiffens suddenly, straight as a board. She resists with all her might, but she can\u2019t win against her \"gift\". She gets on her knees while the man watches, mouth open. She jerks forward, head just above the ground. She tries to clench her teeth, but the magic forces open her mouth and her tongue comes out. She starts to lap up the pink stuff like a dog, almost in tears from the humiliation. The cold gritty stone meets her tongue, practically vomiting in disgust at the thought of all the garbage that must have been throne on these stones. While the man watches, astonished, she efficiently works her way through the puddle, getting almost all of it. Finally, she\u2019s finished. She sits back as the man exclaims:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026 that was great! Thank You! I never thought you\u2019d do it.\u201d He looks at her eagerly. She\u2019s too busy trying to clean that taste off her tongue to respond. Before either of them could say anything else, the potion started to take affect. Ella doubled over, all of her muscles convulsing, she fell back to the ground and twitched involuntarily as her muscles seemed to be trying to escape her body. When she could finally look up, everything was gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Is all she can say. The world had grown huge, the alley seems to stretch on and on until it reaches the massive slab that is the wall of the building. A sudden rush of air makes her turn, and she is confronted with the towering figure of the man who started all of this. He loomed over her, stretching into the sky. He was peering down in awed fascination at her tiny form, clearly at a loss for words. He started to bend over, to get a closer look, and she backed away hastily, tripping over her skirt and falling flat on her butt. She stares upward in horror as a thunderous sound fills the air, him smothering a chuckle. She starts to get angry, her fiery personality taking over, but before she could give him a piece of her mind a massive voice fills the alley:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere he is!\u2019 A group of men, big burly and looking decidedly unfriendly, were rushing down the alley towards the man. He swallows, then takes to his heels. The group of men follow him, thundering down towards the alley towards Ella. She screams in a tiny, high pitched voice as their legs surround her, pounding into the earth and knocking her flat. They pass, however, and she counts herself lucky for not having been squashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla stands up, brushes off her shirt and skirt and starts to plan. She decides to walk down the alley to the distant market, with mountainous figures passing the mouth of the alley in the distance. She starts to walk, trudging along down the alley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has to walk a long way, stepping over the cracks between the cobbles, which are now quite significant. She repeatedly falls down, and by the time she reaches the end she\u2019s sore, aching and tired. She forgets this, however, because she now sees the massive giant people walking around, so big that It dazzles the eye. She contemplates how to get attention, however she never figures it out because someone notices her, it\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ella stands in the mouth of the alley, staring up at the massive faces passing by far overhead, she feels a cold, sharp pain in her mouth. She immediately probes with her tongue and discovers a small, hard object pressing up against her gums. Raising her hand, she spits out the object onto her palm. It appears to be a small piece of cobblestone that got picked up in her lick-it-up session, and which thankfully shrunk with her. Visions of the shard bursting her shrinking head flit across Ella's mind, and she tosses the slimy fragment to the ground with a look of deep aversion before wiping her spit-covered palm on her blue skirt. Looking up, she finds herself face-to-foot with the man from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla stares at the man's old, battered leather boot for a moment, startled. She takes a hurried step back as the boot moves into the air, but it is slow and ponderous, and moves only a very short distance before being set down slowly once more. Looking up and taking a few more steps back, she sees his head returning from a glance over his shoulder turn downwards, his eyes methodically scanning the ground below him. They alight upon Ella almost immediately, widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" he cries, carefully getting on his knees for a better look, \"For a moment there I thought those thugs might have squashed you!\" Ella takes a few more steps back as the man's enormous bulk crashed down in front of her, his overly-loud voice ringing in her ears. He falls silent for a moment as he settles down, still staring directly at her. For her part, she gets an opportunity to study the man in front of her. His dark green pants were stained and battered with use, with a number of ragged, uneven patches and repairs, clearly done by the man himself. His equally battered brown shirt is covered by a leather vest of inferior quality, which is festooned with an enormous number of pockets, most of them bulging. His face is youthful, covered with some scraggly facial hair which has merged with his overlong, dark brown matt. His blue eyes are covered by a beat-up, extremely dirty pair of glasses. For a moment, neither does anything as each sizes, literally, the other up. Ella can see his eyes travel up and down her diminutive form, taking in her blue skirt and white blouse, both acquiring a level of grime from her sudden closeness to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seems like an eternity, the traveler shifts his weight, setting a building sized pack down on the ground net to him. It is crammed to bursting with items, all of which set up a fearful din as the objects inside clatter against one another, sounding like a bull in a glassmaker's shop. Ella can see glass bottles full of plants, animals and strange liquids, as well as some notebooks almost bursting out of the side pockets of the pack, and she shivers as her eyes catch a glimpse of a large net set upon a long pole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement in the corner of her eye draws her attention back to the traveler. He has withdrawn a thin notebook from one of his innumerable pockets and he gently flips it open to a blank page with a pencil in hand. Now he starts to bend down, very slowly, while edging towards Ella with tiny movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">What's he doing?</span>, Ella wonders to herself as he seems to move towards her in slow motion. Suddenly, as he begins to move his pencil rapidly in his notebook, it clicks in her head. <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">He's acting as if I'm a small, wild animal, edging forward carefully and not making sudden movements or sounds!</span>, she thinks indignantly. Even worse, she is reacting like a skittish animal as well, stepping away from him, an instinctive reaction to such an enormous mass on the move. This thought galvanizes her into action. She stops backing away, puts her hands on her hips and starts yelling up into his startled face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! What have you done to me?\" He stares at her, mouth agape and pencil slack. Then his eyes widen and he starts writing furiously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject appears to maintain mental faculties!\" He whispers in time to his writing. His words were clearly meant for himself, clearly a habit he had formed. However, they are quite distinct to Ella, and if anything make her even madder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not some specimen for you to examine, I'm a person who you've shrunk you dolt! Stop that scribbling and change me back this instant.\" He looks at her, quite bemused by the tirade coming out from this girl who doesn't even each his waist, even when kneeling. He continues to watch as her yelling reaches its peak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is outrageous, illegal, immoral and unacceptable; the watch will clap you in irons for doing this to me!\" He now is writing and drawing almost reflexively as he stares, his efforts almost on autopilot on this point. Finally, she seems to become short of breath. She stands there, gasping and glaring, and it\u2019s at this point that he decides to interject:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you felt that way about becoming a subject, why did you lick up that potion in the first place?\" He asks her, in what he hopes is a low, reasonable tone of voice. He had noticed her flinch when he spoke before, clearly too loudly for her newly reduced eardrums. To his satisfaction, he sees that his voice was at a comfortable volume, but to his dismay the words themselves are not received well:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told me that this would happen, you misinformed me and that is a felony!\" Her anger continues unabated by his smug, patronizing words, given in a tone of voice suitable once more for small animals. His face grimaces and he shakes his head regretfully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, it's not, at least, not for the last seventeen years.\" He informs her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be!\" She shoots back, momentarily sidetracked. Her passion and energy quite astonishes the traveler, who once again tries for a reasonable set of words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so,\" he hedges, \"but you didn't have to lick up the potion- thanks for that, by the way.\" He says in an aside with real gratitude. She answers at once, without thinking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did, you made m-\" her words halt abruptly as she realizes what she has just said. He looks at her curiously, head cocked and eyes narrowed in puzzlement:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\" The dreaded question is interrupted, however, as another shadow suddenly looms up behind the man. He sees the tiny girl's eyes widen, and that's all the warning he has before a hand claps down on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotten an early start, have you?\" Asks a chuckling man dressed in merchant's clothing, Mr. Hember. Both of them immediately realize that the merchant has not seen Ella, that instead he thinks that the traveler is drunk and puking his guts out in the alley. The traveler, thinking quickly, immediately bends forward, almost directly over Ella, mouth open. She gets an unpleasant view into his mouth, a gaping fleshy hole n the air above her as he makes dry retching noises. A couple of droplets of saliva hit Ella, and she is buffeted by his warm, surprisingly pleasant-smelling breath. At the same time, he reaches with his concealed hand into a pocket, pulls out a small skin and starts spilling it onto the ground under his mouth, close to Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla takes evasive action, hot-footing it to the right and landing sprawled on her front, aching and even dirtier but at least, she thinks with a shiver of apprehension, not soaked in alcohol. The smell of the drink pervades the air heavily, as the skin had contained some strong spirit or another. Mr. Hember, still grinning, shakes his head sagely:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people can't hold their drink.\" Peering down at the traveler again, he waits for the last of the spirits to be spilled before saying: \"Listen brother, I sympathize with you but you're going to drive away the customers if you stay here much longer. Could you...\" He is cut off by the travelers waved hand and apparently weary nod. Satisfied, he eyes the traveler one more time before moving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mr. Hember is gone, the man straightens up again and looks down. He takes in the small puddle of strong spirit regretfully, than looks over at the girl. She is still sprawled, in the motions of pushing herself up. He finds the scene amusing, and hasn't composed his face enough by the time Ella straightens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoyed girl catches the amused look before it is wiped away into a studiously blank and professional expression. She glowers, but for once he isn't looking at her. Turning his head, he sees that he is getting curios looks from shopowners and shoppers. Looking back around and down, he says, more to himself than to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much attention...\" Returning his gaze to the miniature female in front of him, he decides on a course of action. He...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The traveler quickly puts his hand out, palm open in front of the girl, watching attentively as she flinches ever-so-slightly, but stubbornly holds her ground. His heartbeat is quickly accelerating as he becomes the object of more and more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll take you back to my place and we can figure out what to do about this... situation.\" Ella had watched as his massive hand came down and stretched out on her left, a fleshy platform that filled her with dread. Now, as the disreputable looking stranger asks her to go back to his place, she rebels. Hands on her hips, she shouts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm getting on your filthy hand and going back to your filthy little house-\" she is interrupted by his loud, hissing exhalation. Dealing with her made him almost regret her strange volunteering to be a test subject, even if that potion had cost him many months of travel and exertion to make. He follows his hiss with some equally exasperated words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get on and stark arguing, would you?\" he demands harshly. Considering her stubborn stance, he is contemplating drastic action, but to his complete and utter astonishment she steps promptly over to his hand, gathers up her skirt (flashing a tantalizing amount of leg), and steps lightly onto his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the qualifier at the end of his words, they were unmistakably a command and Ella has no choice to obey. Cursing the almost-inaudible twinkle as she moves, she quickly walks over and gets on his hand. The yielding surface quivers oddly as she stands there for a moment, and she can feel its heat even through her soft shoes. She immediately moves to get off again, but her plans are dashed as the palm shudders and she sees the ground receding below her rapidly. She gives a small cry of vertigo, looking down that immense distance and feeling gravity tug at her. No sooner had he steadied his hand once more than she overbalances, arms pin wheeling, and falls over on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is entirely taken-aback by this sudden change of character and giving in to his will, but he is quick to take advantage of it, especially as she sees her almost immediately reverse course once on his hand. He quickly lifts her into the air, acutely aware of the two tiny feet resting on his palm, and the necessity for speed does not rob the situation of its novelty or wonder. True, he has held small live animals in his hand before, and the sensation of having a warm, breathing creature in one's grasp was not new to him, and he had quickly gotten over the heady feeling of power it brings. This was different, he now held a sentient being, with thoughts, feelings and memories, and who was, most pertinently, female. He is brought sharply to awareness of this fact as she wobbles comically in his hand, than falls on her tush. He would have found it deeply amusing on the ground, but in his palm it takes on an entirely new dimension. Heat rushes to his ears and he flushes swiftly as, even through her skirt, she can feel the girls paradoxically soft firmness. He pulls at his collar uncomfortably and, looking around to avoid looking at her, he takes refuge in logistics:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't carry you there, you'll be seen for sure. Here, I'll empty a pocket.\" He does just that as Ella climbs swiftly to her feet, making sure not to look over the sides of his palm and concentrating on him. He opens the pocket. \"Here you go.\" he says. He brings his hand closer, but stops looking down at her quizzically as she remains silent, arms crossed over her chest and eyes glaring at him steadily. He raises his eyebrows until they disappear into his hair (which, admittedly, isn't that far) and says in what is only partly-exaggerated astonishment: \"That's it? No arguments? No threats? No wild accusations of treachery or reflections on my villainous nature?\" Ella stays silent, still under his unwittingly-given command to not argue, and inwardly terrified of him discovering her curse. He frowns, clearly coming to the conclusion that she was giving him the silent treatment. He shrugs, almost sending Ella tumbling once more: \"All right. Have it your way then.\" With that, he inverts his palm, sending Ella sprawling on her back in his almost-vertical hand, than slides her into one of his top-vest pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis repositioning of the girl had put her entire back into contact with the young man's sensitive palm, and he feels her warmth and smoothness all the way up and down as well as tickling his palm with her hair. This period is blessedly short, as his wits could not withstand much more, but it is still enough to send another wave of heat rushing through his body. He is so distracted that he runs straight into Mr. Hember's table, and he has to fumble t catch a number of falling objects. Mr. Hember waves at him magnanimously and he stumbles on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate,\" he mutters to himself, \"I might as well be as drunk as a sailor.\" With that, he concentrates on the task at hand. Moving quickly and unobtrusively through the crowds, ducking into shops whenever he sees a group of thugs and trying not to get lost as he heads home, having been so long in the wilderness that he's become unused to its crows, closeness and maze-like streets. While he is doing this, he is continually aware of the bulge in his pocket, differentiated from all the others by its warmth and occasional movements, as well as his awareness of what was contained within. Several times he reaches up to touch it gently, wonderingly, and throughout his relatively short journey he contemplates the odd behavior of his newest subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla huddles in the bottom of the traveler's pocket, staring at the seams in the leather through the dim light filtering down through a number of crudely poked holes in the pocket's flap. Judging from the holes, the traveler had obviously kept something alive in here for a while. Judging from the smell, Ella most certainly does not want to know what it was. The motion of her conveyance is worse than any horse or carriage. The relative speed is vastly greater, and the sudden stops, twists, turns and ducks cause her feel nauseous, especially at the beginning. After a while, however, her body begins to acclimate and she is left with her thoughts. Now that there is no one to vent her anger, fear, frustration and helplessness on, rational thought begins to dominate her mind, and rational thoughts are rarely comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, Ella takes stock of her situation, and it doesn't look good. She's six inches tall, completely unaware of her location, trapped in the pocket of a giant over ten times her size who could probably, well okay, <i>definitely</i> overpower and control her with his thumb and forefinger. Even worse, he was the very same one who caused her to shrink in the first place, and who was perilously close to discovering her secret. To top it all off, even if she had relatives who cared, neither they, nor her good friend Arrived, know where she is. Sitting there rigidly, she does her very best not to break down weeping, with a nearly hopeless situation and no real reason not to. She also tries to to flinch as at various points she feels a light pressure from outside, clearly her captor checking up on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the traveler makes it home. Looking around carefully, he walks into a fairly dilapidated building on the edge of town. Entering through the door into the unlit hallway, he steps over to the barely visible trapdoor set into the door. With some determined hauling and a number of muttered curses, he finally manages to get it open. He descends, closing the trapdoor behind him, into his basement home. He gives a weary sigh followed by a gasping cough as his feet kick up clouds of dust from the floor. He shakes his head and marches through his four-room home, past the large numbers of bookshelves crammed with books and jars, and on into his bedroom. Setting his pack down on his decks. He looks longingly at its multitude of specimens, samples and filled notebooks, and for a moment thinks wistfully of taking off his vest, folding it up and sticking it on a shelf, somewhere high up. But his curiosity, his unwillingness to put such an important and fascinating matter off, and his own good, if not inexhaustibly saintly, nature eventually overcame his pleasant fantasy. <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Besides</span>, he thinks to himself wearily, {font:comic]she'd just get out and start shouting abuse at me from on high</span>. Deciding that he might as well start his ordeal now, he reaches up, undoes the flap and reaches in carefully, as if fearful of bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter far too long a period of being cooped up, Ella should be relieved to get out of that stinking pocket. However, as the hand reaches in for her, coming slowly but inexorably, its isolated presence bearing uncanny resemblance to that of an arachnid, she instead does everything possible to avoid getting out. Whether she does it because of fear, anger or sheer contrariness, she simply will not get on that hand. Unfortunately for her \"everything possible\" does not amount to much when trapped in a pocket barely big enough to permit both part of a hand and the tiny girl herself to fit inside, even when she was pressed against one side. She hears a long exhalation from above, sounding much like a slow wind passing between buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you can yell at me all you want if you fell the need, but would you please just let me get you out of there.\" It was partly his words, but far more the release of the command which had been binding her tongue and humming at the edge of her hearing which caused Ella to give in, although graciously. She relaxed her body away from the wall, stepping a fraction closer to his large fingers. He quickly moves in, using a finger on her shoulder to turn her around gently, and then cups his hand behind her. She is motionless for a moment, but she gives her a tiny nudge to the back of the knee, enough to overbalance her slightly and sit down on his fingers, her back resting against his lower palm like the back of a curved chair. For a moment, its warmth almost makes her relax. Almost. But she recovers herself as she is lifted up and catches a glance at his face, which is set once more in that strange, disturbing expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man quickly places his hand over the desk, and the girl daintily steps off his palm onto the desk with a swirl of her skirt. He holds his hand there for a moment as the sensation of holding her gradually leaves it. The girl, meanwhile, is looking around the room, taking in the massive amounts of dust, the spider webs and the only faintly organized books and specimen jars that crowd the shelves. He momentarily envisions how it must look from her perspective, a vast, dimly lit plain of dirt, disorder and confusion that probably doesn\u2019t look even slightly habitable. As she turns back to him, he can see that her stance is not even slightly dainty. Belligerence radiates from her and her face is dangerously set. She is clearly itching for another fight with him. He feels weary and is tired of being yelled at. Trying to think of a way to preempt her inevitable tirade, he ponders for a moment, while the girl clearly starts winding herself up. Finally, he...</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, he decided to give her a fight of his own. There was a small tinge of reluctance, mainly because of the the fact that he knew little or the little human female in front of him or because he didn't possess the heart to argue, for he had been in the wild collecting as much data as he could, surprisingly able to maintain his verbal capabilities. Perhaps it may have been years of experience or the habit he had acquired of speaking aloud when taking down notes. But her small coherant altercating has led him to a degree to which he believes that the only way to silence her was to argue back.  However, the small brunette was to be the first to start up her tirade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How DARE you! First, you shrink me. Then, you study me as if I were some animal, and take me against my will to...to...to HERE!\" She yelled as loud as her small windpipe would, emphasizing the word dare to express her anger. She did not want this, let alone like it. Of course, she was sorry earlier, as she had involuntarily caused the man in front of her to almost lose his years of research onto the ground, but because of her \"wonderful gift\" bestowed upon her, she was very regretful, although it was not intentionally her fault. However, she did not see the incoming move her captor was going to make. \"You are the most unforgivable human on the face of the Earth! And...\"  Before she could continue, however, he interrupted, not too harshly, but enough to silence her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet for a moment and listen!\" He hissed. He watched as she fliched, from the unexpected words flowing out his mouth and from the high pitch of his voice, and quickly turned her head towards him, no longer in anger but in shock by the exclaimation, and remained silent from what he believed was from shock, but actually due to the command. He could have sworn her heard a small high pitch sound, perhaps a twinkle when he finished speaking, but placed that aside. He looked at the woman, who only continued to stare back up at him as if he made a morbid statement. He was actually caught off guard by the sudden silence in the room, but broke it when he let out a long sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I apologize for the current state you're in,\" He apologize, hoping it would cool her down a bit, \"I didn't expect you to actually drink up the mixture from the ground. I'll try to make an antidote for this, but it may take a while. But, I can't let you go for the moment. Please try to understand. In your current situation, if I send you back, then you might not find a way to revert back to normal and my study may be for nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back down to the blue and white cladded miniature human in front of him. She had her arms crossed now, eyes fixed onto him, with her mouth pursed together in contemplation. He was very relieved to see that his \"test subject's\" anger had perhaps diminished.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla would have muttered to herself if it weren't for the command he had yet to lift from her. She could care less about his sincere apology or from the fact that his study may lay to waste, but she did long to return to normal size. She wanted to ask, how long could he predict the antidote to be finished, but could not. She blinked and turned her head to face the large pile of clutter placed against the wall, until she saw his hand extend from next to her, and quickly stopping inches from her, in her view. She flinched a bit, but the man remained unphazed. \"Can we work this out?\" He asked, in a rather friendly tone of voice, giving her a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla looked back at the hand, to the man's face and let her gaze remain upon the hand. Finally she...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Put me down\" Ella said as the girl picked her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who was 11 or 12, was amazed. \"Wow, you can talk and move!\" she said holding the doll up to her face. It was the most advanced doll she had ever seen. It felt and looked just like a real woman. Whoever left it out in the woods must not have wanted it anymore. \"I'm gonna take you home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla crossed her arms across her chest as the girl held her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, your dress is gross\" the girl said, noticing where the frog had attacked Ella. \"I have some nice things you can try on though. This is gonna be fun!\" The girl ran home with Ella in hand. Ella's arms and legs flailed around with each step the girl took as the girl walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girl had reached her home which Ella was dizzy from all of the running. She hung limply from the girl's hand. \"We're here!\" the girl announced. The girl's mother was inside doing housework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my new doll!\" the girl announced holding the dazed Ella up. Ella would have called out for help but she was too dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice Allison, but I'm busy right now. Why don't you go play with your doll in your room? You can show me the doll again later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" the girl said. She took Ella into her room and closed the door. She deposited Ella on the floor and walked over to a chest at the end of the room. She pulled out a box with doll clothing and set it down next to Ella and then retrieved a doll house modeled after a fancy castle. Allison sat down in front of the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Allison, I need you to show me to your mother\" Ella began, although the girl cut her off by picking her up in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom says she'll look at you later. I think I'll make you look pretty for her\" Allison said, lightly stroking Ella's dark hair. She began to undress her new doll beginning with Ella's shoes. Once those were off she began pulling off Ella's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop that! Give me my shoes back!\" Ella yelled. She struck one of Allison's fingers with a tiny fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Be quiet and hold still!\" Allison commanded Ella. Ella's body stopped, her arms sticking out around the girl's fist and her legs coming straight together. Allison realized the doll must have been magic and responded to commands. She finished removing the doll's skirt and stopped to see if she would continue fighting her. The doll was not moving still. After removing her blouse, Ella was down to her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was amazed. The doll was very well made, with no visible joints or screws anywhere. It looked just like a real woman, and everything felt real. She wondered how it was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just the outfit for you\" Allison said grabbing a blue and yellow princess dress from her pile of clothes. She reached to grab the doll to dress it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" She wanted to confirm that the doll did what it was told. \"Here, put this on\" she commanded Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla did as she was told. She put on the princess dress quickly, allowing Allison to grab her to zip up the back of the dress. Allison gave the doll the tiny shoes that went with the dress, and then fixed Ella's hair with a brush. Ella was screaming on the inside as the brush roughly \"fixed\" her hair, though she was glad it wasn't ripping any of it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\" Allison said. She got up, leaving Ella standing on the floor. She came back with a mirror and held it in front of the still Ella. \"Now you're all pretty, like a princess.\" She looked just like a doll. Ella had always wanted to be a princess but this was not quite what she meant. \"You just need to smile.\" As the words left Allison's mouth, Ella felt a doll-like smile across her face. Now she really did look like a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can move and talk again. But you need to keep smiling, just like a princess would\" Allison commanded. She liked having a living doll. She bet no other girls her age had dolls like hers. \"What kind of a doll are you, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ella, and\" Ella said. She would have explained to Allison that she wasn't a doll at all, but Allie didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Ella doll, huh? Are there more of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-\" She began, but was cut off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only one then, and that makes you special. I'm going to keep you. Don't even think about running away or anything, because you're mine. My new favorite toy\" Allison said to Ella. This meant that Ella was bound not to escape from her captor. Allison picked up the Ella doll and stroked her hair with a hand, hugging her against her torso. Ella thought she would be crushed in the girl's hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison then opened the dollhouse-castle and placed Ella inside of it. Ella stumbled and caught herself on a doll-sized chair. Ella almost mistook the two dolls - one a princess one a prince - sitting in the chairs for other people her own size, but realized that she was their size. Allison sat on her knees and watched with glee as Ella explored the dollhouse-castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla came upon the bedroom, which had a plastic bed in it. She looked worried. She didn't really want to sleep in a plastic bed. Allison must have known she would be concerned about this, because she said \"Don't worry Ella, you'll sleep in bed with me every night.\" Ella was not sure that this was better than the plastic bed, but knew she had no choice. Maybe she could sneak away one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison reached in and grabbed the prince doll with one hand and brought it over to Ella.\"Hello Princess Ella, I'm Prince Charming. Nice to meet you\" Allison said, pushing the doll towards her. Ella was grabbed by the girl and pushed into the doll. \"Hug hum\" she commanded. Ella then wrapped her arms around the doll and embraced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison remembered that the doll would do anything she wanted. \"Actually we're going to play dolls now, and you're going to be the princess.\" She let go of Ella. \"So act like a princess would\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello love\" Ella said to the doll. She hugged the prince doll again and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Allison giggled. \"You look handsome today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you, princess\" Allison said in the doll's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Allison pulled Ella out of the dollhouse and put the doll down. She picked up a plush dragon doll and made dragon noises before holding it in the same hand with Ella. \"You've been kidnapped by a dragon!\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me, sweet prince!\" Ella cried out against her will. \"Save me from the beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison made the prince doll slay the dragon and rescue his love. Allison then changed Ella's outfit into a different princess dress and put her back into the castle with the prince doll. \"Now you two will dance to celebrate\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla forced herself into a weird position with the stiff prince doll and clumsily waltzed around the castle. Allison clapped and laughed as she watched her two dolls play like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on Allison's door. She answered and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hattie steps out of Hember's Exotic Good's Emporium feeling pleased. On her way to meet and discuss their pretentious and somewhat strange stepsister Ella, she had stepped into this shop, eyes caught by a pendant in the window, gold shaped into a twin snake configuration that she thought would go well with one of her better gowns. She had gotten a good deal, and the pendant was now tucked into one of her pockets. She thinks again about her horrid stepsister, about whom Hattie has a very tasty suspicion forming in the back of her mind. Glancing around, she immediately shades her eyes and looks down as the bright sun begins to dilate her pupils. She catches a glimpse of movement to her left, and as she focuses on it, she sees to her astonishment a tiny, colorful, humanoid figure on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" she breathes to herself as the figure continues to jump up and down in a ridiculous manner. She steps behind the table towards the figure, squinting to get a better look. Unbelievably, it looks exactly like a miniature version of her hated stepsister and rival, Ella! A grin paints itself across her features as she approaches stealthily from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we have here?\" booms a shrill voice from behind Ella. She does not even have time to turn before a massive force grabs her white blouse by the neck and hurls her into the air. She screams as the ground recedes below her, the air rushing past her tiny form. She struggles fruitlessly as she is raised to the face of her captor. She is rotated by the thumb and forefinger of the giantess who holds her by her blouse, and as she turns she views the enormous, evilly grinning face of her stepsister, Hattie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, then?\" asks Hattie in a falsetto-curious tone, \"An Ella doll? No, it must be the uppity wench herself, cut down to a more proper size.\" Ella gags as Hattie's breath, not improved by her sudden reduction in height, washes over her. Ella unwillingly gets a chance to observe Hattie's gigantic figures, shrewish and ugly, with an unpleasant skin tone and newly visible acne scars, framed by her long, plaited blond hair. Looking down, Ella catches a glimpse of Hattie's repulsive orange dress, which blatantly highlights her fairly considerable bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hattie, this guy shrunk me, you've got to help me-\" Ella's pleading shouts, which carried fairly well to Hattie's ears, were totally overborne by Hattie's instant, loud, indignant and vicious response:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAVE to?!!! I don't HAVE to do anything, especially if it involves helping you, you little bitch!\" Ella is stunned by this epithet and the viciousness of Hattie's response. She starts to struggle again, and again she accomplishes nothing except angering her massive, ugly stepsister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" continues Hattie eyeing the tiny, struggling form of her hated stepsister with displeasure, \"I think you're the one who will HAVE to do something for me.\" At this, Ella's face takes on a panicked, startled look, mouth agape and entire body flinching. Hattie's over-red lips take on an even wider smirk as she opens her mouth 'once more:<br>\r\n'<br>\r\n\"Freeze.\" With an almost inaudible twinkle, Ella's body jerks to a halt, arms frozen in the middle of their gestures, splayed out and twisted. Unable to move anything except her eyes, Ella hangs their helplessly, blouse stretched and pulled tight against her body as she hangs by the neck, starting to inch up her body, revealing a tiny sliver of her midriff. Hattie watches her sister with satisfaction, reveling in her discovery and newfound power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ella, a thought occurs to Hattie. Reaching forward with one hand, Hattie obscures the frozen girl's vision with a large, wall-sized expanse of dirty, over perfumed flesh. Hattie's thumb and forefinger reach forward, grabs Ella's frozen left arm and bends it. It yields to her massive strength, and she roughly moves it into an upright position on Ella's side, a mindless, frozen, palm-out wave. Ella's fury and fear, unable to be expressed because of her curse, increase equally as Hattie moves her other limbs so, to anyone who didn't know the situation, Ella would be just another doll, that one might see standing on a store shelf. Hattie laughs triumphantly as she stares down at her reduced rival:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a doll, an obedient little Ella-doll!\" She chuckles evilly down at her frozen, horrified stepsister, \"and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few tries at jumping up and down, waving her arms and screaming (and repeatedly being knocked over by the passage of an oblivious giant), she retreats back from the edge of the street.  She looks around, seeking inspiration, hoping that perhaps her friend Arrieda would come along and help her out. Unfortunately for her, this was not to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile standing there at the edge of the street, she hears a loud THUNK over to her left. Whirling around, she is confronted with the sight of a large wooden table which stands in front of a shop, towering over her measly form and blocking out any sight of what is on it. The more immediate problem, however, is the  large crystal ball which had just hit the cobblestones. It was a little taller than she was, and it is rolling right towards her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep!\" She yelps as she dives aside. The large, clear boulder, spider webbed with cracks from its fall, rolls across the spot she was standing on a moment before with frightful force It eventually comes to a halt in a particularly deep crevice between cobblestones, and Ella stands up. She brushes off her blouse once more, although by now it has acquired a great deal of dirt and dust and is starting to turn grey. She looks up as a voice suddenly booms out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Away, Get Away you guttersnipes! If I ever see you around here again, I'll chop you up and sell you to the menagerie as lions' food!\" Ella is forced back once more as three pairs of bare, dirty feet belonging to a group of smaller (but still towering) street urchins thunder past. They enter the alley from which Ella had emerged and disappear, leaving Ella shaken, and disgusted by the sight (and smell) of their incredibly dirty feet. Her relief is short lived, however, as just when she starts to move towards the crystal ball to examine it there comes an enormous slapping sound from behind her. Turning, she finds herself confronted by another gigantic figure, an adult this time, clad in soft soled shoes and a fairly prosperous looking purple garment. He's muttering to himself, soft but clearly audible to Ella, especially as he is starting to bend over:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damm Miscreants, touching all my wares and breaking a perfectly good crystal ball. If I ever get my hands on them...\" he says in a threatening voice, head turned towards the alley. He reaches out his hand towards the crystal ball, looks down, and spots Ella. He freezes, eyes wide in astonishment, mouth gaping slightly as he takes in her small, slightly dirty form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla, for her part, is staring up at Mr. Hember, recognizing his face from all the times she had walked into \"Hember's Exotic Goods Emporium\". She is still unused to her new size, and the sight of his frozen, hunched over figure was quite intimidating, even if someone his size would have found it ludicrous. He slowly drops his hand back to his side and straightens a bit, sitting on his heels for a moment as he studies his newest find. Ella, growing a bit more used to the enormous mass of a man in front of her, takes the initiative:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir? Sir? Can you help me?\" She yells at the top of her voice, waving her arms. Hember raises his eyebrows slightly hearing her words as a bit soft, but quite audible and normal-sounding, surprised at this new development:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not a doll, even a magicked one.\" He says, a grin starting to cross his face. Ella didn't like either the look on his face or the tone of his massive, air-shaking voice. She controls her expression and tries again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sir, I'm not a doll, I'm a human named Ella- EEEP!\" Her yelling ends in a frantic shriek as Mr. Hember casually reaches forward and plucks her off the ground with a wall-sized hand, bringing his prize closer to his face to be examined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a fairy either, no wings, no magic. Also, far too pretty\" He says, looking over her pretty young form and admiring her clothes. Ella felt his warm breath wash over her and his slightly greasy fingers encasing her sides and pinning her arms uncomfortably to her side. She really didn't like his tone of voice now, nor the way his eyes were wandering over her body, resting for a while on her fairly low neckline. She looks at him with a sinking heart and a sense of nausea from being zoomed into the air so quickly. She makes another go at it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mr. Hember, I'm not a fairy, I'm a human named Ella, I've been in your shop a number of times, remember?\" She asks, pleading with him as he stares at her with a light in his eye. He does indeed remember her now, walking into his store a number of times, occasionally buying something, usually books. A smirk crosses his face as he replies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I remember now. Ironic that my newest acquisition should be familiar with my store.\" He chuckles quietly as he stands up, absently pocketing his crystal ball and walking into his store. At this, Ella starts squirming furiously, anger all over her face as she yells at him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human being, not an \"acquisition\", you can't just take me, this is illegal and outrageous!!\" She writhes furiously in his hand as he walks into his store. He laughs again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can, you'll be quite the valuable 'little' commodity.\" He is looking at her with greed written all over his face, leering quite openly at her chest. At this, a flash of fear at being held captive by this lecherous, greedy merchant and what might happen to her filled Ella, and just as quickly her fiery personality transmuted it to anger:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! Let me go you slime ball! When I get big again I'm get the Watch!\" and many other, less comprehendible but equally furious denouncements. At the same time, she truly begins to struggle against his hot, sweaty grip, kicking, squirming and straining in a truly astounding display of energy. Mr. Hember is certainly impressed (and pleased) at the amount of energy contained in the small body of his latest \"Item\", and he truly enjoyed the thigh shown off with her rapid kicks and the fascinating wobble produced in the chest area as she struggled against his firmly clenched fingers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He  cries, mostly in surprise rather than pain as his increased leering inspires Ella to new heights of fury, allowing her to deliver a well-aimed and fairly powerful kick to a tender nerve-point on his wrist. Displeased, he glares down at her while none-too-gently squeezing and shaking her tiny form. This earns him a gasp of slight pain and nausea, but she does not stop with her struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" He commands loudly and sharply, figuring that it was probably time for him to start instilling a little respect in his new charge. To his complete and utter bewilderment, the tiny figure in his hand instantly freezes, arms and legs rigid and offering absolutely zero resistance to his fingers. He was taken aback, having expected that she would continue to struggle in the face of a simple \"stop\". Examining her, he notices that the stream of abuse (which had grown softer and more hoarse with continual shouting and exertion) has stopped completely, and the girl's face, while still screwed up in fury, also held a healthy dose of fear. Suddenly, it clicked in his mind, the idea forming and then blossoming into almost-certainty. A slow grin crosses his features, terrifying Ella as she realizes that she's been found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raise your right leg.\" He tells her. She has no choice and almost instantaneously her right leg, stiff as a board, flails out into a ninety-degree angle to her body, lifting her blue skirt with it. Mr. Hember chuckles deeply, rotating Ella to get a peek at the fine view she had just given him. Ella becomes red-faced as she goes horizontal and sees Mr. Hember looking up her skirt, but she, obviously, has no choice, even though her leg is really starting to ache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough\" says Mr. Hember and Ella immediately drops her leg, obscuring his view, to his disappointment. However, this is drowned out by the visions this had opened up to him, visions that often involved large piles of gold. Still grinning, he sets Ella down on his counter. She immediately runs for it, as fast as she possibly could, but he simply smirks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" He says and she freezes in mid-motion, arms out and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Back\" she is compelled to turn around and march back towards Mr. Hember, standing in front of him, not even able to be weak-kneed and trembling because of his order. He settles himself on a stool, looming over her tiny form and smiling. \"Do you have to obey every order?' He asks her firmly, watching as she looks up at him with naked fear. However, she says nothing. He considers for a moment, than says: \"Answer any question I ask you immediately, completely, truthfully and without the slightest evasion.\" He watches with interest as her body stiffens and he swears he hears a small twinkle at the edge of his hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO you have to obey every order given to you?\" he asks again He watches her with intrest as she strains to keep her mouth shut, but of course she can't:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" He can hear the hatred in her voice. He smiles and continues: \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Fairy Godmother gifted me with Obedience when I was a baby.\" She informs him, her expression clearly protesting this turn of events. He nods, satisfied. No curse is as hard to break as one from a fairy godmother, he thinks to himself. With that, he begins to put her through her paces. He orders her to march up and down in front of him, to jump, to do back flips and twirls, to pirouette while doing ballet, to sing like an angel, or scream like a startled cat When he gets tired of her originally amusing but now boring tirades, he orders her to stop that as well. She still has an \"\"if looks could kill...\" glare on her face, but he decides to allow that. No need to be cruel, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tests the limits of her obedience, noting with disappointment that she can bend but not break the laws of physics when it comes to jumping and getting around objects. He also tests the level of autonomy she possessed, giving vague orders which, to his delight, she has to obey exactly as he would wish her to obey them. He ends with a series of commands intended to ensure that she knows her place in the proverbial \"food chain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll over\" she drops to the ground and rolls. \"Beg like a dog\" She gets on her knees and pants, face forced into piteous expressions and voice forced into a small whine. \"Lift your skirt.\" Tears rolling out of her eyes, she seizes her blue skirt and lifts it up to her chest, displaying her white underpants and admirably muscled thighs to the world (well, to Mr. Hember, who had closed the shop on his way in). He admires for a few moments, than waves his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough.\" He was fairly sure she got it now. Her body relaxed, than stiffened as she crosses her arms defensively, furiously angry but terrified, staring up into his delighted face, still under the command to not talk. He is still chuckling as he reaches under the counter and brings up a large, rectangular object made of wood, which Ella recognizes, to her horror, as a cage for small animals. Mr. Hember laughs at the expression on her face as he puts it down on the counter next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're getting it,\" He tells her, smiling. He frowns for a moment, thinking, than smiles and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak freely,\" He is fully prepared to quiet her if she starts abusing him again, but is pleasantly surprised when not a word comes out of her mouth. \"Very good,\" he tells her, not in the least fooled into believing her tamed. He reaches down and opens the cage door. Ella turns to look; mute and terrified, as the door to what is obviously her cage swings open. Mr. Hember reaches down and picks her up off the table, delighting in the feel of her warm, pliant but still muscular body in his hand. Using his thumb, he flips her over and admires her shapely curves before copping a quick feel, which makes Ella flinch and get even angrier, if possible. Getting back to business, the merchant tosses her gently into the cage so that she lands on her already aching behind, and closes the door. He then picks up the cage by the handle...</span></div></div>",

Ha, ha,ha!\", he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out, let me out of here. I'm not an animal for you to keep caged.

Ella walks to the back of the cage away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from me\", she tells him and throws a sunflower seed, left by the previous cage occupant, at the dog. The dog growls at her. He sticks a paw up and touches the cage. As he does, he also pushes it to the side. This causes it to fall off the shelf onto the floor. The cage comes apart and Ella is face to face with the dog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the dog do?</span></div></div>",

She sighs as she lets the soft fabric of her dress slide over her now bare back, and she kicks off her tiny shoes, leaving her in only her undies and stockinged feet. With her delicate hands she unfastens her bra, and letting her hair down, lets it fall to her dainty feet. Her long brown hair falling over her pale, shining fair skinned bare back is a divine site to passersby. She shrugs her beautiful shoulders, and lets it fall forward around her bare collarbones. Then she holds her breasts and tucks them under her mane instinctively, and she moves on. Standing up, the world also gets a decent view of her slender waist, her adorable bare tummy, and her hips. She slips her stockings down her long, slender legs, eventually slipping them down her heels, and right off her bare toes. At this point Ella is fuming inside, but her body moves reluctantly but surely without her hesitance interfering. She begins to slip her panties down, revealing her adorable bare bottom to the world, as it wiggles back and forth as she shivers softly. Now completely naked, she lowers her foot to the ground, panties still caught on her toes. As her delicate bare toes make contact with the cold floor, she suddenly is able to control herself, now naked as he asked, and curls up, on her knees with her hands on her breasts, crossed in her arms, and her hair don her back, her toes right up against her bum, and the soles of her feet against her most precious area. The man see's this, and chuckling, he grabs the panties, pulling with full force, and Ella is forced onto her stomach by the force. He then tells her to make herself comfortable ,and she snarls at him as her body lays on its adorable tummy, and her adorable feet, their glimmering sea-blue toes wiggling frantically, up behind her swing through the air in glee. After making her do many unnecessary things, including skip, roll around, and even dance in the altogether, he lets her down, tickling her sides, tummy, and toes one last time, in that order. Putting her down, she finally truly realizes what is going on. She is Naked.Nude.Bare.Starkers.Butt naked.Without a stitch.Au naturel.Indecent. And she can do nothing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits at the edge of the sink, her bare legs swinging in nervous reflex as her bare toes wiggle in the same type of frantic horror. As the man fills it with soap, he orders her to get it. She falls in, a pleasant warm sensation going up her toes, to her tummy. She catches herself, and in an act of defiance, she pulls up the side. But all it takes is one poke to her adorable bare tummy to send her plunging back in. It goes on for hours, as he washes her from head to toe. He doesn't spare a moment running his wet fingers up her slender form, taking the time to tease her as she is helpless to object to his tickling her delicate toes, groping of her tiny breasts, patting her bottom, and more. She now sits on the side of the sink again, a tattered wet tissue beside her, a pitiful offering for cover it was,her bare bottom freezing on the tile, wondering what to do next as she has been given no clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man seizes her, and he picks her up, and places her in a glass jar. She is then placed on a display, and he tells her to look cute. She smiles and gets on her hands and knees, one leg up behind her with toes pointed out. Oh how she hates him.</span></div></div>",

She turns slowly, and right in front of her a dark wall of cloth is slithering over the cobblestones right at her! She barely has time to step back before it hits her, knocking her over backwards and rasping over her prone body in a very unpleasant fashion, drawing her into total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, it seems like total darkness at first, to her panicking mind. However, as she lies there for a number of moments she realizes that, in fact, it was comparatively bright- dim, certainly, but certainly not pitch black. She also realizes that she is not alone. She can hear more of those clicks, there source much closer and stationary. Standing up and looking around, she realizes at last that she is under the tightly-shut robe of a women. Over on another cobble, she can dimly perceive a large, long object, clearly a foot, whose toenails were painted in the same shade of red that lies upon its high heeled shoes, a lustrous red that catches even this dim light. Looking over to her right, she sees its opposite, shifting up and down as if to relieve its burden, causing the steady succession of clicks. Stretching above them she can see two columns of flesh which rise to a lofty height until they meet the gigantic mass perched almost directly over the tiny girl, which she can't make out very clearly. Turning, she sees the street through the threadbare and rough-woven cloak, clearly cheap and probably ineffective at keeping out the cold. But, unknown to Ella, this day its purpose is not to keep out the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybella stands on the street corner, back to the alley and muttering under her breath. The cloak is chafing her exposed skin, of which there is a considerable amount, and she is cursing the necessity which makes her hold it tight around her body. She scans up and down the street, looking for trouble. This is one of the few alleys that she or any of the other girls could stand in front of with reasonable safety, since Mr. Hember, owner of the shop that dominated this alleyway, did not call the market watch on them, as long as they didn't steal anything, of course. Taking one last look around at the street, empty of guards but full of potential customers, she takes off her cloak and lays it neatly to the side before beginning to advertise her \"wares\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla squeaks and dives out of the way as the woman takes a step forward, nearly puncturing her body with her amazingly high (a tiny bit shorter than Ella) and pointed heel. When she looks up, the cloak is gone and the castle sized woman is setting the folded bundle of cloth on the ground next to her. Ella, however, is staring, surprised, repelled and slightly fascinated, at what little cloth the woman has remaining on her body, which isn't much. Her pale, shapely legs are bare all the way up to an astonishingly high level on her thighs, and the tight, brown under thing at that point only extends a tiny fraction up her midriff before becoming pale skin once more, leaving a massive expanse of skin which tapers off in an incredibly tight breast band (red, of course), which in turn ends astonishingly low on her chest, leaving nothing but a pair of string straps and the prostitutes face, which is too high for Ella to see even as she cranes her neck as far as it will go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla watches, almost entranced by this vision of a world she almost never views, given that this market is in the \"decent\" part of town. She watches as the woman, completely unaware of her presence, puts one immense bare arm to her even more massive midriff, cocks her hips seductively and calls out to one of the passerby:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey handsome,\" The man in question was, in fact, reasonably attractive, well dressed and still the right side of thirty, if only just. He turns and stares for a moment, admiring the prostitute, who is actually fairly attractive and also on the right side of thirty. Than he shakes himself and hurries away, red-faced and eyes downcast. Maybella stares after him for a moment, tosses her head as if to say \"You may be ashamed, but I'm still here\" and directs her attention to the next passing \"gentleman\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla slowly comes back to herself, the spell of both the massive size and forbidden display of this \"lady of the night\" wearing off as she displays herself to the passerby. None of them notice Ella, despite the fact that she is standing in plain sight. They are too busy, either averting their eyes and hurrying on or focusing their attention far higher up than the wee girl's height can claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla considers for a moment. Now that the initial shock is gone, she pulls herself together and thinks. Clearly, getting attention will be even more difficult now that this paragon of sensuality has arrived. As if to demonstrate this, a young, drooling male nearly squashes her underfoot in his booming passage, so taken up that he doesn't notice the figure, who is the size of a moderate rat, diving out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla pushes herself off the ground once again, thoroughly put out, trying to brush off the accumulation of grime on her clothes. She eyes the figure above her nervously, than sets her shoulders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all,\" she says to herself reassuringly, \"there just like any other person, just trying to make a living. Its not like there simply bad...\" Her sense of moral issues propels her to action. She marches towards the woman with a determined look.  Arriving just below her, trying not to look straight up at the large-but--tiny set of underwear hanging over her, she starts jumping up and down and yelling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello up there! Down Here! Help me!\" she screams at the very top of her lungs while waving her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybella, cursing even more fervently on the inside with every passing missed opportunity, fumes inside while keeping that seductive smile planted on her face. If only one male would take her up, she could get out of this watch-infested market. Preparing to try again with an old but obviously rich old man coming down the street, she pauses as she hears some truly odd sounds, like shouting at a distance heard through a wall. She looks up and down the street trying to identify the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla gives a frustrated \"Uhh!\" as the working girl's features hanging above her turned right and left, clearly looking for her. Ella puts her hands to her mouth and screams at the very top of her lungs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you floozy, down HERE!\" The prostitute definitely heard that, her head snaps downwards, eyes locking on to the miniature girl standing at her feet. Her eyes widen in shock and she sucks in a breath. She starts to step back and bend over, but before she could get any further a voice shatters the air:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You There, stay where you are!\" Maybella looks up from the ground quickly, eyes darting up and down the street. There, just up the street she sees a squad of overdressed Watchmen, led by a short and officious sergeant, bearing down on her through the thick crowd, trying to force their way through. Maybella reacts instantly, She sweeps up her cloak and pulls it on, covering her revealing clothing. She starts to run, but then recalls the sprightly figure at her feet. Looking down, she sees that the girl had been knocked over by her sweeping cloak and was now staring up at her, eyes wide and chest heaving. After only the slightest hesitation, she reaches down, snatches up this seemingly living doll and retreats into the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happens blindingly fast, the hand, the pressure from all sides, the massive force of being born into the air and deposited in this small cloth pouch, clearly an inside pocket of the cloak. The nauseating ride continues as the cloak swings back and forth freely, the prostitute is clearly hurrying along at a good pace despite her astonishing heels. Ella is thrown around in the pocket, getting rasped by the incredibly scratchy material of the cloak, occasionally feeling herself pressed up against the working girl for a moment of uncomfortably intimate contact, even through the cloth. The smells saturating the cloth are old and stale but still clearly, and horribly, identifiable to the unfortunate, trapped girl. The ride seems to last forever, but it really takes no more than thirty seconds as the woman finally comes to a halt after pulling a door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla feels the cloak relax as the woman slides down to the floor, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one,\" Maybella remarks to herself before remembering her little passenger. Intensely curious, she reaches down and pulls the warm, flexible figure out of her pocket and into the dim light. Ella is brought before the woman's face. She looks at it for a moment, taking in the blue eyes, thin but pleasant cheeks and good complexion as well as the unbelievably thick makeup, eye shadow and lipstick. The woman stares right back, frankly appraising Ella's looks and body, turning her hand this way and that as well as flipping Ella over in her hand for a moment. Flipping her back over, she smiles faintly and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you're a pretty little thing, aren't you?\" The figure's face screws up for a moment, than composes itself and shouts back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a 'thing', my name's Ella.\" The prostitute looks slightly taken aback, but then she says wryly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you now? So you can talk, it wasn't my imagination.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, It wasn't, I can talk. I'm a human, its just that this guy spilled some potion and then it got all over the ground and I... shrunk.\" Maybella notices the slight hesitation in th girl's voice before the final word, clearly being somewhat evasive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there's more to this story, but later. For now, my name's Maybella.\" They both hesitate, wondering what to say next. Finally...</span></div></div>",
