The sun gleamed into the glass of the sleek, spotless, white office. It looked like it belonged inside the hull of a spaceship. In a way, Swapcation was from a Sci-Fi Movie. Or at least it was, until Dr. Konar invented the Exchanger. Lilian chuckled a little bit, thinking of the long journey that the good Doctor and others had gone through to get to this point. Her heels clacked on the floor as she made her way back to her desk. She was a tall woman of only 22. Her lab coat hung loosely around her skinny frame, her red hair draped over the back. Stepping behind the desk, her pulled back her office chair and took a seat. She looked overthe day's schedule. Although the Exchanger had been used to swap many people unofficially in the past, the first commercial renter and donor would switch bodies today. Just as she was thinking of the subject, the office door swung open. The donor was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison Hixon, 25, female: A former Miss Tennessee, scandals ruined her modeling career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon Corduroy, 32, female: A lawyer, she's part of a racial sensitivity training in which participants of different races switch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody Ramirez, 19, male: A broke college student trying to make ends meet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi Hadad, 28, female: An international criminal who falsified her documents</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison Hixon waltzed into Swapcation's office with a swagger that she had practiced for years on the runway. Her luscious, long blonde hair gentle flowed as she walked towards  the desk. Her face was completely picturesque, symmetrical with pouty lips and a proportional nose. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Hixon!\", Lillian greeted her from behind the desk.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late\", Allison said, though her southern-tinged voice did not seem to convey guilt.<br>\r\n\"That's quite alright!\", Lillian replied, grabbing Allison's files and getting up from behind the desk,\" It gave us time to set everything thing else up. It was clear that Allison hadn't dressed to impress, only wearing a white T-shirt and green capris on her 5'7 frame. The sound of her flats hitting the ground were drowned out by the clacking of Lillian's heels as they made their way into a new room. It was neatly filled with medical supplies, a full-length mirror and an interesting looking chair. It resembled an office chair, but with more cushion and a device that looked like a headband facing upwards on its headrest. \"Just go ahead and have a seat there while I get things ready, Miss Hixon\".<br>\r\n    Allison cautiously did as she was told, daintily sitting down,\" Where's the other person?\", she asked,\" You're not going to rent my body out to some creep, are you\", as if savoring the moment, she took one last look at it. She had worked hard on it after all. Although her clothes were not noticeable, her figure certainly was. Her toned stomach and sleek legs were traits that many women would kill for. Even though her D-Cup breasts weren't natural, the surgeon had done a great job of giving them an appealing shape. Her rear wasn't thick like the ones in popular media, but tight and firm from hours of exercise.<br>\r\n   \"You're renter is in another room, in a chair just like this one\", Lillian said, propping up her chain and snapping the headband around Allison's skull, its two ends resting on her temples. Lillian then walked over to the Computer console across from her,\" And of course not, we thoroughly screen all of our renters\", Lillian responded, clicking and typing away,\" They're not able to do anything reprehensible. This is just like Airbnb, except you don't have to pay a mortgage on your property\", Lillian laughed, but Allison remained quiet, her nervousness beginning to show through.<br>\r\n\"Get ready to say hi to the new you in 3... 2...\", Allison's vision began to get hazy. Before she could get a handle on the situation, she promptly blacked out.<br>\r\n\"Miss Hixon.... Miss Hixon, wake up\", she heard a voice call. Allison groggily came to, peeling open her eyes. She couldn't put her finger on it, but she rely very odd. \"Congratulations, Miss Hixon! You've become the first commercial body donor!\", a different lab assistant decried, bringing a mirror up to Allison's face,\" But I should start calling you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler, 18, Male: A rich teen fresh out of high school <br>\r\nAnohka, 39, Female: The CEO and founder of Swapcation<br>\r\nRonald, 55, Male: A Business Tycoon<br>\r\nCheryl, 75, Female: An eccentric yearning for her youth.</span></div></div>",

The sound of her heels pierced the air, she certainly dressed to match her attitude. She donned a blew blazer, a cream-colored low-cut blouse with matching blue slacks.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming in, Ms. Corduroy\", Lillian chirped, grabbing a folder and getting up,\" Follow me this way, your renter is already here\". <br>\r\n\"Who are they?\", Talon asked, a quizzical look appearing on her broad featured face, her pencil thin eyebrows creasing her brow.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see first hand\", Lillian giggled, leading Talon down a hallways and then into a room. The space was rather plain, only containing a computer, a full-length mirror and a strange chair with a headband on the headrest,\"Please, take a seat\".<br>\r\n     Talon slowed her pace as she came up to the chair. Had she not been wearing heels, she would have stood at 5'5. Although she was by no means fat, Ms. Corduroy's body was a condensed mass. Her chest was a very distinct bulge, her chocolate breasts revealing a tightly compacted cleavage. Her stomach very lightly pressed against the fabric. Her thighs, on the other hand, we incredibly thick, connecting to a very large semicircle of an ass. As she sat her asset on the chair, Talon showed her first sign of apprehension,\" This is safe, right. Besides the fact the I'm probably going to wake up white\", she tried to home at the end.<br>\r\n   \"Perfectly safe\", Lillian replied, snapping the headband onto Talon's cranium and maling her way back to her computer,\" I think it's awesome that our first official swap is going to be for the Race Trade program. You guys are literally walking a mile in each other's shoes\", Lillian the did a little more typing,\" Say hello to the new you in three... two...\"<br>\r\nEverything went foggy, then faded to black  for Talon. Talon gasped as she felt air enter her lungs once more. She felt incredibly strange\"Ms. Corduroy...\", a female voice called.

His back foot was planted on the concrete outside in case he was wrong.<br>\r\n\"That's what the sign says\", Lillian chuckled, organizing some papers as she looked up,\" Cody Ramirez, right?\".<br>\r\n\"That's me\", Cody sighed in relief, stepping in and closing the door behind him.<br>\r\nLillian got up and motioned for Cody to follow her,\" This way\". Cody followed her down a spotless, white hallway,\" So, are you excited to be the first official donor of Swapcation?\", Lillian asked.<br>\r\n\"It'll pay for my semester, so yes\", he half-heartedly laughed. Cody was of average height and average build, which dark brown hair and a slightly tan complexion. The way he moved was lackadaisical, almost letting his limbs propel on their own. Eventually, the duo entered a room resembled the hallway. It only contained a computer, a mirror and a strange chair with a head set attached. <br>\r\n\"Take a seat\", Lillian said. Cody plopped down on the chair and Lillian swiftly snapping the headband onto his noggin. \"Ouch!\", he exclaimed, but Lillian ignored his cry. She began clicking and typing on the console across from his seat. \"Are there any side effects to this?\", Cody asked.<br>\r\n\"No, we ironed out all the bugs in the testing phases\", Lillian replied matter-of-factly,\" Relax Cody, it'll all be over in 3... 2..\". Before Cody could react, his vision began to distort, eventually fading to black. Cody felt cushion beneath him once more as he came to. \"Ugh...\", he groaned, but then stopped. His voice sounded incredibly strange.

She was a beautiful woman of Middle Eastern original, her long, thick black hair draped upon her shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Hadad!\", Lillian spoke, gathering up some papers from her desk and opening a door,\" Your Renter is in another room. Everything is good to go, just follow me\". As Naomi trailed behind Lillian, she breathed a sigh of relief. Her name wasn't even her real name. It was one of many aliases she had collected over the years. Everything she had submitted to Swapcation was a fake. Her Driver's license, Birth Certificate and Social Security number were all elaborate fakes.<br>\r\n\"This room, right here\", Lilian said, opening a door in the featureless hallways to reveal a featureless room, save for a mirror, computer and strange chair,\"Take a seat right there\". Naomi carried her athletic frame with grace over to the contraption. Her lithe form was dressed in a leather jacket and black jeans. Despite its sleekness, her body had curves in the right places that designated her as undeniably feminine. As she sat down, Lillian placed the headband connected to the chair around Naomi's head,\" Just one moment while I set things up\", she instructed, making her way over to the Computer.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\", Naomi replied, suppressing a smile. Her face was quite stunning, with long lashes, plump lips and a curved nose that fit her face. However, it hid sinister intentions. Naomi was actually on the run for her most recent jewel theft in France. She was on borrowed time here in the United States. She didn't particularly care whose body she ended up in. All she needed it for was to flee the country. There were illegal replications of Body Swap technology abroad. If her next vessel was not to her liking, she could surely purchase a more desirable one with the money she was about to receive.<br>\r\n\"Alright, Naomi\", Lillian interrupted the thief's thoughts,\" Say hello to the new you in 3... 2...\", The world began to spin. Naomi wanted to cry out, but her body was frozen and everything faded to black.<br>\r\n     Naomi slowly regained consciousness, a groan escaping her lips. Her eyes flashed open. The noise was entirely foreign to her. \"Calm down, Miss Hadad\", a woman in scrubs said in a soothing voice,\" Or should I say....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnohka, 39, Female: Scientist and CEO of Swapcation<br>\r\nPierce, 28, Male: An FBI Agent going undercover<br>\r\nAlbert, 42, Male: An every man with weird hobbies<br>\r\nCheryl, 75, Female: An eccentric widow</span></div></div>",

After many tests and legal battles and lobbying efforts, she is finally able to give the masses access to her technology. Her new company, <b>Swapcation</b>, allows donors to rent out their bodies to interested customers for a mutually agreed upon time period and price. Although the renters go through a background check before renting a body, the donors are not notified of their new identity until after the swap. Both individuals may be educated on their new identity after the switch is successful. Neither party is allowed to break the law, deface the other's body, or ruin the other's reputation. With Swap technology being so new, however, anything is up to interpretation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Rules </div></b><br>\r\n1. You may add as many characters as you like<br>\r\n2.
