            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason and Jenna found themselves in the Orphanage Director's office, sitting in silence as the mysterious duo that had chosen them finished signing the adoption papers. The adopting couple were dressed rather strangely, with the husband in a dark suit and tie with fedora hat, as though he were a gangster from the prohibition era. The woman also wore black, in the form of a long dress and feathery scarf, making her look like a combination of Morticia and Cruella de Ville. The director, a rather plump middle aged woman with a large beehive style hairdo, quickly gave the documents one final look over before declaring that the Twins were officially adopted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange couple stood and took each twin by the hand, leading them to the exit. Jason and Jenna would've been lying through their teeth if they were to say they would miss this place. The other children all treated the both of them like freaks, ruthlessly avoiding them at best, and tormenting them at worst. However, nobody had ever shown interest in adopting them either, and they were both very suspicious of their new guardians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were outside, rather than leading them to a vehicle as expected, they were instead taken down the street and into a nearby alleyway. \"Is anybody watching?\" The woman asked the man, who quickly glanced around to make sure the coast was clear. \"We're safe.\" He said. The pair of them then turned to the twins. \"I know this seems strange.\" The woman said \"But just trust us, this will all make sense very shortly.\" \"Who are you?\" Asked Jason. \"Why did you want us?\" Asked Jenna. The man raised his hand to quiet them. \"You may call me Mr. Magnus. My associate is Madame Morgana. I assure you, all your questions will be answered. For now, we need you to join hands with us, close your eyes, and remain silent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused as ever, the twins joined hands with the couple, and closed their eyes. The next thing they knew, there was a loud whooshing should, like a sudden blast of wind, and they felt a cold sensation spread throughout their bodies. \"You may open your eyes now.\" They heard  Mr. Magnus say. As they did so, they gasped in a mix  of shock and awe. They were no longer in an alley. Instead, they stood in a courtyard infront of an immense gothic castle of black stone, beneath a blood red sky. \"Where are we?\" Both twins said at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are no longer on Earth.\" Said Madame Morgana \"This plane has no true name, but in front of you is Kazamar Academy.\" \"Academy?\" Said Jenna \"So this is some one of school?\" \"Not just any school.\" Replied Mr. Magnus with a note of bemusement. \"You'll see soon enough. Now, the both of you just head inside through the main doors, and we shall see you tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused about just what was happening, the twins did as they were told, entering through the great wooden twin doors of the castle into a grand entrance hall lined with red tapestries and lit by torches, with a iron chandelier hanging from the ceiling. In front of them were dozens of other children around their age, all of them looking just as confused as the twins. Several of them whispering to each other, asking how they got here or if they were dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall, another pair of doors slowly creaked open, and a booking voice seemingly from nowhere said \"Enter.\" The crowd of children cautiously made their way through the doorway to a sort of Grand Hall, where a figure in a black robe, their face shrouded in shadow by their hood beckoned them from behind a podium. After everyone had entered the room, the figure spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, and welcome to you all. You now stand in Kazamar Academy of Black Magic. I am Mistress Faye, and I will be your advisor, and if nessecary...your punisher.\" At this, the whole room seemed to become about ten degrees colder. The figure continued \"In other words, I am the Headmistress of this school. I'm sure you're all wondering why you are here. It's simple, really. Each and every one of you  is what we refer to, as a Potential. A person with the capability to wield magic. Yes, you heard right, magic. Here, we can teach you to use your powers to their fullest. Now, I'm pretty sure the majority of you were labeled as freaks and outcasts in your old lives. That's because the Worms, those with no magic in their blood, can sense your power, your superiority. They ostracize and persecute you for it. But here, within these walls, you are among your own kind. Here, you are all brothers and sisters. We will train you for when the time comes that we shall assert our dominance on the rest of the world. Until that day, though, this place must remain secret, as there are those who would seek to undermine us, and betray their own kind. So, to all of you, I give this choice: Stay, and learn to wield your power and your right to rule, or have all memories of this place erased from your mind, and be sent back to Earth, to live as a sheep, awaiting for the day of the wolves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her speech, Mistress Faye paused. None of the potentials objected, which she took to mean they accepted her offer. \"Excellent. Your training and your new lives begin tomorrow.\" Faye snapped her fingers, and two portals opened on either side of the hall. \"These portals will take you to your sleeping chambers. Girls on the left, boys on the right. Sleep well, and welcome to the Academy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it begins. Which class shall Jason and Jenna's first lesson in the morning?</span></div></div>",

She turned to talk to Jason and remembered he was on the boys side of the dorms now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hope we're in the same class,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh, you won't be,\" said a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see a scrawny girl with a rats nest of hair and mauve skin dotted with orange moles. She smiled and held out her hand. Jenna took it only to find it came off. Sheepishly, she handed it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, it happens all the time. My mother claims it's puberty, but I have my doubts. The name's Ironica, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's so great! I wish mine was ordinary too. But what can you do, I was named after my grandmother on my father's side. You'll meet them at some point I'm sure. What about your parental units?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any, I'm an orphan. All I have is my twin brother, Jason,\" she told Ironica, than burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl handed her a huge hankie with a sympathetic sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We share a room, did you know that?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we?\" said Jenna in a muffled voice as she mopped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronica nodded happily until her nose fell off and had to be chased down the hall that they now found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my nose is well trained,\" Ironica giggled as it stopped on floor near a closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our room,\" her new roommate said as linked arms with Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some astonishment, Jenna was surprised to see a large red trunk on what she assumed was her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone likes you. I had to bring my own stuff from home,\" Ironica commented with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have my own stuff, so when we left, they must have taken it all back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Ironica said as she pawed through the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like Madame Morgana's taste. Lucky you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lights out soon, here's some night wear, I think,\" Ironica said as she tossed her a garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning early, Jenna and Ironica walked down to breakfast. Jenna watched as Ironica summoned up a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vaguely familiar voice cleared its throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know better, Miss Spellbound!\" the voice said. Without looking up, Jenna knew it was Mistress Faye and she was scowling darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume Jenna that you studied your text before bed last night? she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I was so tired and just went straight to sleep, I am sorry Mistress Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your first lesson in Basic Spells, we here at the Academy require that you conjure up your breakfast every morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand, the headmistress brought forth a copy of the textbook and handed it to Jenna.<br>\r\nTaking it reluctantly, she stared at the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, it looks delicious!\" Mistress Faye exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna startled and looked down at the table in front of her. There sat French toast with a side of bacon and orange slices. A steaming cup of cafe au lait sat to the left of the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did that come from?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said that you and your brother were naturals, but I was skeptical. Apparently, you are,\" the headmistress told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, Jenna started eating before it could disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistress Faye checked a watch she wore pinned to her waistband, then clapped her hand sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty minutes, First Years. I see you in the classroom where your Basic Spells master awaits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">There are plenty of stories out there about schools that teach magic to their students. But they're almost always focused on the lighter magical arts, so to speak. So, I thought, why not give the story a new twist and have it focus on the other side? Before anybody asks, no, this is not set in the Harry Potter universe. It's a completely separate world. Now then, some background info...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Jenna Steele have always been outcasts, be it at school or at the orphanage whose doorstep they were dumped on shortly after birth. They have no memories of their parents, and have only had each other to rely on their whole lives. All the other children either avoid them like the plague, or relentlessly mock and bully them. This has caused the twins to develop a deep mistrust, or even downright hatred for most people. Shortly after their fifteenth birthday, much to their surprise, a strange couple comes to the orphanage, wanting to adopt a set of twins. Since Jason and Jenna are the only twins in the building, they are chosen and lead to a secluded alley, where the couple transports them to another dimension, to be enrolled in Kazamar Academy for Black Magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested yet? If yes, feel free to continue. Hope you enjoy!</td>",
