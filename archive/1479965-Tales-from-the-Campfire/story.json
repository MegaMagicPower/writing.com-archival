The night however, didn't pass by peacefully, and each of the five teens dreamed strange dreams that night. They were all a little creepy, but Ryans was the scaryest by far...He dreamed of a sad little girl crying in a deep, dark woods. A strange fog hung in the air and the little girl began to sink in the mud, crying until the earth swallowed her whole. Then there came a voice, kind and loving, yet at the same time disturbed and full of evil...\"Come to me little sheep, let the dark fire surrond you... come to me little sheep...\" It chanted as the dream faded away to reality. Ryan sat up in his bed, covered in sweat and panting. He looked at the clock, it was 3:21 a.m. He got up, grabed a glass of water and went back to bed.  At around 4:11 a.m. he drifted back to sleep...</span></div></div>",

In a few more minutes he finally met up with his friends, who were all there and waiting for him. \"Glad you could make it.\" Carlos joked as Ryan pulled up out of breath and got off his bike. \"Yeah, heh heh, I slept in in...\" He stuttered as he greeted each of his friends. \"Bad dreams?\" Samantha asked. Ryan was surprised she had guessed it. \"Um, yeah, how'd you know?\" Samantha grinned as she twirled a curl of her hair. \"The same thing happened to all of us.\" They each took turns explaining the various nightmares they had experienced. \"Whoa, that's freaky.\" Ryan said as he leaned against the side of the store. \"But, then again, it is the day before Halloween...\" He glanced down at his watch for a moment. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" Asked Tera, the shortest member of the group. \"Oh, its just that its 4 minutes after 3:00.

You too, bye.\" He clicked the phone off and put it back in his coat pocket. \"Well?\" Robert asked in an annoyed tone. \"What did she say?\" Ryan let out a sigh before replying. \"Him and his friend Clarke got held up in traffic, they'll be here to pick us up, but not for a little while.\" A few members of the group let out a groan and shook their heads. \"Man, I really hope what he has planned is worth it.\" Robert said as he began walking around to help stay warm. \"Don't worry.\" Ryan said with a smile. \"Its my brother, he's never let us down before...\"</span></div></div>",

They were the best of friends, I might add and they did everything together. One night, on Halloween, mind you, the loner of the group, a boy named Caleb made a suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's important to know that Caleb wasn't exactly the happiest guy on the planet. He had quite a few 'personal issues' but I'll not get into those right now. All you need to know is that he had an unnatural obsession with Death. And that's death with a capital \"D\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyways, on Halloween, he suggested a certain...activity. Since the age of twelve, he had been searching for spiritual meaning. I'm afraid, however, that what he found had little to do with church, with God, Buddha...hell, worshiping the Great Spaghetti Monster would have been much more desirable. Because, you see, Caleb turned to the Black Arts, with a particular fascination with Necromancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had pitched the idea of a ritual to his friends, you know, as a sort of Halloween Fling. To kind of...capture the mood of the night. Brian, the unequivocal leader and self-professed 'lady's man' of the group, eagerly agreed, though he believed not one iota in an afterlife, or in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, a skinny, girl, who some found cute, while others saw her as a little on the homely side, also did not take much to convince her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith three on board, they turned to the last; Lucy. She was seventeen, pretty and level-headed. It is also important to note that she WAS very spiritual, a regular ol' Bible Thumper, she was. But the ritual called for a quartet. And when Caleb asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you in, Lucy?\" Everyone held their breath in anticipation...</span></div></div>",

Calib's friends were becoming more and more afraid by the minute. Even Brian, their unofficial leader felt a shiver crawl up his spine as their host continued his twisted chanting.

The first chapter will introduce you to your humble host and storyteller, Ben Mears. After the introductions, you will have the opportunity to choose from five potential stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                          Rules:<br>\r\n1. I won't delete much, but I really do not want anything explicit. This is meant to be a fun, atmospheric game to get in the spirit of Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Try to keep a folklore type of tone to your additions; i.e. \"Once, long, long ago, there lived a widow and her two sons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Please write in the third person as the Narrator is telling the story. However, you may include first person interjections from the Narrator. For example: \"Steve wasn't a bright boy, in fact, I'd say he was downright stupid. Nevertheless, he was well enough liked, though for the life of me, I can't say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.If you conclude a storyline, try to have a formal goodbye where the Narrator bids his guests farewell, telling them he hopes to see them next year, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.Try to be as grammatically correct as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Happy Halloween<br>\r\n</td>",
