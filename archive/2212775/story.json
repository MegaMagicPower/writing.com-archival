You'd never been able to defeat Edelgard in sparring- she always seemed one step ahead of you... and her power was more than overwhelming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm...

I can't feel myself improving...\" you reply. You were quite uncertain of your skills, at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well- I think that you are. You almost had me with some of those thrusts- you haven't been training without me, have you?\" She asks with a laugh. \"If you are, I must say, you found yourself another good choice of a training partner\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two of you settled down outside the Arena, settling yourselves at a table and chair not too far from it.

It would be quite nice to talk simply and one-on-one with Edelgard...

It'd be quite nice to get to know you better, Edelgard...\" you replied to Edelgard's words with a smile, nodding your head accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl soon made a motion to sit down under the roof that bordered the courtyard, letting you escape the bounds of the bright and warm sun. \"I hope you do not mind me doing this, as I rarely have the opportunity to relax.\" She said, trusting you not to not freak out like Bernadetta would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... it's fine, really!\" You respond, slightly concerned as to why Edelgard may think it negative- did she truly believe that you had much better to do? Besides- the training was halted because of you clearly being tired out, in comparison to her. \"No problem...! if that's how you want to relax... that's how you want to relax!\" You say, lightly chuckling once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thanks- that being said, this sort of thing is scarcely without its merit. I wish to get to know you better. As the future inheritor of the Kleimnas Territory, I did imagine that you would be enrolled at the same time as the rest of us...\" Edelgard said, looking to you so as to indicate that you would explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... well, my family isn't exactly one of the... bigger ones\" they reply, giggling. \"It took a good bite out of our family's personal funds to even get me here, honestly!\" They added, scratching their head. \"I'm... thankful, that they decided it was worth it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kleimnas family had been in financial trouble, not too dissimilar to house Galatea of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus- they were easily the Noble house still holding a small territory lacking in funds the most. yet still... they managed to scrape by and keep a hold of their lands- in no small part to Count Kleimnas' skill as a warrior. At times, he could give Count Bergliez a run for his money, even...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the end though...

The boots and the stockings, as well, looked quite alluring... yet at the same time, you knew you had to suppress any urges you had at this moment... you didn't want to ruin their relationship with Edelgard. She didn't seem to think much of it before she looked back to you. She had a slight look of surprise before she began to rub them. \"A-Ah- I must apologise... I simply couldn't bear keeping them in my boots any longer. I hope you might understand the feeling...\" She replied, giving a slight raise of the eyebrow as if to indicate if it was alright to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... it's fine, really!\" You say, glancing down at their feet as if you had only just noticed in response to Edelgard's comment. \"No problem...! if that's how you want to relax... that's how you want to relax!\" you say, lightly chuckling once again. of course, you had noticed long before this... due to your little 'fascination' with feet, to put it lightly and politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you continued to converse, you continued to glance down at the feet in front of you. Those incredible feet that, honestly, seemed like they could crush you underfoot at a moment's notice. The princess, herself, noticed the uncomfortable glances of her friend when her feet were revealed, about to put her boots back until she noticed what it really was: lust. Edelgard soon came up with a devilish little idea... to test her theory by wiggling her toes, hoping that it would incite a reaction.</span></div></div>",

You, a member of the Black Eagle House, were practising your Bowmanship with one of the Knights of Seiros, Shamir, in the Training Arena. You were never a truly accurate shot, in all honesty... that was why you were having Shamir train them. She was especially well known for their well-trained eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... after so many failed shots, it doesn't seem real...\" You said, dusting off the skirt you wore as part of their uniform. You were a man, masquerading as a woman, but no one in the Monastery knew that... at the very LEAST, not yet... You was still cautious not to get caught... if they DID get caught... they could get in serious trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to huff. \"H...How was that, Shamir? I-I know I missed a lot, but... how did I do? Overall?\" you asked. You did rather poorly, honestly... they were quite sure that the teachers and staff told horror stories about how bad you were at practical AND academic subjects... but, at the very least, you had some spirit, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir couldn't help but let out a small sigh. She could see from here barely anything had hit the actual target. Scattered arrows around the target with one that had barely hit the edge. She shook her head approaching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose on the positive side things can only go up from here...\" She said. \"You missed every single shot but one. And the one you did hit was off to the edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said almost casually. Still, it had been a while since she had seen that low level of skill. Even Cyril had been a better student originally. \"Come on, walk down and go retrieve your arrows, you can see for yourself.\" She said, lightly pushing on their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to their criticism intently. Of course, it wasn't exactly perfect... but you were trying at least, right...? that was... something... you... weren't utterly hopeless, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\" They say, nodding their head, before going to pick up the arrows. It was there that you really recognised how badly that they were of a shot... such a horrible shot, in fact. Some of them even landed BEHIND where they shot from, how ever that happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same, you found themselves picking up all the arrows at Shamir's behest, and putting them back into the quiver. They were a little disappointed at their own performance but... oh well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... what next, Shamir...?\" You asked, semi-cautious. Shamir could continue to training in some other direction, like sparring, or she could just throw it all out of the window today and stop... both of those just seemed to exemplify how bad they really were...</span></div></div>",

And they had tried despite the lack of skill which was more then some students did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this? Maybe you need a bit more motivation. You can take some shots again, get a bit more practice. If you can hit the target three times then we can say you've had some definite improvement...\" She trailed off before a sudden smirk appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However if you do less then we will move right onto sparring.\" You both knew as one of the combat instructors you had even less of a chance in direct sparring against Shamir. She patiently waited for an answer to her little challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted their head for a moment. hit THREE times...?! That seemed... practically impossible for someone of your skill! but... You could try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I'll... do what I can!\" You say, motivated. With that, you loaded up another volley of arrows... they missed. Over and over... and over, again. failing time and time again, it was a wonder how you were this bad. Still utterly hopeless, despite your motivation... You didn't want to fight Shamir and get your ass handed to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you actually landed a hit for once... but you only had 4 shots left... if you kept it up, you'd have more than enough...! but... you didn't know if they could do it... you didn't know if they'd manage... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir frowned. Sure you had actually managed to hit it once, but with your current skill she highly doubted you would manage to land another hit. She would of course stick to her word if you actually managed it but she didn't believe it could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" She said, forcing you to pause. She got close and began to adjust the posture. \"This is probably one of the reasons why. You need a better posture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved your arms back, and used her foot to push apart your feet a but more. She couldn't care less about the close contact, not like another girl would mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull back as far as you can.\" She said after finally finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back the string all the way, and landed a direct hit. Your features lightened... You just had to land a few more hits... and you wouldn't have to spar...</span></div></div>",

Then you can start learning the advanced tricks, such as sneaking around, escaping from being bound up, opening doors.\" She mentioned casually, listing off several of the skills that she often found to be quite useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...If Shamir wasn't so close. And if they hadn't mentioned being bound up... thing may have been better. That threw off your concentration a bit, causing you to lose 2 of the shots. You managed to pass it off as just a simple slip up, but... would it remain that way...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamir did not catch on to the effect she had. She did notice however that you had suddenly and rather quickly lost all concentration. She shook her head in disappointment and gave them a quick pat on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try. Still you need to work on your concentration. If you can't hit a shot with me here and talking however would you be able to hit anything on an actual battlefield?\" She began to lecture. She was being entirely truthful about it, that type of carelessness could get you killed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you know the deal. Go pick up the arrows and put them away. I will be waiting for you and then we will spar as I said before.\" She ordered, her tone now less apologetic and more authoritative as she gave the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slightly disappointed chuckle as they went to collect their arrows. They had lost the challenge, but come so close...! now, they had to spar with Shamir... now, you weren't too fearful, it was highly unlikely their secret would get revealed here... but what Shamir might demand out of you afterwards... that was a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you were ready to spar with Shamir... as ready as they COULD be, really... what could they ask for or demand after this? escape training? foot massages? ...that was likely just their perverse thoughts talking... no way either of those would show up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... here I come!\" You say, beginning to start their assault... leaving plenty of openings and ways for Shamir to dismantle your attacks.</span></div></div>",

She easily evaded every single blow, barely taking any effort on her own part as she easily batted away some attacks and just stepped to avoid others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she decided to end the first spar. Without much effort she tripped you, forcing you on his back on the ground. As soon as you hit the ground then Shamir followed up by simply stepping on their stomach and applying a tiny bit of pressure. Her boot digging in just a bit. You grunted as they felt Shamir's boot press into your body. honestly, it wasn't that bad... it felt quite good, honestly! being stepped on by Shamir and her... honestly massive booted feet, was quite wonderful... though they had to try and keep their mind off of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't believe it but your sparing is even worse than your Archery. You need some serious improvement there. After all, thieves are expected to be able to dodge in combat as well.... you're going to try again, but there will be a punishment of my choosing if you are this lacking again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right... what will it be...?\" You asked, as they prepared themselves again. They were an incredibly lacking student, but... what would they be able to do about it...? and what kind of... punishment, would she inflict? would it be what you had fantasised of... or something more...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey received no answer, as if Shamir was leaving it as a surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you readied yourself again... and found yourself with many openings once again... You put up more of a fight this time, though, thankfully, but you couldn't tell if this was Shamir just playing with them, or not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure to hide it but inside Shamir was smirking. She was starting to get playful with you. It was clear the level of skill was so wide she didn't think that you would ever be able to make it up. Still, the other girl was trying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the smirk reveal itself as she decided to have some fun.</span></div></div>",
