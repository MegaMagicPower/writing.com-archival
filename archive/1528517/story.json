As she did she turned her back to put the bottle of whiskey she had poured from back on the selves behind her. so a young woman came in. She was silent like a ninja her footsteps seeming not to register with the wooden floor. She merely dropped a small blue materia orb into the drink Tifa had poured. The materia dissolved into the liquid as if it was never there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!!\" Tifa was startled as she turned around. The young woman smiled brightly. \"Can I help you.\" She nodded and pointed to a bottle of vodka above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One shot.\" She said with a gentle smile. Tifa shrugged and got her a shot glass then poured her one. \"Hey.\" She tapped Tifa's drink with her fingernail. \"Cheers\" Tifa nodded and picked up her glass they both raised it. With a *clink* they both downed their drink. \"Thank you Tifa, this will be a wonderful night!\" The girl got up and smiled as she left her payment and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she know my name?\" Tifa asked herself but before she could ponder on it she felt...odd, and stronger and all in all just powerful! \"Whoa, ok I know I'm not drunk!!\" Tifa said as she shot up to 3 meters tall (9'9) Her head NEARLY touching the ceiling. \"Whoa...\" She whispered repeated herself she felt a strange power inside her. </span></div></div>",

The spiritual pressure inside her flowed through her body and felt like it was building up and expanding. She looked down on her self and saw her boobs were larger than they were before. Orihime sighed and said aloud, \"They just want to keep getting bigger!\" Orihime then felt her hands on the edges of her bed, she couldn't believe this since the bed was indeed larger than her. She sat up and saw that her feet was starting hang off her bed as well. Orihime scratched her head in disbelief, \"What's going on? My body is overwhelming with this energy.\" Her shirt started to tear and stretch with her oversized breasts, her skirt looking shorter on her by the second.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cleo was sitting by herself, daydreaming. The sort of day where she\u00b4d sit in her room staring in the blank space for hours, perhaps dance a little, act a little, perhaps masturbate a little. Other days she\u00b4d read, watch movies or ponder on the world and what is was about while lying on her terrace staring at the blue sky and sun. Her dreams and thoughts would often contemplate on herself and who she was. What was she doing in the world. And more importantly, why was she not doing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was so full of places to be, and cultures to explore. But as much as she craved for adventure the more saddening it was to know that she\u00b4d never go there.<br>\r\nHaving just come out of college, with a fine diploma to go, she had been so sure that the world was hers for the taking. Instead she had gotten a deadbeat job as a waitress in a small diner where the tables was always greasy. With no money to be earned, the only adventuring to do was what she could do in her head or extract from fiction.<br>\r\nAnd the worst part? She felt so powerless. Like she had a problem, where she could never discover the solution. As if the only way to realize her fantasies. ALL of them. Was for some divine gift to be bestowed on her. But alas that would never happen in the real world. The real world was boring<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, bother!</i> She thought to herself <i>If only something could get me out of this damn rut! Something extraordinary! A real gamechanger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh but there is</i> answeared a unseen echo. Cleo sprang from her seat and scouted the room for intruders but found none!<br>\r\n\"Who said that\" she asked to the emptiness<br>\r\n<i>I did</i> said the voice. It belonged to a woman, and had a sort of harmonic music to it. It filled the room with a resonance that reflected on every wall and surface. Like a bell that made a thousand sounds rather than a single, as to mimic speech<br>\r\n\"And who might \"you\" be then?\" asked Cleo<br>\r\n<i>Well, im you. Sort of</i><br>\r\n\"Well you cant be me, can you now. Im here and you\u00b4re not where i am, so you can\u00b4t be me. Otherwise i\u00b4d be talking to myself, and that would just be silly\". Though right in her way, Cleo knew that it was only half-true, as talking to herself was something she had done scores of times. Never out loud, though. Which was why this strange scenario stood out.<br>\r\n<i>Well, im not entirely you. And yet i am. Im sorta the inside-you you, if that makes more sense</i>. It didn\u00b4t. In fact it made less sense. Cleo thought she was being pranked.<br>\r\n<i>You\u00b4re not being pranked</i> that took Cleo aback.<br>\r\n\"Did you just read my mind?\" Asked Cleo in confusion.<br>\r\n<i>No no. I heard it. I live in here after all</i><br>\r\n\"So you\u00b4re just something im imagining\"<br>\r\n<i>No, not that either i'm really here. Im you, just without the body. I know everything though</i><br>\r\n\"Oh really\" Cleo found that this could be interesting. \"Like what? Tell me! I\u00b4d love to know more stuff, and seems like you\u00b4re quite the person to ask!\"<br>\r\n<i>Oh please, don\u00b4t get snarky with me</i>. The voice snapped in its music-like voice. <i>Look, I\u00b4ve got a solution to your problem. Or our problem, however you want to interpret it.</i><br>\r\n\"Solution? What do you mean by solution. How\u00b4s a voice gonna help me move on\" Although Cleo had her doubts the voice seemed like a interesting development to her problem, and she\u00b4d welcome any help it had. Especially if it truly WAS all-knowing, as it boasted<br>\r\n<i>How? Well, i know stuff for a starter</i><br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. What kind of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<i>I know you want some power. I know you like to dream a lot. And i know how you can get the kind of power that you happen to dream about</i> A sudden shiver froze Cleo in her place. She stood silent for a moment, thinking if there was truth to what the voice said. Was the voice even real, or was she still daydreaming?<br>\r\n<i>You\u00b4re not daydreaming. And im not lying either</i> This time the voice not only read her mind, but predicted her next thought as well. If this was legit, where was the loss in going along?<br>\r\n\"That power, huh? And how would i get that power then\". Excitement surged through Cleo by this point. As if she was unwrapping christmas-presents as a child.<br>\r\n<i>It\u00b4s already in you</i>. The answear caused both confusion and disappointment. Cleo did not know how to act, so she asked<br>\r\n\"Uuhh... What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<i>It\u00b4s already in you, Clementine. You just found your inner voice. Me being here is a proof of that. Now you gotta find your inner power. The power within you. Grasp it, and you dreams will come true. Like a child in a playground, all you have to do is start the game you want to play. Its that simple</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later Cleo found herself standing in front of the mirror that hung on her apartments door. It rose as tall as her, and she had a full view of herself. Its was time to test the legitimacy of whatever had contacted her. There could be two outcomes to this. Either her life was about to get a whole lot bigger, given that the voice told the truth. Or she\u00b4d stand alone and unaltered, which of course would prove that the voice had been another too realistic daydream all along.<br>\r\n<i>Im not a daydream!</i> exclaimed the voice<br>\r\n\"Then how do i do this\" asked Cleo. In spite of making everything sound simple, the voice was asking her of a more complex task than she could solve herself.<br>\r\n<i>You just do it. Its that simple. Its all im your imagination already. All you have to do is make it real</i>. Unsure of what \"it\" really was, Cleo nonetheless gave it a shot.<br>\r\nShe took a heavy breath, sucked in her belly, took a firm stance and gave her reflection a sharp look. She put her mind to the situation. <i>Can\u00b4t hurt to try</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<i>Exactly</i> replied the voice.<br>\r\nAnd with that Clementine did it. With every strain her mind could muster she told her body to do the exact thing that she and the voice wanted it to. She described the action she wanted to occur aloud with a single word: \"Grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did. A jolt ran throughout her entire being, and in a split second, her entire figure suddenly elongated by half a feet, setting her well at 6, feet tall. Her frame left the space of the mirror within the second, and her clothes tigthened around her body. Nothing was by extraordinarily much, but it was nonetheless completely real.<br>\r\n\"Holy fucking shit!\" Cleo yelled in joy. \"It really worked!\". There was still a hint of doubt even when she stood with results<br>\r\n<i>Told ya it would. You just had to do it</i>. The voice was impossible not to hear. Though it was possible to ignore it. All Cleo could think of was the power she had just gotten, and whether she could excersize it again.<br>\r\nOnce again, she put her mind to the idea of getting bigger, and yet again her voice swole in growth, this time even more violently than the former one. \"Wohohohoa, here we go\" she said in ecstacy, while the growth lifted her another 2 feet in the air, and only seemed to stop abruptly when she knocked her head on her ceiling. Her body\u00b4s expansion ripped her clothes apart. The sleeves on her shirt sprang, unable to contain her swelling arms, and her shirt ripped on from the midriff and up. What was left of it remained overstretched and tight around her cleavage. The sewings in her pants could not contain her legs which grew with her, leaving her pants a hull of dangling cloth, with holes on evey side.<br>\r\nTowering over her apartment living/bedroom, Cleo happily studied her new and massive height. She thought of the untold potential that was hidden in this oddly sudden ability she had unlocked, and the happier it made her, the more longing she became for her next growth surge.<br>\r\n\"This is amazing\" she said to the voice. \"I have to do it again. You have to tell me how to control this!\"<br>\r\n<i>Well the thing is...</i> replied the voice<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

The people thought they were seeing things. Their queen was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes could not resist the strain her powerful body put on them so they ripped, her glorious nude form now exposed to the world. She rose higher and higher. Her feet expanded towards her people. The people were frozen in fear and awe, some willingly stayed to be a sacrificed to the Goddess before them. Their bodies were crushed to paste before the force of her divine feet. Finally she stopped growing. She was 1 mile tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon God has given me this power. I am no longer your queen, I am your Goddess. Now become mine and join me in my conquest to rule this world.\" Daenerys boomed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe marveled in amazement at her power. To think she used to be one of these mites that scurried at her feet. They were not even the size of one of her toes. Just the strength of her voice caused the people to cover their ears and her dragon was smaller than her breast. There was a dragon perched on each breast. Her skin had turned a pure divine white. Her third dragon was perched on her head on her radiant golden locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people stared in awe at their Goddess. The dragons looked like mere bugs next to her. Everyone bowed before Goddess Daenerys, they were all hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good but this is no different to how you treated me when I was your queen. But now I am divine. I am a Goddess, your Goddess so WORSHIP ME. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer people rushed to feet some rushed to her toes. They began to lick. They were greeted with the taste of foot oil and sweat it was not good but it could have been a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My skin is divine but you worms are not yet worthy of tasting the true taste of my feet so I have replaced it with how my feet tasted when I was queen. In any case you have done well, now I will free all the slaves so they can serve their Goddess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Daenerys could see a slave city in the distance. It was 20 miles away. A distance she could cover with one step. She raised her divine foot. Its shadow enveloped all her people. She moved it until it loomed over the other city and slammed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force she unleashed on the city was cataclysmic, houses and towns were reduced to rubble. Before anyone could admire her divine power. She raised her divine foot and slammed it right next to her other one. There were no survivors. Her dragons barely stayed perched to her. Her people were petrified once again in a state of shock and fear at the power of Goddess Daenerys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm it seems I have destroyed the city, oh well it is a great honor to die underneath a Goddess. But I do not want everyone to die. Still it was not a total waste. Everyone on this continent is now aware of my divine might. Still to remove any doubt of my power, I will give them a slight glimpse of my true power.\" Goddess Daenerys said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Daenerys began to grow. Luckily she was facing away from her people so her expanding feet bulldozed through slave cities instead. In 10 seconds she had doubled in size but she did not stop there.

It was a slow, continual set of tremors, shaking the foundations of several buildings. Of course, the citizens and tourists expected the occasional earthquake, but there was another cause for alarm here. A long stretch of restaurants, bars, and shopping areas rested in a dark shadow, rising and descending ominously. Up, and down. Up, and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazuna snored softly as she regained consciousness. She reached an arm up to rub her eyes clean of sleep - and felt it weighed down. Buildings trembled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red hair swooped around as her head flopped to the right. Though she couldn't make out the resort she and her friends had deposited their luggage in, it was easy to see the sand covering her body. There was even an impressive sandcastle built on her stomach. Sniggering erupted from her left; when Hazuna turned her head to spot it, she found herself staring at a pair of ankles. Following them upwards led to a blue swimsuit (borrowed from a friend), a cheery smile, and bright pink pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey, Mii.\" The sand-bound girl yawned out, with a flat smile. \"Guess I kinda dozed off there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe echoing, tired voice shot through the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMii giggled again, looming above while patting down another handful of sand onto Hazuna. \"You can sleep though anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead would've shrugged if she didn't have that enormous pile of fine grains on her. \"The sun always makes me lethargic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long stretch, Hazuna tore herself away from her grounded position. Instantly, the sand slid off the side of her stomach - and something crashed below. The sandcastle... Wait, no. Her fingers brushed against the side of a shattered, rectangular structure, hidden in the sand. A skyscraper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around. Everything was far too low to the ground. The beach barely stretched for a few feet. Everything looked tiny, even the ships in the water... Except for her four friends, snickering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What did you guys do?\" She started panicking, sweatdrops falling down to Naha City. \"We're enormous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemi smiled, looking at the ground below. \"Absolutely gigantic! And you were in just the PERFECT state to bury in sand - with a little city block underneath!\" She laughed, brushing her blueish hair back. \"You really -can- sleep through anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemis lifted a hand behind her own, shorter, purple hair, looking uncertain. \"I've hear my homeland... I mean, the US - they have bases here. They may have conducted some type of experiment, that could, possibly, have led to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, strong, slender arms wrapped behind her. Nindaline was hugging Demis tightly. \"Then a huge thank-you from China! I'm so glad we could all gather here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly-awoken girl was still disoriented by the sudden change. The strong scent of the ocean, the sounds of fleeing people, everything at a miniaturized scale below... It dizzied her. \"You know, maybe we should ask that army for some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemi chimed in: \"Or destroy their base. And declare world dominance. We should weigh every option!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMii, the shortest - but the eldest - crossed her arms. \"Nuh-uh! Nindy and Demis came all the way to Japan! We deserve a vacation, we're gonna have super-giant bundles of fun, and these stupid little people aren't going to get in the way!\" She crossed her arms. With that voice, nobody could argue. \"Nindaline! Choose our first game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a bit off-guard, her green locks swaying against the pink swimsuit. \"Uhm, how about a simple warm-up game? You have any of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warm-up... Could I suggest Oshikura Manju?\" Demis suggested. \"I've wanted to try that for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oshikura Manju?\" The Chinese girl shot a puzzled gaze back. \"What kind of Japanese magicks is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReni lifted a finger to the clouds, happy to take a chance to explain. \"All participants enter a circle, and press their backs together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she narrated, Mii eagerly began carving the streets. She laughed at how easily the concrete base gave way to her active, twitching fingers. People dove and hid from the goliath-sized wall of flesh that was bulldozing the neighborhood. It crossed through a few homes, slicing the walls neatly. By the end, no less than 3 blocks were within Mii's constructed play area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When one player gives the signal, everyone pushes back against each other as hard as possible, still facing the ring's outside. The goal - beyond warming up through shared body heat - is to push all other players out.\" With the seriousness of an Olympic athlete, she walked into the play area, legs spread apart. A few loose, blue strands of her hair rained down to the ground as she brushed it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemis inched forward next. The Asian-American hesitated, dangling a sandal above the clean beach community below - before entering toes-first, as if it were a cold pool. The citizens ran for emergency exits, only to find a moat blocking the way. Mii had been eagerly scooping up salty ocean water in her hands (paying no mind to swimmers that fell in her palms) and dumping it into the trench she dug. There was no way out for anyone trapped amid the city blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth this pink-haired girl and Hazuna entered next. The latter scratched her arm, grinning to the others. \"It's been a while since I've played this. Hope my karate classes pay off!\" Their backsides squeezed against each other snugly as they got in the ring, all eight of the swimsuit-clad buttocks hanging ominously in the skies above. Only one girl was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nindaline? Something wrong?\" The redhead shouted to the pink-clad groupie. She was crouching down, one arm to the ground, the other held near her chest. Her slender fingers scooped a couple of fleeing citizens and cars, adding to the crowd she'd already collected - which rested in her other palm. She carried them into the ring with her. \"I thought I'd invite some of these tiny people to join!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, good thinking,\" Reni said with a sly look. \"The game works better when there's more players... No matter how little chance they stand of winning.\" She placed a hand to her lips, cooing at the mass. \"Ready to warm up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Demis' immense - yet slender - shoulders shrugged to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls were now ready. Their backsides pressed softly against each other, shivering in anticipation. The populace below shuddered in fear, looking for places to hide. Nindaline carelessly dumped the handheld crowd on her own backside - slight moisture on the swimsuit keeping them clinging on. A deadly drop below. The crushing strength of giant cheeks in every cardinal direction. They looked to the skies above for a miracle - and found a rainbow of hair colours. Their giant tormentors weren't even looking down at their victims. Just a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMii's shriek shook the neighborhood - \"Ready... GOooooowoahwoahwooooah!\" The joint strength of the larger girls pushed her out nearly instantly. Citizens outside the ring, still able to evacuate, couldn't calculate the distance she'd fly and underestimated just how enormous her body was. Many of them met their final resting place under her screaming face. More still fell under her chest, buried instantly in bulbous graves. Only a few writhing, injured bodies survived under her once-short limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oshikura Manju, osarete nakuna!\" The others chanted happily, as was customary for the game - it became an ominous, all-powerful roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the circle, utter chaos abounded everywhere. The girls pushed harder and harder against each other, chanting in excitement. The uneven movements made their sandals crash again and again around the ring - people below struggled to maneuver around and out of buildings before an errant stomp destroyed them. But the ones who had it the worst were those caught between the supple bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no way of predicting any movement; while waiting for Demis' rear end to squeeze them in, Reni's would take them off-guard. The pain from the crushing strength could only by rivaled by humiliation from the fact it came from such cute girls wearing nearly nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemis was the next to fall out; she managed to keep her balance, gracefully skipping into a mall before stopping. Nindaline pushed harder, her legs making quick hopping motions that shook the ground. Breathing space became more and more limited. The Chinese girl put nearly all her energy in one push - leaving her weakened before she could react to their counter-attack. A block fell under the shadow of her bosom as she fell; only some lucky people near the cleavage area survived. The impact was so harsh, the entire city trembled, and some people bounced right into the folds of her bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiyaa...\" She groaned, looking down annoyed. \"Screw seven generations of your ancestors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was down to two girls: Hazuna and Reni. Their hair colors clashed, painting a striking image in the skies; their butts clashed, too, painting striking images in the citizens' minds. The ones struck most of all, though, were those still between the bikinis; the heavenly white struggling to hold Hazuna's backside, or the tight folds around Reni's taut rear. It felt like thousands of tons were smashing them left and right. People below weren't any luckier; as both pushed with equal tenacity and energy, they wobbled all over the moat-blocked part of Naha City. Their sandals flattened every standing structure twice over while they rotated around; if one were to take all the shattered people, buildings, and dreams from underneath the soles, they could populate a small community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Reni crashed to the ground, joining the three others. Hazuna brushed her swimsuit clean of debris and bodies, surprised at how pleasing the sensation was against her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty fun! Good job, everyone. So, what's next?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reni groaned in dissatisfaction, crushing a pair of houses as she went on her elbows. Her hands a few bits of debris and people off the ramp of her nose. They landed in her awaiting bosom, feeling uncomfortably cool. \"Well, this bustling around is certainly fun, but I think a tanning break is in order. We should give ourselves a chance to soak in the sun.\" Annoyed by some squirming in her cleavage, she slammed her breasts together, flattening the survivors. \"...And give this city a chance to soak in our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill splat in the center of a residential district, stomach to the ground, Mii looked back over her shoulder at her friend. Even from the crouching position, stood taller than most of the structures around. \"That's convenient! Nindy and I won't even have to move.\" She swept her arms and feet up and down several times over, making a snow angel out of flattened ruins. \"But we've gotta play something really good when we're done. We won't be in Okinawa forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can't tell how long these effects will remain...\" Demis shuddered. She looked around for a relatively clear spot, ending up resting her backside in the ring her and her friends had just fought in. It unknowingly squeezed the last traces of life under its plush expanse. She stretched her legs out, staring up at the sky - humming uneasily as she felt the soles of her cork sandals slice the corner of a store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngg, I just woke up, though... And I just cleaned this junk off!\" Still wiping across her chest with the front of her arm, the mighty Hazuna, stretched her cramped legs and backside, striking a fearful image against the glowing sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little laugh erupted not that far - relatively - beside her. Nindaline's hand gripped her ankle - even at the same height as her friend, the buxom girl was amazed at the size of the hand against the people below. \"Come on! What was it you say again in Japan? 'The nail that sticks out gets pounded down', right?\" As if to demonstrate that, she tugged her friend's leg, bringing the girl crashing to the ground. Screams erupted from every direction as the soil shook. Hazuna's lithe frame caused an eruption across Naha City, destroying a few more buildings on their last legs. Surprisingly, the ground seemed soft, so easily did it retreat upon being touched by the bikini goddess' flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahaa, okay, okay! No use wiping these crushed things off again.\" The redhead snickered, the sound echoing across the land. \"And I guess you gals deserve to relax after I beat you so badly.\" Her white-clad buttocks wiggled as it got comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReni turned to her, the side of her black bikini crushing a traffic jam, her indigo hair sweeping across the streets. \"I'm sure you'll win this tanning game, too. Nobody can conquer The Great Hazuna when it comes to slacking off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a hand move across her back. Her haughty expression gave way to wide-eyed surprise. The active fingers smeared a few bodies smeared against the curves and folds of skin. Looking behind her, the once-tiny, pink-haired girl was giggling like a madwoman. \"Just puttin' on some sunscreen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to respond, Reni simply shifted to her stomach; stretching herself until the streets had comfortably given way under the weight of her body. Mii sat down, then went back into lying position, her titanic cheeks lit up by the glow of the warm sun. The red-haired girl curled up around a building, her right arm caressing it into her side. The Asian-American Demis kept staring at the sun, rubbing her head of the sweat that crossed it. Nindaline, herself, was playing idle games with the people, chasing them with her titanic fingers, which stomped across the crumbling cement like miniature giants themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they cornered a man down an alley, she reached in. He screamed in terror. They approached, overwhelming him, blocking out the sun... And stopped. The soft skin brushed against the windows of the buildings to either side. Strange, they fit in perfectly into that crack a second ago. He shivered with morbid anticipation. She attempted to pull her hand back out, and simply crush him under her fist... But couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the green-haired girl noticed: these digits were getting bigger. Too big for the alley. Wiggling them around, she loosened a few chunks of cement; then cleanly sliced through the great structures, burying the escapee in a grey tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a warm pressure in the depths of her stomach. The Chinese girl called out: \"Hey! I think I'm growing again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest of them squirmed against the sensation of fleeing people. \"Ooohoo, I'm feeling it too! That bumpy sensation in my belly, like I'm bloated on snacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazuna groped herself, curious. Indeed, it felt like something was pushing out. In small pulses, matching the rhythm of her heartbeat perfectly. First, a tickle, squirming around her navel. Then, a few thumps later, a warm caress, like a lover's embrace. It blended in with the sun's lingering heat, spreading across her. Her fingers and toes curled and uncurled multiple times in the continual, mouth-watering gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah...\" She tried lifting herself up to get a better look around at the diminishing Naha City; but a few more pulses of growth lured her back to the ground. The titanic girl had to content herself with comparing her arms and hands with the surrounding structures, very few of which still existed. Every little spurt, they stretched out further, hitting new goalposts of still-standing landmarks. \"Did it feel like this last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only girl she could see from her position was Reni, resting across a residential district, and kicking her legs out in comfort \"Mmmh... No, this is far better.\" Her eyes shot coyly towards the girl, as one of her stretches tore through a fleeing crowd. \"That buzzing inside was there, yeah. But the overall sensation... Knowing that a thousand eyes are staring at you... Each of them gazing up in fear, seeing your body taking them over effortlessly...\" She brushed an arm lazily through a street, gathering four houses inside of it - before her fingers compressed them. Her backside stretched over another set, flattening them. \"And knowing, knowing that they can't do anything about it! Demis, I'd LOVE to see your military try and challenge us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple-hair girl shook, almost deathly still. She took deep breaths with each pulse, her face getting redder with every one. \"Thousands... Thousands of people... N-national news... American military... I - I can't show my face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNindaline's hand brushed across her shoulders calmly, while the other pressed on her stomach, feeling the beating pulse and trembling skin grow calmer against her strength. \"Hey, don't worry. We're here for you.\" She felt the shoulder outgrow her hand, and her smile suddenly gained a slightly jealous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh - we're not growing at the same rate, are we?\" Hazuna asked, flopping over to Mii. The delightful caresses now became tenser - stronger, as if her stomach had to stretch out in order to accommodate the will of the unknown force making them grow. She bit a little with each tremble now, the rhythm maintained, but the individual spurts' power increasing exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired girl rolled around, in a mix of discomfort and playfulness. The body, still more squat, was larger than any of the others'. Her breasts and backside flattened new parts of the surrounding landscape with every twist. To civilians, it sounded like a series of progressively louder earthquakes, as the range of her rolling-pin maneuver grew and grew. \"Ahah, yeah. We figure it's something to do with your heart speed and sun exposure.\" She went back and forth quickly over one area three times, creating a rounded pair of canyons. \"But when it ended last time, everyone was aboooout the same size. Well, relatively-speaking, y'know. So don't worry! If it's like that, you'll be taller than me like usual again soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with her body used to the stinging, the white-clad young woman didn't feel as much hurt by the growth spurts as dizzied. Every beat, every breath changed her perspective. It grew harder to see where her friends were, and how they were taking it - though judging by Reni's expression earlier, and her excited gasps now, Hazuna wouldn't be surprised if she'd just dropped her bikini onto the ground and started stroking herself. Which wasn't something she exactly needed to see; so she just drank in the changes as best she could, watching the East China Sea grow closer, and the ground grow farther from her expanding eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last pulse outdid the rest of them, nearly doubling her size. Hazuna was the first to reach it; she screamed in a mixture of ecstasy, pain, confusion, and excitement. Mii joined in, followed by Nindaline's low tone, Demis' shriek, and Reni - who screamed in quick pulses that sounded like a Saturday morning anime villain's laugh. This deafening choir knocked windows out for many feet across, and a lingering trace of the sound could be heard all the way from South Korea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them couldn't do much but lie panting for a minute afterwards. When Mii popped up, she felt the ground give way under her sandals, sinking in a bit. \"Hee, I guess we can't vacation in Naha anymore - we've practically stomped it to paste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemis was next, shaking up, nearly unable to bear the weight of her own body. \"The cloud layer... It begins at our knees now. We've grown over ten times. We now stand about 4 miles high - or 6 kilometers in metric.\" Her careful, measured body language betrayed her fascinated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReni cooed, rubbing her cheeks in a wide smile. \"Yesss, talk numeric to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... The Sea of Japan would reach our chins at best. Our ankles reach the same height of the Tokyo Tower. My... My country's Statue of Liberty would look 1cm high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that... I love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them were now standing, regarding the Okinawan island spread out below them. Five girls across the horizon.</span></div></div>",
