He had heard what he presumed to be the last words of the man who worked the night shift before him, and it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the man was most likely crushed and rotting away in an animal suit in the backroom.  In Mike's defense, however, he <i>had</i> been the new guy, and rookies were always targets for immense pranking-- <i>\"Living without a frontal lobe?\"  \"Forcefully shoved into a suit?\"</i>  What the heck was someone supposed to make of that?  Surely it had to have been a joke--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course, it <i>wasn't</i> a joke, but it was a tad too late for Mike to make the decision to quit his job.  No, it seemed that the animatronics had decided that he had been performing so <i>wonderfully </i>in his position that they had just so happened to find him a new position higher-up in the corporate ladder-- they were giving him a <i>promotion</i> of sorts.  Instead of hiding \"behind the scenes,\" Mike was going to be taking center-stage with the animatronics themselves, and none of his protesting shrieks or sporadic kicking were going to tell them different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mike never thought his life would be snuffed out this way-- being stuffed into an archaic, dirty, <b>golden</b> bear that looked like it hadn't been touched in twenty years-- and not so soon either--  the only intimate contact he had ever had with someone was touching a bare boob, but that had been on accident during gym class his Freshman year of high school.  Again, though, the animatronics didn't seem to care much that Mike was never going to be able to make a woman happy, or to make a baby of his own, or to buy a house for that special someone and second generation-- there were a lot of things Mike was never going to experience and fulfill because he had been so stubbornly ignorant to the danger before him-- his own pride in landing his first, true job had blinded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With his bones crushed, many jutting from whatever flesh hadn't been torn apart by the mechanical devices within the golden bear suit that he had been stuffed within, Mike was beginning to acclimate to the pain.  It was shock, probably-- there was no doubt in his mind that he was on the verge of death.  He could feel his own blood dripping down his mangled body and onto the floor, and he could feel his fast-beating heart now slowly ease past a resting pace, to a more slow, worrisome beat.  His breathing was soft, and his lungs were reluctant to keep going with all the blood that was crowding up the small space inside of them.  Mike didn't feel panicked anymore, though.  Death was inevitable now; he was beyond help and he knew it, and no one cared or would come looking for him.  Instead, Mike felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And <b>ANGRY.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And...  sad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With his vision and life fading, Mike had the sinking feeling that his job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza wasn't just yet over.</div></span></span></div></div>",

As he got out of the car, he was instantly drenched in the rain water that was flooding from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly running to the front of the pizzeria, he looked up just as lightning flashed, illuminating the sign, making the entire pizzeria look demonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last sigh, Mike entered the pizzeria to start his 5th week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>____Line_Break____</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>3 hours later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike glanced at the battery to see that he had 57% left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit, he said to himself, \"I've had less battery than this before, and I'm still alive. Better check up on Foxy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the tablet, he looked at the camera in Pirate's Cove, only to see a sign with two words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>IT'S ME</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's eyes widened as he heard clanging coming from down the hall, \"Fuck me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike lept to the door, intent on shutting it before the homicidal robot got in, only to see the fox just as his hand was reaching for the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mike missed the button entirely, and hit Foxy's head instead, just as lightning struck the pizzeria. The lightning caused a brown out that lasted for a moment, making the lights in Mike's office (and that damned fan that uses power even when you're just sitting there) to turn off for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they turned back on, Mike blinked once as he realized that he was in quite a different position than the one he was in a few seconds ago. For starters, he was looking <b>into</b> the office, rather than out of it, and instead of seeing a worn-down animatronic pirate fox, he saw...himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his other senses kicked in, and he realized that he could feel things that he definitely didn't feel before: like his legs. His legs felt worn out, yet strong and powerful. His chest felt...strange. Like there was something missing, and speaking of missing, he couldn't feel one of his hands. But the strangest things were definitely the fact that his face felt different, and he could see much more clearly now than a few minutes ago. (Does Foxy have a tail? I don't think so.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up in shock at seeing his doppelg\u00e4nger, Mike looked in the one-way glass to see his reflection. Standing there, staring back at him was the reflection of Foxy the pirate fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike screamed, the same scream the animatronics use when they tried to get him in the past.</span></div></div>",

As he got out of the car, he was instantly drenched in the rain water that was flooding from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly running to the front of the pizzeria, he looked up just as lightning flashed, illuminating the sign, making the entire pizzeria look demonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last sigh, Mike entered the pizzeria to start his 5th week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____Line_Break____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike glanced at the battery to see that he had 57% left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit, he said to himself, \"I've had less battery than this before, and I'm still alive. Better check up on Foxy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the tablet, he looked at the camera in Pirate's Cove, only to see a sign with two words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT'S ME<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's eyes widened as he heard clanging coming from down the hall, \"Fuck me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike lept to the door, intent on shutting it before the homicidal robot got in, only to see the fox just as his hand was reaching for the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mike missed the button entirely, and hit Foxy's head instead, just as lightning struck the pizzeria. The lightning caused a brown out that lasted for a moment, making the lights in Mike's office (and that damned fan that uses power even when you're just sitting there) to turn off for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they turned back on, Mike blinked once as he realized that he was in quite a different position than the one he was in a few seconds ago. For starters, he was looking into the office, rather than out of it, and instead of seeing a worn-down animatronic pirate fox, he saw...himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his other senses kicked in, and he realized that he could feel things that he definitely didn't feel before: like his legs. His legs felt worn out, yet strong and powerful. His chest felt...strange. Like there was something missing, plus he also felt like something else was gone, but he couldn't quite place his finger on it at the moment, and speaking of fingers, he could only feel one hand. But the strangest things were definitely the fact that his face felt different, and he could see much more clearly now than a few minutes ago. (Does Foxy have a tail? I don't think so.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up in shock at seeing his doppelg\u00e4nger, Mike looked in the one-way glass to see his reflection. Standing there, staring back at him was the reflection of Foxy the pirate fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike screamed, the same scream the animatronics use when they tried to get him in the past.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This will help your job as it prevents the servos from getting locked up. You're welcome. Since time is money, and we would like to avoid paying you overtime, I feel I should offer you an experimental machine. This machine will allow you to control an animatronic of your choosing, thus allowing you to reset the power from the safety of your room. Don't worry, this machine doesn't need the generators either, and we won't dock it out of your pay if you test it. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs took a deep breathe, before getting the machine out, and looking at the selection of choices. Eggs muttered to himself, \"That bear is always there, he should work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Eggs hit the button, and the next thing he knew, he could see the generators. Eggs gave a little cheer, before freezing when he heard, \"See something, BonBon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs slowly turned around to see a large Freddy head right in front of him.</span></div></div>",
