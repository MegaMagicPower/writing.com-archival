He rolled over be surprised by the back of another person, one that didn't have any clothing on. Almost like on cue the person woke up because of the bed shaking and rolled over. Her breasts flopped over and she had little prickles where her ginger pubic hairs were coming in a five o'clock shadow on her bare vagina. \"Mary Jane! Why are you naked in my bed?\" Peter whispered. MJ just yawned and said, \"Your aunt is out for the week remember, she won't hear us.\" \"Why are you naked in my bed?\" MJ started looking both worried and a little angry, \"Peter do you not remember the wild night we had last night?\" Peter, \"The last thing I remember was the field trip to the MIT lab.\" MJ, \"That was a week ago Peter!\" Peter looked at MJ and she started to get shaky and cried out, \"I swear Peter we fucked consensually!\" Peter, \"I'm sure but I cannot remember the past week?\" He looked at the clock, \"Where did the week go?\" He thought back and a week rushed over him. He feel back in a seizure and MJ rolled him over and decided to call 911, she needed to save Peter plus either way, if she ran and let him die or called the paramedics she'd get caught anyways. Peter awoke to a still naked Mary Jane and a group of paramedics asking him if he was okay. Unfortuatly one of them was a friend of both Aunt may and MJ's parents. MJ got a call and she slunk back home to be yelled at by her folks. Aunt may called and Peter thought he was fucked, again, but in a different way, \"Hey May\", this is the younger Homecoming style Aunt May. \"Peter what's this you had MJ over and fucked her?\" Peter was raised a good Catholic boy and so he knew his parents wanted him to wait until marriage, \"Yeah May.\" May, \"Was it good?\" \"Uh, yes.\" \"Good cause you're grounded and I forbid you to have, uh, any fun until I decide you've learned your lesson.\" \"Yeah, that's fair.\" \"And p.s., Niiiiice. MJ is cute.\" \"May!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 days later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay came home and by this time MJ's parents wanted to have a good talking to with Peter and May. They did and it seems MJ was pregnant. May literally started slapping Peter, \"Not only did you have sex with a girl but you forgot protection, the hell is wrong with you Pete. You're going to find a way to care for this child, while you both are still in school. Understand?\" Pete, \"Yeah May.\" May, \"I can't believe my nephew beat me to the kid game.\" Peter had multiple memory lapses over the next few months and each time he remembered a little more from that week. He was bitten by a spider, he became brash and cocky, which led to the MJ incident and that is all. He made an appointment with the lead doctor, Dr. Connors and he told Pete that the spider was a first step in manufacturing a strong material to replace ropes. However, he wasn't sure what would happen with a human bitten by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out the door a mysterious woman came up to him and told him she could teach him how to use his abilities. He refused and she handed him a paper and said, \"These are your powers.\" He went to throw it away and the paper stuck, as he was trying to dislodge the paper he punched through a was and realized the bricks were stuck too, as one fell he felt a tingle in that direction and reacted so quickly the brick seemed to fall in slow motion. Finally he went back to the woman and she trained him. There was another complication.</span></div></div>",

So focused on this, his hold on the ledge gave as he began to fall towards the ground, barely able to keep one hand on the wall to slow his fall until he could re-secure his grip as the pain faded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026what was that?\u201d  He groaned out, it being a very new sensation to him.  \u201cFelt like a massage of my innards, by Wolverine.\u201d  He added as he made for the rooftop where he would have a much safer place to think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a minute passed before he decided that it was completely unnatural, and it would help if he were to seek help, and for that he knew who the first port of call would be.  Sending out a web line, he allowed the Force of Gravity to power him down then along as he swung his way over to the Empire State University.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Connors is one of the top experts in Biology and Genetics,</i>\u2019  Spider-Man thought to himself as he made it to the ESU Rooftop, working his way down to Connors\u2019 Office/Lab.  \u2018<i>So if there\u2019s anyone here who can figure it out if there\u2018s something wrong with me, it\u2019s him.</i>\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the correct window, he was in luck, seeing Dr Connors leaning into a microscope and taking down a note with his one remaining hand.  Or at least he was until he heard the rapping at the window.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d  He queried as he opened the window to let him in.  \u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d  Spider-Man started before a fresh surge of pain shot through him, though thankfully not as severe as the first one which let him stay on his feet.  \u201cSomething\u2019s up with me, I need you to take a look and see what it is.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably seeing him buckle over and clutch his sides that convinced Connors that something wasn\u2019t right with him, since he agreed.  \u201cAlright then, I do owe you after all.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd did he, for similar to Spider-Man he had a \u201ccondition\u201d of his own.  Though where in his case it was accidental, for Connors, it had been intentional, with unintended consequences.  The result of an attempt to re-grow his right arm by mixing Lizard DNA with his own, resulting in his becoming the Reptilian Menace dubbed The Lizard.  Spider-Man had been instrumental in reversing the effects for him, allowing him his life back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a sample of his blood, Dr Connors set to work analysing the sample while Spider-Man waited on the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the word Doc?\u201d  He asked having waited long enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d  Connors murmured to himself before facing Spider-Man.  \u201cYou weren\u2019t born with your powers, weren\u2019t you?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.  Yeah.\u201d  He replied.  \u2018<i>I\u2019d best not let him know too much though, or he might work out who I am.</i>\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, however you got your powers.  It appears to have stabilised at its current point, but that is changing.\u201d  Connors delivered the news.  \u201cIt appears another mutation is now occurring within you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother?  Into what!?\u201d  Spider-Man didn\u2019t take the news very well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d  Dr Connors admitted.  \u201cBut it may not be what you\u2019d consider to be\u2026\u2026human.\u201d  \u2018<i>In fact, it could be very alike what I went through.</i>\u2019  He added in his mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well is there anything you can do?\"  Spider-Man asked him with a growing sense of dread.  </div></span></div></div>",

It.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix arms whose hands held three clawed digits sharpened to a point and as many red eyes atop a lengthened head complete with mandibles on its upper jaw.  Coated in purple-grey hair that travelled down to his twin-clawed feet hidden inside a pair of black shoes tailored to a perfect fit, steel-capped to protect them from said claws.  The navy-blue jacket and trousers, along with the black sweater and socks - all equally tailored to fit his frame - completing the attire.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d  His voice seeming to reverberate slightly in his throat as he viewed the details for himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reality for the past twelve years now, ever since he\u2019d been bitten by a radioactive spider that, somehow, had managed to transfer some of its genetic coding to him, turning him into this, thing.  Only then, had he learned just how cruel the world could be, how sick some people could truly be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to flee, he\u2019d spent time either in hiding, or persecution just for being what he was, igniting a dark fire within him that even now, had failed to extinguish.  Some small time thievery - with the odd bigger one - had permitted him just enough funding to serve as collateral as he began the process of striking back, setting up his company and building it up any way he could.  So long as he kept up with the taxes, kept his more unsavoury acts hidden, and held the right people in line, the authorities tended to look the other way.  All of which served to make Parker Enterprises in seven short years, the single largest Biological/Genetic Research and Development Corporation in the US.  Such a position gifting him with significant clout with which to maintain good ties with the right sorts, and indulge in a few \u2018pursuits\u2019 he\u2019d come to enjoy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with some particularly \"gifted\" personnel to keep it that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me.  Does my appearance, offend you?\u201d  He asked rhetorically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no.\u201d  Ms Cooperton knew better than to say yes if the supposed rumours concerning her predecessors were anything to go by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.  You may return to your desk.\u201d  He dismissed her with a wave of a hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Cooperton wasn\u2019t a particularly bad secretary, in fact she performed her duties rather well was what he thought as he sat back down and scanned the paperwork that needed his attention.  But she was prone to become rather nervous around him, especially when he was rather less-well dressed, he could still remember clearly the look on her face when she saw him standing on the ceiling completely stripped down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an uncommon event in his offices given some of those under his employ - those such as Dr Stegron for example - but there were always those who took offence to this\u2026leeway.  Not that they lasted long in his workforce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strayed thoughts in turn led him to himself, pondering whether or not he wanted to ditch his suit.  </div></span></div></div>",

Most of them were routine and straightforward, the current cash flow, employee timekeeping, new hires and fires, one interesting piece on Parker Enterprises efforts to expand into the Southern Americas.

Emerald-green (top of head, arms legs, back, and tail) and lime-green (front of face and neck, abs, inner thighs and underside of tail) scales save for the dark leaf-green that marked the areola on her mid-C Cup breasts.  Boots that reached her knees, a wrist device, and an ID Tag/Swipecard that hung around her neck all she had on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wished to see me Mr Parker?\u201d  She rasped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Take a seat please.\u201d  She complied as she took the offered seat, her tail sliding through the provided gap with ease.  \u201cI have a particular task I need you to do, and it must remain off-record.  Is that understood?\u201d  He stated bluntly, his red eyes piercing into her own yellow ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.  What is the task?\u201d  She went straight to the point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this.\u201d  He offered the report to her.  \u201cSomeone, has been siphoning funds from, \u2018certain\u2019 Parker Enterprises Accounts.  And what I want is for you to take Dr Stegron, trace the source and, rectify it.\u201d  They both knew full well what he meant by \u2018rectifying\u2019 the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see that it\u2019s done.

Years of research finally saw him ready to test it, and seeing no better candidate than one who\u2019d already lost a limb, used himself as the first test subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not without cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as restoring his lost limb, it had continued to mutate him until he had become a mix between human and lizard. Unable to face his wife, Martha, he had fled into the sewers where he could hide himself away from the world, until he could find a means of reversing what he had done to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a corner of them, he had made himself a small makeshift lab where he could conduct his work without fear of exposure. A small mat lay in a nearby corner for when he needed to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d spent the last several weeks gathering first the materials and equipment needed to construct his new lab, then what he needed for his plans to work. It had been difficult for him, but with some good timing, maintenance of a watchful eye, and a little bit of luck, he had gathered most of what he had needed without detection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that had been easy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a short break, he looked at himself. When he had fled his home, and wife, his clothes had still been in a relatively decent condition, minus the footwear which had been torn off by his far larger feet and tears by the knees of his deep-purple pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the harsh living conditions and work had taken a toll on his attire, the entire right sleeve of his black sweater lost during a heavy fall when the waste in the dump slid on top of him as he\u2019d been gathering supplies, leaving his right pectoral and shoulder blade bare as well, with one other tear down the left bicep to enable green scales to peek out through the dirty fabric.

Predominantly dark olive green scales but light white-green for her palms, soles, and from the breasts down her abs to a short way down the underside of her tail.  Spines run from the top of her head to the back of her neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)  <b>Kregg</b> - Male Crocodilian Humanoid, 282cm (about 9ft3) with a thick heavy build.  A very dark green with paler underside, and a double ridge running from the top of his head to the base of his tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)  <b>Lunette</b> - Female Whiptail Lizard-Woman, smallest of this group at 178cm (about 5ft10) and the least muscled body.

Twenty-four and a half feet in length, eight wide, 12,000lb load limit.  It was far from a bad choice, if a little cosy considering their\u2026dimensions, and still needing to modify the three seats in it given their tails.  Double bed and bathroom at the back, wardrobe kitchen and door in the middle, and couch and armchair behind the cab.  All things considered though, it did fulfil their needs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could wait then,\u201d  Lunette began again.  \u201cI just, I just wish I could ditch these things already.\u201d  She pointed to the clothes she wore, blouse and skirt being what could be seen at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that.\u201d  Gecko took his turn to enter the conversation.  \u201cBut until we\u2019re safely off the roads we do need to keep ourselves covered, as per the conditions set us when we were granted the right to live on the Surface.\u201d  His wear at the moment was a pair of dark jeans and black oval-neck sweater, though like Lunette, he was currently barefoot as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I get what you mean.  I too, would love to be able to pull everything off and let the sun hit nothing but my scales, and go around just the way nature intended, but until we\u2019re there, and safely out of sight, that will have to wait.\u201d  Gila was the only one still to have footwear on, a simple set of low-heeled slip-ons, a dark purple jacket and trousers with a thin black v-neck sweater to finish off her visible attire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so.  I guess I just can\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d  Lunette started to rest her head on her arms before perking up, an idea coming to her.  \u201cSay?  The last part is dirt track, no-one to see us.  So what if we, ditch this stuff then?\u201d  Her suggesting caught the attention of her companions, as they looked to each other for a brief moment, considering her proposal before coming up with their answer.  </div></span></div></div>",

We set up camp, think I might ditch the rest either when we get there, or after setting up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to think of it.\u201d  Gecko cut in.  \u201cWhat about our, old ones?  The old ones we had?\u201d  He referred to their old clothes, the torn-up rags they\u2019d scavenged before they came to live on the surface and were able to purchase proper good ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought them with us.\u201d  Gila replied.  \u201cSo if we ever feel like it\u2026\u201d  There was no need for her to finish it, they all knew what she meant by it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was closing in on them now as they carefully navigated their way through the narrowing track, but this meant they were getting closer to their destination, where they could have ten days to themselves, to simply be themselves.  </div></span></div></div>",

Tonight was later than usual. She began fearing the worst and went out to search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search started at the bar. The bar tender told her that that Harold, Cindy's husband, was last seen by him heading out the door with the group he came in with. He was the only one without a girl around his arms. Cindy sighed in relief and told the tender, \"I'm his wife so if he had a floozy around his arm it'll be hell for him.\" He laughed and said, \"Oh Cindy I know all about you. He makes sure no girl in this bar thinks he's single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swinging around until dawn she finally came home. Harold wasn't there. It was around noon when the door unlocked and a very hungover Harold came in, \"Hey babe sorry about last night, I got way too drunk and crashed at Mark's. Did I ever text you? Never-mind your demeanor says differently.\" Cindy, \"I worried. I didn't sleep. In fact I spent half the night walking the city trying to find you.\" Harold, \"What! You shouldn't have. A lone woman at night, I had a group you were alone.\" Cindy, \"I can handle myself. Call it Ezekiel's training.\" Harold, \"Even though you can fight off attackers doesn't mean you won't get attacked.\" Cindy, \"Then come home when around when you say you will, or at least text me. You know what I'm heading out, I need to clear my head.\" Harold, \"Cindy.\" She slammed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned Harold was out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back into the bar he frequents and saw him, \"Drinking again.\" He looked at her and said, \"It's just how I cope.\" She sat next to him and said, \"That's dangerous. I'm your wife, I should be how you cope. The alcohol should just be a side effect to the fun, not something you lean on.\" He looked at her, smiled, turned to the bar tender and said, \"Can I get my tab.\" He finished his drink, paid, and took Cindy out to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week later Harold's friends asked him out again. He came back at dawn drunk as a sailor. She was unhappy about that, and even more so that he was sloppily trying to get some. He wouldn't stop and Cindy decided to reveal to him her powers, and use it to teach him the brevity of her anger. He was already naked when he started trying to coax her into sex. He backed him up against the wall and he relaxed to the point of sleeping. She webbed his wrists and connected them to the roof. Then she webbed his ankles and connected them to the floor. She then webbed his closed mouth so he didn't pique the neighbor's worries. She slid his credit card out of it's wallet and thought, \"What's his is mine, and mine is his. No harm in him gifting me a shopping spree in apology for his drinking problem. A few hours later he awoke he noticed the soreness in his arms and legs and realized he was naked, his mind told him he was standing but he feet told him he was not on the floor. That is when he noticed past his penis was webbing. He saw it and that he was off the ground, he looked up, webs holding his arms to the roof. He thought he was home and called out Cindy, \"Gnndn!\" That is when he figured his mouth had webs on it too. He was confused and began worrying about last night. 'I didn't pick up any girls or guys for that matter. I don't think I was followed home, I don't feel like I've been violated. I'm definitely home.' That is when Cindy walked out of the bedroom, naked. Harold, \"Gnndn! Thhng Ghd nhh'rm hp, Hm'm wmbbmd hp hvmr hmrm. Hmlp mm! Gnndn! Hm gnhw nhh ghn hmrm mm! Gnndn! Gnndn plmhfm.\" Cindy, \"(Sigh) I hear you, but I don't want to hear it. You've been out all night last night, and at dawn. DAWN! You came in and expected sex. I've decided that you decided that in apology for staying out all night, every weekend, for a month, that you are allowing me to have a day out with your credit card.\" Harold, \"Hm'vm dmgndmd nh fhgh thnng! Whh dh nhh gnhw thht ghn wmb lngm thnf?\" Cindy, \"Ugh, you so loud I'm trying to eat. I'll be back before those webs degrade and then, oh, your really going to hear my mind. That is unless you shut up and let me have my day.\" Harold hung there watching Cindy eat breakfast, then get dressed and began walking out. As she walked up to him, kissed him, and said, \"Close your eyes, I have a surprise for you. She saw he got hard and closed his eyes, she said, \"Not that kind of surprise. Your still in trouble.\" He opened his eyes and saw he dressed as silk. \"I'm a spider-based super hero.\" He got wide eyed and she just said, \"Close your eyes again.\" He did and she webbed his eyes and said, \"I'll be back in a few hours.\" She returned</span></div></div>",

They slowly snapped so that by the time they all broke his fall was not as bad as he feared. He laid there still stuck to the floor for about a minute until those webs started to snap. He got up and, covering his manhood started pulling on the other webs to no avail. He just stumbled to the bedroom hoping the clothes he found weren't too stupid looking. By the time he dressed the mouth webs fell off and degraded, \"What the fuck Cindy. Why can't I get the webs off?\" Silk, \"You're too weak, the spider themed powers involves super strength, Gwen Stacy, the woman I brought home\" Gwen, \"hi, spider-Gwen.\" \"Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and myself are the only people I know that could help you. Well that and waiting like a good boy. My webs degrade in about 12-18 hours so you've got another 4-10 hours left until you can see.

Harold, \"Why are you treating me like this, all I did was get a little too drunk your treating me like shit, in fact your abusing me and your powers.\" Silk, \"(sigh)\" she rips off the webs and said, \"You're right. I'm sorry, it just this is kinda how helpless I felt during your drunken escapades. I might be a superhero but I'm still a woman. I fear for you when I don't know where you've gone. In fact almost every weekend I've searched the city for you, in costume, raising my chances of getting attacked. However, I have danger sense, I can move so fast that time seems to slow, I move in ways that no normal woman can, I can punch people through walls, you cannot.\" Harold promised to reduce the number of drinks and text if he's late or changing venues. Silk also showed him a device created by the great og spider Peter Parker called a spider tracer, \"and if I can't trust you you'll find one of these somewhere on you so that I can follow your every move.\" Harold understood and actually never had a problem ever again.</span></div></div>",

Dad had taken Peter to the library, nerd, and she had tricked Mom into taking her to her friends, the two of you walked to the party, for a sleepover. May was in her underwear looking down at the sexy hunk she had gone upstairs with in his boxers. Her phone buzzed, she ignored it. It buzzed again, she sighed and despite Juan saying, \"See what's the matter I'll wait.\" she ignored the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half an hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police had silently surrounded the party and busted everyone. May was booked and sat there waiting for her parents. An hour passed before the police came to pick her up, but instead of taking her out they took her into an office. The officer sitting on the other side of the desk stood up, \"Miss Parker?\" She confirmed and the officer told her to take a seat. The officer sat down and told her that about three hours ago her father Ben was murdered while waiting for her cousin. Upon going to pick her up her mother May was in a car accident and didn't make it. Her and her cousin were now orphaned. Her phone was returned to her and she looked at the messages, the first one, Mom, \"Hey May something happened, I'm coming over to Becca's to pick you up, I'll explain in the car.\" The second message, Peter, \"May! Where r u? Uncle Ben's been shot and I haven't heard from Aunt May since she went to pick you up. I'm scared she might have gotten hurt. Text me back!\" May was crying as she asked, \"Where's Pete? Does he know about Mom?\" The officer told her that her cousin was being interviewed in the department and an officer took her to him. They both sat there crying, holding and supporting each other. They had to sell most of their stuff and move into an orphanage, at least until May, Who was 3 years older than Peter, turned 18, May is 16 and Peter is 13. Close to Pete's 14 birthday is when he gained his powers and by this time May had become a problem child, she ran off, she partied and drank and had sex. One night though she didn't come home, the police found her in an alley near death. In the ER they told Peter that the only way he could save her was through blood transfusion. He didn't know about the powers and gave it willingly. The loss of blood though caused his body, which was now changing, to faint. He awoke next to his cousin, who blamed herself for Peter being hospitalized. Weeks later he learned the full extent of his powers and began watching May to see if his blood caused similar mutations, it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon turning 18 the now clean May took up the responsibility of being her 16 year old cousin's guardian. They were a crime fighting team and through both of their jobs could afford a small apartment in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story continues with</span></div></div>",

Spiderman had been flirting with her the past few months, but had broken things off recently after half mentioning something about a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a jerk.\" Felicia sighed. She wished some trouble would come up just to distract her but the night was unusually calm. After hours of watching and waiting, Felicia was ready to call it a night. Unbeknownst to her the venom symbiote, freshly ripped from Peter's skin, had crawled its way up to her. Seeing a potential host just as powerful as its last the symbiote, struck forward like a snake, and engulfed her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell!\" Felicia gasped at the sight of the black liquid squirming up her leg. She tried to shake it off but her foot wouldn't budge from the ground. A tendril launched off the main mass and clung to her other leg sealing her in place.  Felicia grunted as she tried to break free. She could feel her clothing torn and ripped apart underneath the alien goo and the warm tight feeling of the symbiote taking its place.  The symbiote was slowly climbing up her thighs, below it her legs now tightly clad in the shiny, ebony, alien skin. her feet clawed. She tried to pull it off her legs but it felt like she was ripping her own skin.  When she pulled her hands away the symbiote had globed on them and began to transform her hands and push up her arms. The warm embrace of the symbiote now reached her past her waist and she arced her back and moaned at the odd but pleasurable sensation. Now up to her neck, she felt power flowing through her,she felt stronger, faster, just all around better than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Felicia said looking at her now clawed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just bond with us and it's all your.\" The symbiote whispered in to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bond?\" Felicia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us become one and all your desires will be yours.\" It responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbiote now enveloped her head, she could hear the voice more clearly. Its seductive whispers became harder and harder to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
