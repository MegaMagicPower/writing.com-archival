            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were at the arcade, playing some random arcade game, just trying to beat the high score of the last guy who played it. After a few hours, some game tokens and a short bathroom break later you had almost gotten to the high score when suddenly you noticed something, out of the corner of your eye you saw someone, someone dancing. You tried to ignore it but for some reason your eye kept being drawn to the person dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Boom!* <i>Game Over! You lose!</i>\" the game laughed mechanically as you took your eyes of the screen one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darn it\" you groan. You were about to put another token into the machine but figured to heck with the game! You turn towards the dance machines and walk towards it to find a rather beautiful girl play not to mention out classing her opponent on the machine. She seemed rather skilled and in fact looked like a goddess as she trashed the foolish mortal's beside her. Scoring exceedingly high numbers of points then her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" you gasp surprised as the goddess continues to dance on the machine like a trained professional dancer. a few minutes go by but it felt more like hours as the world around you turned dark besides you and the dancer. You watch as the goddess' moves slow down as if someone hit the play button on the remote and made everything go all slow mo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however the goddess stopped moving all together and the world resumes it's normal flow. You watch as the crowd around the machine disbands and the goddess dismounts the dance machine. You try to approach the girl but a weird guy with bright yellow not to mention spiky hair cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job Tea. You sure showed that bully not to mess with...\" you stopped listening after that as you walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So her name's Tea? Maybe next time I can talk to her?\" you shrug and walk off, heading home where you quickly turn in for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day you head straight to the arcade just like yesterday but find that that Tea girl isn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw looks like she isn't here. Oh well might as well try to kill some time while I'm here\" you thought to yourself as you look around at the small assortment of arcade games before you. You shrug and walk towards one of those basket ball games by the back of the arcade and begin to shoot some hoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours go by and you eventually had played every single game in the arcade, well except for the dance machine the tea girl was using yesterday. you never were a good dancer but hey when in Rome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the dance machine and it suddenly flickers to life, startling you for a second. You quickly dart your head around and thankfully nobody noticed your little incident as you quickly climb back onto the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Select a song!</i>\" the machine chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and quickly did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Select your difficulty!</i>\" the machine chimed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to select sweet(easy) mode and suddenly arrows begin to appear on the screen. You quickly begin to dance along with the machine and to your surprise, you danced rather well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor the next few minutes you dance on the machine, pulling a few free style moves out of your hat as you went on before suddenly the song came to an end and thus forced you to stop dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and put another token into the machine and continue to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever after another hour your body was too exhausted and you were forced to get off the machine. You decide to head home after catching, figuring that the Tea girl wouldn't be showing up anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home you eat some lunch and head to bed early. That night you dreamed of dancing with the girl named Tea. It felt rather real, perhaps you were having a lucid dream? It didn't matter because soon you woke up and the dream was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours go by before you decide to try the arcade again. How before you go you notice that it was a Saturday on the calendar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm maybe she wasn't there yesterday because she had school? I was there until about 4pm so she might've come later then that?' you thought to yourself before heading to the arcade, hoping that you'd finally be able to see the Tea girl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the arcade and instantly you find the place swarmed with people, it was a Saturday after all. You try and make your way to the dance machines and thankfully you find that only one person was on it, the Tea girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she dances for a little bit but after a little bit of watching you just couldn't help yourself and quickly run to the other machine besides her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you wanna dance to?\" she asked you. You nod and she smiles \"Alright let's see what you can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and get ready as Tea selects a new song. You get ready and as soon as the song starts you begin to dance...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hell's Bells! HELL'S BELLS!! This had to be an extremely rare event that had just occurred at this moment in front of dozens of spectators. When the song 'Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy' ended, you and Tea practically dropped your jaws in disbelief. Not only did you both get 'AAA' rankings, you both had the exact same score at the end of the game! You: 33867543 points. Tea: 33867543 points! Down to the final digit, the both of you tied EXACTLY! An exact stalemate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" your opponent gasped impressed, \"I dont believe it! We actually tied right on the dot!\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" you gasped yourself, \"that's gotta be like... next-to-impossible odds, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you didnt beat her, but you did achieve the next best thing! Accomplish a damn near impossible feat with her! The crowd cheered the two of you as you both stepped off the platforms. The adrenaline took it's time to pump out of your system. Mentally, you felt like you could dance all through the night, but physically you didnt wanna overdo it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done, rookie!\" Tea smiled your way and called you a rookie, \"it's not everyday I find someone that can actually keep up with me!\"<br>\r\n\"Th...thanks!\" despite being called a rookie, her compliment really got to you, \"that... that actually means a lot coming from you!\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, dancing's just been a dream of mine,\" she stated, \"I guess we both share the same dream, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, actually I kinda want to be a cop,\" you admit, \"but dancing's a great demanding workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That was awesome, Tea!\" and just when things were about to get interesting, a familiar voice from an all too familiar yellow spikey haired midget goes and spoils it all, \"an actual exact-score tie in DDR! That's uh... that's special, right?\" As much as you hated someone coming between you and a potential crush, you kept your cool and remained calm... though you HOPED deep down that little guy with a pyramid necklace wasnt her boyfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Perfect timing!\" Tea announced, \"I was just about to start the introduction! I'm Tea! And this guy's Yugi, a close friend of mine from school!\" 'Close' friend, eh?<br>\r\nYou kept your cool face on as little Yugi smiled up and offered his hand, \"Hi! It's nice to meet you! Uh... what's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"My name's [****]!\" you shake his hand... hm, little guy's got a firm grip! \"and the pleasure's all mine!\"<br>\r\n\"Great job making a tie with Tea!\" he was quick to compliment you, \"That's really something! I NEVER saw her lose in this game!\"<br>\r\n\"Th...thanks!\" man, that bright warm smile on this guy's face could melt ice cream! No wonder Tea's hanging out with this shrimp! He's got such an uppity aura about him that makes you all warm and fuzzy deep down! There's probably a story about this guy, but youre more focused on Tea to care about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joking aside, Yugi here's a REAL champion!\" Tea spoke up before you ended up lost in the twinkle of Yugi's sparkling purpling eyes, \"he's the winner of Duelist Kingdom and currently the reigning King of Games in Duel Monsters.\"<br>\r\n\"That's great, Yugi!\" you were good at pretending to be more interested than you already are, \"how does it feel to have such a title?\"<br>\r\n\"It's... it's an experience,\" he stated with quite a bit of emotion in his voice, \"I feel like I got the weight of the world on my shoulders... though technically, I do. And I didnt get this far on my own. I had a lot of support from those around me. A LOT of support.\" Dont stare into his eyes! Dont stare into his eyes!<br>\r\n\"Aw, dont be modest, Yugi!\" Tea cheered him on, \"you earned it. You should be proud. We all are. Which reminds me, we still gotta make up all that homework we left behind going to that island.\" Yugi sighed as Tea turned her head to you, \"Sorry we gotta cut this conversation short.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"I understand. You wouldnt wanna let failing grades get in the way of your dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea smiled, \"I still demand a rematch, though. You got time tomorrow afternoon for a tie-breaker?\" DO YOU?! Sure, you got an exam in world civilization on monday, but youre sure that's not as important as THIS!<br>\r\n\"You can bet on it!\" you immediately answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, play time is over,\" Yugi's voice suddenly got incredibly deep and manly and his aura was even stronger and more empowering than ever! Your eyes widened in shock as you notice him now suddenly a foot and a half taller and a couple years more mature! \"we promised Joey we'd help him with his Geometry lessons, remember?\" Your jaw literally dropped as you gazed in dumbstuck at the new Yugi! He just magically passed puberty in the blink of an eye!<br>\r\n\"D-D-DID YOU JUST-\"<br>\r\nTea didnt seem the least bit surprised, \"Alright, Yugi alright. I know how gets when we're late.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let's go!\" he grabbed her hand and started to drag him off with her. All the while you were STILL speechless from the Magic Growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow, [****]!\" Tea shouted at you.<br>\r\n\"S....see ya!\" you shouted back, still keeping that dumbstruck look on your face. You spent a little too long trying to wrap your head around what you witnessed. Finally, you gave up and shook your head, \"Eh, forget it. It's none of my business!\" The important thing is you got yourself a rematch with Tea tomorrow. Another potential chance to get closer to this dancing queen.<br>\r\nYou've already done what you came here to do and since the adrenaline's wearing off, you should probably start heading back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph!\" but just when you turned around, you accidentally bumped into someone. A rather tall someone. A rather tall dark-skinned someone in a white robe and white turban wielding a golden ankh-shaped key around his neck!<br>\r\nHis soulless blue eyes gazed down at you with a distant stare... like he's in a daze or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... s...sorry,\" you apologized before walking around him. You could feel the man still staring back at you as you walked away, but you ignored it. You focused on getting home and thinking about how youre gonna hit it off with Tea at the rematch!</span></div></div>",

For the last 8 years, I've been kicked around, beaten up to the brink of death, and being talked garbage at. Everywhere I go, I hear people saying that I'm some low life disease that they wished to just die away. Even though I have Zeo and Leo, I can still feel the scars in my heart from the pain they caused to me. It wasn't enough to fill the gigantic hole in my heart. Even my own parents couldn't help me. So, I wished that one day that a girl would just come to me and just be with me because I want to make her happy. But, everytime I tried to, they reject me and say that I don't deserve anyone because I'm just some dork and some punk. After meeting you, I though that things would finally change now.

Well, then do me a favor and stay out of my face.\" You said before going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo-.\" Alexis said but then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT!!!!\" You screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was frightened by the volume of your voice and you go to your dorm. Jasmine and Mindy were just standing there as they see Alexis starting to cry as guilt for what she did to you came over her. You stormed back to your dorm and slammed the door so hard that it left some cracks on the wall. Zeo and Leo heard it and they run to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo? What's wrong, Bro?\" Zeo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I'm fine.\" You said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem fine.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM!!

Who would've though you'd come to me yourself.\" Neo said not surprised to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hurt that Obelisk guy and now him? This isn't like you, man. You wouldn't hurt anyone that's innocent.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Innocent? Well, 'innocent' people like them has caused nothing but pain and misery to me. Now, the time for Karma has come.\" Neo said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! I understand that you're hurting inside and it sucks. But, doing something like this will only make you feel worse. Please, let's go back to Zeo and we can sort this out.\" Leo said trying to reason with Neo. But, it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not gonna stop until everyone feels my pain. But, if you want to stop me, then let's see if you have what it takes.\" Neo challenged as he activated his duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was suspecting that this would happen. Alright, Neo! I accept your challenge.\" Leo declared as he activated his duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis hides in the shadows as she watches the brothers battle to the death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's duel!\" The brothers declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo: 8000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: 8000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first. I summon Mountain Sage, Regia in attack mode.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegia: 1600 ATK 1300 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll placed 2 card face down and end my turn.\" Leo said as he set the cards down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn now. Draw! I summon Destructive Spellmaster, Brioni in attack mode.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrioni: 1500 ATK 800 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll activate the spell card called Cursed Heart. This card gives my Dark Spellcaster monster an addition 600 attack points until the end of the turn.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrioni: 2100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now attack his Regia with Devilish Chant!\" Neo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark Spellcaster chanted a spell and Regia disappeared in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: 7500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then with her effect, since she destroyed a monster in battle, I can special summon one dark Spellcaster monster from my desk except herself in defense mode. I choose Illusion Apprentice.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllusion Apprentice: 1700 ATK 1500 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll play one card face down and end my turn.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! During your end phase, I'll activate the trap Ancient Earth Flute. This will change your tune because now I can special summon one Earth monster from my deck as long as it's got 2000 ATK points or less since one of my Earth monster's destroyed by battle this turn. Come on out Trimaran, Hero of the Lands!\" Leo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimaran: 2000 ATK 1600 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Make your move.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis watched and she has never seen cards like what Neo has. He must've changed his deck. Whatever the case, she hoped that Leo brings back the old Neo.

I'm just worried about these two.\" Alexis said looking at at Leo and Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Alexis. Neo will be back to his old loving self before you know it.\" Mindy said to cheer up Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! How do you know what's going on?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeo told us.\" Syrus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he okay?\" Alexis asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! He's getting care at the medical room.\" Jasmine answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness.\" Alexis sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the duel just started, though.\" Chumley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did and I'm hoping Leo will win for Neo's sake.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the duel, it was now Leo's turn. He draws his card to begin his 2nd turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I use Trimaran's effect. Once per turn, I can special summon a Earth monster from my deck as long it's level is 4 or less. I choose Maiden of the Rocky Lands in defense mode.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaiden of the Rocky Walls: 1500 ATK 1100 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning do with her?\" Neo wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see right now. Trimaran! Attack his Brioni with Boulder Beam!\" Leo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimaran creates a boulder and shots a beam out of it and destroys the monster, making the duel a tie so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll use my Maiden's effect. When a Earth monster destroys another one in battle, you'll take 400 points of damage for each it's level. Since Brioni is a level 4 monster, you'll take 1600 points of damage.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo: 5900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll my turn from there.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My move.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was about to draw his card until he felt something. He smirks as he sees what he drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your luck is about to run out soon, Leo. First, I'll play Pot of Greed to draw two more cards. Then I'll summon the monster known as Prince of Dishonest, Ralpher in attack mode!\" Neo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalpher: 2200 ATK 1900 DEF level 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute! How can you summon a level 5 monster without tributing?\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I can Normal Summon him to the this way since I have at least one Dark Spell-caster monster on the field. Then I'll equipped him with the spell called Dark Gift Staff. This increases my Ralpher's attack by 600 and it cannot be affected by other spell cards.\" Neo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalpher: 2800 attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Ralpher! Attack Trimaran now!\" Neo ordered his monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalpher destroys the monster and Leo took a big hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for Ralpher's other effect. Since he destroys your monster, I can banish on of my Dark Spell-caster monsters from the graveyard and you take damage equal to half of your monster's attack.\" Neo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: 5700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play this card face down and end my turn.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo better hoped that he can think of something soon because this is gonna be huge problem right now.\" Chumley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis sits there and sees the look of hatred and despair in his eyes. She still blames herself of the demonic transformation that happened to you. She really wished that she would never did what she did. But, it's too late. But, Leo maybe her only hope now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe draws his card and he got what he needs to get his younger brother back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this! First, I'll play Call of the Haunted to bring back Trimaran from my graveyard.\" Leo explained as his monster comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do need him again?\" Neo wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this. You should this card, Neo. Since I have two monsters with Land in there card name on the field, I can sacrifice them to summon my ace.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Neo gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonidas, the Gladiator of Quakes!\" Leo said as his signature monster is now on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonidas: 3000 ATK 2800 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! He's got this in the bag now!\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis feels happy that this could all end in this duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activate your ability, Leonidas! Earthly Judgement! When he's summoned when I tribute 2 monsters with Land, he can destroy all of your monsters that are less than his original attack.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonidas destroys all of Neo's monsters and Leo wasn't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore, for every monster destroyed, you'll take 700 points of damage.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo: 4500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll play the spell Leonidas's Earthly Passion. This will increase his attack by 1000 until the end of the turn.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonidas: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for your own good, Little Bro. Now, Leonidas, attack his life points directly!\" Leo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior brings up his blade and cuts right through Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it for now. I'll place this card face down. This is it, Neo. On my next turn, it's over and we go back to how things used to be. I just need one more turn to do it. I'm done.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Neo started to chuckle and then turned to an evil laugh. Everyone, including Alexis and Leo, are wondering on what's so funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Leo. But, there won't be a next turn.\" Neo said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you so sure.\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're about to find out right now. But first, before you completely finished your turn, I'll activate Fires of Doomsday to get two Doomsday Tokens on to the field. Now I draw!\" Neo declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll play the trap card Escape from the Dark Dimension. This allows my to get back one of my banished Dark monsters. Return, Brioni!\" Neo said as his monster comes back to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are gonna end the duel with her and those tokens?\" Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they'll be sacrificed for this card.\" Neo said as he holds up a card in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Is that-?!\" Leo asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And you're about to see it in action first hand. I sacrificed Brioni and my two tokens to summon the symbol of the Apocalypse itself. The Wicked Avatar!\" Neo said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skies turned dark as a thunder storm comes in. The winds got stronger as purple lightning comes in. Then everyone sees a huge black orb coming through the clouds and it spells terror all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the?!\" Jaden said in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good! Not good!\" Syrus said while shaking his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we should be here!\" Chumley said as he wants to get outta there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis looks at the Wicked Avatar and she couldn't believe that Neo had this sort of creature. Leo has the same thought while staring at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's The Wicked Avatar?! That thing's huge!!!\" Leo cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think it's scary now, wait till it attacks. In fact, don't wait. First things first, the Avatar's attack points is always 100 points stronger than next strongest monster on the field. Since that's Leonidas, it's attack is now at 3100. Also, if you think a simple trap or spell could stop it, think again. Because, during the two turns after it was summoned, you can't activate any spells or traps.\" Neo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?!\" Leo said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's not enough to finish you. But, with Fissure, that's a different story.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonidas is destroyed and now he's wide open for an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll play monster reborn to bring back Brioni. Next I'll use Megamorph to double it's attack since my life points are lower than yours.\" Neo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrioni: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicked Avatar: 3100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Neo! I'm begging you! Please don't go through with this!!\" Leo begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that. ATTACK!!\" Neo ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrioni hits Leo first and he sees The Wicked Avatar closing in to end him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo then crumbled to the ground unconscious. The others were shocked to see all of that and they ran to see if he's alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're alright buddy?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine. He's just unconscious.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis turns to see Neo with a cold expression on his face and she was hurt by what monster he's become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis. I'm not who I am anymore. So goodbye for now.\" Neo said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEO! WAIT!!\" Alexis called out. But he was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis just stood there with her head held in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo. I'M SORRY!!\" Alexis cried to the skies.</span></div></div>",

That monster of Neo's really hit him hard.\" Ms. Fontaine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will he be okay, though?\" Jaden wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But, he might be like this for a while.\" Ms. Fontaine explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna continue until Neo wipes out everyone in this academy.\" Zane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" Syrus wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But, I shuddered to think of what he could do next with that Wicked Avatar of his.\" Zane explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then got furious and turns it to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOHHH! You did this, Rhodes!\" Jasmine yelled at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine!\" Mindy said in shock of Jasmine's outburst towards Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to open your mouth and said bad things about Neo and this is what we ended up with! Way to go, Alexis!\" Jasmine yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!!\" Leo yelled to shut Jasmine up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen! Blaming Alexis won't solve this problem nor anything else! Cause right now, we've got bigger problems to deal with. So, try to keep your cool. That's all I asked for, okay?\" Leo suggested to Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Sorry, Alexis.\" Jasmine apologized as she calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Alexis said and knows that what Jasmine said is true. Because, she is the reason that Neo's is on an emotional dueling rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Jaden wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all need to stay here. I'm going after Neo. He's my little brother, after all.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Alexis said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned to Alexis when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna duel him.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAY WHAT?!?!\" Syrus and Chumley said in shock at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me right. I'm gonna duel him myself.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis! Are you out of your mind?!\" Jaden asked also in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do this, you'll end up like Zeo and everyone else that Neo's taken out.\" Zane said trying to reason with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made up my mind. I'm gonna duel him and that's final.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's suicide!\" Ms. Fontaine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You'll get massacred!\" Mindy said in fear of her friend's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that, guys. But, it's my fault that we're in this mess. Now, I've get to be the one to get us out of it and bring Neo back to his senses.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked at Alexis in her eyes and sees that she really wants-, no, needs to do this. He widened his eyes as he sees something else in the eyes of the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love my brother, don't you?\" Leo wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took me a while, but yes. I do.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo can tell that she truly does love Neo. He then decided on how to prepare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me at the Dueling Stage in an hour. Don't be late.\" Leo suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your test. If you really love Neo, then you must prove that if it's enough to save him.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis widened her eyes in surprise which then turned to a look of defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Alexis go on their separate ways and everyone hoped that Alexis knows what she's doing.</span></div></div>",

I guess I was wrong about making this duel with you. So, I suggest you give up while you have the chance.\" Leo said with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Alexis cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was surprised by her outburst while Leo was smirking with one eye opened as he knows that would fire her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a promise to myself and to Neo that I would save him and right the biggest wrong of my life. So, there's no way that I'll give up!

Now, I'll fuse my Etolie Cyber with Blade Skater that's in my hand to create Cyber Bladet!\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Blader: 2100 ATK 800 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'll equip her with Fusion Weapon.

Thus, ending the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Alexis!\" Jaden said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never doubted her for a second.\" Zane said proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did I do?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I was a teacher right now, I'd give that duel an A+.

Two more things before we go.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Is it something about the test that you left out?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's just that Neo still has custody of the Wicked Avatar and I fear that it's getting astringent with every duelist he defeats. So, if you win, both my brother and the world is saved. If he wins, we're doomed. Simple as that.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. So, what's the hold up?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll have to be honest. When we first met you, I thought you were some spoiled rotten popular girl that wouldn't take a guy's feeling without shoving them back in their faces in a cold way. But, I was wrong. You proved that you're a caring, kindhearted girl and I know that my brother would be lucky to have you in his life and he's gonna need you more than ever to heal his emotional wounds.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis cried up in happiness as she heard his words and she knows that he's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, take these.\" Leo said as he shows Alexis some cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis dries her eyes as she sees Leo's, Zeo's and, especially, Neo's ace monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your's and your brother's cards. Why are you giving them to me?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that you know that we're all fighting beside you. Also, Neo would like you to have him.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis nodded as she took the cards and put them in her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Now, I have only one question. How are we gonna find Neo? He could be anywhere on the island.\" Jaden wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have a clue on where he could be.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go.\" Alexis said before everyone leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked down the forest area of the island and were making sure that they're on the right track. Then they came to an old building that's familiar to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Abandoned Dorm.\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! How I hate this place!\" Chumley said as he was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that Neo's in there?\" Zane wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a gut feeling about it.\" Leo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's not waste anymore time.\" Jaden suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD IT!!\" A voice cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to see Chazz, Dr. Crowler, Chancellor Shepherd and the Ra Yellow genius, Bastion coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing here?\" Jasmine wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis! Please, reconsider about this duel! We've already had a lot of students taken out by this madness. We don't that to happen to you too!\" Crowler begged <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! You can't go through with this!\" Chazz begged too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told these guys already that I'm gonna duel him and that's what I'm gonna do.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you saw that demonic thing of Neo's! That's not a Duek Monster! That's the End of the World!\" Bastion added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But, I need to do this and that's that.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-!\" Chazz was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Everyone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She already made up her mind and nothing's gonna change it. Besides, she already proved that she's ready for this.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Shepherd wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! If anyone can get the old Neo back, it's her!\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Syrus and Chunley said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepherd looked at Akexis and can see the fire in her eyes and he comes to conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then.\" Shepherd suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHANCELLOR SHEPHERD!!\" Crowler yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then.\" Leo said as everyone goes into the old Abandoned Dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey go down the hallway and Bastion goes up to Leo for a talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure that Alexis will beat Neo? Many others have tried and they all failed.\" Bastion wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looks at Akexis before giving Bastion his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because she has conviction and a promise to keep to my little brother. So, I believe that she'll win for sure.\" Leo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For their sake, I hope you're right.\" Bastion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, Bastion. Me too.\" Leo thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached tri the end of the hall and found a big door in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be in there.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys. This is my fight. So, I'm going in alone.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Zane wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I need to face him on my own.\" Alexis answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be right behind you whenever you need us.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're always be there for you no matter what!\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Alexis.\" Zane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it your all!\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! Bring our friend back!\" Chumley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this, Alexis.\" Shepherd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe in you.\" Crowler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Show him what you're made of.\" Chazz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have passion. Use it well.\" Bastion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go get your boyfriend back.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis giggled at her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Guys.\" Alexis said before turning to Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, my brother will be happy to have you in his life. Now, bring him back home.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis nodded before the doors opened and she breathes in and out to relax. She steps inside and the doors started to close slowly as everyone watches her enter to what could be the biggest duel of her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can do this, Alexis.\" Leo thought as the doors closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis walks down the hallway alone as she has flashbacks about Neo and herself. She's ready to go in and right her biggest wrong ever and to be in his heart once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang in there, Neo. I'm coming for you.\" Alexis thought.</span></div></div>",

She thinks back on what she said to him that made him the destructive force that he is now and have many students fall to his wrath. But now, she can finally fix this mess and bring him back to his loving self. The more she thinks about it, the more she thinks about the kind smiles that he had before this whole thing started. He was willingly to be by her side so he can finally be rid of the pain he's endured over the years and she breaks his heart and spit in his face in return. Not this time, not ever after this next duel. Alexis looks over the hallway to see things so different than what she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by the property, it looks like Neo's been keeping himself busy.\" Alexis thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis then stopped to see another doorway to her designation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it. Neo's gotta be behind this door. Based on how far I've come, it's too late to turn back now, anyway. Okay, Neo. I'm not gonna runaway, anymore. We're gonna settle this once and for all. Just you and me. I'm gonna save you because I love you and, whether you believe it or not, I mean it and I'll prove it in this duel. If I go down, though, then the world's coming with me. Well, here goes nothing.\" Alexis thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened and she steps inside before they closed behind her. The lights come on and Alexis sees someone sitting on what appears to be a throne. She sees a face under the hood and knows who this is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you, Alexis. I almost thought that you weren't gonna make it.\" The man under the hood said as it was none other than Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you that you decided to come and face me alone. Perfect. That way, there won't be any distractions.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, Neo. I know that you're angry about what I said and you have every right to be. But, what you're doing is not the answer to your problem.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know?! You have no idea what it's like to step out of your house everyday so that someone would creep on you and hurt you physically and emotionally. Well, I did! And each day was worse than the last. And you, you pushed me to my boiling point after that day. But now, with my newest card, I'll finally have revenge on anyone whoever made me an outcast. Starting with you!\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis feels her own heart craked a bit after hearing what Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of my newest card, how about I give you a small peek of it for the hell of it?\" Neo said as he shows the Wicked Avatar to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis shuddered a little as she looks at the demonic monster. She managed to keep her composure in as Neo puts the card in his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that demon of a card has done to you. But, I'm gonna undo it as soon as I win this duel.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to see you try.\" Neo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis and Neo got their decks ready and put them in the deck slot. Alexis just hope that the cards Leo gave her will help her win and free Neo from the Wicked Avatar's control.

You have 3 monsters with 3600 life points while Alexis has 2 monsters with 2900 life points. The monsters she has on her field both belonged to your brothers. She hoped it would bring the old you back, but it only did little work on you. Now, it's your turn as you draw your card and smiled when you saw its the one card that has helped you defeat so many of your enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over, Alexis. I sacrifice my 3 monsters to summon The Wicked Avatar.\" You declared darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour monsters were sacrificed and the clouds starts forming in the area. Alexis keeps herself steady and looks to see the evil black orb lowers to the battlefield. She can sense the massive darkness from it and you as well, but managed to remain calm as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, his effect prevents you from activating any spells and traps for 2 turns. Also, he's always 100 points stronger than the next strongest monster on the field. Since that's Zeonas, he stands at 3100 attack points. Now, destroy Leonidas.\" You declared as the demon goes to obliterate Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Zeo'so Effect! By discarding a spell card from my hand, your attack is negated.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeo leaps in and saved Leo with his big sword to block Avatar's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I end my turn.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zeonas's effect can only be used once per turn and I barely have any spells left. So, I have to make this turn count.\" Alexis thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop trying, Alexis. You don't have anything that can stand up to my beast.\" You said with an evil chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't surrender that easy, Neo. You of all people should know that by now. I'm gonna save you from that thing and that's what I'm gonna do.\" Alexis said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing left to save. You'll just be another duelist that I beat and I can finally be rid of you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong. I will bring the old you back and I will not lose.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly touched her next card and it started to glow. She then sees the real you before her and you reached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can do it because I-.\" You stopped as you leaned in and kissed Alexis on the lips. She was shocked, but then happy, by that kiss. You disappeared and she looks at her card and she knows what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, Neo. I'm bringing you home with this. Since I control exactly 2 warrior-type monsters, I can special summon Neo Sora-rai, the Samurai of the Sky.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to see your former favorite monster out on her field with your brother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's-.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's your ace, Neo. And like me, he didn't give up on you. Neither of these monsters and your brothers did.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet of you. But, my monster is still stronger than any of them. So, I guess it was all a waste.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Alexis said with a cocky smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a new card up my sleeve and it's gonna be the one to take your monster out. I fuse Leo, Zeo and Neo together for a contact fusion.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contact fusion? You're bluffing!\" You said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not. Now I fusion summon Bramus, Knight of Godly Light!\" Alexis declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you was a knight in Golden armor with 2 yellow swords and shining wings behind him. You feel blinded by it's light and also intimidation by it's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttack: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impressive, but my Avatar now gets stronger.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But, it's not gonna be around to use those points.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to Bramus's effect, I can pay half of my life points to destroy all monsters on your field who's level 8 or higher.\" Alexis explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBramus uses his sword to cut down Avatar and the darkness was lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be!\" You said in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Now Bramus! Attack him directly and bring the real Neo back!\" Alexis declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBramus jumps in and slashes through you and your life points went to 0. The real you comes up to congratulate her on winning the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Alexis. I'll see you soon.\" You said before fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis nodded and took your unconscious body to the medical room.</span></div></div>",

As in like the Egyptian Gods?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And the irony is that the Egyptian Gods and Wicked Gods battled fr the fate of the world 5000 years ago. The Egyptian Gods were victorious and peace was maintained while the Wicked Gods were sealed away and never to be seen or heard from again. At least, so they thought.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are these things back?\" Jasmine wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something even he doesn't know.

Also, if it's true that they're out there, then there's someone out there who might want them for a more evil purpose. I have to find them before they do, but I can't do this alone.

You, along with your brothers, Leo and Zeo, and your friends, just made it to the boat out of the island. As you all get on, the boat departed and it heads course for it's destination. Meanwhile, you looked on your god card, The Wicked Avatar, and something kept on going through your mind. Why did it chose you? What is it's real intentions with you? You even reflect back on the time it made you into a rampaging dueling monster that made you hurt your brothers, Alexis, and other innocent students back at the academy. It must've been torture for them and for yourself. That's why you've decided never to use that card again because you're afraid it might take over again. You then felt a tug on your shoulder on your back and you turned to see Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Neo. Are you okay?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey, Alexis. Yeah.

You looked to see that it's Domino City. The home of some the most legendary duelists in the world. You've always wanted to come here amd you're now seeing the sight with your own eyes. Crowlar then assigned the students to split up with a chaperone. You, Zeo, and Leo get to go with Mindy, Jasmine, and Alexis with Professor Banner as your chaperone. You guys looked around the city and was enjoying the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to admit. Even though we're on some sort of a mission, it's great seeing the city up close.\" Jasmine said holding on to Leo's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.

I draw! First, I'll use the effect of my Darklord Ixchel. By sending her and a \"Darklord\" card from my hand to the graveyard, I can draw 2 cards. So, I'll send her and Darklord Superbia to draw twice more.\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Darklords? Never heard of those before. I best be ready for what they might do.) You thought standing your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll play Darklord Contact. This spell card allows me to special summon a \"Darklord\" monster from my graveyard in Defense position. Come on out, Darklord Superbia!\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarklord Superbia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATK: 2900<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEF: 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for it's effect. Whenever it's special summoned from the graveyard. I can special summon another Fairy-type monster from the graveyard other than itself.

You manged to summon 2 powerful monsters just like that? How did you get your deck to be like that?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't worry about that, Neo. What you should worry about is how this deck is gonna defeat you. Now then, I'll use the effect of my Darklord Amdusc. By sending itself and a \"Darklord\" card from my hand to the graveyard, I can add back another \"Darklord\" card from my grave to my hand. So, I'll send Amdusc and Darklord Rebellion to my graveyard and add Darklord Contact back to my hand. Next, I'm gonna activate Ixchel's Darklord effect.\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You said in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darklord effect? What's that?\" Alexis wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine.\" Zeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple, really. My Darklords may have different abilities by themselves, but some of them have one ability that's very similar to each other. They allow me to activate any \"Darklord\" spell or trap card from my graveyard during either of our turns.\" Epyion explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You can activate spells and traps from your graveyard? That's crazy!\" You gasped with surprise along with your friends and brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But, it comes with a cost. 1000 life points to be precise. After paying the cost, they can use their effects to their will as long as I shuffle them back into my deck once the activation is complete. I will do so now.\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpyion: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've paid up, I'll have Ixchel to gain the effect of my Darklord Rebellion. By sending a \"Darklord\" monster from my hand or field to the graveyard, I can destroy a card on the field. I'll send Superbia to the graveyard to destroy your Sky Serpent.\"<br>\r\nEpyion declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not! For I activate the trap Winds of Steel. With this, one of my WIND monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects this turn at the cost of 500 life points. Meaning, my serpent is safe.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 3500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. But, let's see if you can handle this. Darklord Ixchel! Attack his Sky Fortune Teller.\" Epyion commanded as Ixchel makes Neo's monster be blown away in purple dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've activated my other trap card Blowing Redemption! Whenever you destroyed one of my WIND monsters by battle, I can special summon another WIND monster from my deck as long as it has the same attack points as the one you destroyed. So, I'll special summon my Sky Maiden from my deck.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky Maiden<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel: 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATK: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEF: 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll end my turn with a face down.\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo's not doing so good right now, guys.\" Mindy said feeling worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mindy. If we know our brother, he can find a way to put this game back into his favor.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that right.\" Zeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You can do this, Neo.) Alexis thought in hope that you do find a way to turn this duel around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I can come back from that. I draw! First things first. I'll use the effect of my Sky Maiden. During each of my Standby Phases, she can have me gain 300 life points for every WIND monster that I control. Since I control two, that's 600 points.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll play Pot of Greed so I can draw two more cards.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drew your second card, you gasped as it was The Wicked Avatar that you drew and it gave you a bad feeling in your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Neo? Is he okay?\" Jasmine wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Is there a problem, Neo?\" Epyion asked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(No! I've drawn The Wicked Avatar! I don't wanna even consider about summoning this beast. It could help me take out those Darklords of his, but what if I turn dark again? I can't bare the thought of that happening. I just can't.) You thought as you sweat a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My guess that you must've drawn your wicked god card, am I correct? Perhaps, you can use it to gain a good lead in this duel. After all, without The Wicked Avatar, you're nothing.\" Epyion teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him, Neo! That's not true!\" Zeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You don't need that monster! You're strong without that stupid demon!\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! You can beat him with your own strength! We know you can!\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yourself together and show this nut job what you can really do!\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all can play cheerleader all you want. He knows that he wants to use that card or else he'll lose this duel.\" Epyion said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you jerk!\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Epyion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that he's weak without that god card, but you're wrong. He's stronger than you can ever begin to dream about! Not to mention that he's got a bigger and stronger heart than you'll ever had. That's why he's my boyfriend!\" Alexis yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"boyfriend\" kept on repeating in your head and you felt something growing inside of you. It's like you're gaining the power to take on the whole universe by yourself and it felt really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cute. Though, you shouldn't be- huh?\" Epyion stopped when he heard you chuckling and then turned to laughter. \"What do you have to laugh about?\" Epyion wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that I've just got myself a huge confidence boost. Thanks, guys. Especially you, Alexis. I needed that.\" You said while the other nodded with a smile. \"They're right. I don't need this thing to kick your butt. I've got all the power I need to win this duel and you're about to witness it first hand.\" You said in a defiant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to that happening. Show me this \"true strength\" of yours and prove me wrong, Neo.\" Epyion dared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it. So, look out!\" You said with a look of courage in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be continued</span></div></div>",

Still, it went well for me. Now I just to prepare for my next victim.\" You thought darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't!\" A voice in your head called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That voice.

Why don't you want to get revenge on the people that causes you so much pain and suffering over the years? It's much fun to see them feel the same way as you.\" Dark Neo wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you, yes. But to me, it's because I know that two wrongs never make a right. Hurting others will only turn me what you are, the very same people that hurt me. I don't care how many times they made me suffer, I'll never do the same.\" You said with defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Alexis? Surely, you can't say the same for her. After she broken your poor scarred heart, you felt so much agony and hatred that almost causes you to collapse. Now, I'm here to help you get what you had wanted all along, a taste of vengeance and real power.\" Dark Neo said evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, she did hurt me pretty bad. That's still no right to harm these students and you and that demon of a card took advantage of my painful emotions to gain control of me for your own sick needs.\" You said still not backing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are a fool to think that way. Seems like I'll just show you what you really wanted. Let's duel!\" Dark Neo declared as his duel disk appeared on his arm and he activated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you never asked!\" You said as your duel disk appeared too and you activated it to start the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel!\" You both declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 8000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Neo: 8000</span></div></div>",

Consider yourself lucky I don't turn you in for sexual harrassment. See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away, and you just lied there on the ground, crying at losing the best girl ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you were walking with your brothers to your first class. They didn't even ask how the date went because your head was hung down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't beat yourself up,\" Zeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bro, even though--\" Leo started, but Zeo slapped him upside the head. \"OW! What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stopping you before you made him feel worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you guys heard three more voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Alexis, give him another chance,\" the voice you recognized as Jasmine's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw the three friends talking, Alexis with an annoyed look on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was his first date,\" Mindy followed. \"You can't blame him for being nervous and a bit clumsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit?\" she asked in an annoyed tone. \"He kept on 'accidently' groping me, and 'triping' and landing on either my boobs or butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, now, let's not let tempers flare,\" Leo said, catching the girls' attention, specifically Jasmine's who you could have sworn winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like we said, he got shot down by every girl who he's ever asked out, so he never got to go on a date,\" Zeo followed, who you thought you saw Mindy wink at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like that Wendy girl before you came here,\" Jasmine said, which cause you to step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" you said, catching their attention. \"How'd you know about Wendy? The only people that know are my brothers, and they--\" You stopped as something in your mind clicked. You turned your head, and saw them whistling. \"Why did you tell them that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Leo asked. \"That we asked them out while you and Alexis were dueling, and they agreed, so we went on a double-date while you were on yours, and told them about the various crushes that have crushed you during our awesome date. Why would you say something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opened in shock, and Zeo facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, he didn't say that. He asked why we told them about Wendy, not what we did last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo blanched at the realization. \"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really steamed. Telling two girls they just met about your personal life without asking you first. Sure they were older than you, but they always ran things by each other first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two told them about my personal life? Moreover, you talk about having a fantastic date while I screwed my first one up? I can't believe this! I thought we always told each other everything, but clearly you think it's okay to gossip about me and make me feel even worse. You guys have been on dates before, and while some have been great, not a single girl turns you two down. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in your shadow, even now, just because some dude was too much of a sore loser to put me in a higher dorm. I've tried to act like I had no problem with it, but I can't take this anymore! Have fun on your dates while I end up miserable and alone for the rest of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed past them as soon as you finished your speech, and heard them call your name, but you just kept running. People looked at you strangely, but it didn't matter. None of it did. Your first date ever ruined, and your brother's bragging about their dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept on running until you could not run anymore, sitting down deep in the forest. You lied down on the grass, crying your heart out. You kept on crying for half an hour before you cried yourself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~a couple hours later~<br>\r\n\"Neo, wake up,\" a voice begged from what sounded like it was a mile away. \"Please wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice drew you closer, and closer. As you opened your eyes, you blinked to adjust to the light. It looked like you were in a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness,\" you heard another voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head to the side, and your brothers and Alexis standing there with looks of relief on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had us worried, Neo,\" Zeo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we thought that--\" Leo started but had his mouth covered by Zeo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't speak, bro. You're not exactly the best person to make people feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found you near the abandoned Obelisk Dorm,\" Alexis said. \"Thank goodness we found you before something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed now that you were in the Nurse's office, and Nurse Fontaine was sitting there cross-legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to stay away from there from now on, okay?\" the nurse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, your brothers and Alexis have something they wish to discuss with you without an audience, so I'll head on out. Which will be talking first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\noption 1: Zeo and Leo. They need to apologize for not realizing how you felt sooner<br>\r\noption 2: Alexis. she wants to apologize for last night, and see if you'd like to try going on a triple date with her friends and your brothers, which you think will be a good idea</span></div></div>",

You didnt know anything about her, but you followed like a good boy.<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"Keep moving,\" was her only answer.<br>\r\nShe could be leading you toward her gang hidden in a alley to rough you up and jack everything in your pockets. But even if that were true, you'd know. Through one single soul gaze, under her hardened fierce exterior lied a lovely maiden covered in dying withered roses, twitching as if she were sobbing, but no tears fell down her eyes... cuz the head was missing. Abstract maybe, but it didnt seem evil. Just tragic. And vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you ignored the maiden behind the shell and continued following Ms. Izinski. After a while of walking, the two of you stopped in front of a large executive building that was probably at least 5 times the size of your dad's office building. Good. It looked like a wealthy place, but through the soul gaze, you could hear the cries of thousands of troubled lost souls. Each one seemed as lonely and abandoned as you. A home of lost souls, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" you asked Akiza. As predicted, she just gave an unhelpful answer: \"Home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid it no mind and walked through the door. Typical office setting. Nothing out of the ordinary. Receptionists at the desk, lab-coats scribbling on notepads and typing on computers, janitor sweeping up... the only thing out of ordinary were the strange psychic waves emitting from each of these people similar to you and Akiza. Guess theyre all psychic duelists? Good... home of freaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought him here like you asked, Sayer,\" Akiza said to the red haired man in a trenchcoat with a huge hair curl in the front of his forehead that's so huge, it's covering his eye! Strong, dominating psychic waves were emitting from this gentleman. Waves that demanded authority.<br>\r\n'Guess he's the Alpha of this wolf-pack,' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha businessman stepped toward the two of you and smiled at Akiza.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Izinski,\" he spoke in a confident yet shady tone, \"once again, you saved another valuable life with a potentially bright future ahead of him. You should be honored.\" Is he talking about you?<br>\r\n\"Er... nice to meet you too,\" you say to him.<br>\r\nHe turned his head to you and smiled, \"Let me be the first to welcome you to your brand new home. The Arcadia Movement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow at him in disbelief. The Arcadia Movement?! You heard that name in tabloid papers and fantasy books, but you never thought such a place actually exists! A fictional refuge for Psychic duelists to train and hone their skills away from the outside world. Away from all the hate, fear, and persecution. The Psychic Utopia. It's REAL?!<br>\r\nNormally, you'd be incredibly skeptic... but it's not every day you get sense so many fellow psychics in one building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what youre thinking. Does a place really exist?\" the man read your mind, \"I can assure you that we most certainly do... and we would be happy to take in inspiring minds like yourself, [Roc] 'Gazer' Westwane.\"<br>\r\n\"!!!\" you flinched when he said your name. Dang! Guess he really saw you coming after all!<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" he said, \"I am Sayer. I run this entire place... I guess you can say that I'm the alpha of this wolf-pack!\" You gritted your teeth from the surprise. Suffice to say youre not used to meeting other Psychics. Now youre a little too nervous to pull a soul gaze on him.<br>\r\n\"N...Nice to meet you!\" you tried to keep cool, \"I'm... sorry I'm a little... nervous right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Gazer,\" Sayer replies, \"but rest assured, you have nothing to fear. We at the Arcadia Movement recognize your gifted capabilities. They'll be tested to their limits at the same time strengthened so that they flourish into something stronger. We welcome serious students determined to put their psychic duelist skills to the test and are not afraid of getting their hands dirty in the process.\" Sounds good.<br>\r\n\"So I guess this is like the Mutant Academy and youre Professor X, right?\" For some reason, the headless maiden in Akiza soul clenched her fists and emitted bad vibes, as if she was insulted by that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you get off-\"<br>\r\nThankfully, Sayer cut her off and laughed, \"Heh, I guess you can say that. Your story\u2019s like many of the other residences here. They\u2019ve all be shunned, outcasted, and abandoned by society. Many by their own families. What we offer is a whole new start. You wouldnt have to live in fear and hide among the shadows. Here, youre free to truly be who you are. You do not have to be afraid of your special gift, cuz that gift will one day save your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far so good. It beats sleeping outside in the cold. But something deep down told you something was off. You sensed something big was written in the fine print. And just as you thought that, Sayer continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to warn you, Gazer. The Movement isnt for the pacifists,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe will expect you to perform a few crucial tasks you might not agree with. And you will fulfill them at your best performance.\u201d Right then and there was shady.<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf youre not the type to do what youre told, then I suggest finding refuge elsewhere,\u201d He just flat out dodged the question.<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out in due time,\u201d the shallowest answer in the world.<br>\r\n\u201cHell with that, I wanna find out NOW!\u201d you demand, \u201cLike what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare raise your voice at Sayer!\u201d you flinched when Akiza got between you and him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d you tell her, \u201cI just wanna make sure this is the Mutant Academy and not the Brotherhood!\u201d BIG mistake!<br>\r\nThe headless rose maiden intensified with rage to match the Akiza's face! Your eyes widened you noticed she was about to whip out a card! What the hell was she up to?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza. Please,\" fortunately, Sayer alone was enough to sate the maiden's rage. She must be incredibly loyal to him or something deeper. He then turned back to you, \"These are our terms. Nothing that we offer comes without a fair price. If you dont accept our terms, feel free to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not good. If he's not even gonna tell you about these 'crucial tasks that you might not agree with', how can you trust living in a place like this? You werent the type to take risks as big as that! You'd need to soul gaze him to find out clues about what he has in store for you. But then again, what if he sees your gaze coming as is threatened by it? You have no idea what this guy could be capable of, let alone his pretty little sidekick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just turning him means you'd go back in the cold. You'd better think your decision VERY clearly!</span></div></div>",

Cheat in tournaments and duel people to death. Worse case scenario, you'd be a threat to yourself and to others. At least this way, if you were gonna be threat, you'd be a threat with the support of others walking along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and nodded, \"Alright. Count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Sayer approved, \"we'll talk more after the welcoming ceremony for the rest of the 'new students'. In the meantime, you should be getting your rest.\" He then turned his head to Akiza, \"Oh Jean Grey. Would you kindly escort Gambit to his new room?\" Aw, dang it! He's an X-Men fan, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sayer,\u201d Akiza, probably not as well versed in the X-Men mythology, obediently replies, \u201cthis way, [Roc].\u201d You followed her like you were told, although you could still sense the headless maiden venting. She was definitely upset with you. Could you blame her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Akiza?\u201d she said nothing, \u201clisten, I didn\u2019t mean to offend back there. It was just a joke-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe Movement has no room for jokers, Gazer,\u201d she responded to you in such a cold tone, \u201cthis is not a vacation suite. We take our roles very seriously. If you wish to stay here, you will work exceptionally hard and treat your higher-ups with respect. ESPECIALLY Sayer.\u201d Dang\u2026 Sayer\u2019s the word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess you better learn to stop running your mouth\u2026 no matter how hard it takes!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you apologized, \"I wont cut out of line like that again.\" She merely hmphed. That translated to 'I dont accept your apology. And your scent is now known to me.' Yep, you were never good with the ladies.<br>\r\n\"This is your room,\" Akiza pointed to the door, \"you'll be staying here until you earn a better spot. Goodnight.\" She started walking off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you call out, \"but I dont even have a key!\"<br>\r\n\"Ask your roommate,\" was all she said as she left your field of vision!<br>\r\n\"Grr... damn woman,\" you muttered, \"ugh... ok, dont flip out, [Roc]. Youre gonna be just fine.\" Sure you say that NOW, but there's a reason you'd never soul gaze the reflection in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed and knocked on the door. Not long after, someone answers it!<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be my new roommate!\" said the happy young black haired little boy that barely looks HALF your age! Eh, he could be older than that, but not much older. His big sparkling blue eyes lit up with happiness that he finally has a new friend! You stared blankly at him, not noticing your own jaw drop! A kid as young as HIM living in a place like this?! \"It's really nice to meet another new kid on campus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... h... hello,\" you tried to maintain your composure and shook his hand, \"wow... aintcha a little young to be in a place like this, kid?\"<br>\r\nThe boy just shook his head, \"Not at all! Sayer says he's taken in children as young as 4 here!\" Oh man. Kids THAT young being cast away and put in a placed like this? Now you feel depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that warming smile on the kid's face is slightly warming the sadness.<br>\r\n\"My name's Toby. Toby Tredwell,\" he introduced himself, \"I'm a psychic duelist like you.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Toby,\" you introduce yourself, \"I'm [Roc] Westwane. Everybody calls me 'Gazer'.\" For obvious reasons. Speaking of which, you soul gazed the boy as you two made introductions. You could see cute tiny cartoonish angel constantly flapping his wings, trying to fly. He wasnt getting off the ground, but he was sure trying.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I hope we'll get along, Gazer. Come on in!\" he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was small, but cozy. Two light bunk beds, a desk, a tv, and a bathroom. Nothing special, but you dont expect luxury for newcomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place you got here,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I know it isnt big,\" Toby admits. \"but Ms. Izinksi says rookies who past the first couple of trials get to stay in nicer rooms.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll bet we'll have our work cut out for us,\" you reply. That's when you notice a little picture on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a picture of Toby and... MISTY TREDWELL!!<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" you laughed and edged up to the picture, \"you got a picture with that world famous fashion model?!\"<br>\r\nToby nodded, \"Yep. Misty's my sister!\" You almost spit out your imaginary drink when you heard that!<br>\r\n\"Y...YOURE Misty Tredwell's little brother?! No freaking way!\" But from the little angel didnt look like the type to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Toby said proudly, \"she's... she's been taking care of me and taking me everywhere I sent ever since our parents died in that tragic car accident.\" Aw...<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" he assures you, \"I still got her. And now I have the Arcadia Movement now.\" Man, who'da guessed Ms. Tredwell's brother was a psychic? This would make headlines in the tabloids. \"What about you? Do you have any family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked in air and blew hard, \"...My mom and dad... kicked me out. Said they didnt want me there anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"That's horrible!\" Toby said with a frown, \"what kind of parents would say something so cruel to their own son?\" Good question.<br>\r\n\"Eh, who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such short time, you managed to form a good bond with this kid. Compared to the auras in this place, his seemed alright. The little angel in his soul was smiling at you. Guess he likes you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's getting a little late,\" you say, \"maybe we should be getting some rest.\"<br>\r\n\"Youre right,\" Toby agreed, \"the welcoming ceremony starts early in the morning! We dont wanna be late. Top bunk or bottom?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, you decide,\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Alright! I got the top!\" he immediately climbed up to the top bunk, \"we'll talk more after the ceremony! Goodnight, [Roc]!\" Aw geez... he called you by your first name. That's starting to get you.<br>\r\n\"G'night, Tobbes!\" you replied as you hopped in your bed and flipped the light switch...</span></div></div>",

The jerk already knew who it was who attacked him?! You'd be thrilled that anybody ANYBODY would have the decency to save your life, but somehow those words had pretty good meaning to them.<br>\r\nYou were still weary from whatever grasp Magneto had on your mind as Toby stood in front of you like a human shield, wielding his precious baseball bat that still had the sticker 'Happy Birthday Toby, Love Sis' on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasnt your concern,\" Sayer continued as he helped himself off the ground, \"if you had just stayed in your room and slept this night off like a good boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Toby shouted, \"I heard everything, you traitor! You said this place was a refuge when I signed up! Youre seriously turning everyone here into your own personal army?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer, unlike you, was awful quick to recover from a bone-breaking blow. He took a deep breath and looked down at that poor little kid. Toby was shivering. He was just as scared as you if not more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone, Toby,\" Sayer coldly spoke, \"I've taken thorough studies of my students... sadly, you havent reached my expectations.\" You could hear loud marching outside. Judging by Sayer still keeping his cool, they were HIS reinforcements.\"You failed all of my exams.You were such an inspiring student, but... inspiration doesnt equal perspiration.\"<br>\r\n\"Youre not getting away with this!\" Toby snapped, \"once the others find out-\"<br>\r\nSayer's cool calm collective voice was enough to cut him off, \"I was planning on just shipping you off to an undisclosed location to bend spoons for a while... but I'm afraid you now know too much.\" You paled at the hidden meaning behind those words. When Magneto says you know too much, he's gonna do whatever it takes to make sure you cant tell anyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toby stop!!\" you shouted just when he charged at Sayer, but too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auuugghhh!!\" Toby screamed as he was slammed against a monitor by Sayer's will, shattering the glass to pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!\" you shouted as you limped toward him. But by then, Sayer's hooded soldiers had arrived. Some blocked the doorway as the others restrained you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had so much potential, Gazer,\" you didnt even look Sayer in the eye as he spoke, \"you and Akiza wouldve been unstoppable together. Guess youre just not the Gambit I was looking for.\" Now you were getting absolutely sick of all the X-Men references!<br>\r\nSomething inside you just snapped. Rage boiled throughout your bloodstream. There was no way in hell you were just gonna roll and die and let THIS psychotic roam free to harm innocent people with more innocent people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick jerk, you managed to break free of your captors, grab the biggest sharpest piece of shattered glass you could find, and lunge at the madman!<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sayer STILL kept his cool as you jumped at him! Did he see THIS coming too?! Just when you were about to slice this throat open, you soul gazed him. The image you saw behind his soul left chills that would remain long after your adventure ended.<br>\r\nYou saw an image of dozens of angels twitching and choking as they cringed with long tight nooses around their necks! Each one had a look of painful despair as they yearned for the air they were denied. In the middle of this image stood a tall winged faceless figure in Sayer's fancy suit wearing several nooses tightened around his neck. Each rope connected to the ones choking the angels!<br>\r\nThe faceless figure reached his hand out to you, another noose wrapped around his wrist! As everything went white, you heard Sayer's voice echo in your mind:<br>\r\n'I said I'd show you the extent of my power. I didnt say anything about killing you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything around you changed! You werent in the Movement's facility anymore! You found yourself standing in the middle of the street. Sayer mustve teleported you here in the middle of nowhere. But that wasnt all he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down and saw little Toby lying on the ground. His chest had been cut open. The piece of glass in your hand dripped fresh blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-T-TOBY!!\" you dropped to the floor and held that kid! \"H-H-Hang in there! Youre gonna be ok! Just... just... hang in there!\" Toby... wasnt moving. \"Toby, Toby come on! Oh god, I'm sorry! Please dont die on me! I swear I'll...\" He wasnt breathing. You shivered and twitched as you were forced to face the cold grim grip of reality. Toby was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung your head low and cursed under your breath as stuck that bloody glass in the ground. You had just murdered this poor little kid. Whatever that bastard did to you, it made you the one thing you vowed never to become: a cold blooded murderer. You rubbed your aching head and embraced the warm tears running down your eyes as the rain poured down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, you heard the sound of sirens. Crap, Sector Security had arrived.<br>\r\nSS cars surrounded the place. The helicopter's lights shined down on you.<br>\r\n\"[ROC] WESTWAYNE!!\" you heard the deep surly voice of Officer Trudge call out through the megaphone, \"SECTOR SECURITY PLACES YOU UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF TOBY TREDWELL, THE ONLY BROTHER OF WORLD FAMOUS FASHION MODEL, MISTY TREDWELL!\" Reminded you who he was that you killed only added more salt to the wound. \"WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED. PUT WHATEVER WEAPON YOU HAVE DOWN AND PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and got up, you were both scared out of your mind and saddened over the loss of your new friend. Your options were limited. There was no way around this. You were not just a criminal, but a murderer. Sayer not only silenced you, but he stained your good name. No one's gonna believe the words of a murderer. <br>\r\nWhat else could you do now?</span></div></div>",

You kept going until you reached the bridge. Then you took the runner and put it in overdrive near a tunnel that connected to Satelite. After you got there, you got off and put it in full throtle towards New Domino before heading through the tunnel. After you entered and were cleared, you went to someone who could help you. Someone who could destroy who you were and make you someone new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes, you found his place and entered. A 50-something year old man stood behind the counter with a lot of stuff for surgery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Roc,\" the old man said. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been framed for murder and need a new face,\" you said, getting straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a look at your face, and knew that was all you were going to say on why you'd need a new face. He took you to a seat, gave you a shot, and after you fell asleep, began the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~a couple hours later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened, and you saw someone you never seen before. A man the exact same height as you with cobalt-blue eyes and black hair with gold highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" the old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice,\" you said, noticing the change in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, but I gave you a new voice too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. They might recognize me by my voice alone, so I can't be too careful. Thanks, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now, you need a new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering how much I resemble the late Professor Fudo, maybe Yusei Fudo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Then your new name is Yusei Fudo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I don't have any money. My parents found out and kicked me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" He did indeed, for he was one of the only non-psychics who knew about your powers, and didn't freak out. \"This is free. Enjoy your new life, Yusei Fudo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out, and went to have your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAN: yes, I made him Yusei. just popped into my head. now here, he doesn't meet Jack or Crow as kids, but he is still part of the enforcers at one time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked through an area for street duels in New Domino, walking with three kids, an old man and a former pro. It has been four years(AN: I don't know how many years between when Yusei was an enforcer prior to the main storyline, so it's just a guess) since you took on identity of Yusei Fudo, and threw away your old name. Even with your new life, your old one still creeped in on you, especially over the last few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last few years, your Soul Gaze had evolved(AN: how will be explained in later chapters. I have some ideas, which I will share with Aerodeth to use as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after taking on this new face, you met Kalin Kessler, Jack Atlas and Crow Hogan. You all formed a group called the enforcers. However, after you took out all the duel gangs around Satelite, your Soul Gaze saw that Kalin, the leader, thought it was not enough. He wanted to get rid of Sector Security. You had to stop him. After you said you were the leader, they had already captured Kalin. He saw that you were hiding something from the look in your eyes, and thought you ratted him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple years later, Jack had stolen the first Duel Runner you ever made, and you had to build another one. During a duel with Jack, giant dragon showed up, and it gave you a feeling, like it was something you knew about. After the duel ended, you saw your right arm glowing and Jack's. You had a feeling you knew what they were, but decided to play ignorant. After that, you were placed in the facility and met an old man named Yanagi and dueled Bolt Tanner. Yanagi confirmed your suspicions about the beast and your mark. It appears that you were a signer, just like Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head at that. She most likely has forgotten you, thanks to the bastard that forced you away from New Domino all those years ago. Though there was a chance Arcadia was still in New Domino. The three kids you were with, Leo, Luna(who were twins) and their buddy Dexter, had heard rumors going around about someone called the Black Rose. That name brought out that night again, the one you wish you could forget. You did forget though, but after a duel with Leo, you remembered it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after getting an invite to a tournament and your Stardust back from Jack, you all went looking around when suddenly a huge explosion appears. Your mark starts to glow, causing everyone to star in surprise. You all looked up, and saw a dragon. You recognized the dragon from someone's soul. You looked in the cloud of smoke, and saw a lone figure with a bone-white mask and a cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if it was Akiza. She looked at your arm, and gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your arm!\" she asked in a distorted voice. \"You also have a mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used made a gesture, and disappeared in an explosion. As everyone else moved to help the others, your eyes remained glued to the spot where she stood moments ago, a single word leaving your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~in an alleyway~<br>\r\nThe masked figure was panting, and removed her mask, revealing herself to be exactly who Roc suspected, Akiza Izinski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asked herself. \"Why must he have a mark also? Also, why did I feel like I knew him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put that aside for now, and went back to the Arcadia building. For so long, this was her home, yet she felt like something wasn't right lately. Sayer was much more direct toward her, and while she welcomed it, it hasn't felt right for four years, since the day Roc and Toby left. They say Roc killed Toby, but Roc didn't look like a killer. In fact, he was like her opposite. While she had no problem hurting others, he seemed to want to avoid it. Why did it matter so much? She loved Sayer, but she has been doubting herself for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through her usual routine, she went to bed, and stared out the window, thinking about the boy she saw today, and the boy she met four years ago who was gone the next day. A single phrase escaped her lips before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roc, where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~back at the tops, in Leo and Luna's penthouse guestroom~<br>\r\nYou were staring out the window, wondering if that was indeed Akiza. The monster was like what you saw in her memories. Also, her soul was like when you first met her, a headless maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth. She was still with the Arcadia movement, and Sayer's plans were almost near completion. You couldn't let his plans go through. Whatever it takes, you have to stop him, but killing him will only make you a murderer, and you don't want those words thown at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayer, I will stop you, avenge Toby and save Akiza. You think you got rid of me, but you didn't. Now you're in for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAN: will we follow the original story and have the next encounter be at the tournament, or will Roc/Yusei go after Sayer now?</span></div></div>",

Even a blind person could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Akiza said through choked sobs. You knew what she meant without your psychic ability. \"All this time, he was using me. I can't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up to wipe away her tears, and she let you this time. You then hold her chin so she's at eye level with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, I'm sorry, but right now, we need to find Toby, and get the heck outta here before he wakes up,\" you told her sternly gesturing to Sayer. She looked like she had doubts. \"I know this is hard, but if we don't go now, then the pain will be even worse than when you were at that duel academy.\" She looked at you in shock at how you knew this. \"No time to explain.

Akiza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should worry about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer pulled me toward him with his psychic power bringing me eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad. I saw so much potential in you, but really, what good is your soul gaze now? All it does is let you see into a person's soul and know many things about them. All your psychic ability is seeing, but looks like it's no good now.\" You start to chuckle at that. He looks at you like you've gone crazy. \"Why're you laughing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the joke's on you.\" He didn't have time to ask before I shouted, \"Devastation Gaze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Sayer's mind got a jolt of pain, cutting off his psychic power. You forced him to keep eye contact, never letting him wander, not that either of you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sayer asked out of fear. He should be afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Devastation Gaze. You know about 'Ghost Rider'? Well, this is my Pentence Stare. However I keep it locked up, and can only unlock it when I see my face clearly in someone's eyes. Then I use my soul gaze on myself, and unlock my power. However it only works if I look into a wicked person's eyes. It doesn't kill a person though, just destroys their mind. I wonder what the effect will be on a psychic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer could feel his mind being crushed by your gaze. He tried to use his psychic power to throw you off, but ended up intensifying the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I forget to mention to the more brain activity is done, the more intense the pain is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer could do nothing as his mind was being obliterated. He couldn't believe he was getting his mind destroyed by a kid like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think it'd be best to just cut off your Psi Power. So I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you found his Psi Core, the source of all his psychic energy. You put a lot of feedback and destroyed his Psi Core. He screamed in pain, collapsing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to Akiza and Toby, who were shocked that you were able to do that to someone as powerful as Sayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring and let's go! Sayer's scream may have awakened the entire Arcadia Movement, so let's get out of here while we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped them out of their thoughts and followed you through the emergency exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you got outside, you took a moment to rest. Then you reached into your bag and pulled out three pieces of aluminum foil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put these on your heads. They'll block your brainwaves which should keep them from tracking us from our psychic energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at you like you were crazy, but one look into your eyes made them put it on their heads. You put yours on your head, and got ready to run outta here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, we gotta move before they catch us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do to Sayer? Destroy his mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment, and sternly said, \"No, I didn't. Now, let's go. I'll tell you more as when we get somewhere safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of you started running again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of running, you came across a run-down building that had a lot of aluminum foil around it and got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we're safe?\" Toby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now tell us,\" Akiza interjected. \"If you didn't destroy Sayer's mind, then what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment, and replied, \"I destroyed his Psi Core.\" Akiza and Toby gasped in shock. \"He had psychic powers, strong ones at that, so I couldn't destroy his mind. The best I could manage was destroying his Psi Core, the source of his psychic energy. He'll live, but he's lost his psychic powers forever. Without his psychic powers, the Arcadia Movement will crumble on its own. I may be causing more pain on our fellow psychics, but I can live with that knowing that the world is safe. I may have been able to destroy his mind, but decided to not try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in the eyes, and said, \"I didn't do it because of you, Akiza.\" She gasped at your words, and you continued. \"You found out that a man that you trusted for years was planning to use you as a weapon. I could tell how much it hurt you to find out all this without having to use my soul gaze, and I didn't wanna add to it by murdering someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head away, before muttering, \"Thanks for considering me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a small smile before saying, \"No prob.\" You stood up. \"Now, let's get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe managed to find three good beds in neighboring rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" they replied before you each went to your rooms.</span></div></div>",

Oh, boy, now she's causing problems, this time non-destructive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered, \"for saving me from pain worse than with my parents or the academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compose yourself as best you could with her breasts against your back. \"You don't need to thank me. You've already been through so much pain I didn't want to add to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still wanted to say thanks. So, I'm guessing your soul gaze is how you knew about the academy and how to get around the Arcadia Movement building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sometimes I get more info then I intend, but it can be useful, especially when trying to escape from a building run by a...\" You cover your mouth at that moment. You turn your head slowly toward Akiza, and notice a sad look. \"Don't worry. If you need emotional support, I'll do the best I can. Okay?\" She nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her hands started moving down. 'Oh, no,' you thought. 'That ain't good. We're having a moment and it'll be ruined if she finds out I'm getting a hard-on.'</span></div></div>",

When you two get to Toby's room, you see members of the Arcadia Movement trying to kidnap Toby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put him down!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laugh at you, making you very angry. So you leap up, and do a flip-kick on one of the members, knocking him unconscious. Everyone looks at you in shock, and you smirk. You took some martial arts classes for years before you got kicked out by your parents. You never had to use them before, but they finally paid off. They then raised their hands towards you, like they were gonna blast you. They notice that nothing was happening and your smirk gets wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't any of you wonder why we came here?\" you ask them all. \"It's because of all the aluminum foil.\" They all look at you confused, so you sigh and explain further. \"Aluminum foil blocks off brainwaves from going or reaching outward, so you can't sense us here. I assume you saw Toby through the window and wondered why you couldn't sense his psychic energy. Well that's why. Not only that, but around all this aluminum foil, psychic powers are completely useless here.\" They all gasp in shock, then one of them realizes something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means so all your powers,\" one of them says. He pointed to one of them, and pointed to Akiza. \"Get Akiza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the guy had a chance to do so, you whipped out a collapsable bo staff, and swung it at him, slamming him into the wall. You also trained with tons of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, in case you haven't noticed, I don't need my psychic powers. I've got training in karate, kung fu, tai chi, etc. Plus I can use just about any weapon with amazing skill. I'm guessing you guys have always practiced with your psychic powers, so you aren't used to hand-to-hand combat, or even using weapons like a normal person. Which means, I have the advantage. Why would you even try this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayer told us to come and capture you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. And why are you doing what Sayer says?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's our psychic leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he told you to capture us, did you sense any psychic energy from him?\" They looked at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have his psychic powers anymore. I destroyed his Psi Core, thereby destroying his psychic powers.\" They looked at you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? That's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not,\" Akiza piped in, all eyes turning to her. \"I saw it with my own eyes. Gazer used a secret power he keeps locked up, and destroyed Sayer's Psi Core.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you leave, Akiza? You were always so loyal to him, and he treated you with the upmost care and love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she heard the truth,\" you said. \"Sayer never even cared about helping psychics. He just wanted to hurt billions of lives just to make the world into his own image, and you were all just a butch of fools to help him carry it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying!\" one of them shouted as he charged at you. You swing the bo staff, slamming him into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me? Then here.\" You pulled out an extra flash drive with the data you got from the Arcadia files. You had all them linked, so that if you lose one, you still have the data. \"Look at the latest entry in that flash drive, and you'll know everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them looks at you, and asks an expected question. \"Why do you care what happens to others? Your parents kicked you out because of your powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think I should kill tons of people just because I kicked out of my house, and was called a monster by my parents. Oh, yeah. That'll prove them wrong. Let me tell you this, and think about it. It's like beating the crap out of a guy because he took a rubber band, or something stupid like that. Killing people for ridiculous reasons like that is wrong, and like they say, 'two wrongs don't make a right'.\" You said the last part sarcastically with a very disappointed voice. They start to get a look on their faces, as if absorbing your words. \"Now, you've got two choices. Put Toby down, leave us alone, go, look at the files on that drive, then show them to everyone, and tell them what I said to you. Or you can ignore my advice, and I'll force you to leave. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your foot of the one you kicked and let them talk. They huddled together, and started whispering.

I figured that you were a somewhat rude and troubled psychic, but it seems like there's so much more to you. You're strong and kind-hearted as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at her words, feeling a tingle in your chest. You brush it off and say, \"Well, that's very nice of you to say, Akiza, but we should get back to my room, so you can get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna stand guard.

After waking them up, you went to grab some clothes from the closet. You remembered that this house was where one of your martial arts instructors sometimes brought you, the one who taught you about sensing life energy and blocking your mind. Now that you thought about it, it was almost as if he knew about your psychic powers, and was training you to not have to use them to sense other people. Since you trained her, and had to come in your regular clothes, you had some clothes here. You pull out some blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and a hoodie, and tossed them to Akiza, telling her to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though no one else came last night, it doesn't mean we should let our guard down,\" you explained. \"Your wardrobe, hair and...\" You put your hand to your mouth to stop yourself before you took it too far.

You nodded yes, and continued carefully. \"You'd be easy to determine, and considering when we escaped, you don't have any extra clothes, do you?\" She kept silent, knowing he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to the closet, and pulled out a red t-shirt, shorts and baseball hat you had when you were nine, and tossed them to Toby. He looked at you, silently asking 'got anything else?', and you shrugged as if to say, 'Closest I have to your size.' and he started putting it on. You got some new clothes yourself. When everyone was dressed, you all went to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to a coffee place, and ordered some pancakes. You also ordered some coffee for you and Akiza and Toby some milk.

Anyway, you two were saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We asked him how he knew about them, and he said he knew about them from the beginning. He said that was why he taught you to sense life energy. I assume that thought crossed your mind too.\" You nodded, motioning to continue. \"We asked him why he didn't tell us about your destructive powers, but he said that the only destructive power you have works like the penitence stare from <i>Ghost Rider</i>, and you kept that locked up. He told us you see into people's souls, and see the pain from their lives. He said you can also sense psychic energy, with or without your powers. When we heard that, we cried at our actions. That's our story. Who are these two, and how do you know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid is Toby, and that's Akiza. Akiza brought me to the Arcadia Movement, and introduced me to their leader Sayer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Arcadia Movement?\" your mother asked sadly. \"Sounds like you've already found a better home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't,\" you said, both of them turning to you shocked. \"Besides taking in psychics to hone their abilities, everything the public has heard are lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained everything you learned about the Arcadia Movement, how you destroyed Sayer's Psi Core, and how you, Akiza and Toby escaped and went to the house where you trained with Chilo.

You sighed as you looked down to your lap as your parents waited for your answer. Akiza and Toby were both behind you, one behind both of your shoulders. Akiza leaned her hand onto your shoulder trying to be supportive of whatever decision you make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roc please\" your mother begged as you let out a breath. Even though they went as far as kicking you out, you knew they were good people down at heart. And in the end... their your parents and the only ones you'll ever get. You looked up to them smiling and looking like you were going to cry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i forgive you\" you told them as their faces lit up and almost reached across the table to hug you till you stopped them \"But i'll only come back on one condition\" you told them as they recieted back to their seats. Akiza and Toby looked shocked, they weren't expecting you to do that for them. They were going to say that you didnt have to but they didnt get a chance because in the preceding moment your father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh course they can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" both Akiza and Toby said in unison <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both can come, we have plenty of money and not that much to spend it on with Roc almost being grown up. You both are more then welcome to stay with us\" he said as Toby lite up and Akiza almost broke a tear over her smile. Finally everything was going right for you. The only thing that would makes this more perfect is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here\" you told your parents with your arms wide open. They both let out a chuckle as they reached across the table to hug you. Then Akiza and Toby hugged you, making you feel something that you haven't felt since... you don't know when. You felt loved<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were starting to stare at you all so you eventually broke off and lead Akiza and Toby to their new home<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pointed to a clothing store to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need new clothes,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, that's right. I don't have anything there that fits Toby. Well, let's head in, then head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you went inside and began buying clothes for Akiza and Toby. Your mother had insisted that she could loan Akiza some of her things, but Akiza wanted to buy some new stuff since she wasn't sure how your mom's stuff would fit her chest. You thought maybe you should get some new stuff yourself while you were here. After purchasing some new clothes, you all continued on home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got there, your father took out the key, and unlocked the door. You all walked in. It wasn't really what you would expect from parents who had a lot of money, but they were never the kind of people to buy way more than they need. That was fine with you. You gave Akiza and Toby a tour, and showed them the guest bedrooms. After that, you left them to change, and went to see your parents. When you got to the living room, your father had a sad look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to you, and said, \"That was the office. They're wondering where I am. I have to go in order to keep my job. I'm sorry, Roc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Dad,\" you said with a fake smile. \"If you lose the job, then it'll be hard for you to find another one.\" You really wanted to do things with your parents, but you knew the importance of his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I get home tonight, we'll do something. Alright?\" You nodded your head. Then your father left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess it's just me, my boy, and his new friend and girlfriend,\" your mother said clapping her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at what she called Akiza. \"Mom, she's not my girlfriend. I mean, sure she'd pretty, kind, great figure, nice legs, smells nice--\" You covered your mouth as you realized the words coming out of it. Your mother merely smirked as she heard that. \"Oh, man, you've gotta be kidding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, my son's in love,\" your mother cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell Akiza though. I could tell from my Soul Gaze that Akiza had developed feelings for Sayer, and now that she learned the truth about him, I'm not sure she's even ready for a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard footsteps. You turned around and gasped at Akiza. She was wearing a red tank top with a flower in the center and white shorts. The top hugged her body tight, revealing just a hint of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza blushed and said to you, \"From that look on your face, I'm guessing you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your trance, and stuttered, \"Y-you look g-g-great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled nervously, and muttered a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby came in wearing a red Tony Hawk shirt and some blue shorts. \"Hey, guys,\" Toby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Tobe,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you all wanna do while we wait for my husband to come back?\" your mother piped in.</span></div></div>",

She turned to you and smiled. \"Hello, Roc,\" she said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, what are you doing here?\" you asked surprised. After all, here was a totally how girl in your room, sitting on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza didn't say, but she wagged her finger. You walked over to her, and were surprised when she grabbed your head, and pushed her lips against your own. You were shocked at this sudden action, though you quickly started to kiss back. You prodded your tongue against her lips, asking for entrance. She obliged and you began to explore her mouth. She tasted like strawberries to you. After a minute, the need for air overcame the two of you. You looked into each other's eyes, but you didn't search her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to show my thanks, and tell you I love you,\" Akiza said with complete honesty. You couldn't believe it what you were hearing. The girl who you just found out you fallen for today feels the same about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" You looked at her, wondering how she even know, then it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear my conversation with my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. You think I have nice legs and a great figure huh?\" You blushed real dark at that question. Then she took off her nightgown, revealing that she wasn't wearing a bra. She had on some red lacy panties. She pulled them down, revealing her pussy. You noticed a few red hairs the same color as her hair. She then pushed you on the bed, then pulled your boxers down, revealing your slowly hardening cock. \"Looks like you've got some good points too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but hold on a minute.\" Akiza looked up at you. \"Why are you doing this? It's not that I'm not liking this, but why are you doing this so suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza crawled back up to your face, and smiled. \"Because like I said, I love you and I wanted to show my thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you don't need to thank me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don't, but I want to. I mean, it hasn't even been 24 hours, and yet you've found out that a man I thought cared about me was only using me, you used a hidden power to destroy his psychic powers so that he could never hurt anyone ever again, you've saved Toby and me from member's of the movement with your martial arts skills, and given me and Toby a new home. With everything you've done for me, I need to do something for you. So just sit back, and let me thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering how serious she was--and how strong her psychic powers were--, you decided to let her thank you. She gave you another quick kiss on your lips before moving down. She kissed your neck, chest, even your oval. Eventually, her head returned to your cock. She gave you a quick smile before starting the next stage of her thank-you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life's not fair. Sure you can land in a well off family, be feed well, have all the bells and whistles you want. But not have the love that you always wanted since you were a baby crying out for it. Your dad is the governor of the state and is always away on business at the capital. And your mother is a senator, always at the nation's capital far away from you and him. The only love you ever received was from the nannies that raised you for 13 years. Then your father got rid of them the instant he said you were moving to a city closer to the capital, so he could come and see you more often. But you knew that was one big fat lie, nothing could tear him away from his work. So you were torn away from your friends and home and moved to new domino city where you always heard stories of the people here being snobbish rich people or extremely poor dirty homeless guys on the street. So you werent particularly thrilled to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad had dropped you off at your new apartment in the tops, the so called home of the elite of the city. Great you might snobbish money grubber. As your dad opened the door he patted you on your shoulder and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home son\" You took the first steps into your new apartment and looked around. It was fairly big, then again on the near top floor and apartments tend to get bigger the ways you go up. You let out a sigh as you made your way to the couch and unstrapped your back pack and slumped down. Your dad not being able to take a hint just dumbly smiled \"Well i'll just leave the keys here by the door in case you want to do some exploring. Heck you might find a friend\" He said happily as he set the keys down by a near by table next to the door. You really hated all this, and honestly you just wanted to tell your dad to blow off. But you lacked the courage and he just left you again to get back to work. You let out another sigh as you opened your bag and took out a picture. In it was you, the two nannies that took care of you, and your two best friends Lea and Jack at your 13th birthday party. You sighed and almost let out a tear. It just wasn't fair. What gives someone the right to rip you away from your life and leave you all alone all the time. Just when you were on the verge of tears you heard a knock come from your door. Maybe it was your dad who was stupid enough to give you the only pair of keys to this place. You let out another sigh as you got up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming just hold up\" you said as you made your way from the couch and to the door. You opened the door expecting your father but getting a big surprise instead. In the hallway was a girl about your age maybe a year younger with green hair in pig tails wearing white shorts and over shirt with a red and gold under long sleeve.  You were left a gasped, this girl... you didnt know why just seemed different from the others you had meet before. She had almost a raidance coming off her as she gestured her hand toward you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be the new person living here. i'm Luna, I live in the penthouse one floor up\" She explained as you mentally slap yourself back into reality and shook her hand, which you swore you could feel a spark off of when  you held her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm *your name*\" you said surprisingly nicely before you parted hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe another kid lives here now. It's always just been me and my brother Leo\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" You said trying to show that you were intrigued as you tried to figure this girl out. The thought of letting her in your apartment went across your mind when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your thorough planning for world domina-I mean trying to deal with a brand new surrounding with need to wait. You have the opportunity of taking a tour around the new city with a cute girl on your very first day. If you botch this up, you might ruin your one and only chance of a bright beautiful future in your new home.<br>\r\n\"Sure. I hate being cooped up,\" you humbly admitted, \"it's way too quiet!\" 'Quiet' was actually code for 'lonely'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Let's go!\" wasting no time, she grabbed your hand and dragged you off with her! Good thing you locked the front door a microsecond before she grabbed ya.<br>\r\nIt's a good thing one of your nannies made you join a track team when you were younger, cuz Luna was putting your ability to run long distance for a long period of time to the test! Maybe she's on a track team too. Or maybe it's that radiance about her making her move faster than the weak boring girls back at your own home! Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were crowded with tons of people. From what you read in the brochure, New Domino City is a heavily populated city with at least three times as many people living in it than your old city. Despite the heavy population, it was still a city restricted to the high-bracket income populace. Every single person working in this city made at least $100,000 a year. Anything lower probably got separated from the rich folk and are striving to make ends meet in the Satellite, like one of your old nannies. Even though you were born with a silver spoon in your spoon, you learned to treat the struggling lower class with respect. One day, THEY might make it big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed most of the people around you, wearing fancy designer suits, seeing them carry high-tech cellphones, driving cars recently released on the market, walking electronic pets, playing cards games on the street with fancy hand-held holographic simulators! You almost cringed at the huge Summoned Skull that Luna dragged you through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you want a hot dog?\" Luna asked you, pointed over to the hot dog stand nearby.<br>\r\n\"Eh, sure,\" you obliged as you pulled out your wallet cuz you were always taught that the gentleman pays. By then, she had already rushed up to the guy at the stand.<br>\r\n\"Two hot dogs with everything, please!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n\"Arrighty,\" said the hot dog man. You rustled through your wallet as he slapped weiners on the buns, added ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, garlic, tomatoes, bbq sauce, steak sauce, worcestershire sauce, and cheese in record time!<br>\r\n\"Aright! That'll be $40!\" FORTY BUCKS?! $20 for a friggin hotdog! What a royal ripoff! Who in their right mind would pay-<br>\r\n\"Keep the change!\" your jaw literally dropped when Luna slapped a $50 bill on the counter! You practically froze up in absolute shock that she'd not even flinch at the prize and even offered a tip!<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" smiled the shady hot dog con-artist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after a walk down the street, you were STILL in a state of shock! The hot dog wasnt even that good! It tasted like there was dog in it! But you gratefully forced that nasty dog down because your brand new friend had the guts to fork over $20 for it AND a $10 tip! Like your mom used to say, guess you better learn to keep up with the Kardashians... yeah, you hated that show, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the hot dog?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n\"It's uh... er... great,\" you tried to keep a straight face, \"but... isnt $40 a little much to spend on these little guys?\"<br>\r\nLuna just shrugged her shoulders, \"Eh, dont worry. It was just loose change found in my piggy bank.\"<br>\r\n\"L...Loose change?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. My allowance is about $400 a week.\"<br>\r\n\"!!!!\" you almost choked on your hotdog hearing that! Even YOU aint that rich! And your dad is a governor!<br>\r\nThankfully, she didnt notice you nearly choking to death! You silently pounded your chest and coughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*zzzZOOOOOOMMM!!!*<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" you jumped back the split second two big trippy looking motorbikes zipped past you and earth-shattering speed! You blinked for several seconds as your heart raced. The motorbikes just zipped out of nowhere and probably went a few hundred miles over the speed limit! One them came extremely close to hitting you! Luna didnt look phased by that fact nor the fact that you almost got hit by it!<br>\r\n\"D-D-DID YOU SEE THAT?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Wasnt it cool?!\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n\"That was not cool! That bike coulda hit me!\" you were not living this one down, \"did anybody get the license plate number?\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, [Yuri],\" your new friend cooled you down, \"theyre just having a card battle.\"<br>\r\nYou blinked dumbfoundedly, \"...A card battle? At 300 miles an hour? Where people drive?\"<br>\r\nLuna nodded, \"Of course,. It's called a Turbo Duel. You ever heard of it?\" 'Turbo Duel'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head. You recall reading something about Turbo Duels in the brochure. That's what they are? Legal card game drag races?<br>\r\n\"Never... seen one up close,\" you boldly answer. Hopefully you never do. Geez, New Domino City is gonna take a LOT of getting used to. But for the sake of you very first friend in this big super-rich high-tech town, you had to grin and bear in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" you caught your breath, \"where shall we go next?\"</span></div></div>",

Absolutely!\" you tossed your hotdog in the trashcan and beamed with anticipation!<br>\r\nYou gazed up at the ginormous corporate building open to the public, turned into a family-friendly amusement center! KaibaCorp! A corporation that was owned by an old rich snob that got rich by duping another old rich snob! You heard about this place, but never seen it yourself. Home of the world's largest annual Duel Monsters tournament. People come from far and wide to duel and compete, but very few even make it far enough to be recognized. Of course there's also a family fun center, arcade machines, sports center, and even a casino for the older crowd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo big bad Blue Eyes White Dragon statues stood guard in front of the doors. They looked just as scary as you imagined the 'real' ones were! But Luna held your hand and guided you past the big bags and through the metal detectors and into the hall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajority of the hall were Duel Monsters holographic simulators, but without a deck of your own, you resorted to going to the row of few arcade machines they had left. Thankfully, Luna didnt mind playing House of the Undead with you.<br>\r\nLuna spent a huge chunk of her quarters trying to catch up with you cuz she wasnt a great shot with the gun-zapper, but you made it straight to the Emperor and blasted it's ectoplasmic heart out on just one simple quarter. Half of the time, you werent even looking at the screen as you fired and were still a darn good shot!<br>\r\nLucky break, you clearly impressed Luna with your l33t zombie shooting kills!<br>\r\n\"H...How did you do that?\" you asked you.<br>\r\nYou just smiled and shrugged your arms, \"Heh... had a lot practice with a gun. An old nanny of mine, Enrica used to teach me how to fire a real one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sparked her competitive side.<br>\r\n\"Ok! Best 2 out of 3!\" Luna grabbed your hand and pulled you toward the Dance Dance Revelation machine! She put in her quarter... and just halfway through I'm Glad You Came, you were out-stepping her! End Result: C for her... AAA+ for you. \"Another nanny of mine taught me how to dance. Sheila, I think her name was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...th... that was... incredible!\" she was practically exhausted, \"...uh... can we... uh... try something less intense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked, \u201cSure. How bout the crane ga-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY SIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!\u201d just then, you heard a girlish voice shout out and interrupt you! Luna was quick to react to that voice. She turned her head to\u2026 a reflection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! A twin! Another girl who looks EXACTLY like Luna! Same green hair, yellow eyes, face, and outfit, only SHE had a blue shirt and had her hair in a short thick pony-tail! She gave off a radiance similar to Luna.<br>\r\nEven though she staring angrily at you, she looked just as cute as your new friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Twins!! Yeah!!\u2019 you were arm-thrusting in your mind, \u2018I hit the jackpot!\u2019 Today was a GOOD day to be alive!<br>\r\n\u201cLeo, do you mind? I;m kinda busy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I mind, sis!\u201d Leo crossed her arms and glared, \u201cyoure supposed to be at home studying for the big test tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 so are you!\u201d Luna replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI am!\u201d Leo pointed to the duel disk on her arm, \u201cI\u2019m in a study group! But never mind me! Who\u2019s THIS creep youre with?\u201d Creep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to calm and civil to Luna\u2019s twin like a true gentleman. Ladies are present. \u201cAh, so you must be Luna\u2019s sibling, Leo? Short for Leona, perhaps? It\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\nLeo squinted his eyes in a disgusted expression, \u201cI\u2019M A GUY, YOU MORON!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026OH! Dear! One of THOSE twins! Oops!<br>\r\n\u201cOH\u2026 uh heheheh,\u201d you laughed nervous, \u201cwell, this is awkward.\u201d Luna held back the urge to snicker. Leo was in was no laughing mood.<br>\r\nIt was the sister's turn to try to soften the tension.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Leo, this is our new neighbor, [Yuri]. [Yuri], this is my...\" Luna held back another chuckle, \"...BROTHER, Leo.\"<br>\r\n\"Short for Leonidas! Like the Spartan!\" Leo lied, \"...and isnt [Yuri] a girl's name?\"<br>\r\n\"It is?\" you tilted your head curiously, \"anyway, Luna was just showing me around your city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who gave YOU permission to follow my little sister around?!\" as expected, he activates the Overprotective Big Brother card!<br>\r\n\"Oh cool it, Leo!\" said Luna, \"I knocked on his door and offered to show him around.\"<br>\r\n\"You WHAT?!\" her bro went ballistic, \"sis, do you have any idea how dangerous that is?! We're supposed to be together when we talk to strangers!\"<br>\r\n\"Since when was that ever a rule?!\" Luna was flabbergasted, \"wait. Scratch that. Since when were YOU ever the type to 'play it safe'?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great. You just stumbled into a hefty family dispute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I just caught my little sister hanging out with a shady guy I never seen before!\" 'Shady'? Ok, now he's pushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, 'Leonidas',\" you spoke up, raising your finger, \"if youre insinuating that I'm trying to cause trouble with your sister, you are deeply mistaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pst!\" he PSTed in your face and squinted his eyes at you, sizing you up, \"I'm not worried about you causing trouble. Because you aint even in the same league as me and sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about my brother,\" Luna apologized, \"let's just leave, before-\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! Youre not going anywhere! Especially not with HIM!\" <br>\r\n\"Leo...\" Luna's voice got stern.<br>\r\n\"It's alright sis,\" Leo assures her, \"dont worry. I'm just gonna put this loser in his place!\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, I have a red belt...\" you whispered. Thankfully, he wasnt gonna FIGHT you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you gonna be enrolled in Duel Academy as well?\"<br>\r\n\"Er, I think I am.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" he whipped out a deck of cards and brandished his duel disk, \"Then you up for a quick game of Duel Monsters, wimp?\" ...Oh... cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I dont play Duel Monsters,\" you regretfully turned him down, \"my father wont let me buy those cards. He has this strange belief that the cards are somehow haunted and have magical powers... can you believe that silliness?\" You chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah... silly...\" for some reason, Luna was having difficulty keeping a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that didnt matter to Big Bro.<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I'll just let you borrow one of my friends!\"<br>\r\n\"Leo, he's never played before.\"<br>\r\n\"So? If he's enrolled in Duel Academy, he's gonna need to start learning the basics!\" he smirked at you, \"consider this a little lesson in thinking on your feet... and in pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh... he's got a point about Duel Academy. All those rich kids are gonna be learning Duel Monsters inside and out. Youre gonna have to as well, or you just might get your butt handed to you. Plus, you gotta wipe that smirk off Leo's face if you wanna win his respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then again, would it even win Luna's?!</span></div></div>",

He started walking away towards the exit when<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leo!\" he stopped in his tracks when his best friend called him out \"Let's hang out with this guy he seems cool enough\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a intelligent answer Leo just let out a loud growl then ran off, shoving people out of his way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo wait!\" Luna yelled but then saw him dissapear into the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to spilt guys but i got to go after him\" Dex said as you nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok dude go find him\" You said as a second later he ran off in the direction Leo ran off in. At this point you were debating if you should go after him too and find him, god only knows what stupid things he might do when he's in mid rage. Or you could do what you knew moraly was the bad thing, spend more time with Luna under this starlit sky in this metropolis <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be fair you barely knew how to play this game, let alone the cards in this deck so the shot of you winning that were slim to none. Even still he shouldn't be such a jerk about it. You slowly brought yourself up and unstrapped the duel disk and set down on the ground. Like you said you weren't a thief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*your name*\" Luna called out to you but you shrugged her off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bye\" you said without emotion as you left the arcade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you better run!\" Leo shouted out to you as you left. \"Ha man he wasn't to goodd. Still that's what you get if you mess with my sister\" he said happily as Luna stormed over to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Leo hate poop on your parade but\" Dexter said as he pointed to Luna he was standing next to Leo, looking really mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no need to thank me Lun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BIG JERK!\" Luna yelled into his ear catching off guard and almost off balance  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Luna i was just trying to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to protect me!? Leo you can't keep doing this!\" Luna yelled at him as Dexter inched himself away from them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna go home\" he said as he grabbed his duel disk and left. This seemed more of a family issue than a friend issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why cant i? Luna i'm doing this because i care about you and dont want you hurt\" Leo explained as Luna kept her angry expression on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo you can't stop me from getting hurt it's part of life. I don't all over protective of you when you lose a duel or skin your or get a cut, i just help you up and let you live your life\" For first Leo didn't have anything to say. He was like a blank dictonary... without words. Luna took a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to apologize to him for you, i'll see you at home\" She told then left, leaving him with only his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting on your couch, still a little mad at Leo and his cocky attitude. It was truly someone as nice and caring was related to someone who was practically her polar opposite. You yawned out with a stretch, it was definitely time for bed. Today had been... interesting to say the least. Just as you got up and started heading to one of the bedrooms in this place you heard a knock at your door, You could already guess who it was. And that's why you actually went over to your door to answer instead of ignoring it and going to bed. You wanted to apologize to Luna for just storming off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door and saw...</span></div></div>",

You notice there was some sweet going down his face and his hair was really messy and out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* *huff* hey... *your name*\" he said through short intervals as you stood in your doorway deciding whether to be a jerk to him or be nice to him. After all you did like to abide to the golden rule... or at least your nanny Enrica did, she was really religious. So you chose the nicer aproach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to step in. You look a little... worn out\" You told him as he nodded and took his hand off the side of your door and walked past you into your apartment rudely. You just brushed that off and gave him the benefit of the doubt, after all he did look tired \"You want some water or something?\" You asked him as he turned around and nodded frantically at you. Being polite you walked over to your fridge to see if your dad put anything in it. And he did, as a welcoming gift he left you some food and a 12 pack of pop. You opened up the case and grabbed two sodas and brought them over to Leo and gestured him one. He immediately snatched it from your hand and drank it down like a madman. 'geez' you thought to yourself as you opened up yours and took a sip. \"Have a seat Leo\" You told him as you headed to your couch and sat back down and he doing the same as you but taking the left side of the couch, When he finished off his Pop he let a large lip smack followed by a 'ah...' at the end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. But what happened to you? You look like you just ran a mile\" you told him as he straightened out his hair and took a breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually a couple here to beat my sister\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said i ran here so Luna didn't get to you first. Listen i want to apologize for what happened at the arcade\" he said seriously and sincerely. You un slumped yourself and sat up straight as he continued \"I'm sorry i was a jerk and butted in on your time hanging out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology excepted dude\" You said as a thought brisked past your mind. Even though you lost the duel you might've taught this spoiled kid a lesson in respect. Leo let a small smile as he brought his hand to shake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just pretend like it didn't happen ok?\" he asked as you reached his hand and shook it with a grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal Leo\" then you broke hands and both slumped back into your couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Luna will forgive me\" Leo said almost out of nowhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh she will after all you are related\" You reassured him, but not enough though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she's a girl and you know how they are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you lied, just to give him some fake sympathy. You hadn't had that many friends that were girls so you wouldn't know. The only one's that actually came to mind were your nannies and they barely counted. Then Leo got up and stretched a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i better be going\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if she's talking to you tell Luna i said 'I'm sorry i left without talking to you' \" You told him as he looked at you with a nod, a grin, and a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. See ya tomorrow\" he told you as he ran out your door and closed it. That Leo... he really cares for his sister doesn't he? Why though? From what you read siblings are supposed to hate each other so what gives? Maybe it's just a twin thing or something else at hand? Either way you were tired and were about ready to pass out on that couch. </span></div></div>",

My parents are never around. For years, my family were my nannies when my parents worked all the time. My dad brought me here so he could 'spend more time with me',\" you made air quotes, \"but that was just a flat out lie. Nothing could tear him from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked at you with sympathy. \"Oh, I see. I didn't realize. Earlier when you said you hate being cooped, did you mean...?\" You knew where she was going with that sentence, and shook your head. \"I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should probably go see your brother and see if his head's not in the toilet or something,\" you joked.

The movie didnt even try to limit itself, they had people being butchered inch by inch, people burning alive then being slashed in half with a chainsaw, and even someone blowing up in a closed area with other people around.

Basically the ice barrier monsters focus on discarding cards to either destroy your opponets monsters or send them back to their owners hand, while protecting and reviving their allies.\" I nodded understanding while my dad still looked lost. \"So were you a former duelist or something since you seem to know what your talking about?\" The man nodded with a cheesy grin. \"Yeah i used to be a pro but i nearly died in a turbo duel accident and afterwards i counted my good graces and hung my duel disk up but i decided to openy own store to help young up and comers such as yourself.\" I nodded excited now. \"So can you help me build a good ice barrier deck?\" The man nodded once again. \"Dang skippy anything to help another potenial Ice barrier user, after all no one appreciates their value. I'll get you all the ice barrier monsters neccessary for a solid ice barrier deck, and I'll throw in the realm of the sea emperor structure deck and a few different booster packs to help build solid support for your ice barriers. We both nodded as the man who had introduced himself as mako jr, moved around the shop at bkinding speeds gettimg the cards and and packs necessary and even moving to the back of the store to get the ice barrier monsters that were likely once part of his own deck. Finally my dad stepped forward and spoke for the first time. \"This all sounds great and all but how much will this all be?\" Mako looked over and said well normally the total price for all this, not to mention the duel disk would be around 250 bucks but since your a first timer and yur getting so many cards togethor some of which once being my own I'll give you a 50 percent discount and since I've got a good feeling about ya I'll even throw in a extra card that's essentially the ace of the ice barrier archetype and one you wouldn't normally get from a pack or deck considering how rare it is, for free. With that he rung us up the 125 dollars for the cards and bagged them before handing me both a deck box and a ice blue duel disk which i strapped to my arm, and a silver card similar to some that i saw him get from the bags. Looking at it I saw it was named Trishula dragon of the ice barrier and was a syncro dragon monster with 2700 attack, for some reason I felt a weird pull or connection to the card in my hands before blinking and puting the card in my new deck box before thanking Mako. \"No problem\", he said walking us out of the store, \"Any time you need advise, tips or some new cards don't hesitate to drop by.\" We will I said as me and dad said good bye to Mako who waved back before walking back into his store as me and dad went to our car so we could head over o enroll me in duel academy. While my dad was signing te enrollment papers I heard someone call out to me. \"Hey!\" Turning around I saw the person who called me was...</span></div></div>",

Luna giggled at this before her eyes lit up as if she got an idea. \"Hey I know, how about when school lets out you can come over and I'll help you buid your deck?\" I blushed ane grinned at this happy about getting to spend more time with Luna. \"That sounds great!\" Before I could co tinue hoeever my dad came out of the office not noticing Luna there. \"Ok kiddo I got your uniforms here along with your schedule and your clssses start.... tomorrow.\" He stopped as he finally noticed Me and Luna talking before smiling akwardly again. \"Oh I see you already made a little friend thats good and she's a cutie too. Like father like son huh? Both me and Luna blushed in embarrassment while I made a weak attempt to defend myself. \"what. No.  We're not. Shes. I'm... uh... this is Luna.\" I finally gave up. My dad stuck his hand out for hand shale which Luna returned and introducing themselves. Finally I was saved by the bell as the shrill ring made Luna snap out of her embarrassment as she had to go to her last few classes. \"I'll se ya later after achool is over ok (insert name).\" I nodded snapping out of my embarrassment as well. \"Yeah see ya later Luna.\" With that me and dad headed home while grabbing some fast food and watching a movie before he had to head back to the capitol. This time however he left on much better terms with me. And I sat around opening the card packs and structure deck reading all of their effects along with the Ice barrier monsters i got as well.

Losing the duel hurt, but not your pride. It hurt PHYSICALLY. By the end, you were left with sore aching muscles and numerous cuts and bruises. These duel monsters were not holograms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone else ran and fled the academy screaming, you lied there in agony as your pitiful effort to duel some sense into her failed.<br>\r\nAkiza, despite winning the duel with little to no effort, still glared at you. Hate twinkled in her eyes as you stared back at her, trapped in her Black Garden.<br>\r\n\"Ugh... you won, Akiza,\" you groaned as you forced back up. But it wasnt enough to quell Akiza's rage.<br>\r\n\"This duel is not over!\" she spoke coldly, \"you havent begun to feel the pain and despair you and the rest of this trash given me!\"<br>\r\n\"A...Akiza,\" you continued to plead even though you knew it was in vain, \"what has gotten into you? It's me! We're friends, remember?!\"<br>\r\n\"Youre just like all the others,\" your words fell on deaf ears, \"you dont want to be my friend. You never wanted to be my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped out another card and you suddenly got tangled and choked in the middle of several thorny vines! As you struggled effortlessly to break free, Akiza slowly walked toward you.<br>\r\nYou could see tears in her eyes as her cold voice echoed, \"I thought you were different. I thought you'd finally understand me. I was wrong. You think I'm just a big scary monster like all the others.\"<br>\r\n\"Ar...ac.....Ak...iza....\"<br>\r\nThe glare remained as she looked up at you and stared into your soul. The face no longer reminded you of the friend you once knew.  \"Then I'll show you. I'll show you exactly what a big scary monster like me can do! Squirm, [Hunter]! Squirm in my garden of agony until you break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you awaited her wrath, you reflected on the mistakes you made in your life. Specifically, the one that lead you here.<br>\r\nWhat a fool you were. To think you could actually change the heart of a dangerous girl like her. Dad always warned you to stay away from dangerous girls. This is what you get for being the nice guy. Nice guys ALWAYS finish last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis nightmare all started on the day you moved to your brand new city, New Domino City. It wasnt an easy task to leave your old friends, old school, and old favorite hangouts in good ol' Etzville, but ever since your dad got a promotion which required a hefty transfer, you had no choice. The new house took a while to get adjusted to living in, but you managed to make it your own. It was awful lonely what with your dad spending so much time throughout the day at work and mom... well, spending so much time in Heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally acclimating to your new home, it was time to get acclimated to your new school as well. You wanted to settle for a simple unimpressive unastounding public school like the last one you were at, but your pops wanted better for you. He enrolled you into New Domino City's finest and most expensive private schools in the nation: The Duel Academy! <br>\r\nIt wasnt just a high school. It was a higher than high high school! Only the best of the best of the best and the rich kids could so much as dream of studying in such a fancy school like that! It had everything some universities could dream of! It was it's own miniature city! You could practically LIVE in the school. Some students probably do! The only major downside you could find was something about rumors involving a witch, but that's just about as silly as that one rumor about ancient relics that contain spirits of Egyptian deities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly though, you werent exactly an expert in Duel Monsters, a card game which is practically 99.9% of the entire grading system in this school. You were forced to don the uniform of a rookie known as a 'Slifer Red' (despite the fact it's a blue uniform). It looked tacky, it felt uncomfortable, the pants were a little tight around the waist, and no matter how hard you tried, you just couldnt adjust the tie right! In a slight bit of rage, you just jerked the thing tight and almost choked yourself to death! This is gonna be a great first day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the gates, showed the security your student ID and walked through. The Academy was bigger than the flyers advertised. Tons of students of all ages as far as the eye can see. Ages ranged from as young as 10 to as old as what you think is 30! Everyone of them socializing with one another, chatting, laughing, playing, studying, dueling each other with fancy portable virtual projectors... everybody was doing something and with someone.<br>\r\nIt looked as though it wasnt gonna be tough for you to make a friend or two at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you felt left out being the only one by yourself, you spotted someone sitting in one of the row of benches all by her lonesome.<br>\r\nA pretty girl with short red hair with spikey ends and sparkling hazel eyes in a lovely red skirt Academy uniform that if you remember reading from the flyer was a fellow Slifer Red rank. Unlike everybody else here, she didnt look very happy. You noticed a cold lonely look on her face as she looked through her card deck in absolute silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo add heavier emphasis on how lonely she was, nobody else was sitting in ANY of the rows of benches nearby. In fact, you saw a few students that pass by walk completely around the benches with worried looks on their faces. As if theyre trying to avoid her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, that's kinda sad,\" you said to yourself as you felt sorry for the lonely red-head, \"I still got time to spare. Maybe I should go over there and say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped toward the girl... then suddenly stopped when you felt something stop you. You didnt know what it was, but it seemed hostile. Maybe it was some kind of mental warning or something. Premonition?<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" you thought about it. You couldnt explain the sudden bad feeling, but for some reason you couldnt just shrug it off either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's just your imagination. Or maybe it's something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, you didnt wanna be one of the rare lonely students in Duel Academy and youre pretty sure neither did her. You took a deep breath and walked toward the red-haired girl, ready to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone came at you at super turbo hyper alpha speed and knock you almost a few yards away! The girl barely heard your yipe, but probably didnt see where it came from. <br>\r\nAs for you, when the dust cleared, you realized somebody just performed a spear on you! You thought this was a school for card games, not professional wrestling! You were ready to bite the head of the jerk that just tackled you, but noticed he was giving you quite a terrified look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Are you out of your mind?!\" snapped the black haired student with a cap, tiny chin goatee and gray eyes in a Slifer Red blue uniform, \"you got a death wish or something? Believe me, life's hard, but it aint worth it!\"<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you-\" you pause in mid-sentence as realizing the guy with a cap's STILL on top of you, \"get off me!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he got off you and helped you up, \"sorry about that. But it was for your own good. You coulda got hurt really bad.\"<br>\r\nFitting he says that while your back is aching! \"Erg... I AM hurting really bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord, Junpei! What the flying hell is wrong with you?!\" suddenly another student came stomping toward the two of you who looked just as outraged as you do! A slightly taller long black haired pony tailed guy with a neatly designed apache necklace and little white feathered earrings, \"you coulda snapped that poor guy's spine doing a reckless stunt like that!\" Whoever he is, you appreciate HIS concern! \"I'm really sorry about my friend. Are you ok?\"<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, the other guy spoke up, \"Ok, ok. MAYBE I overdid it a little. But it was all I could think of doing cuz he was getting really really close to... her!\"<br>\r\nThe new guy raised his eyebrow, \"...Her?\" Junpei pointed to that red haired girl you were about to say hi to and his friend's eyes widened with almost as much fear as Mr. Tackles! He ushered his head toward, signaling to follow.<br>\r\n\"Dont give her any eye contact,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's up with these two? Something they dont like about that girl you were trying to get friendly with?<br>\r\n\"Will somebody care to tell me what's going o-\"<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" the guy with a cap shushed you, \"not so loud. If she finds we're talking about her, she might curse us or something!\"<br>\r\n\"Who?\" you whispered.<br>\r\n\"You dont know?\" the long-haired guy looked at you oddly, \"you MUST be new to this school. I'm Lupe, by the way. The guy who saved your life earlier is Junpei.\" Saved your life?!<br>\r\n\"Sup?\" Junpei smiled.<br>\r\nYou pointed to yourself and made the introduction quick, \"[Hunter]. Now tell me what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl you were getting close to,\" Lupe explained, \"bad things have been happening around her.\" This wasnt gonna end well.<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes suspiciously, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"There's something about her,\" Junpei joined in, \"I know it sounds hard to believe, but I think she's got like magic powers or something!\"<br>\r\n\"Seems that way,\" Lupe agreed, \"everyone that she duels either gets in a bad accident or suddenly disappears. It's happened with a lot of students lately.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Junpei remarked, \"they say when she duels, the monsters come to life. When they attack, they'll actually hurt you!\"<br>\r\n\"That's not counting sudden fires, blackouts, and random explosions that occurred since she enrolled at this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. What kind of sick joke are these guys playing?! \"Youre joking, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, this isnt a joke!\" Junpei sounded dead serious, \"I've seen it happen! I knew this one guy who was a few years my senior, he was a straight-A Obelisk Blue, on the honor role and had an early scholarship offer from a fancy university... then he dueled her and almost got eaten alive by her Black Rose Dragon card!\" What in all that is- \"The next day, he suddenly dropped out of school and I never heard from him since!\" 'That's ridiculous!' you think to yourself. But it wasnt over.<br>\r\n\"I heard that some of the teachers flat out refused to take her in their classes because theyre terrified of her,\" Lupe noted, \"even her parents are scared of her.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard that sometimes she hangs out at this school around midnight and the security dont do anything cuz theyre afraid to get close to her.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard that that she grows a garden of white roses on her front lawn... and she paints them red by feeding them with human blood.\" Ok, this was getting too much for you!<br>\r\n\"I heard that if you stick one of her cards in your butt, you'll turn into a flower!\" you add sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them actually turned their heads to you and went, \"REALLY?!\" in unison!<br>\r\n\"No, you idiots!\" you almost shout, \"youre seriously gonna believe every little thing you hear? Arent you guys a little old for childish rumors like that?!\"<br>\r\n\"You can ask anybody else in this school, [Hunter],\" Lupe told you, \"if you even mention the name 'Akiza' to anybody, theyre gonna jump out of their skin!\"<br>\r\nSo you got her name. \"Akiza?\"<br>\r\n\"SHH!\" both of them shush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know ya mean well, [Hunter],\" Junpei said, \"but she's known as the Black Witch of Duelist Academy for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black... Witch...?\" the name rings a bell. Specifically the rumor about a witch. You took a look back at Akiza, but notice she was already gone. You sighed hard. Does she really have THIS bad a rep in this school? You felt sorry for her, but at the same time, you got a bit concerned. You know youre supposed to ignore silly rumors and let the bs blow in the breeze, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we better start heading to class,\" Junpei interrupted your train of thought, \"the bell's gonna ring pretty soon.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, c'mon [Hunter],\" Lupe told you, \"the building for the Slifer Red classes are this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and started to follow... when you spotted a little card lying on the bench. Maybe that red haired girl left it behind?<br>\r\nSince youre a witness, you'd hate to just walk away and pretend you didnt see it. You thought about picking it up and rightfully returning it to it's rightful owner. That's always a surefire way to win points with a girl!<br>\r\nYou stepped toward the bench, but then that bad feeling came back! It suddenly made you think about all that gobbledegook Lupe and Junpei were talking about. If Akiza is as dangerous as those two make her sound, do you dare touch any of her belongings? For all you know, THEY could be cursed!<br>\r\n...Urgh... are you actually considering believing that crap?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey [Hunter]!\" Junpei shouted, \"ya coming or not?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! I'm coming!\" you shout back as you thought. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

So you picked it and give it to her in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupe and Junpei were just a few seconds in the room before you were. When you opened the door you saw Akiza on the left side in the third row. Around her was nobody. Either they sat on the right side or at least 2 rows away from her. You felt very sorry for her.<br>\r\nJunpei was waving at you to sit on the chair next to him but instead you took a place next to Akiza. The whole class frowned. Even the Professor. The bad feeling you had 10 minutes ago came back and was worse then before. You could hardly stand it.<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name is [Hunter].\" You said to Akiza. No response. \"Oh look I've found one of your cards.\" You took the Black Rose Dragon out of your pocket and laid it on the table. First Akiza looked shocked. Whether it was because of the realization she had lost it or that you've brought it back to her you don't know. \"Hi... my name's Akiza and... thank you...\" \"No problem.\" You said with a smile and the bad feeling was decreasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the lesson you couldn't concentrate very well, cause you had to look at her all the time. Her pretty face, her beautiful hair and her damn hot body...you couldn't think of anything else until she saw you staring. \"Is something with my face?\" she said with an angry voice. \"Oh no, I didn't want to offend you. You're just..\" \"WHAT?\"  \"Beautiful...\"<br>\r\nThere was a long and awkward silence. The bell rang and the lesson ended. When you got your books you saw no one getting up. They waited until Akiza left. That's cruel you thought to yourself. Well let's get asking her for lunch. You were about to follow her when Junpei and Lupe held you back. \"What was that about?\" Lupe asked. \"Nothing. Just took a place and gave a card back.\" You answered. Then Junpei fell in: \"I admit you're brave but you hadn't to take it that far.\" \"What is with you guys. This was no proof. I...uhm...like her and i don't like how you treat her. That's just disgusting.\" You said really upset. \"Oh this was unexpected due to  everybody is feared of her\", Lupe said, \"well then when you want to put your life on the line please don't expect us to stand behind you. Man i like you but that's too risky for me. When you wanna hang out with us, no problem but not when you're with her.\"<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it...but ok. We'll see after break.\" you said. \"Where do you go?\" Junpei asked. \"Use your sawy!\" you answered with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell first of all you were searching for the rest room and right after that you ran along the hallway down to where you've found Akiza's Dragon. She was sitting there with a thoughtful face. You approached her and instantly and felt again this feeling that you're not welcome. When she noticed you, the bad feeling vanished. She even had a little smile on her face. \"Umm....hi Akiza.\" \"Hey [Hunter].\" \"Do you want... to have lunch together with me today?\" \"Well...yes.\" \"Ok, great! Now let's get to class.\"<br>\r\nOn your way she asked you, why you don't name her a which and leave her alone like everyone. You said, that you don't see a which, you see a beautiful which has obviously problems with the other students. You want to help her. After the lesson you two went to the cafeteria. Today was German's Day. So there were Schnitzel and Bratwurst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to have a bratwurst, cuz it looked ever so much like a hotdog. And you LOVE hotdogs. Combine it with the sausagey flavor that a bratwurst offers and it'd be the best damn hot dog you've ever eaten. Of course, a bit of ketchup, mustard, and relish also helps bring out the natural flavor. You also had a slice of strudel because... that's the only German desert I know off the top of my head at the moment without looking it up. I woulda added Kinder beer, but the Duel Academy has zero tolerance for beer of ANY kind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza for some reason didnt have anything. Her plate was empty and she didnt bother to go up and get something. She just stared into space sipping her coke as you ate your bratwurst.<br>\r\n\"You... youre not getting anything?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"I'm a vegetarian,\" she answered, \"and I dont trust the quality of the 'vegetarian' menu they serve here.\" You dont know about her, but they at least know how to cut a decent bratwurst. Besides, doesnt Coke contain an animal fat?<br>\r\n\"Well, arent you gonna eat something?\" you asked, \"at least a power bar or something to keep you from starving. We still got a half a day of class left.\"<br>\r\nBut Akiza sweated no hunger. \"I'll find something to eat after school. Like I always do.\"<br>\r\nYou shrugged your arms and finished eating. You couldnt force her to do anything... besides, she's probably used to it. She's also probably used to the scared stares the two of you were getting from several other students sitting around you. Akiza just sipped her coke casually and unbothered, but you were starting to get annoyed by it. You knew WHY they were staring. And it was not cool. Not cool at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore them,\" Akiza whispered, as if sensing you were about to do something you'd regret, \"they'll only get more paranoid if you respond to them.\"<br>\r\n\"But it's not right the way they-\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\" she interrupted, \"you'll only make it worse if you react.\" You noticed her blankly staring the direction of two girls standing by the doorway to the cafeteria in orange sashes around her arms. You could feel an aura of hostility between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better go before they get suspicious,\" she picked up her tray and got out of her seat.<br>\r\n\"W-wait, why-\"<br>\r\n\"Pretend you dont know me,\" she whispers, \"maybe we can talk again, later.\"<br>\r\n\"But... I...\" and just like that, the Witch of Duel Academy was gone. It was kinda depressing to see her go so abruptly after managing to bond with her so well. But she probably had her reasons. She had the academy's scarlet letter after all. But you quickly lose your appetite and decide you throw away your bratwurst after it was only 2 or 3 bites away from finished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dump out your leftover food in the trashcan and put the tray on top of it before heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" but just when you got through the doorway, you were stopped by one of the girls with orange sashes. Facing you was a black haired girl who was wearing a kabuki mask depicting a sad maiden's face and wielding a rather big kendo stick. Despite the mask covering her face, you could sense the eyes behind it gazing deep into yours with intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes?\" you asked as the other girl in the orange sash closed up behind you. A very tall girl with white hair, pale skin and freckles, purple eyes, and a rather er... fit body that looked like she's been to the gym quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could just take a moment of your time,\" the girl in the mask spoke, \"we'd like to ask you a few questions.\" You didnt like the way that sounded. You suspected something bad was up. And even the big girl behind you getting too close for comfort amplified it!<br>\r\nStill, you kept your cool and asked, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked girl put a hand to her chin, \"We couldnt help but notice that girl you were sitting awfully close with...\" You didnt like how she added 'awfully' like it was a bad thing! \"You wouldnt happen to know who that girl is, do you?\" That is an odd question.<br>\r\n\"Why? What's it to you?\" you got suspicious yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami ask you simple question,\" the girl behind you replied in a thick accent that was probably SUITABLE for German's Day, \"you just give her simple answer, ja?\"<br>\r\n\"I dont really know what youre asking of me,\" you replied to her, \"is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"That might depend, \" the masked girl that you assumed is named 'Nami' answered, \"but like Swallow said, it was a simple question I asked. Do you have a problem answering it?\" What is this, an interrogation?!<br>\r\n\"Will you please let me go?\"<br>\r\n\"Vhy arent you answering question?\" the thick accented Swallow leaned down at you, \"you hiding somezhing?\" Your eyebrow twitched when you saw Nami grip the handle of her kendo stick a little harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Hunter]! There ya are, I been looking all over for ya!\" suddenly, you hear Junpei shouted over at you as he rushes over to you and the 'hall monitors' \"geez, I thought we were gonna sit together! You couldnt wait another minute for me to make a pit stop?\" As you wondered what he was doing, he drew the attention of Nami and Swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know this boy, Junpei?\" Nami questioned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, he's a new kid, I thought I'd just show him around, give him the proper Duelist Academy welcome!\" he then pretended to look surprised, \"uh... what's up with you two? Did he do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"We seen him sitting together with... that girl,\" said the girl in the mask.<br>\r\n\"What girl?\" Junpei played dumb.<br>\r\nSwallow stared at him coldly and answered, \"You know who zat girl is. Does HE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunpei squinted his eyes, looking like he was thinking hard, then opened them with a feign surprise, \"Oh! OH! Ohhh... THAT girl! Oh man, [Hunter] was hanging out with her?! Dude, you ok? You didnt get poisoned or anything did ya?!\"<br>\r\nYou gave him a weird look but before you could answer, Nami spoke up.<br>\r\n\"So he doesnt know about her?\" she tilted her head.<br>\r\nJunpei shook his, \"Of course not! He's only been at this school for like a few hours! I havent gotten a chance to tell him about... the Witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should,\" Nami warned him, \"you wouldnt want your new friend messing around with matters that could get him hurt.\" Was that a threat?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Absolutely, Nami!\" Junpei nodded hard and grabbed your arm, \"I'm gonna tell him right away! C'mon, [Hunter]! We dont wanna be late for class!\" And he dragged you away from the two were clearly staring your way until you left their field of vision.<br>\r\n\"Dude! What is the matter with you?!\" Junpei whispered to you, \"are you trying to fill a death-defying quota or something?!\"<br>\r\nYou groaned, \"What is it now, Junpei?! I'm getting kinda sick of this.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm getting kinda sick of dragging your butt out of the fire!\" he told you, \"what did I just get through telling you earlier? EVERYBODY stays away from the Black Witch.\"<br>\r\n\"Not this again...\"<br>\r\n\"Not just because she's cursed,\" Junpei explained, \"to the Student Council, she's an outlaw. They want nothing less than to destroy her. To see somebody just hanging around with her all buddy-buddy like nothing's wrong makes them suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your aching ahead, \"Youre kidding right? Am I seriously gonna have to put up with this ALL the time just cuz I wanna make friends with her?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I think that's the least you gotta worry about,\" Junpei said, \"the worst would be being EATEN BY HER BLACK ROSE DRAGON!\"<br>\r\nMan, was that really ticking you off to the highest degree. Then again, Akiza herself did tell you to pretend you didnt know her. You cant help but wonder if you've mightve put a scarlet letter on yourself just for hanging around Akiza last class! Once again, the bad feeling returned... as if part of you told you the school's fear for her was justified, even though the rest of you told it to shut up! Perhaps you will have to put up with this all the time if you wanna land the Duel Academy Black Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject,  it wasnt long before the bell rang and Junpei dragged you toward your next class.<br>\r\nWhat's your next class?</span></div></div>",

Recently, you discovered that the people of this academy were invading the XYZ dimension and turning innocent civilians into cards. Thus, starting the war. You became so furious about it that you felt like everything you were trained here for was all a lie. It was then that you decided to leave the Fusion dimension while you still can. On the way out of there, you bumped into someone you know very well. Her name is Serena. You two first met when you first came to the academy. Although, it wasn't goos meeting as she knocked you into next week that time. However, you dueled against her and you grown to fall in love with her. Just seeing her, normally, makes you feel a warm feeling in your heart. However, seeing her in this situation made you a bit uneasy. When you leave the academy, you'll be leaving her too. That's the hardest part of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, Shawn?\" Serena asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving Duel Academy.\" You answered and it shocked Serena right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like for good?

Not a soldier for an unjust war. Hearing the other students laughing about what they did to those people just made me sick to my stomach and I'm not gonna sit around to do nothing about it.\" You said with hate in your voice while shaking with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that you're angry, but if the Professor finds out that you're missing, you'll be hunted down.\" Serena said hoping that will reconsider your departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take my chances.

You won't like it.\" You said with malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you have any chance of driving us away.\" The one with the blue gem teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! You asked for this!\" You said as you activated your duel disk and the Obelisk Force followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObelisk Force: 4000 x3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be fun. My move! I summon my Ancient Gear Hunting Hound!\" The blue gem member said as a mechanical hound appeared on to the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAGHH: 1000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When this monster is normal summoned, you take 600 points of damage.\" The member said as the metal hound attacks you with a flamethrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place one card face down and I end my turn.\" He said as he set his card down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn then. Draw! I summon my own Ancient Gear Hunting Hound. And just like before, you take another 600 points of damage.\" The yellow gem one said as his metal hound showed up before going to bite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 2800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set two cards face down before finishing my turn.\" The yellow gem member said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my turn begins! Draw!\" The red gem member said as he liked what he just drew. \"Perfect. I activate the spell card, Polymerization! I fuse my friend's Hunting Hounds with the one in my hand along with my Ancient Gear Wyvern in order to bring the machine of demolition. Come forth, Chaos Ancient Gear Giant!\" The red gem one said as the four gear monsters became one gigantic dark blue metal beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAGG: 4500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll play the spell card, Ancient Gear Workshop. This will allow me to get back an Ancient Gear monster back into my hand. And guess who it is? It's your best friend, Ancient Gear Hunting Hound! I'll normal summon him to inflict you with another 600 life points.\" The red gem Obelisk Force member said when his hound burned your life points down more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll play the spell card, Ancient Gear Explosive! By sacrificing my hound, you'll be taking damage equal to half of it's original attack points.\" The red gem member said as his hound was blown to bits and crippled you down.even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that, my turn's over. You might as surrender now and you'll be spared from a grear punishment for your betrayal, Shawn.\" The Obelisk Force member said as he and his comrades laughed evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they failed to realise is that you've been taking in their attacks well for they haven't made you feel squeamish at all. That's when you start to feel a great rage building inside of you and you were glowing a blue aura surrounding your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrunder, huh? Maybe you guys should take your own advice!\" You yelled as a dragon like figure came behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obelisk Force saw it and they feel like trembling in their feet right now. What is this power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn now! I draw!\" You said as you picked up your card from your deck. \"I activate the spell card, Cards of Consonance. By sending away a Dragon-Type tuner monster with 1000 or less attack points from my hand to the graveyard, I get to draw two cards from my deck.\" You said as you send on card away to get two more. \"Guess what? Since the monster I send away was The White Stone of Legend, I get to add my favorite monster from my deck to my hand. My Blue-Eyes White Dragon.\" You said as you show your best monster that causes the Obelisk Force to gasp in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue-Eyes?! That monster hasn't been shown for years! Where did you get that?\" The blue gem Obelisk Force member asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pointless to ask that question now. Next, I reveal to you the Blue-Eyes I just added so that I can special summon this. Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon!\" You said a different version of your ace monster arises to reveal itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEAWD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Shawn. Very good, indeed. It's a shame that it's 1500 points weaker than our giant.\" The Obelisk Force member with the red gem laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot about one thing back at the academy. Attack points aren't everything. Allow me to show you. I activate my Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon's ability. At the cost of not attacking this turn, he gets to destroy your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" The Obelisk Force gasped together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon unleashes a blue lightning attack on the mechanical goliath before it went down like scrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I play the spell, Polymerization. This will let me fuse my Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon with the other two Blue-Eyes in my hand. Now, show yourself! Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon!\" You said as a three-headed dragon decends from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEUD: 4500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to finish this. I activate the spell, Neutron Blast! This will allow my Fusion Summoned Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to attack you bastards three times! Plus, when he does attack, you can't activate any cards or effects until the end of each Damage Step.\" You said with a look of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Tbe Obelisk Force gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over. Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon! Finish all three of them off!\" You commaded as your three-headed dragon blast all three of the members at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObelisk Force: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's done, let's see how being a card would look like on you.\" You said as you set them up for their end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! We surrender! Please! Have mercy!\" The Obelisk Force members begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you shown these people any mercy?! I think not! So now, you'll know what true suffering is. Goodbye and good riddance!\" You said as you pushed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only turned two of them into cards and you sparred the last one. He seemed to be confused, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why did you spare me?\" The last remaining Obelisk Force member asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want you to give these to the Professor and give him this message too. Tell him that I'll be back to Duel Academy one day and that this will be his fate. Is that understood?\" You asked not so nicely as you slammed the cards into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Ye-Yes. I understood, clearly.\" The last member said with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, get out of here before I change my mind.\" You said before the Obelisk Force member runs away back to Duel Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dusted yourself off before you moved on in the XYZ Dimension. As you walked, you think back on how Serena is doing. How so you wish to have her next to you right now. But, you know that having her not to come will protect her.

It was still Yuya's turn and you look like you can handle his turn fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have got out your Blue-Eyes, Shawn, but it's going to vanish quicker than you can blink. Now, Odd-Eyes. Take out his Blue-Eyes White Dragon!\" Yuya commanded as Odd-Eyes goes in for the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do that? Your dragon's weaker than mine.\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I can now activate Drummerilla's effect. Whenever an attack is declared, one of my monsters will gain 600 attack points until the end of the Battle Phase.\" Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOEPD: 2500 - 3100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, he's strong enough to destroy my Blue-Eyes!\" You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, Odd-Eyes! Spiral Flame Strike!\" Yuya said as his dragon destroyed yours. \"That's not all. Whenever he attacks a monster, the Battle damage is doubled. Reaction Force!\" Yuya said as Odd-Eyes puts some more effort in his attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 4000 - 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end with a card face down. Your turn.\" Yuya said as he sets his card down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOEPD: 3100 - 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the best you got? Please. I draw!\" You said as you draw your next card. \"I activate the spell card, Trade-In. Now, by sending a Level 8 monster from my hand to the graveyard, I can draw two cards.\" You said as you send a card away from your hand to draw two extra ones. \"Next, I'll play Cards of Consonance. By sending away a Dragon-Type tuner monster with 1000 or less attack points from my hand to the graveyard, I can draw two more cards from my deck.\" You said as you send away another card from your hand to draw another two cards. \"By the way, since the monster I sent to my graveyard was The White Stone of Legend, it's effect will allow me to get this monster from my deck to my hand. Wanna guess what it is? Time's up!\" You said as you revealed your card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Blue-Eyes White Dragon?! Oh man!\" Yuya gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll play my trap card, Call of the Haunted. This will bring back the monster I sent away using Trade-In. Dragon Spirit of White!\" You said as a shiny spiritual dragon appeared before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDSoW: 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, since he was summoned to the field, he gets to banish one of you spell or trap cards.\" You said as your dragon uses it's energy to make Yuya's card disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Yuya gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more. Since you control a monster, I can sacrifice him to summon my Blue-Eyes to the field!\" You said as your ace has returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! Not again!\" Sawatari yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the beginning! Next, I'll activate the spell card, Return of the Dragon Lords! This will bring back another Dragon-Type monster from my graveyard as long as it's Level is either 7 or 8. So, let's bring back the Blue-Eyes you destroyed last turn.\" You said as your destroyed dragon returns from the graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, he's got two of them?!\" Yuya said feeling a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're about to become one! By sending my two Blue-Eyes White Dragons to the graveyard, I can use them to perform a Contact Fusion.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just say Contact Fusion?!\" Shun asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's like the most advanced form of fusion there is! How does he know that?!\" Sawatari wondered as your dragons started to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons of legend, allow your shining ancient energies to unite and become the unstoppable two-headed beast of dominating power! Fusion Summon! Come forth! Level 10! Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon!\" You chanted as a two-headed white dragon shows itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBETBD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" Yuya gasped with his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. Now, Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon! Send his Drummerilla back to the zoo.\" You commanded as your two-headed Blue-Eyes destroyed Yuya's monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya: 4000 - 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And guess what? My Twin Burst Dragon's ability allows him attack two monsters in this one battle.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two monsters?!\" Yuya gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go take out his Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" You commanded as your dragon uses it's energy to obliterate Yuya's ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya: 2600 - 2100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good enough for now. I'll end with this.\" You said as you set your card down. \"You better hope that you get something good this turn or else it'll be your last.\" You said as you know that Yuya's in a bad spot right now.</span></div></div>",

Care to show me what else you have in store for me?\u201d Sora tease before noticing you acting strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked like you\u2019re about to rain fire on him by just looking at him. It made Sora sweat a bit before you make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI draw. I activate the spell card, Card of Santity! Now, we each get to draw until we\u2019re each drawing six. Then I\u2019ll play spellbook in the pot. Now, we each get to draw three cards. Now, I\u2019ll use my second Dark Fusion to fuse my Evil Hero Malicious Edge with my Great Majiu Garzet to create your end. Devilish beings of darkness, let your raging ambitions swallow you into a relentless terror! Fusion summon! Arise! Level 8! Evil Hero Malicious Fiend!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil Hero Malicious Fiend: 3500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext I\u2019ll use Burial From A Different Dimension to send your Frightfurs back into your graveyard.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Why would you want to do that?\u201d Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to use De-Fusion to split your Chimera back into the pieces you used to summon it.\u201d You said splitting his monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig deal. I can always fuse them back.\u201d Sora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. First, I\u2019m activating the trap, Jar of Advrice. Now, I shuffle five cards back into my deck and draw a new one. Now, for the beast that\u2019ll be your undoing. This monster can be summoned by tributing three monsters from any side of the field.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny side?!\u201d Sora said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get that part, but what kind of monster requires three?\u201d Gong wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re about to find out.\u201d Shun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sacrifice your three monsters in order to summon this monster to your side of the field. The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode!\u201d You said as the sky grew dark and filled with lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a glowing golden sphere descending from the clouds and everyone seems to be in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode: 0 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! What is that?!\u201d Shingo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d Shun said looking at the sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena then sensed that there\u2019s a connection between you and that sphere. Like it\u2019s responsible for your transformation. Whatever the case, this duel is about to go out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow with that out of the way, attack Infernal Sniper, Malicious Fiend!\u201d You said as you actually destroyed your own monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just took out his own monster!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that he doesn\u2019t like it under Sora\u2019s control anymore.\u201d Shun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll end with these two.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy move now! Draw! Hah! Guess what? I activate the spell card, Polymerzation! And I\u2019ll fuse my Edge Imp Chain and Flufful Mouse from my hand. Meet the most scary and soft beast that terrorized the whole sea. Fusion summon! Level 8! Frightfur Kraken!\u201d Sora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightfur Kraken: 2200  ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext I\u2019ll use it\u2019s ability to send your Malicious Fiend to the graveyard!\u201d Sora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless I activate the trap, Fiendish Chain! Now, not only is your monster\u2019s effects are negated, but it also can\u2019t attack.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Too bad. I\u2019ll end with this. But, even though you have the upper hand right now, you\u2019re still that same outsider before we met. I mean, you have never shown any backbone back at academia and that\u2019s just a shame. I don\u2019t understand why Serena over here would-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sora let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said SHUT UP!\u201d You yelled as a huge amount of energy exploded from you that scared everyone, including Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the sphere started to move towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Why\u2019s that sphere moving?\u201d Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, during the end phase of the player who controls this sphere, it switches to a new one. Now, it\u2019s mine! Draw! I play my face down, Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy that set card. Now, with the sphere\u2019s other ability, by sending it to the graveyard, I unlock the seal!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?!\u201d Sora gasped with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Elsewhere)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir! We\u2019ve detected a huge amount of unkown energy!\u201d A man said to the white-haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnknown energy? Put it on feed.\u201d The white haired man ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feed came on and what they see put the man known as Reiji in complete awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt,It can\u2019t be!\u201d Reiji gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be what, sir?\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a team down there now!\u201d Reiji ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The man said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fusion dimension)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor, sir? You might want to see this.\u201d A duel soldier said showing him what\u2019s going on in your duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, after all these years, it finally happens.\u201d Leo said looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back at your duel)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat beast of the sky, please hear my cry! Transform thyself from orb of light and bring me victory in this fight! Envelope the desserts with your glow and cast your rage upon thy foe! Unlock your powers from deep within so that together we may win! Appear in this battle when I call your name! WINGED DRAGON OF RA!\u201d You chanted as your eyes turned completely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golden dragon soon show itself with it\u2019s mighty roar and it left everyone in complete shock to see such a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat-what does he call that thing?\u201d Shingo asked with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinged Dragon of Ra? I\u2019ve read legends about this thing. But, I never thought I see it for real.\u201d Shun said wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nuts!\u201d Gong said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn.\u201d Serena said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the sphere\u2019s other ability, Ra\u2019s power increases to 4000.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Winged Dragon of Ra: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I\u2019m really going to lose?\u201d Sora said in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, Malicious Fiend! Attack his Kraken!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora then screamed in pain for the damage felt real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSora!\u201d Yuya called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say we get out of here like now!\u201d Shingo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, we cant just leave them like this!\u201d Yuya protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do! This duel is already getting out of hand! We need to escape!\u201d Shun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn. Please.\u201d Serena said looking at the man who she loves so much is going on a dueling rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSora.

Just like back home\", Serena said. \"No way, Sora would never do that; he's our friend!\", Yuya said. \"Shawn has known Sora longer than any of you have, trust me.

Soras not messing around!\", Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I play card of sanctity. We both til we hold six cards. Now I activate Frightfur sanctuary, sending 1 card in my hand and 2 from the extra deck to the graveyard; to treat all monsters I control as frightfurs. I use Frightfur fusion, banishing edge imp chain and fluffal bear.

Its like Shawn isn't even human\", Sora muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sacrifice my sniper, to summon malicious edge with its effect. Now, by discarding a card; I can activate, Super Polymerization! This lets me fusion summon using any monsters on the field!\", you say. \"No way!\", Sora said. \"Seriously!?\", yuya asked. \"Shawn, what have you become?\", Serena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse my edge, with your Leo.

Just trying to avoid your pursuers, and dodge any obstacles in your way. Unfortunately, you both ran into each other on a deserted street; literally. \"Ow!

You're surrounded\", said a voice. \"Just who are you guys\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our names are..\"</span></div></div>",

Whenever Meteor Black Comet Dragon is fusion summoned, I can send a Red-Eyes monster from my hand or deck to the graveyard to inflict you damage equal to half of it\u2019s attack points. So, I send Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon to the graveyard to inflict you 1400 points of damage.\u201d You said as you damaged Yuya a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya: 4000 - 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily for you, I can\u2019t summon any more monsters on the turn I use Red-Eyes Fusion. But, it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m still going to win in this one turn. Now, attack Yuya\u2019s Performapal Trampolynx! Dark Comet Flare!\u201d You commanded to go for the One Turn Kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so! I activate the trap card Command Performance! Since I control a Performapal monster, your Dragon is about to go into defense mode and it won\u2019t be able to change battle positions until the end of the next turn.\u201d Yuya countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeteor Black Comet Dragon: 2000 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! He managed to withstand that. Guess this guy is more skilled then I thought.\u201d Serena thought as she looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really thought I had there for a second. But, I\u2019ll just end my turn with a face down. Let\u2019s see what else you have in store for me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Trust me. This next move will be worth watching.

What happened?!\u201d Yuto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI use this trap card. It\u2019s called Draining Shield! Not only is your attack negated, but I also gain life points equal to it\u2019s attack points.

I place one card down and end.\u201d Yuto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy move now. So look out! First, I play Pot of Greed. I draw two more cards. Next, I play Ancient Rules. I can now special summon a level 5 or higher normal monster from my hand. So, rise forth Dark Magician!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician: 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext I play Dark Magic Attack! Since Dark Magician is on my field, he can destroy all of your spell and trap cards in your field. Then I\u2019ll play Magic Formula. This will give Dark Magician a 700 point power up.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician: 2500 - 3200 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt still poses no threat to my dragon.\u201d Yuto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps. But, your friend here isn\u2019t going to be as lucky as you. Attack Revolution Falcon with Dark Magic Attack!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician: 3200 - 0 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just happened?!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Falcon\u2019s other ability.

I use the spell Dedication Through Light and Darkness to remove Dark Magician and summon Dark Magician of Chaos to the field.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician of Chaos: 2600 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when Magic Formula goes to the grave, I gain 1000 life points.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 6800 - 7800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll set two cards down and that\u2019ll end my turn.

Now, Mahad! Attack Final Fortess Falcon! I know that he\u2019s weaker.

This will give my Odd-Eyes an extra 600 attack points until the end of the Battle Phase.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon: 3100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!\u201d You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all. Whenever Odd-Eyes attacks a level 5 or higher monster, the battle damage is doubled. Reaction Force!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? I play the action spell, Miracle! My monster is safe from your attack and I take half the damage.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if my Stargazer Magician has anything to say about it. With his pendulum ability, he can stop any spell from being played when a pendulum monster attacks.\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with that gone, take your turn to attack, Drummerilla.\u201d Yuya commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShawn! Are you okay?\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good. Thanks.\u201d You said while getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI end my turn. I know you can step up, Shawn. So, don\u2019t give in now!\u201d Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. Here goes! First, I\u2019ll play Pot of Greed to draw two cards! Next, since you control a monster and I don\u2019t, I can special summon Cyber Dragon to the field.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Dragon: 2100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, I\u2019ll normal summon Cyber Dragon Zwei to the field as well.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Dragon Zwei: 1500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by revealing a spell card from my hand, I can treat him as just Cyber Dragon. And the one I will show is Cybernetic Fusion Support, which I will play now. Now, by banishing my monsters from anywhere other than my deck, I can create a Machine-type fusion monster. So, I\u2019ll banish and fuse Cyber Dragon Zwei and two Cyber Dragons together.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother fusion summon?\u201d Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy combining these three mechanical creatures together, they\u2019ll create a three-headed weapon of mass destruction! Fusion summon! Level 10! Cyber End Dragon!\u201d You chanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber End Dragon: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? 4000 attack points?\u201d Yuya gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re in for a world of hurt, Yuya.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get started. Attack his Drummerilla now!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a big hit.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll play Pot of Acquisitiveness! I shuffle my three banished monsters back into my deck and draw a new card. That\u2019ll do it for now.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Time to make a comeback!\u201d Yuya said as he draws.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The duel for the Regional Championship was about to come to a close.  With less than a thousand life-points remaining on both sides, your 2400 Attack point Jinzo alone facing down your opponent Ali's Great Beast Angra Mainyu with his 2800 Attack points, you were running out of exits. Your trump card, Dark Magician, had already taken a swan dive early and your hand is full of spell cards that woulda came in real handy for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something deep down was telling you not to give up. Something deep down was telling you to wipe that prideful smirk off Ali's face. Despite losing your best cards, that spark of hope and willpower was still fighting strong. You didnt know what card you had left that could save you, but you put your faith in that spark (or as some refer to as 'The Heart of The Cards') and draw your next card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...WHAT?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed down in disbelief at the card you just drawn. The Dark Magician Girl. A really really good card to pull right now. However, there's a slight issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont own a Dark Magician Girl. You NEVER owned a Dark Magician Girl! None of your backup decks contained Dark Magician Girls let alone the customized one you brought to the championship! How did this one end up in your deck? Did somebody sneak it in? Is it against the rules to have an undisclosed cards you dont even own slipped into your deck during the competition? You dont know whether you should more worried that you found a card you dont own in your deck or that you have broken a rule having a card you dont own in your deck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, what is taking so long?!\u201d Ali goaded you from the other side of the ring, \u201churry up, already! Are you ready to surrender and admit defeat or do you wish to provide Angra Mainyu with another sacrifice?\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to question this anomaly later and get back to the duel.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Ali,\u201d you regain your confidence, \u201cI was just briefly stunned by the sheer beauty of the monster I'm about to summon to finish this duel!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBring him then!\u201d Ali demanded with pride, \u201che'll just be another stepping stone on my path of glorious conquest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a 'him', Ali!\u201d you stated, \u201cI sacrifice my Jinzo to summon the Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\nThe image of Jinzo on the VR grid vanishes and it's place appeared a glowing occultish seal as a feminine figure emerged from it. A blonde-haired woman in blue armor with a seal broach in the middle, wearing a blue Dark Magician helmet and a pink skirt, and brandishing a scepter capable of casting dark magic to destroy her enemies! She spun around and you nearly lost yourself in the twinkle in her sparkling emerald green eyes before snapping out of it just in time to plan your attack. The useless spell cards in your hand just became detrimental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, she certainly is a beauty, brother,\u201d Ali laughs, \u201cbut she still pales in comparison to a Great Beast!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I aint done yet, 'brother'!\u201d you slap a spell card on the field, \u201cI activate Magician's Scepter. This gives DMG an extra 500 Attack Point boost and raises her level to 7. Combined that with the 300 AP boost with my Dark Magician in the graveyard and both our monsters are evenly matched\u2026 that is until I activate this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's arrogant grin disappeared as soon as he saw you activate the trap Resonance of Power. Thanks to DMG now being level 7, she gains an extra 800 AP boost!<br>\r\n\u201cThat puts her at 3600 attack points. You know what that means, Ali? Show him what it means, Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong surge of dark magical power enveloped her scepter and aimed it toward the great beast.<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOO!!!\u201d Ali shouted in horror as his Angra Mainyu was caught in the explosion, leaving absolutely nothing behind in the smoke\u2026 and taking his remaining 800 life points with it! When the smoke finally cleared, the only things left in front of you in that ring were the Dark Magician Girl and the defeated Ali who had dropped to the floor lowering his head in utter shame. Geez, you didnt think he'd take losing THIS bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWINNER AND THIS YEAR'S REGIONAL CHAMPION: [MICHAEL] O'NIVES!\u201d<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild for you. It was a proud day for you. All your hard work and training had finally paid off. You never felt so proud of yourself your whole life! Who cares if you won with a card you dont technically own and was mysteriously slipped into your deck? YOU WON!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were beginning to savor your epic victory, something incredibly unusual happened. The Dark Magician Girl on the VR grid actually turned around and smiled at you. Then she clapped along with the audience for you! None of the duel monsters on the VR grid have EVER done something like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked with your jaw dropping in disbelief just before her image disappears.<br>\r\n\u201cD-D-DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Ali groaned as he walked off with his head hung low, \u201cmy dreams of restoring the Great Persian Empire dashed to pieces? Yes, brother. I saw it clear as day...\u201d What is his problem?!<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it wasnt as big as yours. The cheers from the audience seemed drowned out as you stared at your new Dark Magician Girl Card\u2026 who youre pretty sure wasnt winking in her portrait earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite winning the championship, the anomaly bugged you all the way back to your hotel room. You couldnt sleep in preparation for the celebratory party tomorrow cuz of all the newbound stressed you developed. You spent hours sitting at a desk reviewing your decks, trying to remember when you ever picked up a DMG, but no such luck. No recollection whatsoever. Just looking at the card was making you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duel Monster developers never made a winking Dark Magician Girl card as far as you know. Yet it's not fake, cuz the VR-grid wouldve detected counterfeits. Maybe it's a super rare card that was unreleased to the public? Even so, how did you manage to get your hands on it? Are you inadvertently breaking any laws just having it with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d you moan in frustration, \u201cthis is hopeless. I gotta go to bed.\u201d You'll just have to ponder the magical mystery tomorrow. So after putting your decks away, brushing your teeth, and changing into your pjs, you shut off the light, hop into bed and close your eyes, too tired to even bother pulling the covers over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As a shadowy figure pulls the covers over you.</span></div></div>",

You dont for even a nanosecond assume you were imagine things. Your imagination aint that great! Someone's in the hotel room with you! You got an intruder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn survival instinct, you reach into your pocket and whip out your switch blade! If youre gonna be attacked, you aint going down without a fight!<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it's pitch black. You cant see a thing. Still, you look all directions gazing deep into the shadows as you inch for the lamp. Unfortunately, as you yanked the lamp chain, you bumped into a chair you forgot to push in earlier and slipped and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed face first in the soft carpet, but at least you got the light on. Not to mention someone was generous enough to take your hand and help you off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... thanks,\" you dusted yourself off and politely thanked the blonde woman in a blue armored she-mage outfit. Then your eyes widened at the blonde woman in a blue armored she-mage outfit! Intruder! INTRUDER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE!!\" you shout, brandishing your switch-blade at the cute cosplayer! A weird fangirl just snuck into your room?! But how?! The door's locked and requires a special key only you and the hotel staff have! No sign of a window break-in either. So how else did she get in? Did she bribe hotel staff to let her in your room? Oh, this place is getting much worse than a 1-star review on Yelp! Your father was right. If youre gonna be famous, you need to hire armed security! But that's all neither here nor there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont make any sudden moves!\" you warned the cosplaying fangirl, \"take one step closer and so help me...\"<br>\r\nShe for some reason, didnt seem to look the least bit scared of you. If anything,that frown she was giving you was more of a look of concern than anything. Still, she aint attacking you so far, so good right?<br>\r\nAs you glared daggers at this mysterious intruder, the wheels in your head began to turn. Still pointing your blade her way, you reach over to the table and pick up a particular Duel Monster card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the card then up at her. Back down at the card then back up at her. Same hair, outfit, color of eyes... she even smiled at winked the same way... an exact splitting image of the Dark Magician Girl card in your hand!<br>\r\nShe didnt just look similar to the Dark Magician Girl in your hand, it was completely uncanny! She could pass off as her holographic image on the VR-grid and like 99% of the spectators would never notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you kept your guard up and your blade pointed to the DMG cosplayer.<br>\r\n\"Gotta say,\" you kept your cool as you stared at her suspiciously, \"that's the most authentic looking Dark Magician Girl outfit I've seen on anybody. I dont think I've seen ANYONE manage to pull HER off quite like you do!\"<br>\r\nAs if flattered by your comments, she smiled then put her hands behind her back and lifted her chin in a smug expression of pride.<br>\r\n\"You got a name?\" you finally ask for an introduction.<br>\r\nInstead of giving you one, or at the very least a NAME, she merely points to the card at your hand.<br>\r\n\"Your REAL name, smartass!\" you get impatient with her.<br>\r\nAgain, she adamantly points to your card!<br>\r\nYou gaze at her unamused, \"Youre the Dark Magician Girl?\"<br>\r\nShe twirled around like some heroine in a magical girl cartoon then brandished her magic scepter and struck a magical girl pose! ...Wait, where in Ra's name did she pull out that scepter from?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful. Just bloody wonderful. You got a creepy lunatic as a fangirl! You knew something was wrong when you had to stay in a hotel next to a mental hospital!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, keeping your cool yet being very unamused, very impatient, and very VERY tired, you interrogate your crazy intruder who thinks she's a Duel Monster card!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, 'Dark Magician Girl',\" you gaze coldly at her, \"how about telling me what youre doing in my room before I start calling the cops?\"<br>\r\nBefore she could give you an answer (as if was gonna give you one in the first place), the card in your hand suddenly glowed. Seriously, the glowy designs on it just emphasized it's glowiness as if on cue with your question. And then just after it stopped glowing, the wink on the DMG image was gone! That wink expression wasnt there anymore! Ok, are you seriously seeing things? Are you going as crazy as this loony Dark Magician Girl cosplayer?! ...Surely those stories about enchanted cards and reincarnations of Pharaohs and ancient beasts werent actually TRUE, right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis temporary panic kinda caused you to lower your guard involving the crazy intruder in your apartment. Maybe you are really just as crazy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and put your switchblade away. Something told you she wasnt a threat to you. If she wanted to try something with you, she couldve done so while you had that mental distraction!<br>\r\n\"You know, if you wanted an autograph, I coulda gave you one shortly after the championship.\"<br>\r\nDMG just tilted her head questionably.<br>\r\n\"Look, it's awful late in the night to just sneak into people's hotel rooms,\" you tell her, \"I think I read somewhere that it's legal for a hotel guest to shoot you for doing that.\"<br>\r\nDMG flinched after she heard that.<br>\r\n\"But hey, I guess I cant blame you for wanting to sneak into MY room,\" you snickered a little, \"after all, I am the new regional Duel Monsters champion... and soon to be World Champion if this little baby has something to say about it!\" You kissed your Dark Magician Girl card. Unknown to you, the DMG cosplayer blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that statement, you begin to wonder again how you ever came across this card to begin with. Any memory of securing a Dark Magician Girl (let alone a super ultra rare one that winks!) was not stored in your brain. Perhaps youre too crazy to remember? Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... go ahead and have a seat,\" you pointed over to the chair you tripped on. She gladly sits in it while you sit on your bed. \"I dont think I need to introduce myself to you, considering you probably know me enough to wanna sneak into my room late at night.\" The DMG cosplayer almost cracked a chuckle. \"But I dont think I know anything about you? How about you tell me who you are? Where youre from? Why youre here? C'mon, you owe me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stared at you intently. And of course silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, can you talk?\" you questioned, \"cat got your tongue? Abla ingles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited patiently for a verbal response. ANY verbal response. The silent treatment was a bit too much for your crazy mind to handle!</span></div></div>",
