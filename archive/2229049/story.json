Situated in the foothills of the Colorado Plateau, it's main draw was North Point University, which like everything else, was suffering under the strict lock-down and quarantine that had gripped the entire planet and human civilization as a whole. Most of the student body and faculty had been sent home save for a handful of students that simply were too poor or were unable to go home because of the restricted international travel. The handful of students left had initially looked forward to having no classes and taking full advantage of the nearby campus strip and it's bevy of stores, night clubs and bars...Only to find that like everything else, those too had been shuttered save for a handful of 'essential' stores in the nearby mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dreary life in the high desert, as the college that was known for being more of a 'party' college was reduced to anything but. With nothing to do, nowhere to go and bored out of their minds, the stranded students could do little but sit around in their dorms and wait for something to happen. And for the four students that currently inhabited the Oak Hall dorms, something was indeed happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a name is 'the Third Wish'?\" Peter Tzimeros grunted as he settled down on the worn out couch of the dorm's common room. the football player wasn't used to playing complicated board games like the one in front of him. He'd only ever played games like Sorry! or other simple games as a kid..But there was only so many times he could watch old replays of sports on TV now that everything had shut down and had left him stranded, his parents having been in Greece visiting his grandparents when everything had gone to hell. Still, he could have done a lot worse and been stuck with a bunch of jerks instead of his girlfriend and two cool (for dorks) freshman kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cool name! Y'know, like with the genie and stuff? Aladdin? Ugh I LOVE that movie! We should watch it later!\" Lindsey Michaels chittered as she bounced into her bean bag that she had hauled down from her new room on the fifth floor. Despite her usually 'bimbo blonde' looks, the currently rainbow haired ex-sorority girl was currently taking a break from her IT course, one of the few classes that hadn't slammed to a sudden stop. But she HAD been affected, her Gamma Upsilon Rho Lambda (GURL) sorority house closing down and forcing her to move into Oak Hall. But the Freshman had remained chipper about it, and the fact that with her barista job gone she lacked the funds (or desire) to move back home to Seattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The technical term is Djinn, actually. And I second Aladdin, but only the live action one because it's more historically accurate. But yeah, sounds cool! Maybe we could check it out later? You said it's like a off-brand Hot topic, or something, right Eugene?\" Judy Ross said, the top-heavy, purple haired goth said as she walked across the room with a bowl of popcorn and settled onto the couch beside Peter. Judy was majoring in mythology, and despite her punkish exterior was actually quite sweet. She was, in her own words, 'just going through a phase', and she had refused to go home, citing 'lifestyle choices' with her heavily conservative parents. She was Peter's girlfriend, the two somehow coming together across the vast social divide of 'arts nerd' and 'scholorship jock' to end up as freshman sweethearts last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, the all-american freshman geek on campus, blushed at the attention. The slightly overweight 18 year old had stumbled onto the strange store on his way back from a solo outing to the otherwise deserted Plateau Heights mall on the near side of town. Stranded when his flight back to California was cancelled and without a car and unwilling to put the burden of his already struggling mom, Eugene had been lucky enough to get on the list to stay at the dorms. Besides, he sort of liked having all this time to hang out with Lindsey. She was into computers, and he loved playing video games on computers and they had a lot of geeky stuff to talk about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Eugene replied as he pulled one of the lounge chairs over to the wide table that his recent purchase sat upon, \"It was cool but...Really weird? You guys remember that old store called Spencer's?\" A trio of shaking heads forced him to re-gather his thoughts, \"Well, it was this old store that used to sell all kinds of weird shit. Like they had a bunch of geeky stuff that you and I would like, Lindsey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, like what?\" The girl cooed as she reached over and grabbed a handful of popcorn from the large bowl that currently rested on Judy's fishnet-clad knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything. Like movie props and video games and jewelry...They even had like costumes and anime and normal clothes. Well, normal for Judy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" The goth chimed in through her own mouthful of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But yeah they even had like, dildos and fleshlights in the back, right? So the Third Wish was a lot like that only without the sex toys or the blacklights and loud music. It was kind of like a counter-culture antique store? They had a LOT of 80s and 90s stuff in there. Anyway it's like the only store in the mall that isn't closed right? So I go in and it's empty, I don't even see anyone at the front desk and I think maybe it's closed and they just forgot to lock up or something...But then BOOM this girl pops up behind me! And she goes something like, 'Hey, do you need any help finding anything today?' And I, you know, tell her no, but then she goes off, grabs this thing and brings it right back to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a little creepy, Geno\" Peter said as he draped a muscled arm around Judy, who snuggled in closer, her eyes wide with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what I thought too! But then she starts talking about this game and I'm not gonna lie I started geeking out a little bit because of all it can do! Here, let me read you the rules...\" Eugene reached down and picked up the empty shell the game had come in and began reading off the text that was printed on the back of the weathered cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a game that you will find, brings excitement in boring times. Comes with infinite games that come with two modes, each with it's own rules. We can play it like a traditional board game or we can play something it's calling 'Immersive Mode', which if I'm understanding this right, is sort of like playing Dungeons and Dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know how to play that\" Peter said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither\" Judy said as she set the popcorn bowl on the table next to the hub-capped shaped game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I do! But I've only played once. I was a gnome! I stabbed some guys in the legs and stole their treasure. It was cool but the guys never invited me back to play again\" Lindsey said, and Eugene tried not to just start nerding out over that fact. \"But umm, like, where's the board? Or the little action figures? You need those to play either, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no, the game is all in there!\" Eugene said, pointing at the game, which to him looked like an old 1980's prototype game console, \"It's like a computer, we turn it on, and then we slide a keyboard out from that latch on the side and type in WHATEVER we wnat as a game! We can make it as long or short as we want, and it has four pre-installed game modes but we can program it to make whatever we want! It even has a little printer for the game map and see that little black box on the side? I can even program in MORE with my computer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Dude, this must have set you WAY back\" Judy said, leaning up off the couch to inspect the game more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I only spent like fifteen bucks!\" The girl was way nice, she said she knew what it was like to be cooped up with nothing to do for a long time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know right? But yeah, it also has little cards it'll dispense if we play traditional, like Monopoly cards or something to 'add challenge' to the game. We use one dice, singles and double rolls get two turns and high rollers have to always draw a card...And there's little action spaces that are a lot like the cards. I guess it's all there to make the game more interesting? Anyway, whoever gets to the middle has to yell 'Morphmanji!' and they 'get a wish', whatever that means. With immersive mode it sort of sounds like we have to RP our characters through the game and complete the quest, we get five lives but if we use up all of them we can't play with them anymore...But whoever wins has to yell the same thing and get a wish like Traditional. There's something on here about how if players leave the game before it's finished that can't play again...And this thing must be really old, most of the print is rubbed off here\" Eugene said as he squinted at the faded text as it trailed off. \"Oh well, how hard could it be, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this kinda reminds me of an old movie...\" Lindsey said, leaning back in her bean-bag, \"But maybe I'm just having a blonde moment. Who made it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, there's no logo on it\" Eugene said, looking at the box and then around the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we're going to do this, let's do it already!\" Peter said with a yawn, \"I like you guys but this geeky stuff just makes me even more bored\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's play!\" Lindsey seconded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Just press this button here...\" Eugene said, pushing on the Big Red Button in the middle of the console's top. There was a series of synthetic beeps and boops, and with a metallic click an old mechanical keyboard slid out of the base of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE INPUT GAME TYPE\" A robotic voice squawked from a speaker near the power button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Lindsey squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, what do we want to play first?\" Eugene asked as he positioned his hands above the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment. the group decided on...</span></div></div>",

And besides, it seemed a little complicated for his tastes anyway. But Judy was clearly interested so maybe he'd just stick with it. But damn, this was a lot of talking for a game! He was used to just loading up Madden or something in his Xbox and getting into the game immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush. It's old\" Judy said, \"It's not like your football game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just gotta give it time and junk\" Lindsey nodded, backing up her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we want to play?

Three other heads nodded in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, adventure mode it is!\" Eugene leaned over and carefully typed the word 'Adventure' on the small keyboard, taking his time to not spell it wrong or accidentally break the rather fragile looking keyboard. When he was done he pressed enter, and the machine made a clicking sound before mechanically intoned....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME TYPE: ADVENTURE.

A pampered existence, waited on hand and foot, every whim satisfied, and ultimate authority coming from royal privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was thinking the same thing, trying to decide if it was even 8-bit, 16-bit, or some hybrid machine. Guessing it was pre-playstation... playstation one, even. He agreed, his expectations were lowering with each minute.

Only an oasis here and there, and a temple half lost to the dunes would be enough for whatever processor was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay and Peter were more interested in each other than the game.

They did pass a few people...if you could call them people.  There were a number of women who were dressed similarly to Eugene who would simply bow to Judy and walk off while only muttering 'Princess' before they walked off.  There were also men with swords standing in front of doors that not even a princess might be allowed in.  As they walked along Eugene and Judy could swear they even saw the same woman and guard multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene sighed to himself as he muttered, \"Probably a memory limitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Memory limitation?  What do you mean by that?\"  Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the fact that we're seeing the same model multiple times and the fact we probably can't enter all of these rooms is probably a memory limitation of that game.  It's not truly an open and immersive world, it's a little disappointing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  We got...sucked into this world after you pushed a few buttons and you're complaining how it's not high tech enough?\"  Judy said exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an observation...\"  Eugene said shrinking a little under Judy's gaze.  The two continued to walk along in silence until something caught their attention.  Off in the distance the voice of a woman called out, \"What the FUCK is going on here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing they finally had a lead on their other friends Judy and Eugene sprinted towards the angry woman's voice and when they got in visual range they saw quite the sight.  A beautiful woman was pacing back and forth in a fury.  She was wearing a red harem outfit with layers of see through materials, she was also adorned with a jewels, not as nice as Judy's but eye catching never the less.  But there was one piece of jewelry she had Judy didn't.  A bronze collar with a chain attached to it, and at the end of the chain was a large man standing almost 7 feet tall with a large black beard and muscles that were easy to admire with since he was only wearing a loin cloth.  But despite his impressive physique, he looked oddly scared.  He said with a deep voice that did not convey the confidence one would expect, \"Let's just stay here and, like, take a breather and figure stuff out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure stuff out?  I don't want to figure anything out.  I want to wake up from this freaky dream because that's the only logical explanation for what's happening!\"  The harem girl screamed at the giant man and she tried to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\"  The man said as he tugged at the chain and sent the now coughing girl to the floor.  \"OHMYGAWD I'M SO SORRY!  I just...I just don't know my own strength!  Are you ok?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Eugene and Judy had gotten to the two fighting and Judy helped the harem girl up and said, \"This might sound like a weird question...but are you my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at the princess and hugged her, \"Judy!?  Oh man I was afraid I'd never see you again!\"  Peter said, but as the hug went on and he felt his very large breasts mashed up again his girlfriends he backed off.  \"I mean, I had everything under control.  I was just going to go off to find and save you, but the Hulk over here wouldn't let me.\"  Peter glared at the giant man who looked like he was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just didn't want to risk you getting hurt.  You don't have the muscles you have in the real world and there are some scary looking people around.\"  The manly Lindsay said eyeing some guards that were passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Well maybe you could have used your muscles and go...\"  Peter said starting to get confrontational with Lindsay when Judy said, \"ENOUGH!\"  Peter froze in his tracks under his girlfriend's command.  Judy continued, \"We don't need to fight each other.  We're on the same side.  We're playing this...crazy game and we should...just play it.  And fighting isn't going to solve a damn thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah you're right.\"  Peter said as he looked up to Lindsay, \"I'm sorry.\"  Peter simply said.  Judy sighed, her boyfriend was good about apologizing when he knew he was wrong, but wasn't really good with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too.\"  Lindsay said wiping the last of the tears from her eyes and she looked at Judy and Eugene.  \"You both also look so beautiful, I'm jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\"  Eugene said while blushing.  He'd never expected to be told by his crush that she was jealous of his looks.  Then again he also never expected to be immersed in an Arabian game world where he was some sort of hand maiden so it was a day full of surprises.  Eugene shook his head to get focused, \"We've all found each other, that's a good start, but now I think we have to keep playing the game because we need to be it in order to get back I think.\"  Eugene said as he wondered where the heck the group was even supposed to start.</span></div></div>",

Eugene immediately sank down, intending to crawl towards the door, and let some light in from the next room, or sneak some daylight in from a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he reached the floor, he was confused. His hands discovering chill stone, rather than carpet. Running his hand over the flat surface he could feel it wasn't even plain concrete. A frown formed invisibly on his hidden face, as he stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...\" he called out, suddenly aware how quite they were... How quiet the whole room was. There wasn't any answer, \"Not funny...\" he said with a faint quiver in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I could see...\" The words were barely louder than a whisper, as he spoke to himself. Eugene was startled to see a pale grid fill the air in front of him. He was more surprised to recognise it. It was an inventory list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely an illusion, his hand reached up to swat it away, like a prop his friends had constructed from... luminous painted wood. Or for his hands to pass through it, like the drug fuelled illusion it had to be. Eugene knew he was a geek, even more than his friends, but he never thought they'd doze him with something for their amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene's hand passed into the grid, he felt something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electronic chirp sounded, and he found himself with a torch in his outstretched hand. He almost dropped it in surprise. Only fear of being burned meant he tightened his grip instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was illuminated in the flickering yellow glow of the torch flames. Holding it high, he could see the vague shape of an ornate ceiling above him. He was able to see around him, a faint glowing sphere of light. The shapes in the darkness were tantalizing. His footsteps echoed as he explored, already enjoying the immersion. Approaching one shape, Eugene discovered it was a statue on a low plinth. A naked woman, dressed only in a diaphanous cloth. Moving around he discovered more statues. Some of the women were blessed with full breasts, others with wide hips. Each had a look of grace, poise and ecstasy on her face. One with a look of beatific satisfaction, a hand cradling a belly swollen with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting his mental bearings, he realised there were three statues on each side of the room. He thought of them as side, the room felt longer in the other axis. Walking up the centre of the room, he headed for one end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he found a set of ornately carved steps. Walking up them, he could only praise the realism. His feet scuffing over the stone. His hand feeling the warmth of the flame, and his palm the rough bound wood that made his torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the torch higher, he lit the base of the largest plinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make out the shape of a woman's feet and lower legs. She was scaled beyond human dimensions. The statue was twice or three times her real size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting some writing in the stone platform, Eugene read it. \"Aphrodite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he had to admire the artist's work, the perfect woman carved exquisitely in the richest marble. Delicate details taken even with her insignificant toes. Even from his low vantage point, he admired the swell of her bust, and the lewd detail given to those stony nipples.</span></div></div>",

As he explored it, Sun started to fill the temple, flooding into the main chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked over the other statues, showing the different women. He recognised each of them as typifying some aspect of femininity, virtue, grace, fertility and so forth. As the flame on his torch guttered and went out, the temple was illuminated by the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisposing of the extinguished torch, he was able to admire each of the women. He flexed his hand, which was cramping from holding the coarse wood for so long. Curious to see how different sensations could be created by the game, Eugene ran his hands up and down one of the pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he found himself drawn to one of the statues. A svelte, athletic woman, he pressed his hands against the chill stone of her body. Running it over the cool stone, from thigh up her flank. He was startled to hear a powerful womans' voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your compliment was kind, but your transgression needs punishment. I shall combine them to reward your generous words, and remove your masculine offence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene bucked like a landed fish, as he hunted for the source of the voice. It filled the air without seeming loud, his hunt limited by the ways his hands felt stuck to the stony body of the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he knew this was Aphrodite speaking directly to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe half wanted to fall to his knees, but his frozen hands made that impossible. Part of him wanted to curtsey too. A fear gripped him, as he pondered the Goddess' threat of reward and punishment combined. Dreading the myths of the time. He continued to thrash as he felt his body start to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his body was too bright to look at, and Eugene felt ill with worry. With a brilliant pulse, the blinding light vanished, as the statue released him. Stumbling back a few steps, Eugene felt different. Blinking his eyes clear of tears, he took in the changes he could already feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was covered in a toga. A firm, full bust making the material cling to his curves. Hips swelled out, far wider than he liked, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/5d/51/a55d510303cc27cdbd63f4081b8c7129.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/5d/51/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laurel crown marked her as one of Aphrodite's chosen.

Although running was a bit of a over-statement, as the new proportions of his female body caused him to fall to the hard marble floors more than once with a feminine 'oof' in his new sultry new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is NOT happening!\" He gasped as he finally seemed to find the movement balance his still swelling features demanding, finally leaving the chamber of Aphrodite and wiggling and jiggling down the stone corridor. Eugene ran (or rather, it was more of a power walk, or power-strut in this case) through the darkness, squeaking in surprise each time a torch roared to life as he approached. There was also a cool breeze that seemed to be grower stiffer the farther he traveled into the dark, as if something was trying to push him back into the chamber of the Greek goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with that anyway!? I'm pretty sure, no, I KNOW I typed in '<b>Arabia</b>' into the game! What the HELL am I doing in Greece? Where's all the sand!? The camels!? I should be wearing a turban not...\" Eugene paused for a moment to look down at his cleavage, frowning from the unwelcome mounds of flesh before smushed his new toga-puppies against himself with a unflattering grunt to finally reveal his new tiny feet, \"NOT SANDALS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe currently greek geek felt something ephemeral tug at the hem of his toga and, not daring to look back because he suddenly got the mental picture of the statue FOLLOWING him like a Weeping Angel or something (not that the statue itself wouldn't be terrifying enough), he went back to sprinting down the corridor at the best speed he could manage without flopping onto his new boobs again. But at least he didn't feel as if he was still, uh, 'growing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it's got something to do with proximity to the statue? Really I just would like some goddamned answers alreaDAAAAAAHH!' Eugene let out a girlish squeal of terror as the hard stone beneath his feet gave way to something soft and slick as he comically slid across the substance and into a rather firm piece of topiary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh!\" He flailed, distangling himself from the poking branches and spitting a mouthful of leaves out. \"AND WHY AM I EVEN HERE!?\" He shouted, his new voice echoing into the pin-pricked darkness above him as stars (and other things) began to come into focus around him as his eyes adapted to the dark. Behind him was a massive columned temple, the pillars lit by large braziers. He'd sprinted out of some kind of...side entrance? And around him were the carefully maintained gardens that surrounded the temple; expertly sculpted statues depicting Aphrodite and the other Greek gods...And a bunch of normal looking statue people embracing each other. Here and there were fountains and the entire perimeter, as far as the new blonde could see in the moonless night, was a wall of carefully cut hedges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..Is that Peter and Lindsey?\" Eugene crept close to a statue of a muscled man embracing a rather stick-like girl. The resemblance was a little off and clearly not his friends, but Eugene couldn't help but scratch his head. That was ANOTHER question; Why had Eugene and Lindsey been fawning all over each other before...Whatever happened and he'd been sucked to the <b>WRONG</b> part of the antique world!? Peter and Judy were the couple...Eugene was still working up the nerve to ask his rainbow haired crush out yet suddenly the freshman girl was sitting in the sophmore jock's lap and NO ONE was saying anything? Was that why Judy was acting all weird and quiet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid...Was the game doing something even before he'd pressed start? Before the transformed teen could ponder the potnetial editorial blunder further, something shifted out of the corner of his eye and he looked away from the mistaken statues and directly into the eyes of a much smaller Aphrodite statue that he KNEW hadn't been looking that direction when he'd walked over here. Large marble eyes seemed to bore into his soul and he felt...calm? Or maybe just at peace. Aphrodite WAS a peaceful goddess, why was he running away from her presence? But then he felt a tingle from his new female assets and his toga grew tighter as his breasts swelled once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And with a comical 'NOPE!', Eugene threw caution to the wind and dove head first through the hedges, cursing as he felt his fair (and sensitive) skin receive more than a few scratches. He shielded his eyes with a dainty hand and pushed (as best as a buxom woman suspended in topiary could)  forward through the vegetation, finally emerging out onto a...</span></div></div>",

She also caught many of the women looking at her, an admiring glance, a respectful tip of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to have some respect for looking like a devotee of Aphrodite. Stepping onto the cobbles, she was soon forgotten allowing her to browse the various stalls set up around the marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to forget her new gender, as her bust constantly shifted with every move she made. If the opportunity arose she'd have to invent the bra. The humiliating movement seeming to add to her conspicuousness. Drawing eyes, there was also a growing awareness of how that felt to herself. The constant friction rubbing back and forth over her new, wider nips was just a constant tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only consolation Eugene realised belatedly was along with the gift of her full breasts and wide hips, Aphrodite had blessed her with a money pouch. It bounced against her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar caught Eugene's attention, and she raced towards it. Afraid of vanishing into the background unless she took deliberate risks and actions. She didn't want to find herself absorbed by a role, she hadn't wanted to play. Serving as a temple girl for her Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiggling and swaying, Eugene tried to keep your bust under control, and her pace rapid. Leaving the market, she hear the same bellow, this time clearer. Something tells you he's outside now, rather than simply nearer. Rounding a corner, she found herself at the foot of another set of temple steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man stood half-way down. An Adonis of a man, with intriguingly powerful muscles rippling in the sun. Filling his leather armour in ways that excited and teased Eugene. A short cotton kilt or skirt, barely covered a taut and toned ass that kept drawing Eugene's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter...\" she asked, looking up at the surprise and recognising the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, and answered with a quaver, \"I'm... Judy... Are you ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she replied, \"I'm Eugene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blessings of Ares.\" he explained with a powerful shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blessings of Aphrodite...\" Eugene answered, with a similarly mortified smile.</span></div></div>",

The wind rippled and fluttered up Eugene's toga, and she shuddered at the feeling, having suddenly been getting a little warm (though she wasn't really sure from what). And why did her skin feel so...sensitive all of a sudden? And why were Judy's pecs so...well oiled? Seriously, it was night, the nearby torches of the Greek city they found themselves in weren't so bright enough as to make him appear like it was the middle of the day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Didn't you say...Arabia?\" Judy said a cough, suddenly looking away, giving his armor a shake as something very large and very alien pressed painfully against the primitive codpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No I...I was just doing what you said to do when Lindsey and Peter started acting all weird! And YOU never gave me and answer about what game mode you wanted so I just picked Immersive since I figured it was what you wanted! so really this is all your fault, Judy!\" Eugene said, stamping her tiny foot petulantly, which only served to send her divine assets jiggling, which made Judy's intense smoldering eyes bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...WELL YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THAT WEIRD GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE!\" Judy roared, not expecting his new voice to be that...powerful as Eugene staggered back and several of the torches behind the exquisite blonde fizzled out, and at least one jar was lifted from the ground and tumbled end over end and shattering to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Eugene squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" Judy gasped, \"That...did we get powers from those gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Well, it IS a video game...\" Eugene said, squinting in the darkness, deep in thought. If the game had deposited them in Greece instead of Arabia, and was, uh, 'rendering' Judy's 'model' as if it was being lit by daylight when it was clearly night...Maybe it was just glitching? The game had seemed pretty old, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her thought process was interrupted as a hunched figure came shambling out of the darkness behind Eugene, a cane tapping loudly on the uneven stones that made up the street. Eugene turned and gasped in surprise. Judy scowled and took a powerful step forward, his new stride almost double of what his old, short body had been capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh champions of the gods....\" Came a shaky voice as an old, balding man came into view, his tunic hanging loosely off of an emaciated frame, \"If you have questions you should seek the oracle. Her wisdom is beyond all others, a sacred blessing from Apollo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I know who that is! The Oracle of Delphi, otherwise known as the Pythia!\" Judy's eyes ceased their scowling and she felt elated to finally put some of her classes to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you know of her...I can point you to her for a coin or two...\" The old man grinned, his mouth missing a few teeth as he outstretched a leathery hand, pointing to the small satchel hanging off of Eugene's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go on, pay him Eugene!\" Judy said after an awkward moment, in which the old man seemed frozen. The two peered closely at his near-rictus grin and Eugene noticed that every few seconds his feeble tottering was repeating, clearly on some kind of a animation loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's an NPC\" Eugene said, taking a step back, brown eyes wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't think you're allowed to call people that anymore, Eugene\" Judy frowned at the poor choice of words...But he hadn't pegged Eugene to be one of THOSE people that just called people NPCs for disagreeing with him. The currently buff and male goth girl wasn't really into video games, she only really knew a little of the offhand parlance and NPC was one that was currently more associated with right-wing Internet trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Eugene looked up at Judy, confusion in her big eyes before realization hit her, \"Oh. OH. No I mean, NPC means a 'non-player character'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just blinked dumbly back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. You know...something being run by the computer? Like this guy isn't really real, he's just, uh, I think he's trying to give us a quest or something. See how he keeps moving a certain way every few seconds? That's his animation loop.\" The knockout geek tried his best to explain the concept to her friend, walking around the old man (whose head and eyes creepily stayed locked onto Eugene's face) and point at the repetition in his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at Eugene and then at the old man. Then at Eugene again and gave a shrug. \"Well, when in, uh...Athens, do as the Athenians do?\" He wasn't entirely sure this actually was Athens, but seeing as how, if his memory served, Rome wouldn't be founded for at LEAST a couple of centuries, it seemed an appropriate phrase. \"Just pay the man and let's get going! Maybe he'll lead us to Lindsey and Peter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I kind of have a thing against using money at the start of a game...\" Eugene cocked a hand on her hip and jingled the coin pouch, \"Generally it's sort of a waste, you're better off finding your own way forward since its sort of obvious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, if either of the two had happened to look UP (a common problem in game development, the vast majority of players often simply lock their eyes forward and rarely utilize the vertical camera control to do more than aim a weapon) they would have seen another temple on the hill above the city, the emblem of the Olympian god Apollo adorning the side through an elaborate use of bricks and tile, all lit by large braziers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene I'm a dude and you're a chick that looks like she just stepped out of the 'Perfect Woman' catalogue. I don't really think we should be trying to use video game logic here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm perfect? Eugene said with a blush and a smile, flipping her golden hair with a tiny hand and wondering where the breeze had suddenly gone. She was getting all hot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I mean you've got great curves, most girls would kill to look like you!\" Judy said with an enthusiastic nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's ever called me perfect before...\" Eugene purred softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe they're just blind...\" Judy said as the two moved closer to one another. A tiny set of fingers casually began strolling their way up Judy's pecs as Judy cupped a impossibly small chin in his hand, faces swimming closer and closer to each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cough behind the two that jerked them out of their 'moment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few coins I can point you the way to the oracle, champions\" The old man said again, hand still outstretched and rather creepy frozen smile still locked on his leathery face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm just throwing this out there but I'm started to get creeped out by this guy, and he's not even looking at me!\" Judy said with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, NPC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another brief moment of bickering over whether to pay the old man or not, Judy and Eugene decided to...</span></div></div>",

It was destroying her self-confidence, the constant vulnerability and the need for a man by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene wished again and again that he'd never groped that statue... never complimented that Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair walked, Eugene became aware that Judy was struggling too. In just as alien a body, his hands were restless. Eugene realised that Judy was trying to hide his reaction to her proximity. The supple flesh she was pressing against him and his armour. Her fawning need for a champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene blushed crimson as she caught the straining outline of the erection she was inspiring from Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try to forget about it... It'll go away...\" she whispered as a sympathetic suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know another way to get rid of it...\" Judy suggested. His voice not sounding quite right. Eugene was unsure whether he was joking, being serious... Did she want her to blow him?... a Hand job?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sincerely hoped this was an awkward bluster. A act of male bravado, or a suggestion that she stopped pressing her magnificent body against his.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was an awkward silence between the two as they strolled through the night. All around them were the sounds of ancient Greece, the wind in the olive trees, the distant sounds of conversation, the sputtering of torches and the distant sounds of the sea. Part of Eugene wanted to be amazed at how remarkably detailed the game world was, even if it did have...glitches (luckily Judy's 'model' seemed to have worked out the glitch as was now lit properly for a night time setting), and wanted to think about the possibility of this being some kind of high tech VR...But the hot, growing sensation beneath her toga was growing increasingly hard to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs were the pained grunts of Judy as he walked beside her, a powerful (and large, so very large) bulge pushing against the armor he wore. Part of her wanted to see it. Just for, uh, scientific reasons, of course. When she had been a man she'd never had much of a penis, and was still very much a virgin due to her interests and (then) weight problems. She had hoped Lindsey, who despite being far too pretty for her, would be a ticket out of that department given their similar interests...But now it seemed a bit impossible. And to be honest, not really all that interesting anymore. Not when SHE was now the hot chick and could very easily have any man she wanted with her divine good looks. Eugene found herself regretting having fled from Aphrodite before the goddess could finish bestowing upon her the final parts of the blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh\" Eugene said, trying to make conversation to take her mind off her...things, \"Where do you think we are?\" She was aware that Judy was making Arts her major, and had been in the middle of studying for a big exam concerning the finer points of Greek mythology when the Pandemic had hit and shut everything down (and landed them in this current mess). Again, had either of them cared to look upwards, they would have found their current location rather obvious. For Judy, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to, eurgh, say\" Judy did her best to hide the pained groan as he shifted his large stride to try to give himself more room for...himself, \"Honestly I can't really think right now. Pretty sure it's not Athens or Sparta, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not big enough to be Athens and there are no dudes walking around with mohawk helmets. Ugh, wait, I've gotta...I've gotta do something about this!\" Judy groaned again, louder this time as he staggered against a nearby house. The outer wall creaked and groaned as he slid up against it, his godly strength threatening to knock it over. Eugene half expected a family to come pouring out of the hovel as it shook, but no other NPCs appeared. There was a jingle and click of metal as Judy fiddled with the straps of his armor, and then with a rustle of metal and fabric the constraining codpiece dropped to the ground with a noisy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh GODS that is better\" Judy moaned in relief as the javelin under his tassles stretched further and further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Eugene said quietly as his eyes locked on the enormous erection, and the pulsing urge in her grew more and more hot until she felt as if the only way to ever cool down was to shed the flimsy toga entirely and be free to the night air. Tiny hands fiddled with what few straps kept the together on her blessed form, and in a manner of seconds it was sliding loose around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene....\" Judy gasped, looking upon the former nerd with an expression that could only be called 'concerned lust'. Gone was any thought of Peter, or the jock's adulterous actions with Lindsey while Judy, his GIRLFRIEND, was sitting right there. Now all that matter was the woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I' don't think the house has anyone in it...\"Eugene purred, letting the toga slide completely off, coming closer and closer, teasingly close to Judy's enormous cock, \"Why don't we...Check to make sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she was pressed against Judy, a hand stroking the erection and sending waves of pleasure rocketing through Judy's body. They slid along the wall until they were at the darkened door, growing closer and closer until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a giggle and a grunt as the two slipped closer and closer to the doorway, not knowing that it was a threshold in more way than just being a door. They were so close, Eugene couldn't think of anything else other than getting indoors and then getting a particular divine warrior in her door. Judy was the same, there was a beautiful woman in front of her, ready and willing to be mounted on his 'wall'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when a frantic male voice began crying out: \"Heroes! Oh chosen of the gods! I bring a dire message from the oracle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me\" Judy said as the skinny man appeared from around the nearby corner, a scroll in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Eugene purred as she ceased to stroke Eugene's penis and began to actively guide it towards the burning wet furnace between her perfect legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, Eugene, I think the game is trying to make us do something again!\" Judy said, physically pushing Eugene away and giving him a very, very light shake in order to remove the dazed, blank stare on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Eugene groaned as she held her head, giving it a shake to clear...thoughts from her mind and then loking over at the newcomer, giving a panicked eep! and scrambling to pull her toga back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to the gods that if you start asking for money I'm going to snap you in half\" Judy grumbled as she stalked over to the much smaller man, who instead of looking intimidated clearly just looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank Olympus, master hero! I had thought that you were too consumed to be bothered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit. It. Out.\" Judy wanted to get back to...whatever that had been. It had felt incredible and she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The message is not mine to tell, only the oracle may reveal it, and your true purpose here. Please, join me as I escort you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, I...I think we should do what he wants. I think the game is trying to get us to the oracle. It's just...gonna keep happening until we do\" Eugene slipped the toga back over her barren shoulders and gave Judy an apologetic shrug. The desire was fading once more, and as she eyed Judy's member she could see that it, too, was beginning to droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, doing so will restore order, and you will be granted riches beyond your wildest imagination!\" The NPC said as he reached the end of his idling animations.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine, whatever, take us to this oracle!\" Judy growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most excellent, champion! This wa,y quickly!\" The messenger said with a wave. He turned to race away, to lead both heroes to his mistress when Eugene reached up and grabbed him by the arm with a small hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, before we go, can you tell us where we are?\" She asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my lady\" The messenger said, confused, \"We're in the city of Thespiae! Home of Eros!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains a lot\" Judy grumbled as she picked up the codpiece and slowly fitted it back onto her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I've never heard of this place. Isn't Eros like the god of deception or something?\" Eugene said with a tit of his blonde head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Eris. Eros was the god of, welll\" Judy looked down at himsefl and Eugene before looking back up, \"He was the god of sex\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. Here, let me explain it to you...\" Judy leapt into a full explanation of the strange forces that were clearly a part of the game world as Eugene released the messenger, and the three made their way towards the large temple looking over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, elsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of alarm split the otherwise still desert night, and a few moments later came the deafening ring of alarm bells as they were rung around the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned, dark haired girl ran, blood thundering in her ears as her body rebelled painfully against her. Large sandstone steps smacked hard against her tiny and soft feet as she fled from a massive palace that stretched towards the sky, lit in the dark night only by giant braziers and bonfires that lit the entire structure. A bell tolled from within as the large gates at the front of the decadent structure swung open, revealing a large mass of very angry bearded men as they raced after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little clothing she had been wearing was long since torn from exertion, but she didn't dare stop as she scrambled through the rapidly emptying marketplace. Behind her were the furious roars of dozens of men, their swords and torches high in the air as they chased after their quarry. The girl leaped over a earthen pot, dashed through an empty store stall and took a wrong turn as she ended out in the middle of a large bridge that spanned a massive, mighty and dark river that stretched into the night. She pushed forward until a crowd of armed men led by a older yet powerful looking man wrapped in a white turban and astride a black horse<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man closed in on her, the woman gave them a defiant look, quickly bundled her cascading dark hair into a haphazard bun, and jumped. There was a rush of air in her ears as she struggled to calm her breathing just enough to get a lung full of air and prayed to whatever god might have been watching over her that she didn't just land on a rock and snapped like a twig. She managed to suck in a breath as she positioned herself like a knife; feet and legs stretched out and downwards whlie her arms were wrapped as best they could around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she hit the water, and everything went black, cold, and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the river, crowding around the spot the woman had been just seconds ago, was the small army of men that flanked either side of the dominating figure on the horse, who glared angrily down at the powerful current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Search every house and boat on the river! Close the harbor, I want that bloody whore found!\" He snarled, guiding his horse through the crowd and racing away on it, the hooves clattering into the night as the crowd of man scattered to do their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the water below and already quickly downstream, the young woman could struggled against the current and broke through the water's surface, gasping as quietly as she could for breath. She knew this river flowed to the harbor, and then the harbor emptied out into the ocean. It didn't really matter where as long as the ship wasn't carrying the Black Plague or anything, but she had to get away from this city at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just prayed that she wasn't late, or had used up whatever luck she had to survive the fall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl drifted in the river's current, paddling to get herself close to the shore but not too close, lest she be spotted by the roaming bands of turban-topped guards that were searching for her. As she floated she pulled her hands out of the water and stared at them in what little light there was. They were dark, of course, and she felt the weight of her soaked hair pulling at the back of her skull, and of course, her large breasts, which were bobbing gently up and down in the water, the remnants of her silk dress plastered against them. She could feel the water-tight metal canister bump against her right leg as she paddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt...familiar? But yet at the same time very, very strange. When she'd awoken in the bedroom, something had clearly gone wrong. She knew that she wasn't supposed to be there, that she was missing...someone and...something? She didn't even know her name, or how she'd even gotten there! All she'd known was the pressing need to Get Out and take the strange metal tube that was in her hands with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd dressed in the only thing that she could find: A skimpy blue outfit that reminded her of something...An old story, maybe? There were many things like the girl felt she was supposed to know but instead of answers there was simply the emptiness of uncertainty. And also the four black bars that were tattooed on the underside of her left wrist. There had been fine, but her first attempt at escaping out of the palace window had ended less than successfully as her bed sheet rope hadn't nearly been long enough...And had decided to vanish from her hands in a storm of pixels and reappear buried halfway inside the tower wall as she free-fell to a painful end in the courtyard below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd awoken once more in the bedroom, she'd decided to try the door, and had bluffed her way past the burly, shirtless guard outside and his large scimitar...But that had only lasted long enough for her to get to the stairs out of his line of sight before the guard had started yelling about her escape. The girl had been lucky enough to be both quick on her feet and a quick thinker and had avoided the MASSIVE influx of guards as they started pouring in from all parts of the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the...glitch? happened again, allowing her to pass through the guards at the front gate like a ghost...And then allowing her to move through the wall and somehow get to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was going on? Who was she, WHERE was she? And who were these others that she felt the desperate need to find?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot up ahead caused the girl to lower herself into the water until only her piercing, intense eyes were visible, her dark hair giving her a natural camoflauge as she approached the mouth of the river, where the docks were located. She raised herself only periodically, just enough to get a fresh breath of maritime air as she moved unseen through the tall forest of masts and sails...Only for the glitch to happen once more as she approached a broad ship that sat low in the water. One moment she was reaching for the mooring lines...And the next moment she was standing, dripping wet, in a long and dark cargo hold. The only light was that from the deck streaming through the cross-hatched doors that periodically pierced the ceiling, and she could see, in the gloom, a series of mirrored benches on either side of her, huge paddles sitting at rest. Along the floor were many bodies of men and women in various forms of undress, many curled into balls, some draped over others, but all of them were chained to the benches, and luckily, most of them were fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave for the young Oriental woman that was staring at the girl wide wide, tear-filled eyes, around one a dark bruise was already forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who-who are you!?\" She whispered as the girl looked around for an escape, \"P-please, help m-me! I...I don't know what's happening! I don't even know how I got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ceased her search for an escape and very carefully and very quietly made her way over to the slave girl, keeping the metal container danging from her wide hips from making any noise by pressing it against her wet skin. When she'd crossed the landscape of slumbering flesh, the girl crouched down and placed a small hand on the barren shoulders of the shivering girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know how I got here either. Do you know what your name is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I woke up up and s-some guys were trying to b-buy me! I think I'm a s-slave!\" The mistreated girl sobbed as quietly as she could, \"A-and then when I tried t-to escape, then knocked m-me down and started k-kicking me! And then they threw me i-in here! and c-chained me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escaped girl followed the enslaved girl's trembling finger to the heavy chains that bound her to the rest of the slaves that were in the cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the c-captain has t-the k-key! P-please, help m-me! Don't l-leave me here!\" The slave girl pleaded, reaching out to grab the girl's arm in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry. I have to...I have to go\" She said, feeling the drive to escape this horrible place before she wound up the same as the girl in front of her. She pulled away as the other girl let loose a sobbed \"No!\", but then she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, illuminated by a flicker of torchlight from above, were five bars printed against the slave girl's skin. She...She was like her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's desire for answers over-rode her desire to escape. She HAD to help this girl, and together, maybe they could get some answers. She cast a glance around the hold, spotting a short ladder at the far end leading up to the deck. Well, she'd already died once and lived to tell the tale...If she couldn't pull this off maybe she could try it from a different angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here. I'll be back\" She whispered to the slave girl, and made her way towards the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so Eros is the son of Ares and Aphrodite?\" Eugene asked as they trudged up the long stairs that led to the oracle's temple. She'd long since crossed her arms to keep her overly generous bust from bouncing with every step, but there was nothing she could do to keep her hips from whipping to and fro, or her large rear from jiggling. But luckily this time she was behind Judy and was able to distract herself by looking down at the quiet city below and pondering about, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And since he's the god of sex and we're, uh, the living embodiments of his parents, that must be why we came on to each other. We're probably extremely vulnerable to his influence...\" And Judy was distracted himself, rattling off ancient Greek history, eager for a chance to put his (expensively) gained knowledge to use. Not that he didn't still feel the urge to glance back every once and a while at his bestowed friend. Just to make sure she was okay, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And since this is a video game, stuff like that probably exists for as long as we're within the city limits\" Eugene finished, adding in her own area of expertise. She was already glad that the height of the temple seemed to be clearing her head, but getting out of the town entirely as soon as they could would be optimal. Not that she wasn't...curious about what might have happened had they not been interrupted by the messenger, who walked ahead of them, ascending each step with the precision of a NPC (though here and there his body model seemed to get caught on something invisible, his leg stretching unnaturally before it would snap back into it's proper place some several steps ahead).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene had remembered that it was actually day when he'd arrived in the temple, but when he'd exited, it had been night. And the way the lighting on Judy had freaked out, and now the sometimes herky-jerky movements of their messenger guide...She wasn't going to say anything, but given they were supposed to be in Arabia and all the other problems, Eugene was starting to suspect that something had gone VERY wrong when the game had loaded. Maybe it was broken to begin with and they were now trapped in a game with no visible way out, as were Peter and Judy, WHEREVER they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eugene didn't feel like freaking out Judy with that particular thought. Not just yet. Maybe it was just early loading glitches that would smooth out the longer they played, or would fix itself as they moved things forward. Either way, any further rumination would have to wait as they reached the top of the massive flight of stairs, the temple of the oracle towering above them as braziers as large and Judy was now tall blazed with fire and bathed everything in a red-orange hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I must leave you, oh chosen champions\" The messenger said with a bow, and without another word simply turned and walked away, getting stuck on one of the pillars fro a moment before simply blipping out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" the chosen of Ares and the blessed of Aphrodite said in unison, but before they could do anything else, the heavy wooden doors of the temple swung open and revealed a lavish and extravagant temple interior that was piled high with gold offerings, silks and incense.At the far end of the chamber was a dais, upon which a beautiful woman (though a pale shadow compared to Eugene) sat, a serene smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\" Eugene cooed, unable to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the oracle\" Judy whispered, \"I, uh, wasn't expecting her to actually live up the stories about being so pleasant to look at\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me!?\" Eugene huffed, suddenly offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I uh, I mean, uh, for a mortal?\" Judy stumbled, suddenly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I'll remember that, buster\" Eugene said with an icy tone, turning her nose up at her flumoxed friend and striding in, putting ALL of her curves to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene just mentally kicked himself as he followed after.</span></div></div>",

They passed the untidy mounds of offerings that ranged from simple coins to elaborate golden statues to even...wait, was that a SHIP hanging above them!? Judy and Eugene craned their heads as they passed below the enormous hull, from which draped even more coins and various trophies, some of which appeared extremely exotic in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" He muttered, wishing he could see the rest of the vessel. Ancient Greece was somewhat known for it's elaborate temples but actually seeing one, well, one that hadn't been decked out in weapons and wall sized depictions of gory battles and a very beefy, very angry looking god pointing a spear in his face, back when she was a she, was pretty damn amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This ALMOST makes me want to forgive you for calling me ugly\" Eugene said in partial awe, but there was no hiding the venom in her voice. SHE was the blessed of Aphrodite, and SHE was the most beautiful in the room. In ANY room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\" Just began, but he stopped. There was no use arguing with her. 'Ugh, women' He thought as they approached the dais and the silk-clad oracle. There was a moment of silence as the two players were at a lack of what to do, the woman's creepy serene smile and her unblinking stare at both of them beginning to give Eugene the willies. But then the silence was broken as Judy and Eugene found themselves locked in place, unable to move as the oracle came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh chosen of the gods, you have truly saved all of Greece! You journeyed far and against the odds and faced down our foes in the terrible East!\" The Oracle rose from her seated position and stepped down the small flight of stairs towards Judy and Eugene, her silk robes flowing in the night breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this only the greatest tokens, know this for I have spoken. I bid thee congratulations on your quest, now go to your reward, and take some rest. For soon thou face the the darkened door, the fiery shadow of raging war, and without the secrets you have brought, all of our lives would have been for naught\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle smiled at the two heroes, and then turned away, walking over to the empty space next to the changed college students, who suddenly found themselves able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what just happened?\" Judy said, rubbing his massive arms to get rid of the numbness that had filled them while the computer character spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think we're in a cutscene? But it's messed up-\" Eugene was cut off as the Oracle began speaking once more to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Exotic creatures from far and away, you bring hope on the darkest day. The viper of the sands, the beauty'd jade, I come before thee, my hands splayed. Deliver to me that which I desire, the secret to save Greece from the fire. Completed be your noble quest, I release thee to a deserve'd rest\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle stood there for a very long moment, hands outstretched into nothing as her animation cycle began to loop before in the blink of an eye, she reappeared on the dais, the same smile on her face yet she stared straight ahead at the door, as she had when Eugene and Judy had entered the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, don't, uh, freak out...But I think our game is bugged. I think we somehow skipped to the last level!\" Eugene's big, brown eyes were open wide as she looked around in fear. If this was the penultimate level...They didn't have the key item they needed to move forward! They really had skipped directly to the end but they were stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. So you're telling me this is the end of the game? Dude, we can totally just end the game and get back to normal! BOOBS I'M COMING HOME!\" Judy bellowed in excitement. Not that it hadn't been fun seeing what it was like as a really strong guy, but he was definitely ready to be a she again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We...Judy, we need to give the Oracle whatever it is she's looking for! Without it, we're...we're stuck like this!\" Eugene's eyes were welling up with tears as she looked down at her incredible body. The whole 'sex god influence' moment aside, being a woman had been fun...But she definitely wanted to go back to normal! She wanted to go home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Was all Judy could say when the realization hit him. The juggernaut of muscled manliness staggered as his knees grw weak, and he collapsed against the dais. \"Peter!\" He wailed, tears finally filling his own eyes. He...SHE didn't want to be stuck like this! She had such a future ahead of her! Getting on at a museum! Maybe writing a novel! Having kids and being a better mom than hers ever was! It...it couldn't be gone! Not like this! All because she wanted to help some poor nerd ask his crush out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was in similar straits, though vicious sniffling and sheer man (or woman) power keeping them at bay as she went through her own mental anguish. So much for hooking up with Lindsey, or getting on at a game company. Or seeing mom again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy...Peter and Lindsey! THEY must be the 'viper' and the 'jade' things the Oracle was supposed to be talking to! If...If things are messed up, then maybe we just need to go find them? Maybe we just have to load into, uh, different levels! If we're near the end, then maybe they're back at the beginning! We just have to find them!\" Hope sprang into Eugene's bountiful chest as HE threw together the barest bones of a plan. \"This world is immersive, right? And we were supposed to be in Arabia, right? Then we just GO there and start looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wiped her nose on a bronze bracer, leaving a streak of snotty slime, \"O-oh y-yeah? How are w-we supposed to d-do that!? We don't e-even know what they lo-look like!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do!\" Eugene's voice was full of determination as he strutted over to Judy and lifted his slender arm, \"We just look for people that have <b>THESE</b> on their arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, tattooed against the flawless flesh of the geek's wrist, were five black bars.<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave one last look into the darkness of the slave ship, giving the terrified looking slave girl a grin that she hoped looked more confident than she felt. And then she was up the ladder, moving slowly and steadily and praying that the wood or the hatch didn't creak as she raised it up just enough to peek out onto the deck. Four shirtless men moved about the deck, one with a rag, the other carrying a crate, a third one messing with some rope and another one that the girl couldn't see, but could hear. The one that she assumed was the captain sat at the far end of the ship on a chair, grunting orders at the others in between drinking and fondling another girl in chains. She'd have to move fast and somehow take them all out, she'd only have one shot at this and if she failed, well...She had to suppose it said something about her state of mind that she ended up dead rather than chained below, waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was certain that, in this particular city, that was the Old Man on the Horse. And she was particularly certain that she had to stay away from him at all costs. Luckily though, there had been a large drum near the ladder, and by a even greater stroke of luck, one of the heavy mallets used for striking out a beat to the slave rowers had been left unattended. It hung heavy in her arms but it was the only thing that she had, and she'd have to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of peeking and memorizing the crew as they moved back and forth in almost predictable patterns, the girl summoned up her courage and lifted the hatch all the way up, barreling out of the hold as fast as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The crew member with the rag said dumbly as he spotted the blur of brown motion charging at him in the torch light. He had just enough time to scream before something fast and hard caved in his face. He gurgled once and slumped to the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One\" The girl grunted as she pivoted towards the crewman with the rope, who was now shouting at her. The man thrw the rope and the girl felt it slide around her, and she let out a raspy 'oof!' as the man tugged, the rope tightening around her throat and cutting off her oxygen. She resisted the urge to fall to her knees and her rapidly graying vision as she swung blindly ahead...And gasped sharply as the crewman flew over the side of the ship with a canned scream that sounded VERY familiar, as if it had been used in hundreds of movies and TV shows before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl rounded on the man with the box, who simply threw it at her before charging. She easily ducked beneath the box and thrust the drumstick forward, catching the man in his crotch. He squealed and fell to the deck, where she finished him off with a couple of rapid kicks to the head. The girl spun around, looking for the fourth crewman, only to hear a heavy tump behind her, and massive arms wrap around her tiny body, locking her in place as she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Bring her to me\" The captain slurred, and the girl felt herself lifted up like she was nothing. A giant must have been holding her as she was carried across the deck before being deposited on her knees at the foot of the captain's chair. She looked up, hared in her eyes for the leering man, glancing for just a moment at the slave girl next to him, who looked at her with sympathy but didn't dare move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you could escape? I don't know how you got out...but you'll wish you'd stayed in those chains, girl...\" The captain said as he held the girl's face in his leathery hand.  Another hand brushed away her stray hair before slipping down to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Fazad! Women are such mewling creatures, they desire to be shown proper dominance and...discipline.\" The captain licked his lips, \"I believe I need to sample my property before I sell it. You're very lucky, slave, only the luckiest get to know this pleasure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain leaned in for a sloppy kiss, and the girl spat in his face, mucus dripping off his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INSOLENT BITCH!\" He roared, raising his hand to strike her...</span></div></div>",

And then what, we stick out like a couple of olives in a date market while we poke around looking for Peter and Lindsey?\" Judy flicked away the tears in her smoldering eyes with a harsh laugh, \"You'd have better luck trying to sell a wooden horse to a bunch of second generation Trojans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all we've got, Judy! Unless you wanna stay here with Ms. Smiles over there or move into that house you almost broke and end up drunk cause we look like some god's mom and dad? I'm really not interested in being the starring role in some Greek comedy\" Eugene said, cocking a hand on one of his wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't complaining before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because we were being stupid and not paying attention to GAME. MECHANICS. But now we know that we're in a bugged game, right? I'm Good. At. Video. Games. and I think that if we just pay attention we might just be able to fix things before we really do end up stuck here and I'm popping out demigod babies every nine months until we both die five times from something you can take a goddamn Tylenol for back home!\" Eugene stamped his foot and ignored the jiggling of his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's still a literal world away! Do you even know how big the world is perceived to be now? Let's say that we do this, and we use your game mechanics, right? But if this...world is so detailed and life-like, it will take us weeks, if we're lucky, to get to Athens. I could probably make it, but YOU'RE not built for cross-country. And even if we made it without getting eaten by some mythological beasts, since if the gods are acting through us right now, you can bet there's a goddamn hydra out there, or a cyclops, just waiting to eat us. And then, and THEN, we somehow get a boat that is willing to sail into the HEART of Greece's most hated enemy?\" Judy got up, dusted her bulky body off and leaned against the Oracle's dais with a derisive snort, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weeks at sea, dealing a crew, probably a sea monster, pirates, and then it's just, you know, the tiny detail of trying to navigate what was then the LARGEST NATION ON EARTH and some how not die in our sleep five times simply because we're Greeks in Persia. Assuming, of course, we can even 'load' earlier 'levels'. Forget it, I may look like Hercules but I am NOT a fighter!\" Judy flexed a bicep for show, but it was true. She had NO idea of what to do if they actually got into a fight. Would the game take over? Or was it up to her just to swing a sword around and get lucky? And then what use was Eugene? He just looked gorgeous and hadn't demonstrated any kind of 'gameplay power'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want to wait here, like a coward? I don't know why it's not affecting us here, but Judy, if we DON'T take an active role in events, we're GOING to become part of the game, lives or not! What would have happened if we just went into that building and fucked? Do you really think it's just some coincidence that every time we were about to bang the game interrupted us? It WANTS us to play! If we just sit here we could end up as a couple of NPCs and NEVER get out!\" That was something Eugene was pretty concerned about. Down in the city everything had gotten...swampy, there were so many torches, and according to Judy's earlier history lesson when walking up to the Oracle's temple, she'd mentioned something about torches being a symbol of Eros. And there were a LOT of torches down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Like I told you on the stairs, Oracles were Apollo's domain! No other god can interfere in an Oracle's temple! Look, we're clearly supposed to 'rest' after turning in the quest, right? So to me, that means free room and board for the night. Given we can't advance anything, we can just live here until Peter and Lindsey catch up with us! And then we turn in the quest, fight the boss and go home!\" The towering goth stomped around the temple, kicking scattered tribute lightly as to not accidentally damage their potential future home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, what if THEY get stuck? We were given these bodies for a reason, there's clearly specific roles that WE have to play in order to beat the game! You're the warrior, the tank, you take the hits and give them. I'm clearly the money man...Well, woman, but I'm the one with all the gold right now. Maybe I have another power, who knows, but you don't have any cash, I do, so clearly what we are serves a purpose. What if Lindsey is a healer? Healers ALWAYS die first in video games, and what if Peter is some kind of a spell caster, or a stealth melee class? Or an archer that can't win a fistfight? Neither of those survive long without the support of the party\" Eugene was stretching the truth a little bit, he'd played World of Warcraft long enough to know that really, really good players in those classes could solo group content or take on enemy players teams on their own, but he had to convince Judy to get out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to believe that this game, as powerful and detailed and CLEARLY magical, would be that short-sighted and not let 'Immersive Mode' be free to do however you wanted. I'd honestly rather take my chances with trying to walk through the mythological nightmare. I'm not fucking leaving Eugene, so...Get used to those boobs. Maybe you can invent the bra why we wait\" Judy stepped up on the dais and shoved the static Oracle out of her way, taking a rather violent seat on the lavish pile of pillows and furs that were stacked behind the frozen soothsayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene fumed at the goth's stubborness. But then he got an idea. If reaching out to her and trying to make her see video game logic wasn't working...The blonde beauty that was actually a fat little nerd looked around the temple room for a few minutes, casting glances at Judy, who was busy rubbing her temples and muttering to herself. There was so much treasure here, there had to be a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Eugene cried out, his voice echoing off the high ceiling of the temple interior as he pulled a jewel encrusted sword out of a pile of gold coins, disrupting the balance of the pile and sending the currency spilling out across the stone floor noisily, causing Judy to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Gene, what are you doing?\" Judy tried not to chuckle as the geeky blonde struggled to hold the sword over his head, his arms wavering and impossibly pretty face scrunched in exertion, a shiny sheen of sweat already forming on his otherwise immaculate brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm gonna...oof!\" Eugene stopped trying to hold the sword which shouldn't have been that heavy, fall to the floor with a CLANG. He let out a long and heavy exhale from the strain and tried to lift it again, only managing to lift the blade about an inch from the floor this time. 'Well, this is awkward...' He thought, his plan already falling apart. But he wasn't going to give up, and began crab-walking as best he could towards the temple doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" Judy said as she stood up from the bed of cushions behind the unmoving Oracle, amused and confused as her friend slowly made his way out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene groaned as he dropped the sword once more, \"Ugh, why didn't I wake up in the temple of Athena? At least if I had to be a chick, I'd have some muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed and stepped down from the dais, taking three long strides with her powerful legs until she was next to Eugene. \"Athena is a bitch anyway. Did I ever tell you what she did to Medusa?\" She hefted the sword onto her shoulder with minimal effort, earning a tired grin from the weak beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna sacrifice a goat?\" Eugene made a slicing motion with his tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl could do nothing against the muscles that restrained her, pinning her face down against the deck as her curvy rear was thrust up into the air. She could feel the captain's leathery hands as they caressed her buttocks, and she gave a pleading stare up at the motion-less slave girl next to the captain's chair, who simply looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe this piece of meat will fetch quite a sum tomorrow at the auction...Though I could just keep it all for myself. What do you think, Fazad?\" The girl heard the ripping of fabric as what was left of her dress was torn apart, her bare skin shivering in the cool sea air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a wordless grunt in reply. There was the sound of metal jingling and the girl felt a large amount of clothing suddenly collapse over her feet. There was a sharp slap of her rear and she couldn't help but let out a whimper, fearing what was to come. Why did she have to play the hero? She scrunched her eyes tight, mentally preparing herself for what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, I am getting a bit bored with the other one...Wait, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl cracked open a dark brown eye, and through the veil of her dark hair could see something misty and...green? creeping over the deck railing in thick tendrils. The broken slave girl let out a scream as it curled around her and the girl swore that it looked like some kind of...dragon? The slave seemed to fade away into the green mist, her voice growing fainter and fainter as she disappeared from view...And the pair of iron shackles that had been around her wrist fell to the floor with a loud clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this!? What are you doing, witch!\" The captain roared behind her, and the girl was suddenly freed from the crushing grip. She spun around to see both men suffer a similar fate as the green mist curled around them. The two seemed to evaporate as they swung wildly at the mists, screaming as the strange mist dragons consumed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they were gone, their clothes fluttering to the floor in silence as the mist quickly retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to question providence, the girl quickly pawed through the captain's abandoned clothes and pulled out a large iron ring of keys and scurried back into the ship's hold, and the other tattooed girl.</span></div></div>",

She reached up and gently pulled Peter back to the couch, who gave her a quizzical look, \"But yes. Greece sounds FINE. And before everything went crazy I was writing a paper on Greek myths anyway, so maybe I'll get to put all that to good use!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's two for Greece...Guess it's down to you and me Lindsey, what do you want to do?\" Eugene said looking up again as Peter was pulled down. The rainbow haired girl put a sparkly finger to her pink lips for a moment and made an audible 'HMMMMMM' for dramatic effect as she thought about her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment Eugene swore he could hear the Jeopardy! theme playing from somewhere else in the dorm building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greece is fine, I guess! I mean if this is fun and stuff, we can just, like, play another game after!\" The displaced sorority girl said with a cheery smile. It honestly didn't bother her one bit, she really just wanted to see the cool and totally retro looking machine in action and if it really did all the things Eugene said it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majority rules, I guess\" Eugene said with a (mostly) mock sigh of disappointment. He settled his fingers over the keyboard and carefully typed in \"GREECE\" and hit enter. The machine made a buzzing sound before it began a series of mechanical clicks and something that Lindsey pointed out sound like an old dial-up modem, which only she had really any true knowledge of because of her computer classes and they were all young enough that they never knew of a time where one could not be on the Internet and use the phone at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of internal noises from the machine, silence returned to the room with a loud POP as two large black buttons snapped out from the top of the game, with the words 'TRADITIONAL' and 'IMMERSIVE' stenciled on them in chipped white lettering. A flap on the side flipped open and a tray holding four small figurines, each lacking much detail and each a bright primary color, slid out. There was what looked to be a blue large, muscled man holding a sword over his head, a yellow shorter human figure in what looked to be a toga carry what appeared to be a rock and chain in it's hands, a red half-horse, half-man creature with a bow and arrow...And what was very clearly Medusa, a green molded plastic tail extending from a human torso that was topped by a fanged head that was ringed with delicate looking plastic snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CHOOSE A GAME MODE\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? MORE choices?\" Peter complained as he rubbed his forehead. This was too much thinking for something that didn't involve a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush\" Judy said, softly bapping his left knee with a slap, \"It's just one more, right Eugene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. We just...\" Eugene paused and pulled up the game's box again to read more of the instructions, \"After we choose a game type, it'll let us choose our avatars. Then we just type in 'Player' and the number on the back of the miniatures, then just type in 'start' and it'll begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's pick something already!\" Peter said impatiently from his spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Eugene mumbled as he squinted at the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" The jock groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we choose Traditional mode, we have to input the number of spaces and then wait for it to print out the game map. Then it'll our dice and THEN we type in start\" Eugene said as he scratched his head. 'That was weird, was all that text really there just a minute ago?' The geek thought as he stared at what he had just assumed was an empty section of the box. He pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes; he just must have been seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked back to his friends, Judy who was frowning slightly, Lindsey who had pulled out her phone and Peter who was staring up at the ceiling. They were getting bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what does everyone want to do? Majority rules votes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fine, Eugene\" Judy said, slapping Peter's chest with a long nailed hand, \"Doesn't it Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, whatever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, show of hands, who wants...\" Eugene began.</span></div></div>",

He felt himself deflate a little; the geek had been hoping for Immersive mode to see just what exactly the game would do. Would it have played the role of dungeon master, or something like one of those old fashioned MUD games?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, democracy works!\" Eugene chuckled and with a tiny bit of dramatic flourish, stuck out his right index finger and pushed the big black button that read 'TRADITIONAL'. There was an audible click, and a whirring noise emanated from within the machine as a soft breeze of warm hot began to blow out from a tiny vent on it's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE INPUT GAME LENGTH\" The game spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, last big choice, how many spaces do we want to have?\" Eugene said as he glanced at the box and the column of rules that were under the word 'TRADITIONAL', \"We each get one normal dice to roll, singles and double rolls get two turns...If anyone rolls a six they have to pull a 'Challenge Card'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are those?\" Lindsey said, scooting her beanbag closer to the table. Eugene forced himself not to look at the blonde's breasts as they bounced up and down with each consecutive scoot and instead buried his head in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traditional mode has 'Action Squares' and 'Challenge Cards'. If we land on a square, the game will announce an action for us to perform...And the cards are sort of the same thing but they're just much more specific. They're kind of like Monopoly cards, they make the game more exciting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What game? All we've done is talk\" Peter muttered, getting a soft elbow to the ribs from Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please continue, Eugene\" Judy said sweetly as she glared at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Uh...Players can't roll again until they've done the Action Square or a Challenge Card, and we ALL have to reach the end of the game before the game ends. Whoever gets there first has to wait on the others, and then we all have to say 'Morphmanji!' for the game to end...And whoever got to the end first gets a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Three heads said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. That's all it says. 'The Player that reached the end first gets to make a wish'. I guess maybe one of us will have to type in something and we'll get a special ending?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds dumb\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It does! It's just a game, not like it can actually make wishes come true or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene shrugged, \"It's old. You know how old games can be. Anyway, since at max we can only move six spaces at a time, how many squares do we want? it will generate the Action Squares and Challenge Card spaces at random so we don't have to put those in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there, like, a default number of spaces?\" Lindsey said, giving the machine a curious poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the default is 36 spaces, but we could make it longer or shorter if we wanted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like 36. It totally sounds like a good number to play with the first time through\" Lindsey continued to poke the machine, her desire to crack it open and see how it worked growing stronger by the minute. It was just so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36 fine with you and Judy, Peter?\" Eugene asked, and his friends on the couch nodded. Satisfied, he looked down at the keyboard and typed in 'DEFAULT' on the small keys and watched as the word lit up on the one screen the game machine had, the red lights glowing brightly as they spelled out his choice. The geek pressed 'enter' with a chunky finger and sat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE WAIT. PRODUCING GAME MAP.\" The machine called out, and yet another unseen flap opened on the domed electronic device as paper, somehow already loaded, began slowly inching out of the set of rollers as the sounds of a printer buzzed from inside the faded plastic shell. The group took this time to use the bathroom or get some refreshments, and five minutes later they returned to the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table, draped off the side due to the game machine taking up most of it, was a black and white paper game board that had a set of four elaborate tiled paths that curled and twisted around and across each other, each path broken only by the words 'Action Square' and 'Draw Card' interjected at random points across the map. The only place that seemed to have a uniform symmetrical dispersion of 'Action Squares' were the points were each path intersected with each other, and at the very center was a small circle that had 'Morphmanji' printed across the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE SELECT AVATAR AND INPUT PLAYER ROLL ORDER. TYPE START AND ENTER TO BEGIN\" The game buzzed, almost as if it was slightly annoyed that it had to wait on the young adults to return to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard it. Let's pick who we're going to be.\" Eugene said, reaching out a hand as the lid of the miniature case flipped open and tiny servos raised the plastic figurines out to be selected. The nerd had thought about it, and how Peter's show of muscles had made his insecurity about his weight flare up...Even if it was just pretend, maybe it'd be nice to be the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIBS ON HERCULES\" Peter shouted, a freight train sized fist shooting forward and gabbing the muscled, sword swing warrior, knocking Eugene's hand out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER TZIMEROS, STOP!\" Judy shouted right as the jock's cable-like fingers wrapped around the blue swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Peter whined back, but then stopped as he saw that look in her eyes. He knew that look, and it always meant trouble. He let loose a mental sigh as he sat back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eugene's game. It's only fair that he choose first\" Judy said, matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Peter began, but fell silent as Judy's glare intensified, \"Ugh okay. Geno you get first pick bro\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks, Pete\" Eugene stammered, and with a shaking hand, pulled the blue muscle man out of his cradle, Peter letting loose a sigh of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIBS ON THE CENTAUR DUDE!\" Lindsey shouted, darting out to pluck the equinoid. Peter stared wide eyed at the development. BOTH of the muscled guys were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine\" He pouted, and reached out towards the machine, \"Guess I'll just play as Medusa then\" Peter's hands clasped the tiny gorgon and brought it up to his face, examining the yellow monster. \"Man, I can believe that someone this ugly WOULD be a monster! She must have been a horrible bitch\" He chuckled, and was promptly swatted on the back of the head by his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did NOT just say that! I'll have you know that Medusa is a VICTIM, not a MONSTER!\" Judy reached out and plucked the tiny yellow snake-woman from her boyfriend's palm, \"She was RAPED by Poseidon, and then tries to defend herself to Athena, supposedly a 'good' goddess, SHE just turned Medusa into a monster for daring to speak out against the gods! And then she got stuck in a cave and had to fight for her LIFE every DAY because of all the assholes that tried to KILL her just for their own personal glory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Eugene and Lindsey simply stared wide eyed at the now red-face goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, Medusa was a victim against impossibly hopeless circumstances, and since I'm the only one who wrote a paper about her,  I'M going to play her!\" Judy's nostrils flared with indignation as she stomped over and grabbed another lounge chair, abandoning Peter on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, babe, I didn't-\" Peter stammered as he tried to wade out of the emotional hot water he found himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Just pick the Or-The mace-guy and let's get started, okay?\" Judy said, plopping HER Medusa down on the game board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mace-guy? For someone majoring in mythology that sure doesn't sound like a technical term\" Peter said, and instantly regretted the petty comment. Not willing to risk getting sucked out deeper into the boiling hot water sea, he shut his mouth and grabbed the tiny red figure that was holding the rock and chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...We don't have to play if-\" Eugene suggested, but only received an angry sigh from Judy in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we've come this far, we're going to ALL play this game, Gene\" She said slowly and carefully, while staring daggers at her boyfriend who simply withered under her triggered gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...'kay\" Eugene mumbled. \"I guess give me your numbers and I'll type them in then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm player 4\" Judy snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, 3?\" Lindsey squeaked timidly as she put her green centaur on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two\" Peter mumbled, doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay uh just, uh, just a second!\" Eugene sputtered and he quickly typed the information into the game's keyboard. With Judy's Medusa entered, Eugene typed in START and then pressed ENTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGINNING QUEST OF THE TITANS. ALL PLAYERS ASSUME STARTING POSITIONS. DISPENSING DICE\" The game intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, my stomach hurts!\" Lindsey cried out suddenly, rolling off her beanbag, hands clutching her abdomen. Her numerous bands of jewelry creaking as her arms began to swell and change color, as if she was having an allergic reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey!\" Eugene shouted, but suddenly he felt hot. Really hot. he was instantly soaked in sweat as his breaths turned heavy and fast as the world suddenly became hyper-defined and over saturated with color. The geek collapsed backwards into his chair and felt impossibly heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I, Did-did someone spike my...drink?\" Peter said woozily as the world began swimming. He...he didn't do drugs they...drug tested players and...Peter's mind failed to finish it's train of thought as he toppled sideways on the couch and passed out, long strands of black hair falling across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Judy, a splitting migraine suddenly filled her skull, as did the intense urge to vomit. She stood and lurched towards the bathroom...Only to find her legs tripping over each other as she fell to the floor with a heavy, hissing thud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene was, literally, paralyzed. His body throbbed with what felt like electricity as he lay frozen and sprawled across the suddenly tiny feeling lounge chair. He could what felt like boulder sized droplets of sweat boiling up out of his skin and soaking every single article of clothing he wore as they hung heavily of of him, but there was nothing he could do. All he could do was stare up at the flourescent bulbs on the ceiling of the common room as their buzzing and off-white colors continued to intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he having a stroke? Did the machine explode and electrocute him? What was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the ringing, the buzzing stopped and the colors of the room returned to normal. And then a loud creaking noise filled his ears as the lounge chair burst apart and dropping him suddenly, and painfully, to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Eugene cried out, and was immensely relieved at the face he could talk and move again, pulling himself upright. He wiped his face and then froze as a giant, gloriously golden-browned tanned wall of flesh with fingers attached flew at his face. But when he froze, so did the giant hand. \"Wait, what?\" And that was when he noticed the deepness of his voice now, the thunderous rumble a far cry from his normally reedy, nasally tones. Strands of brown hair slid into his vision, and he cautiously raised what was obviously his had up to feel a mane of hair that was clearly NOT the short ear-length hairdo he preferred. He stared at the hair for a moment and then followed the alien hand down an arm that looked as if he'd spent a lifetime lifting impossibly huge weights. And he had TWO of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he looked down, and was greeted by a body that looked as if it had been expertly chiseled out of stone and laid bare to the world. Gone was his t-shirt, he was naked from the top down to his barely covered groin, with swollen, muscled pecks that topped what felt like an endless column of rippling abs that ran all the way down to twin trunks of legs that were swollen with powerful, tightly bound muscles. A loincloth covered his groin, made out of some kind of scaled and tanned leather...And he was absolutely sure about what was between his legs didn't belong to him. It was definitely NOT as huge as it currently felt, cradled in what felt like animal fur? Eugene was afraid to look and instead examined the elaborate laced sandals that wrapped his slab-like feet and ran up most of his shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been transformed! But..How? And why? Did the game do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, look at me!\" Eugene rumbled, but his eyes went wide and his jaw went slack as he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch across from him lay a stunning brunette woman, easily the prettiest he'd ever seen. Her angular features were still, her long-lidded eyes closed and her puffy red lips parted as she breathed slowly in and out, he large breasts rising as falling beneath the white toga that draped her frame. Long slender legs spilled from the bottom of the toga and ended in tiny feet that were wrapped in similar, if smaller sandals to Eugene's own, and two womanly arms hung limp and were decked in large bronze bracelets, one of which was attached to a heavy chain that spooled off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\" Eugene gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my stomach!\" A voice almost deeper than his own complained next to him, and Eugene's he snapped towards the source, his eyes practically exploding as he saw a MASSIVE creature, half-horse, half body-builder human struggle to sit up. Four powerful legs kicked slowly and a hairy tail thumped against the floor while the bearded, wild haired man-half groaned...And then froze in shock as red eyes snapped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH. MY. GAWD!\" The man roared in terror, \"I'M A DUDE HORSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey!?\" Eugene gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!?\" The centaur that was obviously his friend and current crush screamed, her legs kicking wildly and knocking the table across the room, the game machine clattering noisily as it threatened to tumble over the approaching table edge. Strangely enough though, the four tiny figurines and the similarly colored dice did not move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! It's me Linds! It's...It's Eugene!\" The geek scrambled to his feet and suddenly realized he TOWERED over everything. Before he'd been a fairly normal 5 foot 6 inches but now...He was WELL over 6 feet tall. \"Woah...\" He whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EUGENE!? LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED!?\" The half-equine former female whined as Eugene held out a hand, and was surprised at the powerful grip of the rough, leather hand that grabbed at it. \"Like, help me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene tensed his muscles and pulled against Lindsey's manly hand, silently lamenting the fact that this was the first time he'd held her hand and it had to be with her as a horse-monster. A MALE horse-monster. But he had no time to contemplate or complain, Lindsey's massive body came flying up at him as he clearly over-compensated his new strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEK!\" Lindsey bellowed as she FLEW across the common room, Eugene letting go of her hand in shock as she sailed into the kitchen area and crashed to a halt against the refridgerator, practically crumpling it in half. There was a moment of shocked silence before she stumbled to all fours and grabbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooww!\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jesus, I'm sorry!\" Eugene cried, but as he attempted to go help, a feminine grunt came from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, who...who spiked my drink? Ugh did I get sick or something, why does my...voice\" The woman on the couch said, her accented voice groggy as she pushed herself upright before freezing in place, staring down at her chest as her eyes widened in horror. \"HOLY SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\" Eugene said, caught between helping Lindsey and a sudden urge to help the former beefcake jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?\" The woman screamed as she scrambled across the couch, tripping over herself and as the chain drew taut, was pulled backwards with a screech. Eugene looked at the object that had weighed her down and blinked. It was...a rock? Or maybe a large pot? It was roughly cone shaped and was decorated head to toe in elaborate carvings. He couldn't read the words but the images certainly looked like greek things he'd seen on Wikipedia and in video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eugene!\" The newly giant teen explained to the shocked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Lindsey!\" The centaur wailed as she trotted back to the common room before stopping her tracks. \"OHMYGAWD THERE'S SOMETHING HANGING OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey flailed and twisted, trying her best to look under her hairy new body, but Peter and Eugene's eyes zeroed in on what it was: There, like a tank rifle and a pair of oil drums, was a large penis and balls dangling for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Linds?\" Eugene said, wondering if his new body had a package that large, \"You, uh, you're a guy now so, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG OMG OMG OHMUHGAWD!\" She roared and began prancing around bucking, which did NOT h elp matters. 'GET IT OFF! I WANNA TURN BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we can't!\" Came a oddly distorted voice from behind the couch. Lindsey stopped her wild bucking and clopped to a stop, her new manhood swinging wildly as she, Eugene and, after a moment, Peter looked around for it's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guysss heard Eugene, we have to finisssh the game before we can change back!\" The voice said with a soft hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Wait, Judy!\" Peter gasped and looked over the back of the couch, \"OH FUCK!\" He screamed again and tumbled backwards, landing on the floor of the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don-don't look at me! I'm a...I'm a gorgon!\" Judy wailed from behind the upholstery, \"If I look at you I'll turn you to ssstone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rustle and multitude of smaller, quieter hisses as scaly green shoulders rose above the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Eugene mumbled in shock as the head that followed was a twisting next of angry looking vipers who coiled and twisted and slithered back and forth. Long, similarly scaled arms were raised, elongated talon topped hands covering the entirety of Judy's new face as she slowly turned, revealing her reptillian new form. Her torso was a soft tan, the scales longer and more sequential and they flowed over a pair of modest breasts that were cupped in a silver and leather breastplate...And that was all she wore. A huge tail coiled and rose above the top of the couch as Judy rose high and higher, rising to ye level with Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all...mythological beingsss. The game changed usss. I'm a gorgon, Lindsssey isss a centaur, Eugene you're sssome kind of demigod, obviousssly and Peter...Oh Peter, I'm sssorry!\" Judy said as she bobbed and curled around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Did YOU dod this Judy?\" Peter said, rising unsteadily to his new feet and wobbling as his new curves jiggled, \"I...YOU SAID I WAS GONNA BE A MACE GUY! I'M A CHICK! AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ROCK!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sssorry! I wasss upssset! You're an oracle! The Pythia! You can sssee the future! The rock isss the Omphalosss Ssstone! It givesss you the visssionsss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, how can you, like, see us if you're covering your face?\" Lindsey asked with a involuntary clop of a hoof on the kitchen tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'sss the sssnakes! I can sssee out of them! It'sss asss weird for me asss it isss for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TURN ONE START. ALL PLAYERS MAY ROLL.\" The game announced from it's new spot in the corner. All four pairs of eyes (or at least three pairs and a multitude of small heads). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Guess We better start playing\" Eugene said, walking over and grabbing the small blue cube that rested next to the figurine he now macro-embodied.</span></div></div>",

It was so light (or perhaps h was just so strong) that he didn't even feel what little weight it would have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene! Be careful!\" Lindsey said, chewing on a rather blunt and dirty looking nail, her red eyes filled with worry. Judy simply bobbed up and down on her massive tail, head still in her hands and all the tiny eyes of the vipers staring at him. Peter wrung his tiny hands and kept glancing back and forth between Eugene and the canyon of cleavage that now hung from his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's...there's no skill involved right? Well, here goes...\" Eugene said, sucking in a breath and holding it as he tilted his hand sideways and watched as the blue cube seemed to fall in slow motion down towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dice clacked against the table and bounced along it's surface before spinning to a stop, revealing four white circles facing upwards towards the ceiling. Eugene let out the breath he had been holding, only to suck in a lungful of new air as he watched, in amazement, as his figurine moved four spaces on it's own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Guys, did...Did you see that?\" Eugene said, pointing a finger at the figure as it slid across the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it just move by itself?\" Peter said, taking a few steps forward before being stopped by the rock, pulling at the chain with a annoyed girly grunt as the Omphalos Stone slid forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It totally did! OMG!\" Lindsey said as she moved on all fours out of the kitchen and into the main common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you land on one of thossse sssquaressss, Eugene?\" Judy said as she slithered carefully around the couch. Her new form was MASSIVE, even longer than Lindsey AND Eugene were now tall. The newly empowered teen shuddered involuntarily as he watched the former goth uncoil before watching the tiny blue miniature come to a stop on the final square which had the words 'Action Square' typed upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION SQUARE: YOU FIND YOUR PATH AHEAD OBSCURED. CONSULT AN ORACLE FOR GUIDANCE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to face Peter, who blinked in confusion. \"What?\" He said dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby...You gotta give Eugene guidance. That'sss what an Oracle doesss...\" Judy hissed softly, slithering around to her now much smaller boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how, uh, how do I do that?\" Peter said, nervously eyeing Judy's new body and shying away from the hissing vipers that now made up Judy's hair. He took a step backwards and Judy flinched, stopping in her trac-well, slither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Judy mumbled, arching backwards away from Peter, clearly hurt by his reaction, \"Well, uh, you have to look into the Omphalosss Ssstone and breath deep itsss myssstical vaporsss. That'sss how it worksss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Peter said is disbelief, looking at Judy and then at the decorated stone that he was chained to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think you, like, have to get high, Peter!\" Lindsey offered, but was then distracted as one of her hooves clacked against something shiny. She looked down and cried out, \"Oh! Oh no, not my Lake Reno bracelets! I got those with Bethany in high school!\" She pouted, awkwardly lowering herself down to scoop the fragments of metal up in her own large hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, these oracles were just pot-heads? I thought they were like demigods?\" Peter asked, bending down to peer into the opening at the top of the cone-shaped rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda? The sssmoke wasss sssupposssed t come from the godsss...\" Judy said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do I light it? Do I use it like a bong or something?\" Peter looked the rock over and found four additional openings opposite of each other on the sides of the artifact, but he couldn't see anything on the inside, just darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh...\" Judy couldn't help but let loose a snarled chuckle, \"Oraclesss often danced to gain the godsss attention, and then the godsss would allow the ssstone to work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" Peter deadpanned, staring up at his former goth beauty with a blank face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta dance! Ssshake that thing, girl!\" Judy said as she double coiled over in a hissing fit of laughter. Even the snakes on her head seemed to take on a jovial appearance as they bobbed up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't dance! I'm...I'm a football player not a ballerina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, um, kinda look like a stripper now though\" Lindsey joked, looking up from a VERY concentrated effort to get her broken jewelry back on her hairy arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up you bimbo!\" Peter pouted, crossing his arms as best he could in front of his new assets. \"Ugh, how do you chicks do ANYTHING with these!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here honey, let me-\" Judy said, lowering herself down and sliding her hands off her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUDY DON'T!\" Eugene cried out, and her turned away as Judy's newly uncovered eyes turned towards him, flashing a sickly green-gold before she cried out and covered her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod! Eugene, Peter I...I'm sssory! I wasssn't thinking! Are you guysss okay!?\" Judy curled in on herself, the snakes darting back and forth between the shaken oracle and the hiding geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're fine, uh, fine. We're gonna need to fix that though, we can do this if you can't look at us\" Eugene said, letting out a sigh of relief. He looked around and after a moment of thought, grabbed one of the two destroyed lounge chairs and stripped the fabric from them, fashioning a crude blindfold. He walked over towards Judy's cowering form and slowly brought his hands close to the intently staring nest of snakes. After a very tense moments of shifting hands, claws and scales around, Judy was now fitted with a dull blue band of upholstery, blocking her deadly gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Eugene!\" Judy said as she patted her face, which was actually still quite attractive now that Eugene could see it. It wasn't really all that bad to look at save for the instant death part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, um, now what?\" Lindsey grunted as she dropped her ruined bracelets back to the floor, \"Those were my favorite ones...\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, I guess you gotta do a dance or something Peter. Rules say we can't roll again until we do what the game wants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is complete bullshit! Like what kind of dance am I supposed to do?\" Peter stamped a sandaled foot in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...Oh, what about Wrecking Ball!\" Lindsey offered, a large grin on her rugged face, showing off a myriad of teeth that were in dire need of a trip to the dentist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT twerking!\" Peter hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jussst do sssomething Peter. There are no godsss ssso we jussst have to pleassse the game\" Judy groaned, \"The quicker thisss isss over the quicker we go back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then...Uh\" Peter looked around and took a deep breath before he...</span></div></div>",

Her snakes drooped in clear reptile disappointment. \u201cYou decssssided to do the Hokey-Pokey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShu\u2026. Shut up.\u201d puffed Peter in the midst of shaking his leg all about. He tried to turn himself around, but the weight of the stone was too much for his reedy arms. he dropped the stone with an ugly <i>CRACK</i>, and fell back on the couch, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe floor!\u201d cried Judy. Her lithe snake body glissaded across the room to the Omphalos and the circle-shaped indent it was resting in. \u201cThe RA\u2019sssss gonna <i>kill</i> ussssss, Pete!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026. put a rug over it\u2026 Jude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr we could totally wish for a new one!\u201d Lindsey rumbled, goofy grin spread across her chapped lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wheezed and extended a dainty middle finger at the horse-man-girl, whose responding laugh sounded an awful lot like a whicker. He slumped onto the couch, chest heaving from the apparently unaccustomed effort of doing <i>anything</i> it seemed, a pool of black hair spilling onto the cushion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, uh, alright there, Pete?\u201d ventured Eugene, reaching a hand out towards his friend before thinking better of it, despite some quiet, remote urge <i>insisting</i> that he do. He never was a touchy-feely kinda guy and with these big hands and Peter\u2019s new\u2026 everything, helping him out seemed like a danger-fraught idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had less qualms about Pete\u2019s new smooth bits and wiggled over quickly, gently stroking his forehead with a taloned hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe massaged her throat to soften the natural growl of her voice. \u201cAre you okay, babe?\u201d she rasp-cooed as best she could. Peter nodded, his half-lidded eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene smiled absentmindedly at them. It was sweet to see how much the two cared for one another. Still, that little voice in the back of his head said that this was <i>wrong</i>, that such a wretched <i>monster</i> shouldn\u2019t be anywhere <i>near</i> such a delicate and helpless damse\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene pinched the bridge of his nose, <i>hard</i>. Damn intrusive thoughts. Must be all this testosterone and muscles or whatever. Man, Peter had to have some serious fortitude to be a nice guy with all of <i>this</i> against him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene was pondering the pitfalls of his physique, Lindsey had lifted the Omphalos to Peter\u2019s face at his behest. He furiously sniffed at it, face alternating between sultry concentration and smoky disgust, full lips almost always drawn up in a bow of consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells like <i>rock</i>,\u201d he whined in between sniffs. \u201cThis is the shittiest superpower <i>ever</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could see Judy\u2019s brow underneath the azure cloth, but if her practically-spitting snakes were anything to go by, she wasn\u2019t pleased with her prophet-boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ssssss not a ssssuperpower,\u201d she explained, voice edged with strained patience. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessssssssing of Apollo. You\u2019re a vehicle for the word of the <i>godssssss</i>, Petey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had given up on huffing rock-gas and had purloined a couch cushion instead, sulkily hugging the pillow in front of his chest-pillows. \u201cSo what, I\u2019m supposed to make this pervert Apollo-dude <i>horny</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ssss not\u2026\u201d started the gorgon, before bringing a grimy yellow nail to her lips. \u201cActually, that might work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was <i>kidding,</i> Jude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know some good moves!\u201d Lindsey piped up \u201cBody roll, th\u2019 belly dance, and\u2026\u201d She turned her fiery gaze downwards at her abbreviated torso. \u201c... I prob\u2019ly can\u2019t teach you any of \u2018em now, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene kept a polite distance from the conversation. Peter didn\u2019t seem in the mood to take any male-advice right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, meanwhile, was lifting her petite boyfriend up by his armpits, his tiny feet pinwheeling out from under his toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLe<i>ggo</i>!\u201d he moaned. A stray foot caught Tudy right in the scaled ribcage, and Peter balked. \u201cOhmigodareyoualrightbabe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, who didn't even flinch at the accidental kick, gained a predatory-in-two-senses curve to her lips. \u201cPeter.\u201d Her snakes moved closer to her boyfriend\u2019s face, but she flicked them back with a toss of her head. The oracle flinched. \u201cRight now, honey, I\u2019m a sssssssssnake-lady that killsssssss anything ssssshe looksssss at. If you\u2019re a good boyfriend \u2014 <i>and I know you are</i> \u2014 you\u2019ll wiggle your assssss for <i>five sssseeecondsssss</i> so I can be <b>normal</b> again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded numbly, and Judy returned him to the ground with a smile. Peter cleared his throat with a pitched cough, and, in an attempt to regain some male ego, leveled an imperious finger at Gene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> doing this in front of him, though.\u201d A brief flicker of remorse flickered over his face and he shrugged at the musclebound nerd. \u201cUh, sorry, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Lindsey\u2019s mouths opened to protest the <i>obviously</i> unfair treatment, but Eugene was already walking around a corner, hands raised in mock surrender. \u201cAll good, man.\u201d he cried over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll good.\u201d he mumbled after safely out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the next five minutes trying to convince the weird intrusive voice that things <i>were</i> all good, that the <i>right</i> it was insisting that he had to march in there and guide the nubile Oracle\u2019s movements himself really didn\u2019t exist and plus that might ruin their friendship and oh yeah Peter was a <i><b>GUY</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sibilant instructive hisses coming from Judy and Peter\u2019s sullen moans didn\u2019t help much in that department, and only really exacerbated his brain-horniness. Fortunately, the baritone giggles and didactic tittering from Lindsey made it so the massive thing in his loincloth didn\u2019t actually move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK?!\u201d came a soprano screech from the commons, and Eugene leaped to his feet and rushed to the noise, hand jumping towards where a scabbarded sword would hang (if he'd had one, as the game had failed to provide weapons or objects outside of that weird stone when it changed all their clothes and bodies).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 to see Peter in what appeared to be mid-hip-shimmy, hands raised Shakira-style in the air, the fulsome flesh of one cheek outlined by the white cloth of the toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>second</i> thing he noticed, and the thing that everyone seemed to be reacting to, was the clouds of blue smoke billowing out of the grounded Omphalos. Both Judy and Lindsey were slithering and backing away respectively, and Peter was testing the limits of the chain in an attempt to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Peter?!\u201d boomed Eugene, stepping towards the frightened brunette, but a cry from Judy stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ethylene gasssssss, Gene! You\u2019ll passssss out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud rose to cover the aghast Peter, \u201cThen why -<i>kaff</i>- am <b>I</b> -<i>cough</i>- good in\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence fell over the commons that no one dared to break. The quiet hiss of gas and Judy\u2019s snakes were the background noise to the loud thumping of everyone\u2019s hearts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA footstep sounded from the cloud. Then another. And another, until Peter emerged from the smoke, eyes half-lidded, secret smile on his face and hips pivoting wildly with each catwalk strut towards Eugene. The Omphalos was tucked underneath his left arm with no visible difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Pete?\u201d half-laughed Eugene as he took a nervous step backwards, but Peter\u2019s languid gait only lengthened its stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeero,\u201d breathed what might be Peter, in an accent that was far thicker and steamier than a few minutes ago. He was upsettingly close to Gene, enough that he could feel the erstwhile-beefcake\u2019s breath on his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Brave, <b>strong</b></i> hero.\u201d hummed the oracle, who absentmindedly traced a finger around the square bulk of one of Gene\u2019s pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Hey.</b>\u201d growled Judy possessively, dragging herself forward before Lindsey\u2019s thick arm impeded her path. Contrite at her near-gaffe, the gorgon folded her arms and slumped back on her coils, the angry flick of her tail betraying her true thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was looking dead forward, eyes rolled up towards the ceiling, not wanting to piss off Peter when <i>hopefully</i> he turned back to normal. His breath was hitched in his chest, as if its release would spell the start of a <i>very</i> bad decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter drew in a breath, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter took a deep breath, his bountiful boobs swelling just enough to brush against Eugene's lower torso, a slender arm outstretched towards his face and Eugene felt something massive twitch within the primitive pants he wore as he chanced a look down at the oracle. Peter was wreathed in the blue gas as it curled lazily from the Omphalos, pooling down around his tiny feet and drifting lazily along his arms and between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's tiny hand reached up and jut barely reached Eugene's towering chin, pulling his head gently but forcefully down to stare into the oracle's big brown eyes. The blue gas curled along Peter's fingers and drifted across Eugene's chiseled face as tendrils entered his new nostrils. Just a whiff of it made Eugene's head swim. He reached out and set a hand on Peter's wide hips to keep himself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh brave, strong, <b>HANDSOME</b> hero, born again no longer a zero\"</i> Peter intoned,<i> \"Strength you desire of body and mind, you seek to leave all weakness behind. Your path ahead is fraught with peril, your group should find some new apparel. The first object that you hold, will help you be fierce and bold.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's head was submerged in thicker bands of the blue gas and he closed his eyes as he wobbled on his feet, pulling Peter closer for...support. The two of them began to sway as if moving to some unheard music. Someone said something off to the side but Eugene couldn't tell who it was or what they said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Long shall be your current quest, there will be time of much needed rest. At touch of night, on turn of three, with great haste come back to me\"</i> And then to EVERYONE'S surprise, Peter lurched up, grabbing Eugene by the back of the neck and pulling him down into a startled (and deep) kiss, his free hand slid down Eugene's chest, a soft palm dancing lightly along the bulge that was pressing against the leather and fur loincloth...And then with a soft breeze from an unknown source, the blue clouds retreated swiftly back into the interior of the Omphalos, and Eugene opened his eyes. Instead of a pair of dreamy, sparkling brown pools instead there were two brown pinpricks amid a sea of terrified white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips parted with an audible pop. And then the screaming began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK FUCK FUCK GROSS FUCK SHIT WHAT THE FUCK!?\" Peter screamed, dropping the prophetic gas device to the floor again as he violently shoved against Eugene, the giant geek not moving as Peter flopped backwards with a girlish 'EEK!' as his boobs threatened to smother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\" Judy hissed in alarm, uncoiling and sliding against the tile, curling up around the feminine form of her boyfriend, who was currently spitting and blowing raspberries as if to banish the taste of his friend from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE THIS GAME! WHY'D YOU DO THIS TO ME JUDY!?\" Peter sniffled as watery tears formed in his wide brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sssaid I wasss sssorry!\" The scaled goth whined, reaching out to grab the stricken young adult in a tight embrace, her tail coiling around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! LET ME GO!\" The reluctant priestess squirmed against his girlfriend but given how small and weak his body was, and how Judy was now basically one giant muscle, it was a futile effort. He glared daggers past the vipers that were flicking their tongues across his closest cheek and smearing salty eye-water across his face. \"HOW COULD YOU!?\" He said, pointing a twig-like finger at Eugene's dumbfounded, if hunky, form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, dude I...I didn't-It was the gas!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE! JUDY STOP I CAN'T BREATHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon had steadily been coiling tighter and tighter around her beloved, not just out of comfort because it had felt...right? She blinked behind her haphazard blindfold and relaxed as Peter sucked in a huge gulp of air. Judy stared out of the multitude of snake eyes at him, growing more and more used to the 'double reflection' vision, like how it was when you closed one eye and possibly stood on your head. He was so small now, so vulnerable and confused. She loved Peter, he could be a bit of an ass, especially about his former body but now she just wanted to hold him close and stare into his new womanly eyes....Forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt a taloned hand brush against her blindfold before she shook her head, her snakes hissing in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sssorry, babe. I'm jussst, I'm sssorry you had to do that! It'ssss okay, it'ssss just...It'ssss jussst the game. It doesssn't mean anything!\" She slithered about until she had mostly unraveled, her new bulk taking up a rather large portion of the common room, but still kept her arms wrapped protectively around Peter's tiny waist. A single strand of her snake hair reached out and stroked against Eugene's neck before a tiny hand smacked it away. Judy resisted the sudden urge to hiss and squeeze the tiny human in her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the guy that STOLE MY MUSCLES! What's next, is the game gonna make me fuck him or something?\" Peter pouted, still glaring at Eugene who gave an apologetic shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy figured it was probably best to not mention that most oracles, at least according to the greek legends, remained virgins, only stepping down from the role AFTER they had sex. She wasn't sure if any of them could handle that particular revelation...Or if t would cause Peter to get some crazy thought in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, what was that like Pete?\" Lindsey asked with a swat of her tail. The long hairs tickled as they whisked along her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bad! That's what it was like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's REAL descriptive, totally the answer I wanted\" Lindsey crossed her bulging arms and her thick lips turned into a frown. She snorted like a horse and tapping a hoof on the tile impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene was pondering what the Oracle Peter had said. Seek new apparel? Did that mean armor or something? But all their clothes had changed...What if he went back to his room and put on a new shirt? And what was that about the next object he would hold? The geek looked down at the scattered debris from both his and Judy's lounge chairs, spying a splintered chair leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder...' He thought, bending over and reaching a hand out towards the ruined furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what the hell is it like for a girl having junk the size of my head, Lindsey!? Everything got all blue and shiny and it's like I HEARD the words before I said them and I was moving like a damn robot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally didn't look like a robot tho. But you were, like, acting like a such a slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter bristled at the insult but couldn't exactly deny it. His description of what had actually happened was a bit of a lie anyway. When the gas had taken hold it seemed liked nothing really mattered aside from getting close to Eugene, touching his muscles and telling him that...Fortune? Prophecy? Whatever it was, Peter had WANTED to do it. \"Well whatever. That's what it was like. I saw Geno reach over and grab part of one of those chairs like he's doing right now and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white light as Eugene's fingers curled around the tiny chair leg, it's ruined form gorwing large and heavy as it morphed into a large sword almost as long as Eugene was now tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG!\" Lindsey gasped. All of Judy's vipers curled away hissing from the light, and Peter simply stared at the magic scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was just like what I saw! Did...I really did see the future!' He thought as his jaw went slack. \"Dude...\" Was all that came out of his mouth, watching as the light shimmered and danced across Eugene's seemingly naturally oiled muscles. The buxom boyfriend didn't realize he was biting his lower lip as he stared at what had once been his little pipsqueak nerd friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light faded as Eugene slowly brought the sword above his head. It still shimmered with a magical light, but only along the edge of the blade. It had a comfortable weight, heavy yet balanced, and it made a soft whistling noise as he swung it in a lazy arc through the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool\" He muttered to no one but himself, not noticing Lindsey and Judy wincing with each swing. 'I wonder if putting on new clothes will give me armor?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION COMPLETE. CONTINUE TURN ONE\" The game buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, it'sss your turn\" Judy hissed softly, uncoiling her boyfriend's fragile female form towards the game, scooping up the Omphalos since outside his 'oracle' form, Peter seemed rather incapable of any physical exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Uhh...\" Peter mumbled, looking away from Eugene for the first time in several minutes, still not realizing he'd been biting his lip, and took a tiny step towards the game that had, for now at least, ruined his life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter took a hesitant step towards the softly buzzing game as Judy slithered behind him, carrying the Omphalos. He HATED being so small and weak that he couldn't even lift a rock, he HATED being a woman with gigantic sweater puppies, larger than Judy had ever had in her normal form, hanging off his chest and he HATED the fact that he had to play this STUPID game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had to play it, otherwise they'd all be stuck like this. HE'D be stuck like this. Some mewling little woman that only seemed capable of doing anything when high as a kite of god-gas...Or whatever the hell it was that made him see the future and grope Eugene up and down. As they reached the table Peter cast a look over his shoulder and moved his waterfall of silky black hair out of the way to stare at his friend in worry. Now that he was only inches away from the clearly magical and VERY dangerous machine, it suddenly seemed a LOT safer over by Eugene. Especially with that sword and those muscles...And he wasn't quite comfortable with the fact that he was also inches from a snake-lady with instant death vision, even if she had been his girlfriend. Hell, it even looked safe with the burly, unclean centaur than where he was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete?\" Judy rasped softly, placing a large clawed hand on his barren shoulder, causing her boyfriend to shake in surprise. Or had it been a flinch? It was hard to tell anymore with the little human female. The strong confident male he'd been just a little while ago seemed to be gone and really it just made Peter look even smaller to her. Weaker. Feminine. Pretty. Like really pretty. Pretty like Judy USED to be. The vipers attached to her head began to hiss intermittingly but she silenced them with a somehwat violet shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, it'sss your turn\" Judy released Peter's shoulder and reached down towards the yellow die that was on the game map, grasping it between her talons and pulling...Only for it to not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" She said, casting a blindfolded look at her boyfriend before trying again, only to get the same result. The small yellow cube refused to move from it's place on the table. \"It's, uh, not moving guys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Here, maybe you just can't get a good grip with those terrible nails\" Peter said batting aside Judy's claws and plucking the dice off the table, \"See? Easy! So easy a WOMAN could do it!\" Peter said, sticking a soft red tongue out and then immediately regretting the annoyed look on most of Judy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's, um, part of the magic?\" Lindsey called out from behind them, \"Like how only Thor can use his hammer in the movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it\" Judy said, turning towards her fellow monster and nodding, \"Sssort of a 'only THEY who be worthy can possssssesss the power of Thor' type sssituation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it is, I'm rolling\" Peter huffed, and dropped the dice back towards the table. It bounced and rolled and came to a stop, five black dots shining up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice\" Peter said with a grin that revealed his perfect white teeth. And then he gasped, \"GUYS ITS MOVING AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the small yellow plastic figure that was a gross misrepresentation of the body Peter now possessed was moving across the board, skipping the Action Square on the third tile and landing safely on a blank space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOO! I don't have to do anything!\" He cheered, giving a victory hop that he immediately regretted from all the things on him that now jiggled. He stumbled, but felt a scaly weight pressing up behind him. He looked and saw part of Judy's tail curled upwards, preventing him from another comical fall backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" He said dismissively, \"So, who's turn is it ne-\" Peter was eager to move back to the safe area over by Eugene when the music let out a tiny DING, and a blue card slid out of the mysterious machine. It was almost as if the machine was building these ports and interfaces the longer it was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what now!?\" He whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mussst be a Challenge Card\" Judy said, reaching out and pulling it slowly from the previously unseen slot. She handed it to Peter because she obviously was having trouble looking at things right now. \"Here. Read it.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter took the card from Judy's green fingers, cleared his throat, and read what was printed on the card's surface in bold print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A priestess has no need to carry her own riches. Find five individuals among the masses to serve and carry your burdens. Upon task completion, you will be able to move one additional space per turn. Failure to complete challenge will result in moving one less space per roll.\" Peter flipped the card over and looked for any more text, but it was blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what does that mean?\" He asked, looking at Eugene for answers, who simply shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, um, it seems like you need to find five non-players and it'll give you a mobility boost so if you roll a three, you move four. Or if you don't do it, the next time you roll a five you'll only move four spaces. Or whatevs\" Lindsey said, clopping forward.\"I don't think it means us because we're players...So do we have to go out into town and find people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peter and I will be the only ones able to go out since you and Judy are, well, uh, monsters\" Eugene said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! We're already gonna attract a shitload of attention with me looking like Conan and Peter looking like Gal Gadot. And Peter can't carry that rock he's chained to on his own! And what happens when we find five people? How do we convince them to just follow two random cosplayers back to the dorm?\" Eugene said, sliding the giant shining sword into the scabbard that had appeared around his loincloth's waist roughly around the moment the broken chair leg had transformed into a giant sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess you'll have to find out, unless you're good with not getting a movement bonus, Pete\" Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they could BOTH usss sssome fresssh air away from usss monssstersss\" Judy hissed in anger. She released her grip on the Omphalos and turned away from Peter, who, not expecting the weight, was pulled down to the floor with a girlish 'oof' as she slithered away and sat angrily on her coils away from the group. She should just show them who was the monster! One look at she'd be able too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she shook the notion off. After a few minutes of discussion, Eugene and Peter decided to...</span></div></div>",

He pulled at the gold chain connecting him to the Omphalos and began stomping towards the dorm's main doors...Only to get stuck walking in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH THIS STUPID ROCK!\" He screamed, turn around and giving it a petulant kick with his sandals, which only succeeded in nearly knocking him over again. There was a hissing cough from the corner as Judy began snickering, a yellow claw pointed at him mockingly. His full lips parts in anger as he was about to rattle off another insult to the hideous creature when Peter's line of sight was blocked by a wall of muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Pete. I'll carry it for you\" Eugene said as he lifted the Omphalos up with a single giant hand, palming it like Peter used to palm basketballs in the gym. The beefy geek effortless tucked the magical stone under his arms, the muscles flexing like well oiled machinery. Really well oiled. Peter closed his mouth and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks, Geno\" He said, feeling his face run hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's the least I can do. We'll never get anywhere if you can carry it, plus this is sort of all my fault\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is. Also, is anyone else really thirsty? Because I'm totally thirsty\" Lindsey quipped as she headed back towards the common room's kitchen, gently opening the ruined fridge and pulling out one of the crudely disguised six packs that the students had hid in a box of Coca-Cola cans. \"Really if you'd just stayed in we could be watching a bitchin' movie right now. Also pick us up some more beer while you're out? These are totally mine now\" The centaur pulled a can out of it's plastic ring and with dexterity that her new fingers shouldn't have had, popped open the top and began chugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash similar to how Eugene had gained a sword, the tiny can of beer shimmered and glowed, expanding outward until it was a massive urn held aloft in one hand by the sorority girl, rivulets of what looked and smelled like wine running down into her messy beard. Setting the urn down, the usually well mannered blonde let out a thunderous burp and looked down at the changed beverage in surprise before breaking out into a whickering chuckle. \"Uh, nevermind. Guess whatever we use now turns period appropriate! Man, this is really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Eugene just blinked as they watched their friend take another long, messy drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, let's walk. I don't want my truck turning into one of those horse carts\" Peter said, looking up at Eugene, who had a look of disgust on his face as he started at Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itsss called a chariot you bimbo\" Judy muttered quietly from her sulking corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I don't think I could fit in a normal car anyway right now. But yeah, let's get out of here and do this thing\" Without bidding the two former girls as much as a goodbye, Peter and Eugene hustled towards the door side by side. Peter opened the glass doors and moved through first as Eugene ducked as they exited out into the warm summer evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took a deep breath of fresh air as they stared out over the deserted campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Where do we find five people, and how do we convince them to just follow us back here?\" The towering titan wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what we should do first, we should go to the mall and get that chick at the store to fix this!\" Peter said, pointing a nail in the direction of the shopping center. \"Tell her to give you your money back and end the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't\" Eugene replied with a shake of his head, his brown, Fabio-like hair flowing in the soft breeze, \"It's after 5. The mall closed twenty minutes ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods damnit!\" Peter kicked a small rock with his sandal, \"Well, we could always try the off-campus frats? I know that Psi Iota Mu Phi Sigma still has some guys staying there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good a place as any to start, I guess\" Eugene shifted the Omphalos under his arm and then took off walking, long strides almost jerking Peter along before the currently athletically incapable jock whined, slowing their pace to a much more manageable stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Jeremy is gonna say when I show up looking like this, though. Dude's a bit of a horn dog\" Peter wondered out loud as he trailed behind Eugene, his eyes absent mindedly settling on the rear of the loincloth, the shifting gluteous muscles pulling the raven haired former man into an almost hypnotic trance. It was a nice distraction from his own jiggling, bouncing bits and Peter off-hand began thinking about stealing a bra from Judy's dresser. Not like that scaly, flat and currently-acting-like-a-bitch bitch needed one anymore with that tacky metal breast plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I don't think he'd try anything with me standing there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I really appreciate it...Even if this is, like, your fault\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm sorry. Hey, you, uh, wanna talk about what happened?\" Eugene cast a look over his shoulder to look at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. OH! No. Absolutely not. we're never going to talk about any of this again! And if you do I'll kick your ass. Or something!\" Peter blinked rapidly and shook his head, sending his long black mane of hair flying as he pulled himself out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Fair enough\" Eugene chuckled. All things considered it hadn't been TOO awful. For a moment after the game had started he'd half expected to have to fight his friends or some cyclops or something would have come charging out of the game. So far, outside of the transformations, it really hadn't been all that terrible. Definitely not 'full of peril' like the oracle next to him had decreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked for a few more minutes in silence, the jingling of Peter's chain the only real sound outside the normal late afternoon ambiance of the town. Even in lock-down there was still the distant roar of traffic as the world continued to spin beyond the otherwise closed college campus. It was pretty peaceful, even if the high desert breeze felt a little chilly on Eugene's bare chest. But that peace was broken as they rounded the corner or the Sciences building and ran smack dab into campus security. Specifically Perry Logan, the security guard who thought of himself as the World's Best Cop but was very much the opposite in almost every way. The man was short tempered and had trouble hiding his dislike of individuals that were not American. He typically only worked during the day when classes were in session, but with half the campus security leaving for lockdown, the ugly man had chosen to work a double shift for more pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, its Officer Friendly\" Peter groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balding, middle-aged man had just been starting his smoke break when two had appeared. Some Kevin Sobro-lookalike and some chick that wasn't wearing enough clothes. He made it a point to know most of the 'characters' on campus, and he didn't recognize these two at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' tourists\" He muttered as he threw his cigarette to the pavement and rested a hand on the tazer strapped to his hip. \"Folks, hate to interrupt your...evening stroll but this campus is closed. Authorized personnel only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked up at Eugene, who had a look of confusion on his handsome face, \"Uh, you catch that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh. Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry rolled his eyes. \"Great, just great. Listen, I don't know what the hell you're saying, but in AMERICA. WE. SPEAK. ENGLISH.\" The security guard said loudly and slowly, and let out a sneer of frustrated disgust. Why did he always have to deal with the weird people? FOREIGN weird people? He rubbed his thick moustache for a second and then pantomimed at the nearly naked dude and his (admittingly fucking hot) girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU. LEAVE. BEFORE I. ZAP\" Perry pointed at his taser and then pointed at Eugene and Peter again, before making a shooing motion. After another moment of confused gibberish, Perry just shook his head. He couldn't ACTUALLY zap them, not unless they attacked him first, so maybe a little physical encouragement would help speed things along so he could get back to his smoke break. HE stomped forward and grabbed hold of the pretty girl's forearm and began pulling her towards the street. The girl had shouted something in surprise while the big man yelled, clearly angry...Perry unclasped his taser and spun around to point it at the big man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then Peri blinked, letting go of her mistress's arm, gasping in horror at daring to touch the Pythia without permission. She collapsed to her bare knees, silken fabric swirling in the breeze as she settled to the rough pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MISTRESS, FORGIVE ME! I knew not what I was doing! I am forever your faithful servant, please, tell this worthless handmaiden what she must do to earn the forgiveness of the gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Eugene looked at each other in shock. In the span of a moment they had just seen the pushy security morph just as the chair leg had. Just as Lindsey's beer had. The overweight man's body had shimmered as it slimmed dramatically, his hips flaring out, breasts emrging as his guard uniform shrank and shifted into a revealing toga similar to Peter's. A balding pate had exploded with soft brown hair, and a veil had settled over a definitively face. And the security guard's rough smoker voice was replaced by a soft girlish one, and speaking in a language that the two could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what the ACTUAL fuck!?\" The two transformed students yelled at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Eugene, making sure to keep the Omphalos chain loose by extending his arm, took a step away and Peter felt an unexpected stab of pain in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt <i>bad</i> to have Gene be repulsed by him, to have his rippling, impressive bulk out of arm\u2019s reach. He opened his mouth to say something to the bronzed demigod, to maybe bridge the gap that had developed between them ever so quickly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he shut the fuck up when he saw what Geno was actually doing. An electric blue flower, the exact color of the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Zeus-device</span> Taser, had fluttered to the floor alongside the prostrating\u2026 luggage-girl that the dickhead security guard was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Pete,\u201d breathed Eugene. \u201cThat was\u2026 weird. But, uh, impressive! I didn\u2019t, um, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019ll be fine if you touch <i>me</i>, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter dumbly nodded. \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019ll be good. We, uh brushed against each other when we left the door, \u2018member?\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely sure if it was a lie or not, but the thought of <i>never touching Gene again </i>felt... <b>bad</b>.  \u201cPlus, I, uh touched Jude too. After the card-thing.\u201d <i>That</i> he was sure of. He couldn\u2019t possibly forget having her slimy, disgusting coils all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Cool.\u201d Eugene sidled back to arm\u2019s-reach-distance, and Peter felt <i>secure</i> again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attention was once again turned to the feminized form of their resident Sgt. Dickhead, whose veiled forehead was still practically scraping the pavement in her extended bow. Peter would <i>never</i> admit it, but having a superpower that didn\u2019t result in him draping himself over the sturdy, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">handsome</span> form of Gene was pretty badass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the new-girl\u2019s tits were smaller than his! Just like a handmaiden should be, less beautiful than their Mist\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peter scowled and pinched his arm to dispel any sense of possession or pride related to his burdensome funbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, think you need to tell her to do something.\u201d mumbled Eugene, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cAnd he was speaking, like, some other language, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit, yeah,\u201d Peter waved a hand at the prone form of the\u2026 what should he call her? Or him? \u201cYou may rise, girl.\u201d he commanded, waving an arm imperiously. \u201cThere are, uh, things to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stifled a chuckle. \u201cYou, uhm, started strong, but the finish was \u2014.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut <b>up</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Peter\u2019s quiet awe, the girl-cop seemed to lower herself <i>further</i> into her apology-bow. \u201cYou are too kind, Mistress, but <i>please</i>, you musn\u2019t restrain yourself. Shall I partake in a round of self-flagellation \u2014\u201d Peter looked questioningly at Eugene, who mimed whipping himself \u2014 \u201c\u2014 alk over burning coals?\u201d She crawled towards Peter\u2019s sandalled feet. \u201c<i>Please</i>, Mistress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter blinked. People didn\u2019t normally ask him for advice, or commands, or the minutiae or methods of harming themselves. But \u2014 besides the last one \u2014 this felt pretty alright. People <i>should</i> listen to him. Still, he had to rein this masochist in a bit. He didn\u2019t want her to throw herself off a cliff before she could give him the movement bonus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, or at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your penance, um, feeble\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeri, mistress, but there\u2019s no need for you to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your penance, Peri, you must\u2026\u201d Peter put a nail on his lip, miming deep thought. \u201cRub your stomach and pat your head! <i>Simultaneously!</i> <b><i>For ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY seconds</i></b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, I \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT IS WHAT THE GODS WILL!\u201d Peter thundered. Or rather, yell-squeaked. The little stomp he gave to cement his authority didn\u2019t really feel stompy or authoritative, too. Just jiggly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silken robe of \u2018Peri\u2019 swirled as she rose from her bow. Her veil shifted rippled with every pat of her head, sniffles of gratitude slowly graduating to full-on joyful crying, which made the tummy-patting a bit awkward to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene coughed. Peter shifted from foot to foot. Both tried not to look at the girl sobbing happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, we gonna go through with this?\u201d Eugene said, shifting the Omphalos from hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Yeah.\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like this is gonna last forever. Plus, Psi Iota has some real dickheads. Gonna go in there like Rambo with girl-guns.\u201d He shot finger guns at the distant frat house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene weighed the morality of turning some frat bros into weepy handmaidens versus the benefits of winning the game, plus the weird part of his brain that said that more soft, small damsels around was a big plus no matter which way you looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d shrugged the nerd. The latter side won out. <i>Hard</i>. \u201cHey, do you think we\u2019re, uh, talking differently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard Perry before he went all\u2026 this.\u201d A large hand was waved at the mid-penance-sobbing maiden. \u201cEither we have, like, dysphasia or our Broca\u2019s area got blasted by the board game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rubbed his eyes and leveled a sour look at Eugene. \u201cYou goddamn nerd.\u201d He waved a pale hand at the heroic dork. \u201cC\u2019mere. I\u2019ll\u2026 say stuff, and you try to see if my lips are, I dunno, pulling bullshit or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene complied, and sidled up two feet away from the oracle. Suddenly, the two were acutely aware of how close they were to the other, and that, frankly, both were paragons of their respective gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright.\u201d mumbled Peter. He stood on his tiptoes and swayed vaguely towards \u2018Gene\u2019s bronzed bulk. God, he was tall. \u201cLet\u2019s do this. \u2018Ba-na-na.\u2019 \u2018Kum-quat.\u2019 \u2018Wa-ter-melon.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene probably would have made a snide comment about how Peter\u2019s mind was always on food if he wasn\u2019t absolutely and utterly entranced. Everything about Peter was thrown into sharp relief: his long ringlets of dark hair; the immaculate pink skin of his full lips; the way that he could practically see down his toga \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY MISTRESS?!\u201d rung out through the warm air, breaking the two out of their shared reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to face the frankly furious Peri, who minced over to stand between the two, extending her arms to protect the befuddled Pythia behind her, and setting an expression on her face that seemed like it was <i>supposed</i> to be threatening, but, ultimately made her look more like an angry Chihuahua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow <i>dare</i> you approach her without cleansing yourself, how <i>dare</i> you gaze upon her unveiled \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Gene, that\u2019s a rookie mistake,\u201d teased Peter who was rather enjoying the sight of someone else getting the third degree for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene would have responded with a pithy remark, but he was pretty sure that the former mallcop would probably try to kill him if he did so. He didn\u2019t want her to hurt herself in the attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014 and how <i>dare</i> you tempt her so! The flush on her face, the sheen and sparkle in her sainted eyes! Did you make a wicked pact with Eros, you \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Allllrighttt</i>, that\u2019s enough.\u201d interrupted Peter, his face was cherry-red and lined with panic. \u201cUm, it\u2019s all cool, uh\u2026 Peri?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>There\u2019snoneedforyoutoremembermynamemistressthemeresoundofyou</i>\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, yup, sure, whatever,\u201d groaned the prophetic jock. \u201cI, uh, talked with the gods and uh, he\u2019s all right in their books.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri put a delicate hand over her mouth. \u201cOh! I am <i>so</i> sorry, sir. I did not\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d rumbled \u2018Gene. They did <i>not</i> need another two-minute apology session. \u201cNo hard feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri tilted her head at the unfamiliar idiom, but otherwise got the message. She curtsied to Eugene \u2014 who wasn\u2019t entirely sure if that was period-appropriate \u2014 and turned to Peter eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I divest you of any burdens, Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter scratched the back of his neck. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I have right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s this.\u201d Eugene waved the Omphalos around with a cheeky grin and set it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Pythia shot a pointed look at the Herculean geek. \u201cDude, she might hurt herself, don\u2019t be a \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handmaiden hoisted the Omphalos into her arms with a soft \u2018Oof\u2019, cradling it like it was her baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014dick.\u201d finished Peter, sullen pout on his face. \u201cHow come <i>everyone else but me</i> can lift that thing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could carry <i>any</i> burden for my Mistress!\u201d proudly announced the handmaiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Eugene said, trying to pull Peter out of his fourth weakness-realization funk that day. \u201cJudy might have swallowed Lindsey whole by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter laughed nervously at the joke before setting out. Judy wouldn\u2019t do that. Right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peter instead turned his focus to how <i>nice</i> it was to be able to walk without worrying about being jerked back or forward every four seconds, nearly bouncing his tits out of the gauzy toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry may have been a shit security guard, but he could carry a rock like no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he\u2019d never admit it, but it was <i>way</i> easier to walk with the guy who had a product partnership with the concept of muscles and an overeager cupbearer than stay in a room with Ms. Horsedick and his <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">(<i>terrifying</i>)</span> snakeheaded girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeno was <i>much</i> easier to look at, too. Easy enough that his gaze would wander over to his sculpted pecs, impeccable biceps, or <i>crazily</i> tight ass if Peter\u2019s focus lapsed\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wrenched his attention back to walking. Peri better not have noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few drew a few looks from pedestrians as they walked outside the campus. Eugene couldn\u2019t whether it was because they were <i>smokin</i>\u2019 hot, or that they weren\u2019t wearing masks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould representatives of the Gods get COVID? Hopefully not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was half-tempted to go out and high five a disapproving old woman who <i>definitely</i> tutted and scowled at them into servility, but Eugene dissuaded him. Other people would <i>definitely</i> notice the geezer losing forty-five years and eighty pounds, and plus, she might have a family or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Psi Iota Mu Phi Sigma boys\u2019 only family was the platonic idea of partying. When the toga-wreathed boys trod back to their frat the next day, they\u2019d probably be met with raucous cheering and no questions about where the hell they were the last day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they might object to seeing their bros feminized in a flash of light. The Morphmanji players looked up at the frat house gravely, contemplating their options. Surrounding the brown-glass littered porch was a flat roof, and presumably, a wealth of dorm windows, which equalled more baggage-girls for Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that roof could hold my weight?\u201d mused Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised the <i>dorm floor</i> holds your weight, Geno.\u201d snarked Peter with a flick of his hair. \u201cI should be the one to go up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you gonna move the Omphalos, dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if you <i>hurt yourself</i>, Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rolled his brown doe-eyes. \u201cThe chain\u2019s long enough if you just, like, set it down a foot away from the edge, man.\u201d He turned his attention to the histronic handmaiden. \u201cAnd, uh, the Gods said that they\u2019d protect me and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri\u2019s contrite expression slid into a mask of joy. \u201cI see! My apologies for doubting you.\u201d Another deep curtsy followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another problem,\u201d Eugene hooked a thick thumb at the door of the frat, that was seemingly scribbled over in red oil marker. \u201cThat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter shrugged his pale shoulders with a roll of his eyes. \u201cOh <i>no</i> frat bros don\u2019t have respect for rented property, what<i>ever</i> shall we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dude, I mean, can you read that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter squinted at the red-marked wood. On second glance, the scrawled ink <i>did</i> look like letters, just in no language he recognized. \u201cNo.\u201d he lamely admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that community forum post from a couple months back? Some town-lady got pissed \u2018cuz the Psi Iota guys scrawled \u2018Don\u2019t Dead Open Inside\u2019 on their house door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded slowly, comprehension dawning. \u201cFuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene returned his grave nod. \u201cNo English for us, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock scrunched his face into a sullen pout.

Rising from the couch amidst much clattering of beer cans, he staggered to the door, stepping over the prone form of his frat bros who were <i>waay</i> morre partied out than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a pizza call? At \u2014 he squinted at the grandfather clock in the foyer \u2014 five PM? A bit early, but hey, food was food. It was his turn to pay anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door\u2026 to a petite brunette who was nine kinds of cute, her face pulled into a charming pout of concentration that quickly shifted into a gasp when she saw the beleaguered frat bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much greetings!\u201d she cheered in an accent Jeremy couldn\u2019t place, throwing her full body into a wave. \u201cI am being a dys-track-shen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy blinked. This was\u2026 different. Girls didn\u2019t approach him. Especially cute foreign girls. Also she wasn\u2019t pizza, but he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s real nea\u2014 wait, are you the new dealer? Or a cop, \u2018cuz you have to tell me if\u2026\u201d He stopped when he saw the girl\u2019s face wrinkled in confusion. He\u2019d have to go slower, it looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2026 You\u2026 Have\u2026 A\u2026\u201d Jeremy searched his alcohol-addled mind for a query that could cross the language barrier. He settled for forming his hand into a finger-gun and pointing it demonstratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny concern he might have had was dispelled when the girl mirrored his own mimery, touching her index to his and tilting her head questioningly. If worse came to worst, he\u2019d be postively fucking <i>elated</i> to let this chick arrest him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy activated suave-mode, which consisted of him slicking his greasy hair back and lowering his voice half an octave. He threw in a lean against the doorframe to really bring her the smolder. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019re you here for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor Mistress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unexpected answer. Jeremy didn\u2019t let it phase him, though. \u201cUh, neat. So, like, are you a maid or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl broke into a bright smile. \u201cShe is <i>best</i> Mistress!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not really an answer, but she was still adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Peter listened to the cacophonic alien language shouted from the doorstep. It was far easier for Peter to sneak along the white picket fence than Gene, but being too short to be seen was kinda like having a low BMI because your legs got cut off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the corner of the frat, the ideal place for infiltrating. There was a raised patch of ground next to the  low roof\u2019s corner, and three out of four angles of sight blocked by the nearby houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this, Pete?\u201d half-whispered Eugene. \u201cI can try to go up with you, you know..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter tried not to let his flush show. \u201cI\u2019ll be <i>fine,</i> dude.\u201d He looked up at the window and grit his teeth. \u201cOnce one of \u2018em\u2019s a maid, they can probably <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">carry the stupid fuckin\u2019 rock for me.</font>\u201d He set his face into a frown of determination post-grumble. \u201cJust make sure you put the Omphalos in a good place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost-Hercules shrugged. \u201cAlright then. Boost on five?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty braced himself as Geno rumbled a count, ready to step on the interlaced fingers of his friend\u2019s strong arm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why he let out a squeal when that selfsame arm circled itself around his hips and handily hoisting him into a seated position behind his head.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Pete</i>!\u201d Eugene turned his face as far clockwise towards the attractive augur as he could without getting a noseful of thigh. \u201cThis is supposed to be <b>stealthy</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2014 you \u2014\u201d spluttered the shame-mantled soothsayer, \u201cYou said you would <i>boost</i> me, dude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I <i>boosted</i> you onto my shoulders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter most definitely did <i>not</i> think about how he could <i>feel </i>the rumble of Gene\u2019s voice from his firm seat. \u201cThat\u2019s not a \u2014 fuck, whatever. Just get the rock up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter watched the flex and ripple of the nerd\u2019s arm as it hoisted the prophetic rock, teeth teasing at his lip <i>for no reason at all</i>. With a bit of a scrape, the Omphalos was placed, base down, around the midpoint between two windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Might use my wish to keep these.\u201d Eugene experimentally flexing a bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded his agreement as soon as the words left Gene\u2019s lips, and then was immediately glad that the dweeb couldn\u2019t see his head. \u201cFuck that, dude. I\u2019m winning with my plus-one movement and wishing for a badass mansion, with a fuck-ton of workout rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I drop you here, huh?\u201d teased Eugene, faking a drunken stagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare</i>.\u201d hissed Peter. The mock-wobbling soon approached the shakes of <i>real</i>, oracle-dislodging wobbles, forcing the jock to cling to the rectangular prism of a skull in front of him for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Eugene who first realized what the twin softnesses pressed against his parietal bone were. It was also Eugene who realized that Peter\u2019s soft skin had the sweet scent of violets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter reached the same conclusion Eugene had shortly thereafter, and disentangled himself with a mumbled apology. Eugene returned the same contrite murmur, and the two went about their next task silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was able to clamber up Gene\u2019s raised limbs surprisingly easily, considering his utter lack of muscle tone. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">His</span> The oracle disappeared from sight, forcing the board-game-owner to listen intently for signs of mission completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light tapping on a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muttered curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light tapping on a window left of the first tapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlass-muffled thumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coo of (what he hoped was) mock-femininity from Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of very fast glass-muffled steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creaking of a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he could <i>see</i> the flash of light.

Could you help me get thi\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn airy gasp. \u201cAnd lay my hands upon the sacred Omphalos without anointing myself first?

He didn\u2019t need to be nervous. This would be <i>fine</i>. Everything would be <i>fine</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he spared a couple of concerned looks at the window as he padded back to the front of the frat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she is dancing, like <i>pow</i>! And the gas is going-up-ing, like <i>fyoosh</i>! And \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy was nodding dreamily at every word out of the firecracker\u2019s mouth, not really comprehending what she was saying, but generally appreciative of all the bouncing that her gesture-exaggerated onomatopoeias brought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she may be waxing broken-English poetic about this \u2018Mistress\u2019 character, but she sounded more like some really admired big-sister instead of, like, her lesbian girlfriend or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she was, so what? He could probably sway them into a threesome with his raw sexual charism\u2014 <i>wow that guy was big</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone who looked like Kevin Sobro mixed with prime-Schwarzenegger with the hair of Fabio strode into Jeremy\u2019s line of sight, his ripped top half completely unclothed, and a Big Fucking Sword sheathed at his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy risked a small wave of acknowledgment, and the man returned a distracted nod, staring up at the windows of the house. Concern jolted through Jeremy \u2014 was he about to get <i>robbed</i>? \u2014 but the short unconcerned look the foreign girl shot the bodybuilder relaxed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn\u2019t moving, he wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl moved, pushing past him into the frat with an excited \u201c<i>Mistress</i>!\u201d Jeremy turned to see a gaggle of five togaed girls descending the creaky stairs, all of them surrounding a grumpy looking bombshell with <i>massive</i> tits, who was chained to a rock\u2026 for some reason. His conversation partner joined the herd, jabbering excitedly in some foreign language into the black-haired girl\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, can I help you? Hey, is that a six-pac\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl pushed past him \u2014 and took a moment to frown at her hand, as if she expected to push <i>through</i> him or something \u2014 then hailed the bodybuilder with a tired wave and sulky foreign grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their conversation heedles of jeremy, but to be fair, he wasn\u2019t too focused on the anachronistic couple, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved to the girl he\u2019d been talking to for the last twenty minutes with a \u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did that cute full-body wave, adding in a \u201cGood-bye-bye!\u201d to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have, like, a number you could give me or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a tiny finger to her lips in concentration, shouting \u201cFifty-<i>two</i>!\u201d at the befuddled wannabe-playboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy watched them trundle towards the campus, shrugging at the seeming-security-violation. Perry\u2019d get them if they were doing anything untoward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he\u2019d get some pizza. That sounded good right now.</span></div></div>",

The Omphalos was nestled comfortably in the arms of Peri who had quickly caught up with the group and had, after a very brief argument had quickly been chosen as the 'leader' by Peter (who was, frankly, already growing tired of the entourage even if it did mean a movement bonus and no longer dealing with the gods damn rock of destiny).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, can you guys just be quiet for two seconds!?\" Peter groaned as they reached the halfway point, and the fraternity turned sorority went dead quiet for exactly two seconds before chattering once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene chuckled, getting a punch to the forearm that, had they both been in their previous bodies, would have landed painfully on his shoulder and possibly sent Eugene flying. Instead it felt more akin to a fly landing on his forearm, while Peter stumbled back wringing his hand and was ENGULFED by VERY concerned toga wearing women showering him with sympathetic noises followed by 'Mistress!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods will you all just take the twists out of your panties!?\" Peter waved his arms to free himself from the gaggle of girls who all looked at their mistress and then themselves, in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are panties mistress?\" Peri asked with a look of innocent bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? OH FUCK!\" Peter pawed at his robe and, for the first time since assuming the role, realized that he was very much naked beyond the folds of the white toga. \"DUDE I'M NOT WEARING ANYTHING UNDER THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just realizing this now? Your uh, fashion choices haven't really been leaving too much to the imagination Pete\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA judgmental gasp of disapproval washed over the handmaidens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the most divine Pythia chooses not to wear these 'panties' then no one should speak ill of her choice!\" Peri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen by the gods or not how dare he speak to our mistress like that!\" The former Tommy now Talia gasped, covering her veiled mouth, her curly auburn hair seemingly turning a shade lighter from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo should punish him for such blasphemy!\" Marcus now Macaria hissed, pointing a long nailed finger at Eugene, pushing her brown hair out of her green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These 'panties' sound terrible anyway!\" Cried Lucas now Lucia, as she struck a stand-offish pose, hands resting on hips that 'almost' rivaled Peter's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look as majestic as always, mistress!\" Gushed Kevin now Koren, who wore her blonde hair in a set of loose braids down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Koren\" Farad now Farah, groaned with a dismissive wave of her dark skin, giving the former (and smaller) frat bro a shove, sending her tumbling backwards onto the campus green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods\" Peter facepalmed  \"All of you leave Eugene alone. He's, uh, allowed to talk to me that way. Your, ugh, mistress commands it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you will it, it shall be done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what great and wonderful wisdom you possess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the wisest commands flow from your lips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great and powerful warrior, accept my my humblest apologies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By your command, my mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Peter groaned. When he'd gone about turning all the guys he'd actually gotten a little bit of a thrill. His own personal little army that were worshipping him! It had been fun but the last five minutes of just nothing but the tittering, the gibbering, and oohs and aahs and the word 'mistress!' popping up every five seconds like the seagulls from that one Disney movie with the talking fish he used to watch as a kid. It was extremely grating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're totally raiding Judy's and Lindsey's closets when we get back to the dorm. I can't believe I've been walking around commando this whole time\" He muttered, stomping off, the handmaiden harem buzzing along behind him in constant adulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you know what it feels like for me\" Eugene chuckled, taking two large strides before being right back at Peter's side, where he belonged, \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" Peter said with another wave, but a part of his mind giggled at the random thought of Eugene somehow wearing his loincloth as a shirt in somewhere. After all those signs typically didn't say anything about pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what are we gonna do about this whole 'English is a foreign language' thing now? I don't know about you but that's freaking me out a little bit\" Eugene asked as they approached the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry hero, Mistress said I did a good job on our quest! If you or mistress need assistance with these outsiders then it would be the greatest of any honor to translate for you!\" Peri said cheerily from just a few steps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I've got my own text-to-speech device. It'll be fine\" Peter said as he reached for the dorm's door, only to blink in surprise as five pairs of hands shot out in front of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've got it mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jest, I'VE got it mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me, mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me, grace of Apollo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY! GODS, I GET IT! YEESH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT A WORD, MISTER\" Peter let out a womanly harumph and sashayed into the dorm lobby, Peri following closely behind. Eugene moved towards the open door, but it swung shut as the almost comical pile of girls funneled in behind Peter's flowing toga robe, leaving the geek to blink in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. This is still so cool\" He muttered as he very, very carefully pulled the glass door open...And then completely ripped it away from the door frame with a crash of twisting metal and shattered glass as a wall of high pitched screams washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER!\" Eugene bellowed, tossing aside the ruined door like it was nothing and charging into the tall building, hand leaping to the hilt of the sword and pulling it out in one swift motion. It even made 'sching!' sound and everything. But as cool and Eugene may have found it, his mind was focused on one thing as he charged through the dorm lobby, leaving cracked tile in the vague shape of large feet as he headed for the common room: His friend who was currently a vulnerable girl. As he rounded the corner and ducked into the common room, the geek stumbled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the somewhat clinical environment he and Peter had left, the large communal room now resembled the inside of some ancient temple! There was a roaring fire in a large pit in the center, the couch and the three other lounge chairs were gone, replaced by elaborate marbled little stools and benches that were covered in lavishly colored drapes and primitive looking pillows. Jars are all sorts dotted the room, and in the center, past the currently screaming pile of women and one very confused and distressed looking oracle, was Lindsey, calming rotating what looked like a plucked chicken over the roaring fire. The only trace of Judy was the end of a scaled tail that was slowly winding it's way into the dark opening there the bathroom doors had been. Near it was the table and the game machine, untouched and modern looking as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene cautiously entered the transformed room, sword at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GODS will you guys shut up!?\" Peter cried, and then the weight of the six bodies pulling and pressing upon him, looking to shield him from the terrible creature that seemed rather non-plussed by it all, was too much for his legs to stand, and the entire entourage collapsed to the now straw-and-animal skinned floor with a collective girly 'OOF!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHALLENGE COMPLETE\" The game buzzed, \"PLAYER 2 AWARDED ONE ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT SPACE PER TURN\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lindsey? Judy?\" Eugene approached the sweating horse-bulk that had been his crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Whozzat?\" The transformed sorority girl slurred, turning around clumsily, a piece of oily looking meat hanging out of her broad mouth, her red eyes dull and unfocused as they searched for the unfamiliar voice. Then they locked on Eugene before darting over to the pile of terrified looking former frat boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Geeno! Yer back! Dude we can, like, totally keep playin' now!\" Lindsey bellowed spewing half-chewed food everywhere as the centaur scrambled to her hooves, knocking over a large clay pot that shattered noisily. After a few uncertain steps forward and a leering smile at Peter that made Eugene's blood run hot, Lindsey made her way over and draped a smelly, hairy, sweaty arm across his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get this\" Lindsey burped, and Eugene waved the smell invisible ball of gas out of his face with a large hand, \"So me and schales over there got s'bored when yoo guys left so we started lookin' at the game again an' I decided tuh roll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Lindsey, you were able to roll!? But shouldn't it have been locked until Peter finished the Challenge Card?\" Eugene blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gezz so! An'way, So I rolls a 3, right? And it lands on an Akshun Skquare! And the game goes, it goes \"Dion...Dee-ooh...The party god! IT goes 'The party god blesses yoo! Show yer 'preciation by throwin' a party! Then POOF all this schtuff shows up! But then it wuz jus' me an' Judy and shee was all grumpy and shit. But now yer back! And y'guys brought girls! Woo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur gave Peter and the handmaidens a sloppy grin and a wink before bursting out into laughter despite their terrified stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon lez drink Geno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey, you...you never get drunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz you, like, dun't know me very well, heh! C'mon Geeno, les have some fun! Tis s'pposed tuh be a party skool an'ways!\" The centaur let go of Eugene and stumbled back towards the fire, scooping up a small earthen jug and chugging it, dark liquid splashing over the floor as Peter and Eugene shared a VERY concerned look at each other.</span></div></div>",

Thas yer prob'em. Yer thinkin'! T'game said party so we gots'ta party! C'mon girls!\" Lindsey said, reaching over and pulling one of the handmaidens out of the pile of silky togas and frightened stares.

The former athlete rose to his tiny feet and and began stomping towards Lindsey, who was currently settling back into place next to the fire, depositing the absolutely petrified and teary eyed auburn girl roughly between between her hooves. The girl recoiled as Lindsey's large penis flopped with a thud against the floor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Petey! C'mere, room fer another!\" The inebriated sorority girl said with a phlegmy laugh, patting the scattered hay next to her. But Peter wasn't deterred, stomping on his sandals until he was in Lindsey's face, Peri scrambling wide-eyed behind him, Omphalos in her hands. the other handmaidens were cowering against themselves as they watched their mistress stand up to the horrid, disgusting creature that had taken the most sensitive of their sisterhood captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense moment as Lindsey simply grinned up at the scowling Peter, before the irate oracle raised a tiny hand and viciously slapped Lindsey across the face. The centaur's head snapped to the right and her red eyes went wide in surprise before she burst out into a another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Im only doin' what the game sez...toots. Can' roll 'til we party! I wasn...I wasn't gonna do nothin!\" Lindsey chuckled, reaching down and wrapping an arm around Talia, who simply whimpered as she struggled to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give. Her back. Now. Lindsey\" Peter said, ice in his usually pleasant (even when upset) voice. Eugene took a step forward and opened his mouth to speak but the oracular athlete stuck out a palm towards him, not breaking eye contact with the girl that had, little more than an hour ago, been half his size and more or less a stick. But now Lindsey was literally the size of a horse and even drunk had muscles that Eugene thought might give him a run for his money if he really did have to settle this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire crackled and the fatty grease on the chicken popped and sizzled as the two sized each other up...And then Lindsey laughed, releasing Talia and pushing her upwards with a dismissive smack on the rear. The girl let loose a frightened sob and rushed around Lindsey's hooves towards Peter, who grabbed his handmaiden and pulled her in protectively, a hand running down the curly locks soothingly as Talia tried her best not to openly weep onto her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stretched, all six limbs stretching outwards and joints popping like trees in deep winter, 'S'fine. Gezz we're stayin' like this then. S'not so bad really. Kinda like bein' a dude\" She yawned before reaching off and tearing a drumstick off the charring chicken and scooping up another jar of what was obviously wine. \"Hey Petey, lemme know if y'change yer mind in a'month. Might wanna party then!\" The girl cackled before loudly taking a bite out of the chicken, grease splattering and dribbling down her beard as Peter slowly turned away and guided Talia back to her sisters, who reached out and took the traumatized girl while Peri followed dutifully behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scaled tail slithered further into the cavern, disappearing from sight. Eugene gave it and Lindsey a wary look before padding over to the group of former men who were all cooing and soothing and quietly praising Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, you were so brave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly the greatest of Apollo's chosen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was going to be fine! Mistress is so fierce and strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Koren\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-thank y-you muh-my mis-mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah\" Peter said, his quietly letting loose a breath he didn't know he was holding, casting a glance through his hair back at Lindsey, who was already draining another jar of wine. All of which seemed to be appearing out of no-where. After a moment Peter looked at Eugene, and the titanic late-teen could see the fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, I uh, I gotta say that for someone with no balls, that was pretty ballsy\" Eugene said, reaching out and brushing away a few stray hairs that had decided to cling to the beauty's face. Peter nuzzled against Eugene's large fingers for a moment, closing his eyes and willing his heart to stop racing...Or at least stop racing out of fear...Maybe just a few moments like this to catch his breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Geno\" Peter leaned into Eugene's handa bit more. It was soft but firm and warm on his flushed and clammy face as the adrenaline drained away, \"I just, I HATE guys like that. That's the reason I left my frat. Just a bunch of 'roiders getting drunk and being really rough with the girls that they'd trick back there. Just pissed me off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo would be proud, mistress\" Peri said, setting the Omphalos down, \"No other priestess would have confronted such a beast for their handmaidens\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I couldn't just let it happen. You girls are only here because of me. I, uh, gotta look out for my squad\" Peter said, opening his eyes and giving the first of his six followers a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri didn't quite understand what the oracle was saying, especially 'squad', given that they were handmaidens and the farthest thing from a military unit...But she just returned the smile with a bow of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...I mean SHE is right though\" Eugene said with a hushed voice, pulling his fingers away after a moment, Peter turning to watch with more than a little regret as Eugene's fingers trailed away to rest on those popwerful, bulging knee caps, \"We've got to have SOME kind of party, even if we have to fake it. Otherwise the game won't unlock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't look at me! The only 'greek party' I know of involved getting fuckin' wasted and then puking my guts out and then ending up naked on the roof the next morning! Somehow, given that farce I had to do just to make my stupid rock work I don't think that's what the gods are looking for here. Maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked once more towards the dark, sinister looking entrance into what had been the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's one person that would know. Besides, we need her to roll when the game unlocks\" He said warily, and Peter followed his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Peter groaned as a shiver ran down his largely naked back. The last thing he wanted to think about after confronting a sloshed centaur was another monster. Even if it had been his girlfriend at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, don't think you should go with me\" Eugene said as they rose to their feet. You might actually be safer out here given how mad she was at you when we left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she wuz totally pissed!\" Lindsey answered between noisy wet chomps of what remained of the chicken, which she was now eating right off the roasting spit. But before the two other players could reply she simply pointed to her pointed, furry ears. \"Ima part hu-horse, 'member?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Peter shared a look and then a shrug. It was the least weird thing about all of this right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll go in and get Judy. You stay out here and if, uh, 'anything' happens I'll run out and deal with it\" Eugene thumbed towards Lindsey and then patted the pommel of his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aight. I guess I can uh, try to do something out here? Maybe I just earned some karma points or something\" Peter said with a hopeful shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took a deep breath and nodded. Peter could take care of himself. After all, he doubted that even if Lindsey got...frisky again, she was probably too drunk to chase them very far. With a smile downwards he took off walking for the cavern opening, ignoring the wave from Lindsey as she slurped down another jar of wine, coming to a stop in a heroic pose that he didn't intend to do. He felt cool air leaking out of the darkness, and somewhere within it something tumbled, followed by a distant raspy breath. He reached into the darkness, his slab-like hand disappearing from sight near instantly. It would be next to impossible to see in there and the lair of the gorgon wasn't one that you wanted to wander into without a light...Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene pulled out his sword, the blade ringing and glowing as he pointed it into the darkness, the abyss giving way to a mess of broken tile, bathroom stalls as...stone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, whatever. Here we g-' Eugene thought as he took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GENE, WAIT!\" Peter's voice rang out, and he turned to see the former linebacker practically tossing himself into Eugene's arms, a startled looking Peri stumbling behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Be careful, okay? I-We can't finish this without you...\" Peter cooed softly, and the smell of violets filled Eugene's nose. He lifted Peter's small chin and gazed into those big brown eyes, so full of concern, glistening as the beginnings of tears began in their corners...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. It's just a gor-It's just Judy\" Eugene said, and then blinked in surprise as Peter darted up and planted a soft kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For uh, luck. Or something\" Peter said, turning away to hide the deep red blush on his face why he mentally kicked himself. Why'd he do that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm the hero. I don't need luck\" Eugene chuckled, and Peter felt his knees tremble. And then Peter was gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter very much wanted to close his eyes as he passed through the clearly magical barrier and into the darkness, but he fought against the cowardly impulse and soldiered ahead, his path lit only by the glowing edges of his sword (that had once been a chair leg). He stopped a few paces in and turned to look out into the common room again, waving a beffy hand at the worried stare of Peter and Peri, but the two women, one reluctant, one oblivious didn't seem to acknowledge his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess they can't see me...\" He muttered, kicking a stray piece of water looked like a sink with his sandal, the piece of debris clattering in the dark stillness and it's echo carrying on far longer than it should have. Eugene watched as, after a few moments Peter took a deep breath, his breasts heaving, and then the somewhat imperiled athlete turned and looked around the common room, with one final glance at the cave entrance before waving a hand and striding back over towards the clustered handmaidens, Peri following dutifully (and closely after him), the former security guard casting a wide eyed look of fear backwards before quickening her own stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess it's just me now\" Peter said with a determined nod, and he felt a chill run down his spine as a hissing laugh began echoing all around him. He spun, sword waving wildly for any sign of his foe...Of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isss jussst you, hero\" Judy sneered from the darkness, staring at the hero below her, her eyes fully uncovered as the ragged blindfold hung limply off her nose like a ill-fitting surgical mask, like the ones all the humans were wearing now because of the plague. Her scaled form clinging effortlessly from the stone above. Her raspy voice bounced off the walls of the former lavatory, it having altered along with the common room when the dullard horseman had landed on the action square.Both the womens and the mens bathroom had been slammed together, and the cavern had grown to consume at least the second floor bathrooms as well, giving Judy more than enough room for her lengthy body to finally stretch out to it's full extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene made his way slowly into her lair, the gorgon slithered along silently above, musing on her plans as she avoided the rays of Apollo's light from the magical weapon. She grinned, ducking just low enough for her fang-filled face and forked tongue to glisten in the pale light, and then darting back into the darkness as the muscled demigod turned to look, only to see more crushing darkness. Judy glanced behind her and saw a few stray pebbles lined along the edge of the small crevice. She sent them flying with a wiggle of her muscles and let loose another hissing rasp of laughter as they clattered noisely among the tuins of the bathroom below, and slithering out of sight as Eugene turned to look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, as nice as this cave was, it wouldn't hurt to have a little more. She just needed to figure out what to do with all the humans first. The hero would be easy, just wait until his back was turned then slither down...Afterwards she'd just claim the oracle's eyes for herself and turn all of those pretty girls into the most delightful statues. She'd position them at the doors, and if that horsebrain would listen, maybe Judy could include her in her own plans...And if now, well, she wasn't particular about her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy slid down over the edge of lip of the small ravine, poised like the snake she was, near motionless  and mere inches from Eugene's face. It would be all over soon and then she'd have her justice. A whole tower to herself, to gaze out the windows and feel the warmth of Helios upon her skin. It would be a small justice for the wrongs against her, to finally not have to hide in some wet dank cave like a...like a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Monster</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blinked and suddenly pulled the blindfold back up over her eyes as she realized what she was doing. The word rang in her head like a church bell, she could hear the voices behind them and even in the darkness, she could see the crying 18 year old as she sped away from a large white house in the suburbs, two judgemental, unforgiving faces glaring at her from a picket-fenced yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat...What was she doing!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene! Eugene I'm right...I'm right here!\" Judy cried out, slithering her bulk down into the warrior's path with a mighty crash. The geek shouted in surprise and brought the sword up to strike, his eyes clamped shut. His mighty muscles tensed as he prepared to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait! It's me! It's Judy! I'm...I was just playing, okay!? DON'T SWING!\" She cried out, waving her clawed hands in the air. The snakes in her hair hissed erraticaly, slithering in every direction as they fed off the panic the goth girl was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene had just begun his downward arc when the gorgon had cried out. He froze and felt the weight of the sword knock off his balance almost in complaint of his hesitation. He decided to take the risk and peeked open one eyelid by barely a centimeter, and than relaxed as he saw the blurry form of Judy stopped so low she was practically touching the ground, her hands straight up in the air in a clear gesture of surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Hera, you scared the piss out of me, Judy!\" Eugene said, lowering the sword to the ground. And it was the truth, or extremely near to it. Maybe he wasn't as good at this hero thing as he thought...Or maybe Peter's good luck kiss had some oracle magic looking over him. Either way, he was pretty sure that if the gorgon had wanted him dead, the inexperienced hero would already be gathering dust in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sssorry about that...Don't know what came over me. But sssee! I have the blindfold on and everything!\" Judy pulled herself back up to the closest thing she had to a 'sitting' position, which was rather hard to do when properly using chairs as designed was a physical impossibility for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. Why are you down here anyway?\" Eugene said pointing at the darkness around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It jussst felt...right? Like it wasss where I wasss sssupposssed to be. Plusss I couldn't take Lindsssey charging around like a minotaur in a pottery shop anymore. I think...I think sssomething isss happening to usss Eugene! More ssso than what already hasss!\" Judy pointed a claw to her writhing, living hair, \"I think the game isss messsssing with our brainsss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't really noticed anything really different. I just really love this feeling of being strong though!\" Eugene flexed his muscles as Judy's snakes, once again her only way to see without hurting anyone, looked on with a frown on her face. Eugene honestly didn't know what the creature was saying...And quite frankly felt like he couldn't trust her anymore anyway. He was pretty sure he'd been inches from death. He still WAS inches from death, if this was all just some clever ruse to get him to drop his guard. Plus why wouldn't he enjoy this? He could FLEX his PECS just like they Terry dude from Brooklyn 9-9 could! How could anyone not think that was cool! Especially when Peter stared at them. He eventually ceased his impromptu display of manliness with a hissing sigh of impatience from Judy. \"Well, maybe you're just paranoid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT paranoid! Eugene, I almossst killed you! I think your sssword isss-\" Judy whined, pointing to the glowing blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't. And now we're talking sooo...\" Eugene trailed off. It was hard to keep his focus, staring at her scaly skin and disgustingly mobile hair, \"Anyway, I came in to get you. We need to figure out how to throw a good party in the way that the gods will like it so we can keep playing the game. It's, uh, your turn next, by the way\" Eugene added the last bit as an after-thought, a mild incentive to get Judy out of the cave without either killing her or knocking her out and dragging her enormous bulk back into the common room and dealing what would happen when she woke up. But Eugene knew one thing if he still had to resort to that option; definitely tie Judy up before waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon shifted her full body into what looked like a cocked head turn, \"What, you guysss don't know how to throw a party? that sssoundsss lame\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shoot me or something\" Eugene shrugged, \"Can we get a move on? Quickly we get back to playing the game, the quicker one of us gets the wish at the end\" Judy tightened his grip on the sword, and the many snake heads of Judy shifted towards the action, and then back to Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really a request\" He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHERO! HERO COME QUICK! THE PYTHIA NEEDS YOU!\u201d Peri\u2019s voice echoed through the darkness, and Eugene turned away from Judy, whose threatening hisses ended with a questioning grunt as she looked up towards the mouth of the cavern, a claw pulling away from the weak binding that kept her deadly power sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemigod looked at monster, all of the previous animosity between the two vanishing as they simultaneously said \u201cPeter!\u201d, and began rushing upwards out of the dank underground abyss, the light of Eugene\u2019s sword guiding his mighty strides while Judy rippled effortlessly over the maze of debris that filled the throat of the cave. And then they were out, the flickering light of the bonfire casting long shadows as they gazed upon the scene in front of them. Peter was floating slightly off the ground, arms out-stretched and his torn robe red and dripping from being doused in wine, his gods-given breasts revealed for the world (or at least the gathered players plus\u2026\u2019guests\u2019). A rather sizable portion of the formerly white robe was hanging from one of Lindsey\u2019s outstretched and gnarled hands, and the centaur herself was openly ogling Peter\u2019s body, her massive horse-cock straight as a rod and throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Peter spoke, his voice once more heavily accented, but not soft and silky like it had been before. This time his voice was loud, powerful, and had a rather masculine reverb echoing off of it. His brown eyes were open wide and glowing with angry looking light, tendrils of magical, clearly divine, energy flickering out of Peter\u2019s eyes as she glared down at Lindsey, who was clearly too drunk to be anything more than amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIf thou act a beast, my anger you should fear the least. So given to your craven desires you have provoked the gods\u2019 ire. Blessed you were, and so shall stay but now no woman shall look your way. A more fitting form you\u2019ll find for thee, perhaps a horn or two or three. Cursed you are, from friends be riven and banished, no longer will you have centaur magic. Take delight in your feotid breath, be thankful that you face not DEATH. Apollo strikes thee with his light, now cry foul heathen for his delight!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter spoke a dark cloud gathered along the common room\u2019s ceiling, rippling with flashes of lightning and thunder. Something seemed to pass over Lindsey\u2019s face and the drunken, leering grin faded away to uncertainty, and then out right terror as the impossible storm whipped itself into a maelstrom of thunder and lightning, a pinprick of light appearing at it\u2019s core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene felt the urge to race across from the cavern\u2019s opening, to tackle the possessed Peter to the ground and roll him out of danger, but a thick tail wrapped around his legs and he turned with a growl towards the Gorgon looming out of the shadows behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go, Judy!\u201d Eugene rumbled, grabbing at his friend\u2019s coils, but then the sound and noise stopped, and Peter let loose a shriek as he dropped to the ground, the gaggle of handmaidens rushing forward and dragging their beloved mistress over to the small fort made up of hastily overturned benches and chairs and more than a few pots. Meanwhile the light continued to grow in intensity in the center of the storm before a thematic WOOSH shook the entire dorm building as an arrow of what looked to be pure light shot down from the glowing portal above the stricken sorority girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!\u201d Lindsey roared as her drunken form was struck squarely in the chest, and suddenly a vast pillar of fiery golden light erupted from her broad, hairy chest, growing quickly to consume her entire form as she roared and screamed in terror and pain. Eugene was suddenly VERY afraid that if the gods really did exist (because of course they did, who else would have given him all of this?) then they were smiting his former crush from existence. And without her\u2026They couldn\u2019t finish the game and Eugene wouldn\u2019t get his wish! But in moments the light began to fade and the silhouette of something MUCH smaller than a centaur lay curled in the fetal position as smoke curled off it\u2019s form and that of the scorched\u2026tile? Stone? Eugene was sure what the floor was made out of anymore. And then with another ominous rumble, the clouds overhead rolled away to whatever nebulous realm they had come from. Which was Olympus, obviously, but Eugene didn\u2019t bother entertaining the preposterous idea any longer as Judy pushed past him, her coils releasing the greek geek from her clutches as she slithered towards what was left of Lindsey. Eugene tromped behind the massive snake, careful of his heavy strides to not accidentally step on the gorgon and once again set off her temper. So long as the monster would play nice, Eugene would as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, curled into a tight ball of smoking fur, lay a half man-half...goat looking creature that had two large horns, the ugliest face Eugene had EVER seen (and he'd seen Judy's current one) and a long, but thin, penis that hung out hard and stiff from under a poorly fitting loincloth.. The new creature was also extremely small, it's two legs bent backwards and forwards and ending in two stubby cloven hooves. In fact Eugene wasn't sure if the creature's constant erection wasn't nearly as long as the animal man was tall.It's baby-like arms and tiny hands were clutching at five long connected tubes as it spasmed and twitched in the aftermath of the divine strike. A black card that read PENALTY lay attached to it's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What is that?\" Eugene said, pointing at it with his sword. The creature groaned as it's wrinkly eyes fluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I think Lindsssey jussst turned into a sssatyr...\" Judy hissed as she slithered around her former friend. 'Ssso much for a tower guardian...' Part of her mind thought. Another part of her mind suggested that the satyr was small enough that she could probably eat it in a few bites, but Judy ignored both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lindsey!?\" Eugene gasped in surprise, \"Pete, you...\" Eugene's eyes stretched wider as he realized that Peter wasn't by his side, where he belonged. The hero spun on his sandaled heel and looked at the small crowd of handmaidens as they fan and massaged the oracle, who was groaning softly, a delicate hand on his forehead while her breasts hung out, open for the world to see. He felt a twinge of something but his concern overrode his 'hero' thoughts. \"Peter, what...What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri looked up with worry in her eyes, \"Oh hero! When you were in the cave, our mistress was trying to show up how to dance! She called it 'The Shakira Thing\" and said that maybe if we all started dancing, maybe the gods would help us with the 'party' she says we need to have!\" Peri frittered about, making sure the other handmaidens were doing...Whatever they were doing right. Eugene really had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then the Pythia is dancing, doing the most magnificent moves when all of a sudden that ghastly, beastly centaur gets up and starts dancing with her! And drinking! He was so clumsy, and now he's paid the price!\" The former security guard said with a girlish grunt of feminine approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but WHAT happened, Peri? I saw the light-show, and Peter didn't sound like himself!\" Eugene pointed up to the ceiling, \"Where did those clouds come from1?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Apollo of course! You see, sir hero, the centaur tripped and dumped all of his wine over our fair, pure mistress! And then he laughed like he did with Talia and grabbed Apollo's Grace! And he ripped off her robe! So then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then the blue smoke came out of the rock and I turned into Super-Bitch\" Peter groaned as he pushed himself upright. \"Ugh, my fucking head...Is that what it's like to have a god in your brain? I, uh, think I preferred it the other way\" He chuckled, wincing at the headache that had descended up his skull. But he was extremely glad that Eugene was okay, and took a little solace in the fact that Eugene was now rushing to his side and worrying about him. He gave Eugene a smile as his tiny hand disappeared inside the titan's, \"And hey, you brought the gorgon back! Wonder if we can roll again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wasn't really sure what had happened, though. One moment he was staring in outrage as Lindsey paraded around with the remains of his top, and then the next moment it was like he could see EVERYTHING. And then something spoke THROUGH him...It was definitely different from last time, when it had just felt like a compulsion this had felt like a full override. Peter had just been a passenger in his own body. And he wasn't sure what to think about that. On the one hand, magic game...But...Apollo? In his head? Oy vey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, by the way\" A high pitched neighing voice said, and all eyes turned to focus on the tiny creature as it staggered to it's feet, seemingly permanent erection smacking painfully against the floor and showing in the tiny man's beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Every other person in the still-transformed common room groaned in disgust. One of the handmaidens...Koren? The blonde one, seemed to throw up in her mouth a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Whaaat!?\" Lindsey said, arms splayed wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsssey, you're a sssatyr, honey\" Judy rapsed, \"Sssatyrsss are the dregsss of Dionysssusss'sss court. They make crude, crasssss jokes and have to live with, um, thossse\" The gorgon seemed to be the only one in the room unaffected by Lindsey's new grotesque appearance, pointing at the awkward perma-boner that was sticking out of the loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? LIKE OMG!\" Lindsey cried out, spotting the ungainly appendage for the first time, \"First I get one big enough to kill someone and now it's all long and hard! Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you apparently insulted the gods, specifically Apollo\" Peter said, not making direct eye contact with the creature, \"So do you guys think this means we don't have to have a party now?

With any luck maybe Lindsey's drunken screw-up would have ended the Action Square's lockout and they could get on to playing and get to the wish at the end that much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the four players let out of a collective sigh of disappointment (for Lindsey it was more like a burp) as the die clicked and clattered across the table and the tiny figure that Judy had taken the shape of did not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! And it wassss a sssix too!\" She hissed, resting her vicious looking hands on what amounted to her hips, where the human aspect of her body ended and the lengthy muscle mass of her snake attributes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's back to figuring out what a party was like in ancient Greece\" Peter said, finally accepting a pillow to cover his breasts as he finally felt sturdy enough from the divine possession to sit upright without his pretty head throbbing. \"Uh, thanks...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koren, oh most illustrious, most graceful, more beautiful vessel of Apollo's, um, greatness! A thousand blessings upon your most honorable-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're the one they keep telling to shut up, arn't you? Here's a tip girly, being a kiss-ass only gets you so far in life\" Peter groaned as the perky blonde turned beet red and looked down at her feet, the rest of the handmaidens sharing small grins and even a quiet snicker. But they all went quiet save for a whimper from Talia as the gorgon slithered over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually we don't have to. In ancient Greece, partiesss were called sssymposssiumsss, and they involved a lot of drinking, eating but also danssscing and sssinging...And it wasss usssually ssscentered on a debate between two men, generally in posssitionsss of power. They'd make their ssspeechesss and then the gathered party-goersss would vote to ssseee who made the better pointsss\" Judy said, doing her best to fight off the impulse to lunge at the whimpering girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you're telling me all those nerdy debate clubs started off as ragers?\" Peter blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss! Maybe if you'd lisssten to me onssssce in a while you'd actually learn ssssomething!\" Judy stuck a forked tongue out at Peter, earning a wave of satisfying gasps of shock from the small harem, save for the one that seemed to be constantly carrying around the Omphalos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you speak to the mistress that way, foul creature! She should call upon Apollo and have him smite you like she did the centaur!\" Peri fumed, finding the courage within herself just as her mistress had with the centaur that her mistress, the bulky hero and the gorgon were all referring to as 'Lindsey' which seemed a very strange name and was now a foul little creature that was currently playing with it's disgusting privates...But Peri was beginning to realize that her mistress was more than a little unorthadox. Still radiant and wonderful, but definitely unorthadox. The transformed security guard placed two dainty hands on her hips and stared at the gorgon. If mistress could be brave, so could she!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, chill out Peri!\" Peter said with a roll of his big brown eyes, reaching forward and pulling the feisty handmaiden back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mistress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine she's, uh, okay with the gods. I think. Just chill out and uh, go get me an aspirin?\" Peter rubbed his temples with his free hand, his words once again calming the gaggle of girls, but not completely setting them at ease like it had with Eugene. Probably because Judy was a monster and not a demigod ripped straight from all of Peter's fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass per wren? Mistress, is this another outsider word?\" Peri felt just AWFUL about letting her mistress down, but she kept using all these strange words and terms. She was doing her best but it was a base part of translating a foreign language to at least have some context of the words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods are you kidding me? Over there in the kitchen there's a cabinet with a tiny blue...bottle...DUDE!\" Peter exclaimed, pointing a finger towards what had once been the common room's kitchen. Instead of the broken fridge, a microwave and stove and sink was now a vast looking pantry filled with all sorts of foods from dried fruits, crisp looking vegetables all the way to various skinned animals hanging from hooks from the ceiling! Large pots that were filled with powdery looking stuff that was all manner of reds, yellows, oranges and browns, and even more capped pottery shaped like the ones Lindsey had been drinking from. There was even a small fountain filling a basin, the water pouring in from a gap in the wall that had NOT been there before the game had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow\" Judy gasped, as if seeing the complete changes to the common room for the first time. If only she could look out of something other than these snakes...But she pushed the notion aside as she felt a claw tease the edge of the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like, yeah! Where did you guys think I was getting all the wine and chicken from?\" Lindsey cackled, but frowned as everyone seemed to ignore her. She sighed again and went back to trying to hide the skinny rod that was poking out from her, wincing from the pain as it bounced against the floor and was constantly throbbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should have gone back to Seattle and just dealt with that jerk' She thought darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress...Should your temple NOT have a full pantry? Are your ways so different from that of Babylon's?\" The exotic voice of Farah trilled. She questioned many of the things these foreigners did...But she still loved the divine Pythia. She doubted any other priestess of the gods would have pulled a Persian from the auction block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Peter just blinked dumbly at the former Farad, \"Oh wait, isn't that the place Xerxes was from in 300?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah turned away in shame while a hiss of disapproval washed over the other handmaidens, typically involved the word 'fiend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am sorry I have made you utter such a cursed name, my mistress!\" Farah said, falling to her knees. This was it, she was going to be kicked out! She would be put up for sale or worse! Greeks hated Persians and she wasn't safe without her mistress! \"Please, forgive me! I shall...\" Farah looked around before forcing herself to stare at the greasy satyr, \"...Punish myself by laying with the satyr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG!\" Lindsey said, just happy that someone was paying attention to her again. She felt the narrow shower curtain hanging off her throb again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! Uh, no it's fine. It's fine! I was just, uh, thinking out loud HEY LET'S GET THIS SIMP-POSER THING STARTED OKAY\" The overwhelmed oracle just willed himself to ignore the headache and push the hideous mental picture of one of his handmaidens getting skewered by the little imp-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to do, Peter. We have to have at least two guys, right? I'm the only dude here. Pretty sure THAT doesn't count\" Eugene said, finally speaking up from his somewhat amused silence at watching Peter handle his 'squad'. It was actually amusingly charming to watch his oracle sputter about like a mother hen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plusss we have to have a unbiasssed crowd to vote afterwardsss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we going to do? If we can't end this dumbass party we'll never get to the end of the game and get that wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISTRESS!\" Peri squealed loudly as a DELIGHTFUL idea popped into her head. She hopped around to face her wonderful Pythia, bowing low as she spoke quickly and excited, \"I know where we can find another man! The boy from before! The one I distracted! And I'm sure he will know of others than would love to make a pilgrimage to your temple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? You mean Jeremy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demigod, gorgon and oracle looked at each other. The satyr looked as well but she was once again relegated to the background as part of her cursed appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it's a shot...But I really, really don't want to walk over there again. Does anyone have their Hermes Scroll? I think mine, uh, got Omphalos'd. Or something\" Peter grumbled, lamenting the loss of the expensive device. He doubted he'd be able to get another one, not with the plague outside and Antikythera being so far away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we lossst whatever we had on usss when the game ssstarted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have mine!\" Lindsey offered, scrambling over to where the pile of pillows that had been a bean bag lay scattered. She dug around with her grubby hands before pulling out the small rectangular device that was powered by Zeus...Only to watch it POOF into a blank stone and chisel. She looked up at the others...Only to see they'd continued to ignore her, their discussion having drifted farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peri, since you offered...Do you know the way back to the house?\" Eugene asked. He'd go himself but with the whole 'no English thing, the VERY eager handmaiden seemed the best choice for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh most definitely, great hero! I won't let my mistress down!\" The perky former guard said, staring eagerly at her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, go and do my, uh will?\" Peter said with a shrug and a wave, and then blinking as the girl sprinted away with a squeal of delight, moving as if she had been blessed by Hermes himself.</span></div></div>",

He'd half-hoped some VR effect, or early 3D would've appeared to show them the world they were about to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" he asked his friends, as he moved the controller down to 'start'.

Painting an insincere smile on her face, prepared to endure anything to spend time with her Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if he was blowing any social cool he had, a glance to Judy saw her smiling too. A broad smile as wide and genuine as his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" She answered, seeing his furtive glance.

He yelped, as the controller seemed to sting him. Looking to his hands to see if it was a short-circuit, or a spark that had caused him the pain, he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't look quite right. Oddly more pixelated, his eyes darted to his friends, or rather their hands. Each of them was looking to their hands in horror, as they started to shift from crude jiggling pixels to a finer resolution, then that turned to smoke, and was drawn towards the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay started to shriek and freak-out. Her elbows jerking wildly as she tried to toss the controller aside. It remained stuck to her hands, even as they disappeared, even as the effect worked rapidly up her arms. All of them were freaking out, as the pixelation reached their bodies. Only Peter was holding his breath as if about to submerge beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was whimpering a quiet prayer to herself. While Eugene was trying to work out how this was a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was indifferent to their reactions. All of them, as their heads turned to smoke and shot towards the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour controllers, fell unobserved to the floor, as the screams turned into electronic noise before the room fell silent.</span></div></div>",

I kinda wish we could go there, experience it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was nodding along, \"Yeah...

To play in that world sounds like fun to me, with heroes like Aladdin or Sinbad, with his bare rippling chest, and they were gorgeous and hunky. A real Man, who'd win the princess, and leave the harem girls swooning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...me then\" Peter said with a grin, earning him a pillow to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they all sound fun.\" Eugene tried to work the friends towards a common vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we want, fantasy creatures.... like Djinn, sorcerors, minotaurs and demons, harem girls, and heroic .. heroic heroes.\" he finished lamely, his voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Eugene started speaking again, his confidence coming back, as he read his friends faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we want to go?\" he half-asked.

Eugene loved the Indiana Jones films... Well the first three, and was happy to compromise with a different world. His friends were more engaged with the idea nodding along, and compromising on each of the different features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you think we should set it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do Arabia, it's such an exotic place!\" Judy said, already halfway into a daydream of her lounging about in a palace as an Arabian princess not unlike Jasmine from the live-action Aladdin, a Sultan's daughter caught up in a whirlwind adventure carrying her across a moonlit desert on a magic carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! We should totally do Greece! I wanna kick someone off a cliff in that old 300 movie!\" Pete said, \"After all I'm part Spartan anyway. This is destiny at work here\" The born-in-America athlete said, standing up from the couch and flexing his muscles in front of Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, gross\" She said mockingly, rolling her eyes as she play-acted. But she did give Peter a small smirky grin as she snuck a peek at his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we could also do something a little more modern?

The machine began to buzz and make several mechanical noises not unlike the sound a floppy disc would make as it was loaded into a old computer. The sound was harsh and metallic, and the group shared a look of concern with each other when the machine began screaming what sounded like an old dial-up Internet dial tone before suddenly, with a loud beep, all the noises stopped...And a latch opened on the sides of the machine's sloping dome, showing four hard plastic, primary colored game pieces: A astronaut, a alien and a retro styled robot and rocketship. And next to that flap, two big black buttons popped out of the side of the machine like two pieces of toast from a old toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both about the size of a thumb and, in faded and flecked away white lettering, were labelled 'TRADITIONAL' and 'IMMERSIVE'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CHOOSE A GAME MODE\" The game's electronic voice buzzed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, MORE choices, Peter groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we want to do guys?\" Eugene asked again, leaning forward and holding a finger over the buttons.

There was only so much Internet and video games that someone could take in all this lockdown nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If we go 'traditional' then we'll probably have to, like, type in a bunch of stuff and wait for it to get printed out, right? I kinda want to see that\" Lindsey said, resting her pretty, Legally Blonde face on her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, let's just do this already. You and Lindsey can just tell us what to do if we do the DnD one\" Peter said, finally helping himself to a massive fist of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a round of discussion in which Peter largely tuned out because it was all nerdy talk, it was decided, the group would play their first game in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After another short discussion (and another slightly futile examination of the faded text on the game's box), the four friends decided that they'd try the 'Immersive' mode for their first run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go slow for me and Pete, okay? This stuff is new to us\" Judy said as she leaned took the popcorn bowl back to the common room's kitchen area. She was slightly disappointed it had vanished so fast...But then again Peter's hands were large enough to be digging buckets on construction equipment. He'd practically emptied the bowl in two scoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah DnD is pretty easy to pick up. Maybe it'll print out character sheets or something? I've got some spares in my room I can grab if we need them\" Eugene said as he pushed the big black button that had the word IMMERSIVE stenciled on it. The button slid back into the game machine with an audible click, and there was a whirring sound that emanated from within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that sounds like an old VHS tape!\" Lindsey said as she marveled at the machine. It was, like, totes tripping all of her nerd buttons. She felt an urge to grab a screwdriver and take it apart like one of her computers and see all the old gizmos inside it...But she also didn't want to ruin Eugene's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IMMERSIVE MODE SELECTED. PLEASE SELECT YOUR AVATAR AND ENTER THE WORD PLAYER AND NUMBER ON THE BACK INTO THE KEYPAD. TYPE START AND PRESS ENTER TO BEGIN THE GAME\" The synthetic voice squelched, and the small tray holding the four game pieces slowly rose up until the astronaut, alien, robot and rocketship pieces were within easy reach of the four students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who wants what?\" Eugene asked, pointing to the figures, \"I figure if this is like DnD then they might stats or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs on the rocket!\" Lindsey said, plucking the small yellow ship out of the machine with two sparkling bedazzled nails, \"Um, guess I'm player 4\" She said after looking on the back, holding it out to show Eugene who tried to be cool about the attention his crush was giving him. The rocket really was retro styled, it was a pointy dart-like shape that had three fine near a tiny engine, and even had two ray guns sticking out the front with three little rings around each sphere topped weapon. The only thing that looked a little out of place for the time period was the small bridge that poked out from the top of the ship and its row of little yellow windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rocket?\" Judy called from the kitchen as she fixed herself a cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz it's sooo retro!\" Lindsey yelled back, \"This whole thing is so totally retro and I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll take the alien\" Peter said, leaning forward out of the couch and gingerly grabbing the tiny green, large foreheaded alien out of the tray. The jock looked at the number printed on the back of the alien, not really giving his chosen piece a detailed inspection, \"Looks like I'm player 2 Geno\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, do you want the astronaut or the robot?\" Eugene said as Judy rejoined the group, sipping on the glass of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just take whatever one is left, its cool\" The goth said as she readjusted her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're cool with being a robot then I'm gonna be the astronaut\" Eugene reached forward and plucked the solid blue spacefarer from its cradle and inspected it. Much like the other game pieces, it was retro styled. The helmet was a bubble that linked directly into a collar of a poofy spacesuit that looked like it had been pulled out of a 1950s pulp comic. On the back of the astronaut was a white number 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm player one\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah but are you like, um, ready?\" Lindsey said, giggling at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that means I'm the automaton\" Judy said as she set her glass of tea on the table and plucked the tiny robot out of its perch. She stared at it for a moment with her dark brown eyes, the egg-shaped head with antennas sticking out from the sides, hands that topped ribbed tube like arms that stuck out from the front of the robot and its large, blocky feet. \"And by process of elimination, also means I'm player 3\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Give me a second...\" Eugene bent over and carefully typed in the information for each of them into the game machine. Despite the somewhat tedious nature brought on by the game's analog and primitive interface, he couldn't help but be excited. How long had it been since this game had been played? He definitely hoped it wasn't a disappointment and a waste of fifteen bucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we go!\" The geek said as he typed in the word START and with a little bit of dramatic flourish, pressed the enter key on the small keyboard...And frowned as nothing happened. There was just the same whirring noise from inside the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did it work?\" He said, looking around the machine for a newly revealed button or some indication that it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its busted\" Peter said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it time to, like, think, okay? Old machines are old\" Lindsey offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my dad had something old like this when he was a kid. One of the old Nintendos. He said he had to blow on it to get the dust out or something\" Judy said, taking another sip of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you would have made me a glass, babe\" Peter said as he watched his girlfriend swallow a mouthful of the dark liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't ask so bleh\" She said, sticking a studded tongue out of her black lipstick colored lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banter, however, was cut short as the machine emitted a deafening fanfare of digitized sound, and the four friends covered their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGINNING STAR QUEST. ALL PLAYERS ASSUME STARTING POSITIONS\" The mechanical voice boomed on top of the pulpy soundtrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT! Turn it down Geno!\" Peter roared over the emulated trumpets and strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, there's no volume button!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys is anyone else feeling kinda...dizzy?\" Lindsey shouted, before her green eyes rolled up into her head and went limp in her beanbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey! What happened to...her...\" Eugene said, leaping from his seat before a wave of light headedness forced him back down. He cast a blurry look over at Peter and Judy, whose heads were lolling about as they slumped onto each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to...turn off...game\" Eugene muttered as the electronic anthem carried on, growing more muffled as a ringing filled Eugene's ears. He struggled to lift himself out of the chair, but the world spun and went black as he lost conciousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cold, sharp air filled Eugene's nostrils as his mind slowly regained consciousness. He groaned and pulled himself upright as he blinked his blurry vision, bringing a hand up to his head...Only to grunt in surprise as it palmed a surface that was definitely NOT his head. Instead it was smooth and hard, and come to think of it, most of what Eugene could feel was a large amount of padding as if he was wearing a heavily insulated glove. The world finally swam into vision, and the first thing the young man saw was an arm at least twice the size of his own currently plastered to a wall of slightly reflective glass some inches away. It was like staring at the arm of a huge winter coat, and was covered in a blue suit that had white pinstriping and nodules. Eugene moved his left arm to wave, and the arm resting on the glassy surface waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh no way!\" Eugene said, his voice coming out out of a grill near the base of what he could only assume was his helmet, a harsh voice that wasn't his own. With some effort, Eugene rose to his feet and bent over and stared down at himself the best he could; the rest of his suit being the same blue as his arms and covered in straps, nodules and other doodads that looked like a mix between the astronaut suits of the early 1960s and something clearly designed for fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" He whispered. He..He was the astronaut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a door to Eugene's right slide open as a tall, leggy, barely clothed woman stepped into the sparse chamber that Eugene had awoken in. It took the transformed student a moment to process that the creature he was looking at wasn't quite human, despite most of her body looking like that of a supermodel. Or a porn star. For starters, under the white and silver strips of what Eugene assumed to be cloth that barely covered her heaving breasts and hung off her wide hips and down over her crotch, her skin was entirely a shade pale green. Her face was mostly human, high cheekbones, puffy lips, a slightly upturned nose...But then the similarities stopped. Where the ears of a normal human would be were just two bony looking protrusions, sparkling silver chains hanging from each of them, and her wide black eyes that were filled with pinpricks of violet light, and her head was overall slightly swollen, her forehead riding up farther than what looked natural and two antennas stuck out prominently from her green flesh, topped with faintly glowing white orbs. Two tick...tails? Tendrils?...Tentacles? hung down off the back of her head and out from underneath a vibrant mane of hair that was rapidly shifting between bright red, white and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2291\u235c\u2330\u22ac \u2307\u2291\u27df\u23c1, \u2359\u2291\u235c \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22ac\u235c\u238d!?\" The clearly alien female said in a language Eugene couldn't possibly identify, her voice high and breathy as she leaned against the door, her exquisite legs turned inwards, knees knocking together as she was clearly struggling to walk in topless heels that looked almost comically impractical, revealing tiny two toed feet. Her sleeveless arms were thin and lacked anything that Eugene could identify as muscle mass. And both of her hands were tipped in fingers that looked just slightly too long and only had four fingers on each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't understand you!\" Eugene said, taking a step back. Part of him was clearly turned on...But the sudden appearance of a real alien had taken him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u2385\u27df\u2385 \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u2307\u23c3\u22ac!? \u27df \u260a\u23c3\u22cf'\u23c1 \u238d\u22cf\u2385\u27d2\u2340\u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u22ac\u235c\u238d! \u235c\u2291 \u238e\u238d\u260a\u260d, \u23c1\u2291\u27d2\u2307\u27d2 \u2291\u27d2\u27d2\u2330\u2307 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u260d\u27df\u2330\u2330\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u22d4\u27d2! \u2359\u2291\u27d2\u2340\u27d2 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22d4\u22ac \u238e\u2340\u27df\u27d2\u22cf\u2385\u2307!? \u2359\u2291\u22ac \u23c3\u22d4 \u27df \u23c3 \u260a\u2291\u27df\u260a\u260d!? The alien chittered again, and took a uneven step forward into the compartment...Only to fall flat on her, well, breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene couldn't help it. Despite his fear he raced forward as best as he could in the cumbersome suit and knelt next to her, a heavily gloved hand outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, of course, was when the next visitor arrived, a seamless portion of a nearby wall sliding open and a retro-monstrosity clanking out, a clear glass head showing a multitude of spinning antennas, self-flipping switches, gauges and a Jacob's Ladder looking contraption that rose out of the mechanical mess, purple electricity constantly dancing upwards. It made a sound like an old fashioned calculator and began flailing it's stubby clamp-tipped arms about in a wild motion as it clomped forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS UNIT IS EXPRESSING SHOCK\" The robot boomed, \"UNIT WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS. UNIT DOES NOT LIKE THIS. UNIT WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO PLACE OF MANUFACTURE\" The robot's voice was deep and masculine and had a buzz at the end of each word. The mechanical being took another step forward before it stopped it's flailing approach, and brought it's primitive hands up to what Eugene could only assume was 'eye level'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wait...Judy!?\" Eugene gasped in surprise. His eyes felt like they were about to pop out of his head, and he looked down at the sexy green alien woman that was pulling herself off the floor. \"Oh god, PETER!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u23c1\u2291\u27d2 \u2291\u27d2\u2330\u2330? \u2359\u2291\u27d2\u2340\u27d2 \u2385\u27df\u2385 \u23c1\u2291\u27d2 \u23c1\u27df\u22cf \u260a\u23c3\u22cf \u260a\u235c\u22d4\u27d2 \u238e\u2340\u235c\u22d4!? \u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u27df\u2307 \u27df\u23c1 \u2307\u23c3\u22ac\u27df\u22cf\u260c!? \u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u2307\u23c3\u22ac\u27df\u22cf\u260c!? \u2359\u2291\u22ac \u23c3\u22d4 \u27df \u23c3 \u260a\u2291\u27df\u260a\u260d!? \u2307\u235c\u22d4\u27d2\u235c\u22cf\u27d2 \u23da\u27d2\u23c1\u23c1\u27d2\u2340 \u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u2340\u23c1 \u27d2\u2316\u233f\u2330\u23c3\u27df\u22cf\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u235c\u2340 \u27df'\u22d4 \u260c\u235c\u22cf\u22cf\u23c3 \u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u2340\u23c1 \u23da\u238d\u2307\u23c1\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u2291\u27d2\u23c3\u2385\u2307!

The alien woman said, looking up at Eugene with big dark eyes that glittered from within. Her breathing started to increase dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, if that's you, I can't understand what you're saying! You're speaking an alien language! Judy, can you translate what he's saying?\" Eugene said, looking back and forth between his radically changed friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Error. Error. Unit Judy is suffering from calibration errors. Unit Judy cannot translate without a translation matrix. Unit Judy desires to return to place of manufacture. Unit Judy does not enjoy this\" The Judy-bot said, wiggling it's tube-like arms as if it was anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm...I'm sorry! I didn't know this would happen! Wait...Where are we? Where's...Where's Lindsey!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a squelch of static from above the door that the alien Eugene assumed was Peter entered through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm everywhere! Like I can see and feel and hear everything but I can't, like, move! I think I'm in space! Eugene, I think I turned into the rocketship!\" Lindsey's voice crackled out through the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Eugene said, looking around him at the barren chamber in shock, and then out through the door which led down a rather empty, technicolor hallway that was lined with bright yellow pips, domed ceiling lights and doors that seemed to be random colors with no identification, \"Lindsey, where...Where are we, how did we get here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are currently orbiting Rigel-IV, captain\" Lindsey's voice lost it's accent and inflection suddenly as she spoke in a monotone voice, \"We arrived here on orders to meet the Jaxerion Warlord Nuk'ar and negotiate the release of Space Force hostages in return for saving his daughter, Solaria, who is currently in your custody\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like OMG, that was SO weird! I suddenly just KNEW all this stuff that I didn't know before! It was like a switch in my brain flipped or something, it felt SUPER weird! Eugene, I don't think I like this!\" Lindsey's bodyless voice said again, her natural way of speaking returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is...We're in the game!\" The newly minted astronaut said as he lifted Peter to his uneasy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Query: Captain Eugene, can you get your current crew out?\" Judy said, taking a thundering step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene shook his head, \"I...You say the rules. That must have been what it meant about playing our characters. It also means that we...\" Eugene looked down at his suited arms before grabbing one of Peter's arms and rolling it over as he gibbered in protest. There, on his hairless fore-arm, were five black bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be our life count\" Eugene said softly. He immediately regretted ever buying the game, this was just too dangerous, how could this even happen!? It was just a game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Eugene? I think there's like, another ship or something getting close. I can, um, hear it? I think I might have like sonar or something\" Lindsey said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this must be level one. Well, I guess we have to start playing. Only way we get back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unit Judy is not okay with this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2291\u27d2\u2330\u2330\u235c? \u260a\u23c3\u22cf \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u238d\u22cf\u2385\u27d2\u2340\u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u22d4\u27d2!? \u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u2330\u27d2\u23c1 \u260c\u235c \u235c\u238e \u22d4\u22ac \u23c3\u2340\u22d4!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uneasy glance at his friends, Eugene turned and marched down the hallway, Lindsey guiding the group to her bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Alien Translator located here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lingojam.com/AlienLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">https://lingojam.com/AlienLanguage</a> ))</span></div></div>",

Her simplistic jointed legs tottered back and foot on top of the large bricks that were now her feet, and the metal clamps that replaced her once delicate hands dangerously flailed about inches from Peter and Eugene's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u23c3\u23c3\u23c3\u2291\u2291\u2291! \u260d\u27d2\u27d2\u233f \u23c1\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u260a\u2330\u23c3\u22cf\u260d\u27d2\u2340 \u23c3\u2359\u23c3\u22ac \u238e\u2340\u235c\u22d4 \u22d4\u27d2!\" Peter squealed and buried his pretty face into Eugene's suit as his supermodel body shook with fear. Eugene's own face was filled with a carpet of multi-color hair that shifted across what had to be all different colors of the rainbow before then were suddenly bathed in harsh red lighting. Eugene pushed his changed friend off him, causing Peter to wobble and fall on his rather expansive butt with a angry sounding \"\u235c\u235c\u238e\", but he ignored the jock's intelligible muttering to face Judy, who in her panicked state and the grim lighting looked more than a little terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If she's left like this she's gonna explode or something!' Eugene thought as he looked at the bright, angry glow emanating from what had to be Judy's new 'brain'. He'd seen metal get that color before, in those 'will it melt' videos he watched on YouTube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You're gonna explode!\" He cried out, but his malfunctioning robot simply continued to spin and flail, shouting out \"ERROR. ERROR.\" In her booming masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. Uh...\" Eugene searched his brain for a solution as Judy's own grew brighter and brighter, and he could see the glass shell begin to scorch internally.  Maybe...maybe he had to give her a command? Like a real astronaut captain in whatever this 'Space Force' would do?\"Uh, UNIT JUDY, COMMAND DIRECTIVE OVERRIDE! INITIATE COOLING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMMAND DIRECTIVE ACCEPTED. INITIATING COOL DOWN AND REPAIR\" Judy boomed, her spinning body locking in place and a sharp screaming whistle began as a cloud of super-heated steam or gas or something spewed out from several different vent openings on her blocky body. Her arms went still and limp, and the glowing mass of metal that made up her new head began to cool as the electrical arcs between her pylons flickered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus\" The intrepid astronaut rasped. He turned and stared up at the nearest speaker, \"Lindsey, you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning. Warning. Structural integrity compromised. Hull strength at 42% and falling. Captain to the bridge. Captain to the bridge.\" Lindsey's 'ship' voice said calmly, which was instantly followed up by a loud cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOWWW! I'VE BEEN, LIKE, SHOT! I WANNA GO HOME!\" Lindsey said, her voice strained and wavering, \"OH NO, THEY'RE COMING BACK! WE'RE GONNA DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!. Pete, c'mon!\" Eugene yelled, taking off down the corridor towards the large heavy door at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, since he currently lacked anyway of being understood or understanding anything the strange astronaut, the creepy looking robot and the other voice were saying, simply looked at the retreating suited figure before looking at the deactivated automaton behind him, and then grimacing at the two fleshy Mt. Everests that he'd woken up with, giving one a squeeze while brushing the constantly shifting hair that was EVERYWHERE out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have told those nerds to shove it and just played some Madden. Where the fuck am I!? Who the hell was that!? Where the HELL are my THUMBS!?\" He muttered, staring at his new hands in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Eugene had finally reached the hatch that he assumed led to Lindsey's bridge. He spun the old fashioned crank latch until it unlocked with a heavy clunk and he pulled the door open with all of his strength, a creaking metallic grind ringing in his ears as it slowly swung open to reveal a room that looked like it had been ripped directly from the original Star Trek show, if only a little smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle was a single rectangular chair that floated in the middle of the bridge from what looked like thin...wires? There were two smaller chairs that were firmly secured to the floor just a little in front and below the central chair, two consoles of large blinking square lights and bulging screans that had the word 'WARNING' slowly flashing across them. The walls of the bridge were dotted with similar consoles, a sea of blinking toggles, switchboards, what looked like old fashioned computer servers with the giant tape reels, and on each side were three large circular portholes. At the very front of the bridge was a large window, and as Eugene focused on it, his breath caught in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in front of him stretched the cone of the ship as it came to a tipped point. But beyond that was the blinking black abyss of space (as portrayed in movies). And a massive neon purple planet floated there, encircled by rings of tumbling rocks that glittered like diamonds in the light of the distant giant star. This was something Eugene had long since made peace with never seeing. Space. He found himself blinking away tears as he took a hypnotic, slow step onto the blinking bridge, and the sight of another rocketship, much larger and resembling more of a 1950's monorail covered in spikes than the retro-styled rocket Lindsey had been changed into, slowly began drifting into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Was all Eugene could say as he stared out into the cosmic wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proximity alert. Hostile vessel within firing range\" Computer Lindsey said before her normal accent snapped back into place, \"EUGENE, DO SOMETHING NOW PLEASE\" She screamed, and her shrill cry roused the teen from his mesmerized state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Oh hell! Lindsey, is that the guy that shot us!?\" He said, staring at the angry approaching ship. He suddenly felt like he was being eyed by a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. Scans have identified it as a Jaxonian warship. Their initial attack has rendered us combat ineffective. Ray cannons are offline. Shields are offline. Hull integrity is at 42%...Ugh, that is SO annoying, other me!, but yeah those are the guys that shot ME! they SHOT ME, Eugene!\" Lindsey said, her voice filled with anger and annoyance, \"Like, you didn't have to feel it! I feel like I've been in, like, a car wreck of something but I'M THE CAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Lindsey. I didn't know any of this would happen! I thought we'd just be playing DnD or something!\" Eugene gave an apologetic shrug, \"The girl at the store tricked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, you have a incoming message from the enemy warship\" Lindsey said without any trace of emotion, \"UGH I HATE BEING AN ALEXA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, you mean we're being hailed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, captain. Shall I acknowledge it? And they, like, better not shoot me! Tell them whatever they want to get us out of here sooner!\" Lindsey said, playing back and forth with her 'other' self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. Yeah put it on screen. Maybe this is how it's supposed to play out?\" Eugene said, making his way to the floating? Hanging? chair that he felt was HIS seat. He sat down slowly in it and half expected the thing wire, which didn't look all that different from fishing wire, to snap and have him fall on his ass. But instead it held his weight, and the moment he seemed to settle, the wires...disappeared? He wiggled the chair and it made a soft humming sound as it hovered in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh cool!' He thought to himself, but he had little time to play around as the starscape that dominated the screen blinked away, and was replaced by the looming figure of an alien...that looked exactly like Peter! Only this one was clearly a male, his head was larger, bald, a pair of horns were in place of the glowing antenna and a sinister looking goatee ringed his fanged mouth as two long Fu-Manchu strands of facial hair hung from his smiling mouth...With was filled with pointy teeth. The alien was dressed in an elaborate robe of silver and white that seemed to glow in the over-saturated color of the transmission, and was partially open, revealing a body-builder physique and a chest of jet-black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you have arrived\" The alien said in heavily accented English over Lindsey's speaker system, accompanied by an ominous string quartet. He pointed a silver-claw tipped four fingered hand directly at Eugene, \"Now I finally get to see the vaunted hero of the so called Space Force. Remove your helmet so that I, Nuk'zar the Dread, Supreme Warlord of Jaxonia, Conqueror of the Stars may speak face to face with the famous Captain...\"</span></div></div>",

The other three looked questioningly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the yellow wedge. Trivial Pursuit. History Questions. You guys have played Trivial Pursuit, haven't you?\" When the other three students shook their head, Pete couldn't help but laugh. \"I guess I'm the biggest geek here then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete relayed some of the background of his upbringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete had always been a physically active child, but academically, he was a bit slow. He wasn't stupid or anything. It's just school never caught his interest. The same with playing board games when he was growing up. The simple ones like Sorry were fine, if the weather didn't let him go outside. But anything more complicated than that quickly lost his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete scraped by in elementary and middle school, but only did that well because his parents had their own \"No pass no play rule.\" And even when he was small, Pete loved playing football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in eighth grade, Pete met Coach Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Runner was both the eighth grade football coach and its American history teacher. A number of coaches placed in this position would have relied on media presentations and rote memorization from their students. Coach Runner, however, took several trips to historical sites across the country during the summer, from Jamestown to Cape Canaveral. He had a way of making history interesting even to a student like Pete, who was only interested in keeping his grades up high enough to be eligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach Runner kept in contact with me after the eighth grade,\" Pete concluded. \"Believe it or not, my senior years, I had to take remedial math, and was barely getting by in regular English, but I made an A in Honors History. That's why I'm minoring in History. If I don't make the pros when I graduate, then when I start teaching and coaching, I can teach history, just like Coach Runner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also started playing Trivial Pursuit when my Dad's family got together once a month. I suck by myself, but everybody wanted me on their team for team play. I was always good for the orange and yellow wedges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three looked absolutely dumbfounded about this revelation of their football playing friend. Even Judy hadn't seen this side of Pete. Pete could have been insulted, but instead he just found the whole thing funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if this is Adventure History, I bed it's things like the Moon Landing and Climbing Everest and finding the Source of the Nile, and things like that,\" Pete theorized. \"I'm good at regular history, but I'm really, really good at sports history and adventure history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Eugene finally got out, still flummoxed at this unexpected intellectual facet of Pete's personality. \"So do you guys want to play the Adventure History Immersive or Traditional?\"</span></div></div>",

There might have even been some talk about steampunk in there. Pete was surprised that Judy was right in there with all the talk. But she seemed excited about the opportunity. And they all wanted to play the Lake Victoria immersive version of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete would have rather done the traditional form of the game. History trivia questions were more his speed. He thought this immersive game was going to be roleplaying or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pete was just as surprised as anyone with what happened next. As soon as Eugene selected 'Lake Victoria,' it looked like a hundred lasers shot out of that game console, blinding everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his vision returned, the world had changed in a big way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them were standing at the base of these huge waterfalls, that looked about hundred feet high, if not higher, and a quarter mile wide. Well, they weren't standing directly at the base, but they were close enough that they could feel a faint spray from the waterfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the weird thing. Pete had concluded that the lasers that had blinded him were projecting the image of the waterfall on the common room walls, But how do lasers make water spray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and the other players realized that the world they found themselves in wasn't just a laser display. And the first clue was the bodies they found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete found himself in the body of a five foot tall potbellied Asian man in his late forties who, though dressed in safari clothes, looked and talked like he was from those old movies about the Chinese-American detective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked and talked like that English actor who had played James Bond, then was in that movie with Robin Williams, where Williams played a nanny or something. Well, Eugene was a little bit more muscled in his new body than that actor, and looked like he had a three day beard on his face, but the resemblance was still remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey looked like Lindsey. Mostly. She was wearing a white blouse that clung to breasts that Pete was sure were larger than Lindsey had started off with in the real world. Lindsey was wearing a brownish skirt that fell to her ankles. Her hair looked to be reaching to the middle of her back, but it was blonde now, in a loose ponytail and had a slight wave to it. Her eyes were now an ice blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's appearance had changed drastically, though not as drastically as Pete's and Eugene's. Judy's hair was dark, long and straight now, reaching to her waist, and her skin was a dark olive color. She had also gotten a lot fitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete had always been turned on by Judy's body, and it wasn't like she was flabby. But she wasn't athletic like Pete was. She had a hint of a muffin top around her waist, her breasts were a bit saggy, and she had some junk in the trunk. Pete still enjoyed Judy's body, but he always wished she was in better shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was. And everyone had seen it. Because Judy had appeared in this world wearing a grass skirt, a pair of sandals, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was so stunned, that for half a minute, Judy just stood there, her flat stomach and firm, large breasts on display for everyone to see. And Judy's breasts were very firm. Her dark brown nipples had hardened at their exposure to the air, and pointed slightly upward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Judy realized she was exposed, she screamed and ran into a nearby tent, with Lindsey right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time that Pete had yelled out for the fucking game to end. The game ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was less than thrilled that Eugene had seen his girlfriend's breasts. That was going to be yet another thing on the list of things to pay Eugene back for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, Pete had to grit his teeth and suffer. Everyone else had fit bodies that were in their twenties, while Pete had an overweight, middle aged body. Everyone else had cool skills, while Pete's skills centered around camp management and detecting stuff. Who needed Sherlock Holmes in the middle of the jungle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and Eugene were sitting in folding chairs in front of a campfire, surrounded by a circle of tents, and eating a meal that Pete had prepared. Pete had to admit it was pretty good, but he didn't want to be the group's cook and butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Judy emerged from one of the tents, with Lindsey carrying what looked like a rolled up map in her hand. Judy was wearing a dress like Lindsey's, though her breasts were really stretching out the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stared at Judy's chest, then quickly looked away. Judy still caught Eugene staring, and blushed in response. She also had a little smile on her face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy didn't even bother looking in Pete's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete added something else to pay Eugene back for, when this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was oblivious to the emotions simmering underneath the surface. Instead, she waved the rolled up document in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this in the supplies tent,\" she said. \"This is probably where we have to go, to win this game. It's a map to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that pissed Pete off more than anything. Pete was okay when Eugene was the little wimp hanging around. But now that the roles had been reversed, Pete didn't like it one bit. So Pete had promised himself to give Eugene a beating when the game finally ended, and things returned to the way they were meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you guys talking about it, before we started the game,\" Pete continued, \"But I didn't catch the details.\" What Pete could have said was that he wasn't paying attention, but he didn't see it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\"  Eugene began, but a melodious soprano voice interrupted him before he could continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the source of the fabled wealth of King Solomon,\" the voice explained. \"During the nineteenth century, when Europeans discovered the ruins of ancient city near the shores of Lake Mutirikwe in East Africa, they were baffled by its location. Numerous explanations were put forth for its existence, but the one that captured the popular imagination was that this ancient city had once served to shelter and protect the workers in King Solomon's mines in the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. Here, it was believed, could be found the source of the King Solomon's legendary treasure of precious metals, gems and magical artifacts. For several decades adventurers and fortune hunters sought the legendary mines, but without success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the camp firelight there stepped a beautiful brunette whose light olive skin and exotic facial features spoke of an Eastern Mediterranean ancestry. Her long dark hair was bound in a simple ponytail that reached to the middle of her back. She was dressed in the same \"Safari dress\" that Lyndsey and now Judy were wearing, and filled out the dress very pleasantly. There was a hint of mischief in her smile and, though she looked to be in her twenties, there was something in her eyes that hinted at an old soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes!\" Eugene said excitedly. \"This is the girl who sold me the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, Lindsey and Judy might have been stunned by this revelation, but it only made Pete see red. In front of him was the unknown girl who had put this whole insanity into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yell of \"You Fucking Bitch!\", Pete charged (or, considering his body shape, quickly waddled might have been a more accurate description) right at the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette didn't even blink. And one second, Pete was charing/fast waddling. The next, he was frozen in place.

A <b>low</b> single digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's chest was smooth and unblemished, save for an odd tattoo of Celtic letters on his right pectoral muscle. There was an air about Eugene that made you think that, unless you had five heavily armed guys backing you, you would not want to fuck with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene, is that you?\" Lindsey asked, reaching out to touch him.

The grasp wasn't too tight, but it was just precisely the amount of force necessary to stop her hand's movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's this body,\" Eugene said apologetically, in a voice an octave deeper than he was talking with just a few minutes before. \"It has reactions and...sorry,\" he said, releasing Lindsey's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey tentatively reached out to touch Eugene's chest, and hissed in surprise when her fingers met flesh. \"I thought it was going to be like a hologram or something,\" she told Pete and Judy. \"You know, not really there.

Pete was uncomfortable, jealous and perhaps even a little bit fearful of this new body of Eugene's, but he didn't want to show any of those emotions. So instead, he tried to pretend Eugene was the same wimpy, geeky guy he was just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Geno,\" Pete began, \"How the hell did this game pull this off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was about to plead his ignorance when another stanza when appeared on the television screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Wow, Eugene, I bet you think, <br>\r\nThat your new body is heaven sent,<br>\r\nBut how 'bout, what do you think,<br>\r\nIf I made your body permanent?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four players just stared at the screen, dumbfounded, until Eugene said</span></div></div>",

I do have a the hammer throw record for my high school, though,\" Pete added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mighty Thor,\" Judy laughed as she snuggled up to Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll give the spaceship to our science geek,\" Lindsey said. \"Which leaves the canoe and the pickaxe for me and you,\" she told Judy. \"Any preferences?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shrugged. \"Not really. I don't know anything about digging with pickaxes.

The paths split up, merged and criss crossed each other, with each square in the path having one or two words on it. All the paths seemed to lead to a circle in the middle, with the word <i><b>MORPHMANJI </b></i>in the middle of the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom right hand corner was a blank square with the shapes of their four tokens in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black square appeared in the middle of the screen, with the following stanza inside it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Welcome to Third Wish<br>\r\nA Game That Will Shape Your Day<br>\r\nWould you Care to Review the Rules<br>\r\nOr Just Go Ahead and Play?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete wondered what the phrase 'Shape Your Day' meant.

She had tried to get Pete interested in binge watching all those kinds of shows while they were all quarantined, but Pete didn't even want to feign interest in them. If it wasn't a traditional sport like football or hockey or soccer, Pete didn't consider it a sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete didn't even notice the excitement at the possibility in Judy's voice, but Lindsey and Eugene certainly did.

Hey, Judy, you ought to take the bikini. You fill the top of one real nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed, not looking down at her sizeable breasts. Eugene and Lindsey both pointedly did not look at her chest. Sheepishly, Judy did as her boyfriend directed her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves the carabiner and the sash for me and you,\" Eugene told Lindsey.\"You know anything about rock climbing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I know everything about being a modern day gypsy,\" she laughed. \"And that sort of looks like the sort of thing a gypsy would wear. Do you mind?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Eugene answered. Lindsey smile and took the sash from Eugene's palm, leaving him the carabiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Pete began to ask. And would have asked, if the world of the four students wasn't suddenly composed of nothing but a blinding white light and a screeching noise. Thankfully for the four of them, unconsciousness took them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all four awoke, they found themself standing on a tall cliff, dressed in strange outfits, their bodies changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Pete wasn't dressed in strangely, nor had his body changed. He was wearing the cleats, socks, shorts and shirt he worked out on, when getting ready for football. Of course, the pandemic had prevented him from getting his preseason workout, so he was a tad out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, though, wasn't out of shape. For from it. He was wearing climber shorts, and from his belt was hanging several carabiners and one chalk pouch. He was bare chested, and had a trimmed beard (something he had been unable to grow in real life). Eugene didn't have Pete's big muscles, but he was definitely lean and ripped, and his abs had the classic six pack he hadn't ever bothered fantasizing about having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy also found herself looking trim. She was wearing denim shorts and a bikini top and her stomach, though not defined in the same way that Eugene's new body was, was definitely flat. Her hair was no longer darkish purple, but was a lighter violet. All her piercings and such, even in her ears, were gone, and her face looked freshly scrubbed and makeup free. Her violet hair was bound in a single braid, which hung down to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Lindsey was also taking in the new changes of her body. Lindsey had always been in a good shape (she was a cheerleader in high school, which had put her in good standing with her sisters in Gamma Upsilon Rho Lambda), but she instinctively felt she was in the best shape of her life. She looked down and found herself wearing a leathery two piece jungle girl outfit, with her arms, legs and midriff bare. Her breasts were at last a cup size bigger, and she wasn't wearing a bra, but they were so firm she didn't need to. Her rainbow colored hair seemed a bit brighter, more lustrous and full, and now hung loosely to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four looked at each other, taking in their new forms, Lindsey blurted out, \"Holy shit! I know things! Martial arts and running obstacle courses and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do obstacle courses too,\" Eugene added. \"Climb rock and ice and mountaineering and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to sail and kayak and make lean-tos and purify water and...\" Judy chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three chattered about what they knew, Pete looked on disgruntledly. He hadn't changed at all, and hadn't somehow magically learned anything at all. He was tempted to say the other three were bullshitting, except he couldn't argue with how their appearances had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eugene,\" he interrupted, feeling left out, \"How is any of this happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some really, really advanced virtual reality program,\" Eugene answered, reaching down to touch his own stomach. \"But I have no idea how.\" Eugene had washed his slight potbelly just that morning, but now he had washboard abs to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how we all know this new stuff,\" Eugene added, having not noticed that Pete hadn't contributed to everyone's excited litany of newly acquired skills, \"I haven't a clue. It sounds like something from that old Wesley Snipes movie. What was it, running man, demolition man, burning man?\" Eugene shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is all pretty cool,\" Michelle said, as she did a standing flip, which got applause from Judy, \"But what do you think we should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waiting for her to answer that question, glowing letters appeared above the four:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Welcome to the Jungle<br>\r\nWe've got fun and games.<br>\r\nCopyright prevents me from singing<br>\r\nBut I'm not naming names<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo read very carefully<br>\r\nHere's the basic rules<br>\r\nYou really should learn them<br>\r\nSo you don't act like silly fools<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start the game with five lives<br>\r\nIn Latin, that's a Vee<br>\r\nLose one, and you get another chance,<br>\r\nLose five, and well, you'll see<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things will happen<br>\r\nSo just be happy, and let things flow<br>\r\nBut there are a few things<br>\r\nWhich the answer is always no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo forward, follow prompts,<br>\r\nBe careful, and it'll be fine,<br>\r\nIgnore directions, or act contrary<br>\r\nAnd your ass is mine/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Other rules will be made apparent as the game progresses)</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules hung in the air for several minutes as the four silently read and reread them, before they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was clear as mud,\" Pete groused, still upset in this strange game that he obviously wasn't given the same advantages his three friends go. \"Can we end this game? I really don't want to play anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see an obvious off switch,\" Lindsey observed. \"Or a prompt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they took in their surroundings,the four found themselves on a high cliff, looking over a deep chasm, There was another cliff about a hundred feet on the other side of the chasm, with no obvious way of getting across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the cliff were a set of stairs carved in the rock, leading downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we take the stairs down,\" Judy observed. As the group was about to take the stairs downward, a chime sounded, and more letters appeared in midair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Your first task is simple<br>\r\nJust cross the log<br>\r\nBut if you fall<br>\r\nYou'll break your nog.</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What log are they talk---\" Lindsey began, when a long board appeared, bridging the chasm.

His memory told him he had done something like this when he had gone mountaineering, but he didn't quite trust those memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene started off timidly, purposely not looking down.

Eugene and Judy followed suit, with both of them looking to have no problem with the crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do I have a feeling I've done this before? Pete thought to himself. He hadn't, of course. At football practice, the thing he always had problem with were the foot placement drills. It was something he made himself to do extra, to get ready for the season. And now here he was, having to focus on foot placement and balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one foot at a time,\" Pete told himself, as he began crossing the chasm. \"Just one foot at time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete</span></div></div>",

He was already upset about having lost his chiseled physique, but something in the back of his mind darkly suggested that the other three would have probably been able to cross the board without this much trouble even if they hadn't had their bodies changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was doing okay...Until he got to the middle where the board began to bow and bounce with every little movement and he struggled to stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just focus Pete, you...you got this! Just like when you danced around that kid and made the winning touch down Freshman year!' The athlete tried to psyche himself up, reliving the glorious memory where he actually HAD used fancy footwork to juke around the football field. It had proved his worth to the team and to his coach and instantly put his fears of not being good enough, of his scholarship being pulled, to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this\" He hissed, and after taking a deep breath he calmed his nerves, fixed his eyes on the second half of the board...reached out with a foot and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Promptly missed his landing and fell, screaming, into the misty abyss below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER!\" Judy cried as she scrambled towards the edge of the ravine, but Lindsey grabbed her and held her from suffering a similar fate as Peter's rather unmanly screams grew fainter and fainter until there was a loud CRUNCH and then silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed text filled the air above the deadly crevice as the game spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>You need to find your balance Pete!<br>\r\nYou're slowing down the game!<br>\r\nHere let me help you out<br>\r\nWith some better footing for your feet!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distant chime in the air, and the silence was disrupted by screaming. Womanly screaming. The forest above shook and crashed as someone tall, lithe and thin landed on her ass. Her dark hair was tied in a loose braid, and her breasts were certainly filling out the blue latex jumpsuit she was wearing. Her legs were barely covered by a pair of booty shorts, and her feet were wrapped in stiletto heels. She couched once from the small cloud of dirt drifting lazily past her and then froze, her brown eyes wide as she slowly looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! I'M A FUCKING CHICK!\" She screamed, flailing her arms in panic, not knowing how to handle the sudden jiggling her body was experiencing. The red text over the chasm faded as next words formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Welcome back to yet another try<br>\r\nI've helped you out you see<br>\r\nYou should find the crossing now a snap<br>\r\nNow shut-up, go, be calm you ditz, don't you freaking cry</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman suddenly calmed as light faded from her eyes. She looked at her body, clearly curious, but the panic was long gone replaced by...Well maybe by nothing as she began curling the end of the brain in her fingers. She eventually stopped staring down into her compressed cleavage and spotted her speechless friends on the other side of the gap, and her eyes brightened as she gave them a goofy wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, OMG hey guys! Look at me! I'm TOTALLY like super hot now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Peter!?\" Judy gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Jude! Like, best song EVER! But yeah it's totally me! But um, let's stop yelling! It's totally messing with my, um, voice thingy!\" The woman rubbed her slender throat with a feminine hand and pulled herself upright with a girlish grunt, now several inches high than she had been in her normal body as she walked towards the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Peter don't-\" But Judy stopped in mid-scream as the girl that had been her boyfriend strutted across the board with no difficulty at all. IT barely even swayed or bowed under her long, confident stride, her enormous heels clipping and clopping one in front of the other, Peter looked pretty bored by the entire experience. And then she was on the other side of the chasm and towering over all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that was, like, super easy!\" Peter giggled, striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter? How...But you- I don't-\" Judy fumbled for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a stripper, Pete!\" Lindsey couldn't help but giggle. But it wasn't her normal, air-headed giggle. It was a nervous giggle of someone realizing that maybe, just maybe, they were in over their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what's with...the...\" Eugene was about to point out how Peter was acting, the polar opposite mannerisms and speech patterns, but the look his formerly male friend was giving him was pretty distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heeeey Genie\" Peter purred, walking away from Judy, her eyes fixed solely on the now last man standing, \"This game is, like, really fun...Maybe whenever we get done we can play another...game?\" Peter practically threw himself at Eugene, his new assets on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Was all the geek could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No FUCKING way.\" Judy growled, \"This is not happening. HEY GAME, WHAT THE FUCK GIVES!?\" Judy screamed into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the words appeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Oh poor Judy, don't get be a bore<br>\r\nYour boyfriend was always a bit of a tripper<br>\r\nBut not anymore, bring on the catwalks galore!<br>\r\nNow go on, lest he stay a stripper!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is...this is BULLSHIT! Change him back! Or I'll...I'll fucking smash you with a hammer when we get out of here!\" Judy roared, giving the canopy of trees the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>That's so cute, a little threat<br>\r\nBut onwards the game must go!<br>\r\nThe next path you face, a challenging race<br>\r\nYou better win before you get all wet!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, too late, silly words!\" Peter giggled, leaning heavily against Eugene, staring down at the clearly uncomfortable geek as Peter's ruby-tipped nails traced paths across his new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking kidding me?\" Judy hissed, staring angrily at what had once been her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross\" Lindsey looked away from the scene in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was a rush of wind, and a thick wall of fog closed in around the previous area, blocking out the chasm while the fog wall behind them fell away. In front of them, at the bottom of a steep, muddy slope, was an obstacle course made up of several different paths that hung low across a wide river that sat in front of a colossal, thundering waterfall. A massive mesh canopy soared above the course, sheltering most of it from the hot sun that was now directly overhead as the mist and fog curled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" Peter gasped in  simple amazement at the obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rotting rope bridges, several having already collapsed partially or completely, leaving what looked like a series of parkour platforms hanging over the river. There were several enormous fallen trees green with moss but otherwise sturdy and straight, thick hanging vines and, sticking out of the rushing water, a multitude of rocks and boulders. On the far side of the river, up another muddy bank and anchored securely into a cliff-face, was a metal platform with a large red buzzer on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before anyone could ask a question, the sky overhead darkened and there was a rumble of thunder, followed by large, heavy drops of rain that quickly turned into a full on downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, my hair!\" Peter cried out in dismay as she clung to Eugene, who wanted to be exactly anywhere else but there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think we gotta get over before the river floods!\" He yelled over the downpour, pointing at the obstacle course, which was, thanks to the canopy, dry save for the spray of the clearly rising river, \"I think the buzzer is the goal! We have to get there before the water takes out the paths!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't the game say it was a race?\" Lindsey yelled back, her soaked outfit clinging to her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So I guess whoever gets to...the buzzer first...wins?\" Judy trailed off as the the three friends shared a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what are you silly bitches talking about?\" Peter giggled despite having his hair, like, totally ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another, louder crack of thunder directly overhead and the three competitors took off, sliding down the muddy embankment towards the course as the river continued to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! LIKE, WAIT FOR ME!\" Peter cried, strutting after them as fast as he could, and screaming as the soaked ground slid out from underneath him, sending his curvy form speeding down towards his friends in a mudslide.</span></div></div>",

But that still meant getting filthy and caked in slimy wet dirt that stuck to the bottom of his new climbing shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for looking hot\" Eugene said, looking down at himself in dismay. But at least they were out of the sudden downpour of rain and under the massive tarp that stretched the length of the obstacle course. He stomped on the plain metal, dislodging as much of the mud as possible and otherwise cleaning off his gear..And then sneaking a peek at Judy and Lindsey, who were wiping the mud off their new forms with similar dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's so hot' Eugene thought and tried not to be too obvious about staring...But then he didn't have to worry at all, as a high pitched, girly scream came from above where the woman that used to be Peter lost her footing and began messily sliding down the embankment...And bringing most of it with her as a mudslide began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...RUN!\" Eugene cried out to the two girls as he darted forward the first path he saw: The water-bound boulders that were slowly disappearing beneath the white-topped rushing water of the river. His rapid movement felt strange but also natural, most likely in part to the knowledge that had been bestowed to him by the game. He scampered across the stones, heading for a larger, more vertical rock that was clearly designed to test his new climbing ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls blinked in confusion, turning to see what the newly fit geek was fleeing from...only to see the blue-clad Peter, his over-done angular face screeching in absolute terror as he flopped hard on the metal next to them, the rest of the bank close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!\" Judy and Lindsey screamed in unison, and they turned towards their own respective paths, Lindsey racing for the vines and broken bridge platforms. The muddy haired girl carefully climbed on top of the metal landing's railing and pushed off, leaping onto a dangling vine and swinging across to the first of many different platforms that were hanging precariously in different states of disrepair. The soggy wood creaked as Lindsey lined herself for the short wall run she had to make next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy herself eyed the deceptive safety of the more intact rope bridge and made her move towards it...only to look back at the muddy form of Peter, who was whimpering dumbly in the growing mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh GET UP YOU BIMBO!\" Judy screamed, and wasted valuable seconds to pull Peter to his heeled feet and shove him towards the path made up of slippery long logs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like-\" The jock turned stripper whined, but Judy was already gone, jumping over the rising mud and onto the rope bridge, which swung perilously from side to side as she started to make her way across. Judy grabbed both of the mossy, thick robes and began to take each step as quickly as she could as the bridge attempted to start barrel rolling...Or just fall apart entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Poop!\" Peter cried with a petulant stamp of his muddy heel as he tip-toed (literally) out onto the first log, using his newfound (but hadn't he, like, always had it?) balance to stay upright despite the slick moss and his mud encrusted heels and body, \"This is, like, the WORST vacation EVER!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the crumbling bank behind her and the dangerously fast and frothy water beneath her, Lindsey couldn't help but feel a thrilling rush as she stood on the swaying platform. Ahead of her was a trail of vines and collapsed bridge sections; some hung vertically, creating wall-like sections while others were flat like the one she stood on now and spaced between thick vines that hung down from above through slats in the tan-colored canopy. Here and there were metal bars that hung from thick chains and presented some form of swinging challenge. Some of the platforms rocked and bucked while others looked safe and still, and at the far end was a huge gap that was punctuated only by single rotten looking boards, vines and several rusty metal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just like those old Prince of Persia games!\" The sorority girl thought to herself with a grin. She had always been good at those games, so that skill had to translate over to...whatever this was. It certainly felt like real life...But real life didn't work like this. But she had all these skills in her head now and this new body, so it couldn't be all that hard right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a careful step back to give her just a little more space to get up to speed for the wall-run section ahead, took a couple of quick breaths and pushed herself forward, her muscled legs pumping as she raced across the section of collapsed bridge she was on. There was the ledge and...NOW! Lindsey leaped into the air, her body tilted at just enough of an angle to maintain momentum across the wall board....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she screamed as the board flipped end over end from her landing and she went crashing, hard, into the water below, bouncing off a barely visible rock with a loud \"OOF!\" before disappearing beneath the current. There was a chime as Lindsey fell from the sky and landed noisily on the muddied platform at the start of the obstacle course, a red <span class=\"clred\"><b><i>5</i></b></span> turning into a <span class=\"clred\"><b><i>4</i></b></span> appearing above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" She cried, pulling herself through the (thankfully) slowing mud to start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Judy was making progress. She figured that she had the easiest path, after all outside of Peter's current...situation, her body didn't seem the same level of athletically inclined as Lindsey and Eugene were. All of her knowledge seemed more focused on general survivalism, and she wasn't sure how filtering the rushing water below into something safely drinkable would help her in this case. And she didn't see any sailboats or kayaks rushing down the rapidly flooding river, so she was stuck with traversing the long and rickety bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step she took was slow and careful, testing the weight of each board as she moved forward. Some were sturdy enough to put her full weight on, many were dangerously soggy, but many of the boards were simply in such bad condition that they snapped with the slightest touch, dropping into the water below with a CRACK and a SPLOOSH. And each board lost, the bridge became more unstable, it's rocking more severe as it swung back and forth above the river, trying it's best to buck the goth off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll...have to try better...than that, game!\" Judy sneered through the struggle of holding onto the moldy ropes as she neared the halfway point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the collapsing river bank behind her caused the bridge's supports to loosen, a sudden slack catching Judy off balance and she stumbled forward directly into a patch of weakened boards, all of which snapped and fell away underneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME O-\" She howled as she tumbled into the rushing rapids, feeling the sting of the impact and the sound of water rushing up around her. Than the soaked goth was falling, landing knees first back on the starting platform, waist deep in the sucking mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK this game!\" Judy hissed as she fought her way out of the mud, ignoring the live counter over her head as it subtracted a life, bringing her down to four. She stepped up to the even more rickety bridge and began her slow trek once more, the water now just a little bit closer and rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was having more luck than the others, the rocks he was clambering across gave him a height advantage from getting wet. He was moving like a fluid pro. First he'd practically skipped across the first few rocks, slippery as they may have been and landed safely on the first of six different shaped boulders that sat astride the river like large fat men taking a cleansing bath. The first boulder had been easy, the hand-holds apparent and obvious as he'd made his rock up it's vertical bulk to the flat top. The next rock seemed a little trickier, there were not as many hand-holds and they were spaced apart...And the only way to the top seemed to be a deep crack in the side. He'd have to use a carabiner to get to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Geno\" He said, calling himself the name that Peter calle-well, used to call him before the game transformed the jock into a brain-dead stripper. He risked a look at his transformed friend who was making his (or would it be her?) way slowly and steadily across the first fallen tree, wobbling every few steps and saying something that her couldn't hear because of the roar of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peter's moving so slow, so I can't rely on him. This is my fault, he's stuck like that because of me. We're all stuck here because of me! I'm the only guy left and I have EPIC muscles...I've gotta save us!\" Eugene psyched himself up, allowing a macho feeling her very rarely felt fill him up as he gave the rock ahead a serious look. He gripped a fingerless gloved hand around one of the carabiners and with a wordless shout, took off running across the boulder he was on as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroic looking geek just didn't remember to take into account that rocks in rivers often had tiny divits and pools where water spray collected and were not perfect running tracks. Right as Eugene approached the edge, he splashed into a small puddle of clear water he hadn't seen, felt his ankle slip and twist under him, and the teen left loose a muffled \"WHAAA?\" as he tumbled over the edge of the boulder and impacted with a heavy thud near the bottom of the second, sticking just enough to the rock-face to realize he'd messed up before gravity peeled him off and dropped him unceremoniously into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chime sounded and Eugene fell through the air, landing on the mudslide and sliding face-first into the collected mud on the platform below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEH!\" He spat and looked above him to watch his life counter tick down one life. He spit out more of the cloying wet dirt and crawled over to the rocky starting point, looking on in despair as the river had almost covered the smaller stepping stones. He was running out of space! With a groan Eugene pulled himself up and began his trek once more across the drowned terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd meanwhile, unnoticed by all of his other friends including that, like, dreamy hunk Eugene, Peter was continuing to make his way across, putting his cat-like balance to the test and just not looking down at the totally scary amount of water that was rushing past beneath the path of fallen trees. His breasts wibbled and wobbled, his ass jiggled to and fro, but Peter knew his body (despite having only been in it for a grand total of about fifteen minutes) and trusted his perfected stripper skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, totally gonna speak to the travel agency about this!\" He muttered in his childish voice, trying not to scream as he felt the tree dipping lower as it's perch on the muddy bank grew softer and weaker. \"I'm, gonna totally have someone, like, fired! I'm SUPER sure this isn't the way to the spa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter let loose a terrified squeak when he reached the second fallen tree that was lower and closer to the water, lodged in place against a craggy pile of boulder-ettes. It was SUPER slippery, and after a long moment of, like, deep thought while he rested his glorious rear on the edge of the fallen tree, Peter removed his heels and dropped carefully to the log below, his manicured and painted toes squishing in the slick layer of moss that had grown across the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, not my nails! UGH THIS IS SO GRODY!\" Peter whined as he began making his way across the second log, ruined heels dangling from his tiny muddy hands.</span></div></div>",

The sport teen stood there for a moment, watching the wall section she had just tried to run across continue to sing back and forth, and she kicked herself for being so...well, dumb. Of COURSE it couldn't have worked, there was too much slack in the line and the section wasn't connected to anything! She should have read the terrain better before wasting one of her lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept of multiple lives was also something she wasn't trying to think too much on. If this had been real life and she'd done that...She would have been dead. A shiver not totally related to the cool air of the overhead storm or the wind racing through the river canyon crept down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, focus Linds\" She said to herself, \"You still have to get a running start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey walked over and inspected the vertical sections of the ruined bridge and realized that there were several areas where, if she was careful, she could crawl along one before leaping to the other. Then she just had to make that fine up ahead to the next platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems...simple enough\" Lindsey said with a shrug. She moved back to the start position on her platform, took a deep breath...And sprinted forward, racing across the boards and with a mighty leap, reached out and...snagged her hand in one of the gaps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" She screamed in exhilaration as she pulled the rest of her body up onto the section and with a excited giggle, began crawling across it towards the second section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy struggled on the slippery wood, now having to climb up at a bit of an angle due to the new slack from the bridge's supports coming loose and having the added challenge of all the loose wood she had stepped on before being completely gone, leaving a haphazard path back to where she had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First it takes my boyfriend, then it MURDERS me...fuck this game. I don't care if my body feels great, just...fuck this thing\" Judy muttered as she leap-frogged from solid plank to solid plank, using engaging her core muscles as she launched herself back up the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ropes twisted and turned from the rough action as the bridge began to violently swing from side to side, and Judy screamed in terror and frustration as it spun completely upside down as she approached the gaping hole where she'd lost her first life, her legs leaving the uncertain safety of the boards as she hung suspended over the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! NOT AGAIN!\" Judy roared as she clung tightly to the ropes, her hands aching from the exertion as her knuckles turned white. She wasn't going to lose another life! She had to win...She had to get Peter back! After a moment terrified desperation, she began pulling herself upwards, redistributing her weight as she hooked a leg around one of the bridge's rope supports. She grunted again and swung her other leg up, securing herself in the ropes and from another plunge into the greedy white waters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! TAKE THAT, ugh, GAME!\" Judy screamed in primal fury. She carefully rotated herself upside down and began pulling herself along the upside down bridge, blinking water out of her eyes as she grinned like a mad woman at her progress (and the fact that even she had to admit, this felt pretty damn awesome like an action movie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene skipped along the disappearing path of smaller stones as carefully as he could, the rushing rapids of the river consuming his path forward far more quickly than the others due to their proximity to the water. Before they'd been a comfortable four or five feet above the water line, but the river was rising so rapidly that now they was being constantly splashed and soaked by the flood waters, making Eugene's trek quite risky as he nearly slipped twice on his return trip across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" He swore as he pushed off the final stone and onto the first boulder, right as the rising tide swallowed the rock whole. He looked back and groaned with worry; the entire path was now GONE! He'd have to try one of the other paths if he wanted to cross the river...And outside of the three taken ones, the only path left was the rather risky looking two vines that he'd have to crawl back up the muddy embankment to get to...And then swing like hell and hoped he wasn't just mistaking environment detail for part of the actual competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut time for reflection was over as water lapped against his climbing shoes, and Eugene forced his new body to move as he clambered up the rock with less ease than he had before, given his soaked and doubly muddy clothes. But he made it once more to the top, swinging a leg over the lip of the boulder and pulling himself up with the leverage. He hung there for a moment however, feeling his muscles ripple and flex, expecting a burning pain...Yet all he felt was exhilarated energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is what Pete always feels...felt like?\" The normally overweight boy wondered, and then he pulled himself on top of the boulder and made his way, much more carefully this time, to the far lip and inspected the second of the three massive stones he had to cross. Running and jumping was out of the question, what with all the deceptive pitting (biopitting, his knew knowledge based warned him) that caused him to fail the first time. Now that he had taken the time, he spied a small grouping of potential handholds one the backside of his own boulder. They'd allow him to get a better, more secure base to leap across onto the second boulder, rather than his reckless movie star stunt that had ended in failure before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong, not dumb\" Eugene mumbled to himself, reminding himself to not get overly reliant on his new body as he lowered himself down for a second traverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Peter, poor Peter, was still inching her way across the second large log, squealing each time the log rocked was the water rushed against it, threatening to dislodge it from it's precarious perch on the disappearing rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, like, don't think about it girl!\" She whispered to herself, keeping her eyes locked straight ahead, her legs mincing forward like she'd done a thousand times before at work. This was, ummm, this was like no different than her routine! Yeah! Just ignore all that totally super grody stuff squishing between her cute little toes and messing with her pedi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log rocked again, harder this time, and Peter screamed as she tilted dangerously from side to side, her assets threatening to lose their delicate balance. Her heels clopped together as she stuck her arms out trying to regain her balance and she felt the added weight of the mud-laden stilettos pulling her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WooAAAhhh!\" She cried, and Peter gave her beloved heels a pouty look before she released them from her tiny hands, the heels dropping beneath the rising water with a PLOOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were, like, my best pair! Like, I'm totally never coming here again!\" Peter slowly regained her balance as the log shifted below her, tilting slightly upwards. The stripper took a nervous ragged breath, refocused on the log's horizon, and tried to play the music of her routine in her head as she moved towards the end of the log. Ahead of her were a collection of large flat stones that would take her up towards a shining metal pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I, like, know ALL about poles...\" She thought airily, thinking of a certain pole she'd prefer to be looking at, stealing a glance over at the super hunky Eugene as he heroically leaped from one big rock thingy to the other like a total movie star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her tiny feet started to lose traction, and Peter shook the errant thought from her mind as she looked away. She, like, didn't want to go swimming in some dumb river! She was pool-side only!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus it would, like, totally ruin my hair\" She pouted, already forgetting her black mane had been ruined on her tumble down the hill, now being filled with mud, twigs and properly soaked all the way through.</span></div></div>",

They were walking around Pete, giving him mock wolf whistles, and even teasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm a little jealous,\" Lindsey told Judy. \"The game bumped me a cup size,\" she observed, cupping her breasts through her leather top, \"But Pete got to start the game with a bigger set. They're almost as big as yours, Judy!\" Lindsey reached over to feel Pete's new rack, but he slapped her hand away, which just got Judy and Lindsey laughing harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene could see Pete was seething. Eugene knew some guys who chose a female avatar in a first person game, because if they had to look at an ass through the entire game, they wanted it to be a female one. But not Pete. Pete's whole identity was tied into his masculinity, and the fact that he had been forced into a female avatar in a game, particularly a game as intensively real as this one, was almost too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene wasn't going to say anything, though. At some point, the game would end, Pete would be a burly football player, Eugene would be a nerdy, slightly overweight freshman, and Pete would remember any insults Eugene delivered in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was trying to think of something to say that might diffuse the situation when more instructions appeared above the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>For his rude behavior<br>\r\nYou now have Petra, instead of Pete,<br>\r\nTrust me, she's all woman now<br>\r\nFrom her head down to her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC, D, E,<br>\r\nHow lovely they must feel!<br>\r\nIt's just a game, you all four say,<br>\r\nBut what if it all was real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this second on.<br>\r\nAs you cross field and range<br>\r\nThis simple promise I will make you<br>\r\nNothing more will change<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how about a bonus?<br>\r\nFrom my land into yours?<br>\r\nA change that will last forever?<br>\r\nMorphing that endures?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess my little riddle<br>\r\nSolve my clues, and then,<br>\r\nAll once had all five lives<br>\r\nAnd so they shall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudy on the second.<br>\r\nTrust me, there's naught amiss<br>\r\nComplete the second of the second<br>\r\nThen seal it with a kiss</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's eyes narrowed dangerously. He knew he was all woman now. The game had reduced the size of his equipment before, and had now removed it completely, replacing it with a vagina. The absence there was the weirdest thing he had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only upside was that this new body of Pete's had skills, just like the other three. Pete knew he would now have no problems crossing that board. Heck, he could somersault over it without breaking a sweat. But Pete didn't want those skills. He didn't want to be in a woman's body (except in the traditional male rutting way). He just wanted this game to be over, and the only video game he was ever going to play was Madden football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four studied the instructions in silence before </span></div></div>",

And, I have to admit, it's kind of funny Pete having to play with a girl's body. I mean, he's a good boyfriend and everything, but he can be kind of an asshole too. Plus, his new body seems to have skills that his old one doesn't. So he won't be slowing the rest of us down. Or should I start calling him she?\" Judy said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Eugene and Lindsey noticed Judy never said she loved Pete, but didn't mention that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I said I think that's what the game is promising. I'm not sure,\" Lindsey confessed. \"But I do know if we do solve the riddle, that is to say, perform the answer, then the game will definitely not change our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the answer?\" Eugene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing,\" Lindsey said, deliberately refusing to provide the answer. \"I think if the we act through the answer, it will give Pete his fifth life back. I think it will also make the changes to our bodies permanent. Not only here, but in the real world as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Judy thought about it for a minute, then added, \"I wouldn't mind. I mean, okay, I like this body. It's like the best version of me, even if it is tattoo and piercing free. And maybe I'm through with that phase of my life anyway. But this is just a game. A game can't just give me a body in the real world. Can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this feel like any video game you've ever played?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Judy could only nod in agreement with Lindsey's observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the answer?\" Eugene asked, repeating his earlier question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the second stanza,\" Lindsey said. \"It starts off with C, D, and E. I usually were a 34B bra,\" Lindsey said matter of factly, \"But I think the game made me a C cup. Judy, you're an E cup, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded, blushing at discussing that detail in front of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete's new body looks to be somewhere in between our two sizes. The next line in that poem talks about how they must feel, and then later on it says seal it with a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Judy asked, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the answer is, Eugene here has to feel us up, and give us a kiss while he's doing so,\" Lindsey explained. \"And he has to do it in a certain order. First me, then Pete, than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Judy replied. Her eyebrows furrowed as she thought about it. She looked up at Eugene and said, \"Well, I guess I would be okay if Eugene didn't go around and brag about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross my heart and promise not to,\" Eugene said, as he found himself getting hard at the thought of being able to handle Judy's big breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be okay with me too,\" Lindsey added, which made Eugene get even harder. \"I like this body, and I like being a badass. I'm pretty sure Eugene would like to take his new body back into the real world as well. But do you think it would be okay with Pete? Do you think he wants anyone to grab his tits and kiss him? Do you think Pete wants to get stuck in that body forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Judy said simply. Judy and Eugene Lindsey stared at each other until Pete/Petra called from the other side of the chasm. \"Hey, I'm on the other side!

Like what would be like to <b>use</b> his penis with a member of the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was a virgin and, though he hoped to be relieved of that condition while at college, had no hopeful prospects in the immediate future, particularly with the pandemic going on.

Before anyone could argue, Lindsey stepped on the log and began crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing. Lindsey's body just knew the right place to put her feet, and how to adjust for the slight bounce to the log, and the occasional errant breeze.

'This new body knows how.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that mantra in mind, Eugene stepped on the board and began crossing. Like Lindsey, his body instinctively knew what to do. With a laugh, Eugene almost trotted over the chasm. He and Lindsey exchanged an excited hug, with Eugene forcing himself not to make the hug too long or awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waved for Judy and Pete to join them. Judy tried to make eye contact with Pete, but he was refusing to engage. With a shrug, she began crossing the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's muscles had memories of climbing through the lines and masts of a tall ship, even in storms.

The football player stared daggers at Eugene. Eugene looked away, and Judy refused to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was possibly the only one of the four who could look at the conditions dispassionately. The game was telling Pete he could wait out the game here, but there were rewards that Pete wouldn't get. And that line about Pete's luck unraveling sounded ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stanza about Pete getting to cross \"for free\" if Eugene got to feel Judy up didn't sound good. On the face of it, it didn't require any sacrifices. But it was sure to drive a wedge between Pete, Judy and Eugene. Just the suggestion of it had already done that. Pete was petulant to begin with. Whatever the game had done to Pete's penis had made his attitude worse. If Pete had to watch Eugene groping his girlfriend, that would be the nail in the coffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was also giving Pete the choice of giving up two lives to cross the chasm. On the face of it, that was also a decent deal. Lindsey had finally deduced that, off all the four students, Pete hadn't gotten any special abilities. Theoretically, if Pete tried to cross that chasm, he could fail five times and lose all five of his lives. So two lives would actually be a good bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey wasn't sure she even wanted Pete to go along with them. She was enjoying the game, enjoying the things she could do here that she couldn't do in the normal world. Pete...Pete coming along would probably just ruin things for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the game ended now, Lindsey was pretty sure she could never be on friendly terms with Pete ever again. But whatever happened next, for better or worse, it was going to be Pete's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete looked at the instructions and decided to</span></div></div>",

She wanted to scream, to rant, to do something to get to Pete to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete just stood there stolidly, not looking back. The board crossing the chasm disappeared, while a mist began rising from the chasm. Soon it was so thick, that Pete and the opposite side of the chasm were no longer visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just stared in the mist silently. Eugene and Lindsey stood there, feeling awkward, wanting to say something but not sure what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Judy turned to the other two, a determined look on her face. \"I guess we better find a way off this cliff. Unless there's another prompt?\" Judy looked up at the open air, daring the game to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game didn't respond to the taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a trail at the top of the cliff leading downward. Lindsey led the way, with Judy in the middle and Eugene bring up the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of rears, Eugene couldn't help but notice that both girls had firm, athletic rears. A little narrow in the hip for some, but Eugene definitely approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene forced himself to stop focusing on female backsides. No telling what would befall him if he let himself get distracted in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path ended midway down the cliff on a wide ledge. Set in the cliff were five doors, each with five different symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the first door was an infinity symbol over the number eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the second door was the number 2425, with a small hourglass shape in the exponential position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the third door was a solid vertical line in the center. On either side of the line were two wavy vertical lines, and on the outside of the lines were two infinity signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the fourth line was a vertical horizontal line, with a pair of concentric circles on either side of the vertical horizontal line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the fifth line looked like a left pointing arrow next to a golf tee, with both followed by what looked like a tic tac toe matrix where the ink had run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is bullshit,\" Judy yelled up at the air. \"So first you fuck with my boyfriend, and when he gets tired of your bullshit. you fuck with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air didn't deign to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at the other two, and there was an air of exhaustion and defeat about her. Lindsey stepped up and gave Judy a hug. Judy returned the hug with a fierceness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hug ended, she gave Eugene a hug as well. Startled, Eugene returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's be honest,\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"The game did fuck with Pete, but he was kind of being a baby about things to begin with. So I'm going to forget about him for a while and focus on winning this game. Who's with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the way,\" Lindsey answered. Eugene echoed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shakes her head at the symbols on the door. \"I thought this was supposed to be about adventure sports, not puzzle solving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The symbols might be clues to the next challenge behind them,\" Lindsey opined. \"We get to pick our next challenge, if we decipher what the symbols on each door means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they might be Easter eggs,\" Eugene adds. \"You know, a reward of some kind. The instructions back there said there would be rewards. Maybe we figure out the clues we get the reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever is behind the doors, I can't make heads or tails out of these symbols,\" Judy says with a shake of her head. \"Although...\" She's staring at the fifth door, her eyebrows furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged their observations and theories before deciding to go through the</span></div></div>",

Judy started reaching for one, then snatched her hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would anyone mind if I take the carabiner?\" asked, almost meekly. Lindsey smiled and said, \"Go ahead,\" and Eugene smiled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I out to take the dumbbell,\" Pete said, reaching into Eugene's palm to take the token. \"Since I'm the only one among us who's ever actually picked one up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only two tokens left, Eugene gave Lindsey a sheepish smile. She laughed and said, \"Don't worry, I won't stick you with bikini.\" Eugene gave Lindsey a grateful smile as she took the bikini token, leaving him with the carabiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the console had heard his question, it's mechanical voice said \"<b>PLACE AVATARS BACK IN DRAWER.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends did so dutifully, and the drawer snapped shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pete could repeat his earlier question, the room was filled with a loud screech and a blinding light. The four students crouched on themselves, until both noise and light stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the four of them opened their eyes, the found themselves on a desolate ocean beach. And there had been changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete found himself in the shorts and shirt he worked out with the rest of the football team in. Pete had felt a little sloppy the last few weeks, since he hadn't been participating in his team's preseason football workout. But that's not how he felt now. He felt at the top of his game. He felt better than that. He felt like he could put up record breaking numbers on the football field, and be in the running for the Heisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene felt weird. Good, but weird. He found himself clothed entirely in black, with only his eyes visible. His body was fitter than it had ever been in his life. Better than he had ever fantasized. Eugene had two visible blades on his body, and various weapons and gadgets squirreled about his body, and he knew how to use each and everyone of them to their deadliest effect. He knew he could see in near darkness, cross a tightwire even in a moderate wind, climb a near featureless wall, and perform mind blowing acrobatics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was studying a strand of her hair. It was brown now, and fell around her shoulders. She was wearing a khaki shirt and shorts with lots of pockets, each with a different device. The shirt was tied off just below her ribs, displaying a flat stomach and her large breasts which, though always firm, felt a little firmer know. Judy had always been in decent shape, but now she felt in great shape. She knew she could boulder, find a trail up a seemingly featureless cliff face, find the best source of food no matter what wilderness environment you set her in. She was the expedition racing badass she always fantasized about being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was in a wetsuit, though it was unzipped to her waist, revealing her green bikini top encased breasts. Lindsey had started the day wearing a B-cup top, but the bikini top she was wearing revealed she had gone up two cup sizes. She was still a cup size smaller than Judy, but the changes didn't go unnoticed by either Pete or Eugene, who were surreptitiously checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's body was a golden brown, with her hair now a dirty blonde, and reaching down to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey had been a cheerleader in high school, and still considered herself an athlete. But her body was telling her that she was just kidding herself before. Now Lindsey was an athlete. Her pronounced back muscles had become so defined by a body trained to do any variations of surfing and sailing, as well as being able to swim three miles in record setting time. Lindsey's body was telling her it could be one of those people who swam the English Channel, if she wanted to, or set free diving records, or basically do anything she wanted to do in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four just stood there, looking at themselves and each other, a chest rose out of the sand. The chest was small, able to fit into a large palm. It opened up, and from within, the Mechanical Voice that had intoned from the game console said \"<b>CHOOSE ONE TOKEN</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the game has begun,\" Eugene said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you, Geno?\" Pete asked. \"Normally, I'd say you look like a dork, but I don't know. There's just something bad radiating from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad ass,\" Eugene replied. \"I have no idea how the game did this, but all I can say is WOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, WOW, definitely fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the chest intoned \"<b>CHOOSE ONE TOKEN</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we supposed to do?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four suddenly became aware that they were clutching the token they had chosen in their right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we need to put one of the tokens in the chest to start the adventure,\" Judy opined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four discuss the various possible outcomes of putting a different token in the chest, and decide to put in the</span></div></div>",

Lindsay already looked on the verge of dropping it, and throwing the game. Peter looked like he'd have preferred a more sports based game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to start the game before any objections were raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing the 'Start Game', a chip-tune emerged from the games system, and it started a countdown. Eugene frowned, not expecting it needed to load any levels, or even be capable of such complexity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he looked around, he suddenly spotted his hands instead of gripping the controller were turning to dust. The various particles only loosely held in place. The murmur of panic told him, that his friends had noticed too. The next moment, the dust started to race towards the screen. Drawing more of his arm into the dusty flurry, before reaching his body. His scream was cut out, as his chest was overrun by the ... the whatever... His thoughts still jumbled and terrified. Eugene was trying to lean back, further and further to avoid this. But as it reached his face, Eugene's vision went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodiless, he felt himself thrown wildly about. Ricochetting around invisible corners, or drawn down some twisting wire. The sensations stopped before he could analyse it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was back in the real world... Or, if it was the game one, it was very impressive. No longer where he was, his eyes darted wildly around. Ignoring the other people, he took only a few moments to realise he was in an office... Well, the tea room. The kettle clicked off, and he spotted the four mugs sitting ready for the boiling water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about this moment, as Eugene wanted as much normality as possible. He reached out to pour a mug for everyone he spotted the feminine hand reaching for the kettle. His own hand. Twisting his wrist this way and that, Eugene confirmed it was a woman's hand... and following his gaze up that arm. He found a slender shoulder, and the unmistakable bulge of his bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather disconcerting from this angle. She felt her heart race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring the water, the air filled with the unmistakable aroma of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eugene...\" he said, his voice now trilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/11/42/cc1142e74031a934cf33500894fe8c03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/11/42/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Jeanie...\" Another girl quipped.

And then we'll be out of here and back in our bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily, who knows how long it could take us to get promoted.  It could take in game months or even years to get the promotion.  We might even get a game over if we screw up enough.  See,\"  Lindsay said pointing at her ID.  \"In tiny print on the back of the ID it says '5 lives'.  Maybe if we screw up 5 times we get a game over and who knows what happens then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter gulped as his eyes widened in terror.  His girlfriend noticed her boyfriends distress and Judy put an arm around Peter's shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, I'll help you out so you don't have to find out what happens if we lose...but I'll still kick all of your butts.\"  She said as she gave Peter a quick peck on the cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably won't be that bad, I'm sure time will probably fly by as we play like in any real game.\"  Eugene said to cheer everyone up, \"It'll be just like doing homework!\"  He added enthusiastically and Lindsay nodded in agreement.  Judy and Peter didn't share the same love of homework as the two nerdier members of their group, but didn't want to rain on their parade.  Now that the 4 had settled down and into this world a little bit more, a clock went off implying the tea break was over.  The four players went to their starting stations behind their desks which were conveniently all beside each other and right outside of the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Peter could even sit down he heard the mad tapping of computer keys from Eugene and Lindsay's stations.  Judy was already answering a phone call and Peter was just staring at a blank screen not sure what to do first.  He already felt like he was in last place, something his competitive nature was not a fan of, but he had no idea how to get the promotion first to win and turn everything back.</span></div></div>",

It was the other person... a police officer, with a threat of a ticket... and a casual invitation for a date being offered. Just not explicitly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, Petra watched in horror, as Leo raised a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you girls, could make the same argument... You have similar amounts of experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSingling each of them out, with a stab of the pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean is my fastest typist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy one of the best for closing sales...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to struggle with Lindsay, his face silently confessing she was there as eye-candy. In her lurid top, and too tight skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you... Petra, you have your own skill sets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftening his approach, \"I know it's difficult, you'll all have the answer at the end of the day. There won't be this cloud of uncertainty hanging over all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to escalate, and end this Petra decided to play her appeal card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do to sway your decision?\" she asked innocently. Her question deliberately neutral, she kept any sexual suggestion from her tone, and any explicit promise clear from the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she did rest her hands on his desk, as she bent from the waist. Giving him a view deep into her cleavage, as the girls themselves strained to fall from Petra's lacy bra cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealing one last lingering look (If it could be called stealing, when it was being so clearly offered). Leo sighed with regret, before sinking back into the deep padding of his swivel chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" he answered with clear restraint, \"You'll just have to wait until the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny, crystal clear chime sounded in the air. Leo didn't react as if it had sounded. But Petra was absolutely sure she'd heard it. Looking around, she saw her three friends looking through the office glass to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissed and defeated, she left his office. A glance to her ID badge showed 4 lives inscribed there. Worse, Petra felt another change too. A punishment to go with her lost life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/f5/62/e9f562e6fd5517fe35e4bf47544d5cbf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/f5/62/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt felt more tightly packed.

Perhaps a juicy ass was a reasonable price after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra's musing were missed by Judy who was strutting proudly towards Leo's office. Sure the promotion was literally in her hands.

A curt, \"Close the Door.\" was the only protection her dignity received, as Leo gave her a dressing down for not having sold ten times that amount to a regular customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe windows, and partition walls were far from sound proof.

Currently her gal, and she intended on establishing her authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing from her own body, she soon reduced Petra to a mewling, whimpering mess.

But, she was still lost in an endorphin haze, as she waited for Judy's next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra was unaware, that behind her back, Judy was removing her from the competition. Deleting an e-mail, from her phone. She ensured a report due by lunch would be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra whimpered with needs, as she felt Judy's hands taking her wide hips. But, they merely planted her back on her unsteady feet. Wobbling like a new-born deer. Petra took a few moments to realise this wasn't a set-up to her next mauling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy straightened her outfit with a couple of quick tugs at the hem, and lapels.

For Lindsey, she tried not to feel too bad about tricking the little nerd, but she was terrified of being changed. So much so that she was now heavily relying on her programming skills and base computer instincts to help win. Her fingers, even capped by long ungainly nails that she despised, flashed across the tiny keys as words filled the screen, and before long she was already pages ahead of schedule, risking a glance at Jeanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl was struggling, a look of frustration on her face as she hen pecked her keyboard as fast as possible, swearing quietly as she continually had to backspace and retype a word because of her own long fingernails. In the last ten minutes she'd barely completed three pages due to her slower and inefficient typing habits, her fingers naturally conforming to the WASD positioning used for gaming rather than the 'Home Row' method they'd taught in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanie risked a glance up at Lindsey, and the natural woman was yawning, a look of boredom on her face as she seemed to type without needing to look at the keyboard every few seconds. She leaned back and took her hands off the keys, stretching her arms and pushing her breasts put prominently, and Jeanie felt her own hands flop over the keys in distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeanie, is it hot in here?\" Lindsey asked innocently, looking around before wiping her brow dramatically, \"Maybe it's just all these computers...I just really wish I had a way to cool down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey then casually undid several buttons on her blouse, the light green fabric splitting apart to dangle a canyon of cleavage in front of Jeanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's MUCH better!\" Lindsey giggled as she wiggled in her chair, sending her assets jiggling, \"Well, back to, like work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teasing girl went back to work with a smirk, her rapid fire typing filling the air between them once again, Jeanie couldn't help but feel as though she'd blundered into a trap.

I really expected more of you, Ms. Michaels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but!\" She whined as the chime sounded and she looked down at her employee ID as a bar was subtracted, leaving her with four lives left. \"N-no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second half of the punishment began as Lindsey felt her rear press swell dramatically, pressing against the already tight fitting skirt. She felt the material threatening to split apart from just standing there. She desperately wanted to feel how large it was now, but she was frozen in fear...If she felt herself up in front of her current boss...She might lose (and gain) even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to your desk, Ms. Michaels. I expect a completed and professional looking copy of this on my desk by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey summoned her courage and whimpered a less than confident \"Yes sir\" before turning and carefully wiggling herself to the door, her skirt squeaking and groaning as the material struggled to hold in her swollen new rear. She opened the office door and quietly tip-toed out, looking down into her cleavage to avoid the smirk stares from Petra and Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...It should have worked!\" She muttered to herself, seeing Jeanie burying herself in her work, fingers chattering away on the keyboard. She carefully lowered herself into the now smaller chair and winced at how her hips now bumped against the hard plastic armrests, forcing Lindsey to push herself down in order to fit back at her desk, and gave a huff that bordered on a sob as she went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...She was better than this! She hacked TWO different college servers! She could write basic data entry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Lindsey could feel worse about herself, Leo's voice called out from his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Petra, I need you in the office for a moment. Something has come...up\" Their boss said ominously, and the secretaries stared at Petra in sympathy and worry as the former athlete tried desperately to not freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means now, please\" Leo called out again, and there was a steely undercurrent to his voice. Ptra scrambled to her feet, did her best not to fall over, and minced into the manager's office, shutting the door behind her.</span></div></div>",

She took a heaving breath and turned to face the...video game character? REally person? Petra couldn't deny the strange new feelings and sensations she felt as real, but she wasn't quite ready to admit that this wasn't more than a VERY elaborate game, or possibly prank, being pulled by someone, possibly Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm totally kicking his ass for this' She thought to herself as she took the seat that Leo was offering with his free hand.

So instead of giving you another reprimand today, I'm offering you a chance for...let's call it 'redemption'. I have something that needs to be taken care of in a timely and professional manner. Leo said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you can do this for me, I'll put your name back in major contention for the promotion.

Anything you want sir!\", but then going wide-eyed as the flat-topped executive frowned at the nterrupton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she watched as Leo shifted awkwardly in his seat, as if he was trying to dislodge or adjust something without using his hands.

He simply waved and blew Judy a kiss as he went in search of HR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully this office generated by the game was kind enough to leave a helpful trail of arrows that pointed Petra in the right direction.

Then a devious thought crossed Peter's mind.  The paperwork seemed to have some space to write and add a few things.  Perhaps he could give himself a glowing review and maybe bring the other 3 down a peg or two.  '<i>It'd only be fair.  The others already had skills that gave them a head start, why shouldn't I get my own bonus boost?</i>'.

As Leo's thumb swept back and forth, an icy chill settled in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he closed the blinds on the glass partition overlooking the rest of the office. Sealing off Petra's witnesses, leaving them blind to what was going on. The office darkened, as the strip lighting was kept out. The clouds outside were dark, blocking out much of the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra had never felt more alone, isolated and vulnerable. As Leo walked back to the desk, she felt rooted to the desk. Afraid to flee, and disobey her immediate superior. She trembled, when Leo rested a strong masculine hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe towered over her, even had she hopped off the desk, he simply have stood taller than her. Leo's other hand returned to her thigh. This time rising, she whimpered and mewled afraid to make a noise, or protest. Even as she became aware, he was sliding his hands to explore her crotch. Pulse racing, eyes darting wildly for any escape. Leo took that as excitement, as evidence of her horny need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to show how committed you are to the company... to <i>pleasing</i> your bosses...\" As Leo's calm steady words reached her ears, they felt to Petra like screaming demands.... <i>Please me or be fired....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go along to get along...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncreasing the weight of his hand on her shoulder, he slowly bent Petra's head lower. Her eyes locking onto Leo's crotch... She saw to her horror his zipper was undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to be a cock-sucker... Her teeth clenched, she shook her head. Peter had been sucked off a couple of times... But this was wrong! Leo missed the shake of the head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid herself from the desk, using the impetus to leave the room.

Looks like there's an option for an 'outdoors' simulation or a 'music' simulation...And it looks like if I type the number 3 it'll list off even more stuff.\" Eugene neglected to mention the little voice in side his head telling him that maybe this 'U' person was still around, despite how old the game machine looked. Maybe there was some kind of wireless card inside? The game HAD said that it could be connected to a computer, maybe even the Internet in order to download new game types...But that notecard had been crisp and clearly new. It wasn't just a relic from the 80s or whenever, some programmer speaking to another in the days where instant communication was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly had a hard time remembering if he'd caught the girl's name that had been at the shop in the mall. Had it started with a 'U'? That didn't seem right...But the longer they messed with the machine, the more of a not-quite-right feeling was growing inside of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" Lindsey cooed, her blue eyes lighting up at the new modes, \"Music sounds REALLY fun! Maybe it's, like, karaoke or something! I totally did that at a Japanese bar when I went on my honors trip to Japan last year in high school. It was so much, like fun! And those Japanese guys get REALLY into it! But me an' Bethany TOTALLY won with our duet! I got a little trophy and everything up in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to Japan? On an honors trip?\" Peter said, coughing a bit as the sip from Judy's iced tea caught in his throat in surprise. This was quickly followed up by a soft elbow to the side from Judy, who was giving him a look. \"I mean, uh, that just sounds really, uh, expensive! Yeah, expensive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn't seem to mind, or perhaps notice, the gaff, \"Yeah! Like Honors Club wanted to do something different than just flying to DC, right? So we convinced the teachers to, like, let us fly to Japan! 'Course we all had to get jobs on top of doing all the fundraising since yeah it was, like, SUPER pricey! But SO totally worth it! Tokyo was a blast! We should totally go before we graduate! I know, like, all the best shops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was still blown away by the revelation, Peter especially. The learned jock had tried to steer away from 'labeling' others, given he worked hard to make people see him as something other than just a dumb jock on a scholarship run, but Lindsey either was putting on a enormous 'innocent dumb blonde' act or really was like the chick from the old Legally Blonde movie and just didn't realize how much like a bimbo she often sounded. Even if she did lack the normal 'bimbo curves' on her stickish frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music COULD be cool, I uh, usedtobeinachurchchoir\" Judy mumbled, and regretted saying anything to try to cover up her boyfriend's error. She saw Lindsey and Eugene turn to stare at her while PEter looked up at the ceiling as innocently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU went to church!? But like, all the gothy stuff!\" Lindsey said, pointing at Judy's heeled boots, fishnet stockings, black and purple skirt and the one size too small t-shirt that had a heart shaped skull on it, Judy's purple hair and the heavy eyeliner and black lipstick that adorned her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, uh, parents made me do it.\" Judy said quietly as she tried to disappear into the couch next to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so gothy! You're like, the most gothy chick I know!\" In reality Judy was the ONLY gothy chick Lindsey knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was the outdoors one like, Geno?\" Peter said, clearing his throat in an attempt to steer the conversation away from Judy's past, which he knew she hated talking about. He had been dating her for almost two years and he STILL barely knew anything about it and what he did know was only because of 'boyfriend confidentiality'. But he did know that it wasn't a happy place...And that Judy was a fantastic singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well...\" Eugene looked at the machine and the game box and then just shrugged, \"I guess just something to do outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds pretty nice. The air IS getting a little stuffy in here. I change my vote to Outdoors instead of music\" Judy said, running some fingers along the back of Peter's head in appreciation for the topic change. Despite the fact he could sometimes be a bit of a whiny accidental jerk, she was glad that he had a good heart and had looked out for her. MAybe later she could show him just how much she appreciated him, after they got done playing with 'the kids'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! But...\" Lindsey pouted, burrowing into her bean-bag in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys I...I'm not sure if\" Eugene couldn't put off the creepy feeling he was getting from the dome-like machine buzzing on the table in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow, Genie!\" Lindsey suddenly chirpped, pulling herself out of the beanbag and sliding the game's keyboard away from the startled geek. She stuck her tongue out playfully and typed in...</span></div></div>",

The younger girl was sometimes a little TOO impulsive, and it had put a strain on their friendship more than once. This was appearing to be one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow too slow, let's just play a game!\" Lindsey's eyes twinkled with mischievous energy as her fingers dancing across the keyboard with far less caution than Eugene's hen-pecking style had been. Typing was just natural to her, more so than it was to the other students that had grown up with computers. You kinda, like, had to be when you worked with programming code and may or may not have hacked into a college database to change a friend's grades from across country...Or into North Point's own servers to make sure that she personally wasn't forced to go back home and deal with her own drama. The less said about that jerk the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey hadn't missed Judy's sudden regret at mentioning her past, and while Lindsey really, really REALLY felt like having a fun karaoke night she decided to err on the side of caution and instead type in 'OUTDOORS' into the machine. She pressed enter and the game made a fax machine sound accompanied by grinding metal...And Lindsey was suddenly afraid that she may have broken her geeky friend's toy...But then the machine returned to it's normal soft buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUTDOORS SELECTED. PLEASE SELECT AVATARS AND CHOOSE GAME MODE\" The machine said, two black buttons that had 'Traditional' and 'SImmersive' stenciled onto them. A tray popped out from the side of the machine filled with tiny game pieces made up of all kinds of different outdoor-related objects, but four were held above the rest on small racks: A cowboy hat, a rifle, an axe, and a rather rugged looking backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lindsey?\" Judy looked at the clearly more than she seemed ditzy blonde, who gave her a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're SO right, the air is getting pretty stale in here. Besides, maybe it'll, like, put us on teams! Lindsey got up and practically jumped onto Eugene's lap, whose face immediately turned a deep shade of red as she draped her skinny arms around his neck. \"I call Eugene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ooh, u-uh\" The geek stammered as he tried to to will his penis from growing erect as he looked away. He tried to think of something, like a rock or...Well, anything other than his giggling crush that was draped across him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we wanna, like, do this Traditional thingy? Or try Immersive? I'm a real good DnD player, you know...\" Lindsey cooed, enjoying how uncomfortable she was making Eugene feel. It was a guilty pleasure of hers, she LIKED teasing boys, especially ones that didn't know how to tease back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Peter and Judy just shared a surprised look at each other. Judy had been trying to get the two together since the beginning of the semester last fall but Lindsey had seemed uninterested in being anything but friends with the fat little dork, and Peter had been trying to push Eugene to open up more and stop being such a, well, stereotype. This seemed to be jumping several steps in their 'plan' of getting the two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if no one is gonna say anything...\" Lindsey said, her voice an innocent singsong that was betrayed by the twinkle in her blue eyes. She stretched out like a cat and dug her hand into the small tray, plastic rattling as her hand dug around before she mad a fist and withdrew, sliding the try back into the game before pressing...</span></div></div>",

It was better if it was random. It was more fun when you couldn't plan out your encounters. That's why during the fateful DnD game she'd ignored the min-maxed Elf spell-caster and had closed her eyes and landed on the tiny Gnome rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was also the game that led to her being banned from the campus DnD circles simply because she'd shown up all those nerds that had been too busy trying to flirt with her, or gatekeep her or talk down to her simply because she was a rare female that was deep in what was still, even in this day and age, considered 'man territory', though really could those boys really be considered men? She'd been the closest some would ever get to a woman, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Judy and her sweet Eugene, the one little nerd that was actually TRYING to do more than just get in her pants, all snatched at the primary colored plastic and stared at them, and then her, as the blonde reached over and pressed 'ENTER'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop!\" She sang out, but then went limp in Eugene's arms as the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what...What happened? Eugene? Judy? Peter?\" Lindseycroaked as the world swam back into focus. But as the dizziness cleared, Judy could see that they definitely were not in Kansas...well, Colorado anymore. Or maybe they were, but it definitely wasn't Gunner's Butte. And they definitely were NOT in a dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden plain stretched out before her, with snow-capped mountains in the near-distance. A pleasant, warm breeze washed over her, and the sound of birdsong and insects filled the world around her. Near the mountains, a wall of tall, deeply green trees rose out of the plains, and she could smell water. The sky was a brilliant blue, with only a few white clouds lazily drifted past as the sun shone down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree other voices groaned around her, and Lindsey blinked in surprise as three strangers pulled themselves out of the grass around her. They were...</span></div></div>",

Looks like there's an option for an 'outdoors' simulation or a 'music' simulation...And it looks like if I type the number 3 it'll list off even more stuff.\" Eugene neglected to mention the little voice in side his head telling him that maybe this 'U' person was still around, despite how old the game machine looked. Maybe there was some kind of wireless card inside? The game HAD said that it could be connected to a computer, maybe even the Internet in order to download new game types...But that notecard had been crisp and clearly new. It wasn't just a relic from the 80s or whenever, some programmer speaking to another in the days where instant communication was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly had a hard time remembering if he'd caught the girl's name that had been at the shop in the mall. Had it started with a 'U'? That didn't seem right...But the longer they messed with the machine, the more of a not-quite-right feeling was growing inside of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" Lindsey cooed, her blue eyes lighting up at the new modes, \"Music sounds REALLY fun! Maybe it's, like, karaoke or something! I totally did that at a Japanese bar when I went on my honors trip to Japan last year in high school. It was so much, like fun! And those Japanese guys get REALLY into it! But me an' Bethany TOTALLY won with our duet! I got a little trophy and everything up in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to Japan? On an honors trip?\" Peter said, coughing a bit as the sip from Judy's iced tea caught in his throat in surprise. This was quickly followed up by a soft elbow to the side from Judy, who was giving him a look. \"I mean, uh, that just sounds really, uh, expensive! Yeah, expensive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn't seem to mind, or perhaps notice, the gaff, \"Yeah! Like Honors Club wanted to do something different than just flying to DC, right? So we convinced the teachers to, like, let us fly to Japan! 'Course we all had to get jobs on top of doing all the fundraising since yeah it was, like, SUPER pricey! But SO totally worth it! Tokyo was a blast! We should totally go before we graduate! I know, like, all the best shops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was still blown away by the revelation, Peter especially. The learned jock had tried to steer away from 'labeling' others, given he worked hard to make people see him as something other than just a dumb jock on a scholarship run, but Lindsey either was putting on a enormous 'innocent dumb blonde' act or really was like the chick from the old Legally Blonde movie and just didn't realize how much like a bimbo she often sounded. Even if she did lack the normal 'bimbo curves' on her stickish frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music COULD be cool, I used to sing back chur-uh, back in high school\" Judy offered, partially regretting the potential questioning into her past and the bad memories it would dredge up...But on the other hand, a karaoke night just between the four of them could be a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oh, yeah! I would LOVE to hear you sing, Judy!\" Lindsey squealed in delight, \"Oh, maybe WE could do a duet! Like OMG, this is gonna be SO much fun!\" The chipper and seemingly always perky blonde jumped to her feet and was practically bouncing around the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Judy DOES have great, uh, pipes. She's ALL the time singing those high notes after playing my...organ\" Peter chuckled, and received a soft ribbing in reply from his top-heavy girlfriend for the innuendo. In truth Judy really was a fantastic singer, though he knew that she actually used to be in a church choir instead of singing in high school. Judy never spoke of her childhood much, but being the boyfriend, Peter was somewhat more privvy to her backstory than the two Freshmen students were. She didn't like talking about it, and every time she, Judy usually ended up a tear-stained anxiety ridden mess and he'd spend the rest of the evening comforting her or she'd just storm off back to her room...Or ask him to leave to go back to his. But she seemed in good spirits about this, so in true supporting boyfriend form, he was backing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three against one Genie!\" Lindsey said making an energetic half-circle around Eugene's chair and ruffling his short brown locks, causing him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Uh, yeah. Music s-sounds cool. Just, uh, d-don't make fun of me okay? I'm not really that good of a singer\" He mumbled as he tried not to be overwhelmed by the perky blonde who was now setting her entire grinning head on his knee. He was also desperately trying to ignore the growing stiffness in his pants. That's ruin the mood entirely if a boner flopped up and poked Lindsey in the eye. He was lucky enough the rainbow haired girl was talking to him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! And don't worry Genie, I've, like, heard way worse. Like Billie Eillish? Ugh, PUKE!\" The girl made a gagging motion with her mouth as she pushed away from the geek's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, karaoke night it is! Get us started Geno!\" Peter leaned farther back on the couch and felt Judy snuggle in closer next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight freshman nodded and typed in the information onto the keyboard and pressed enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUSIC SIMULATION SELECTED. PLEASE INPUT GAME MODE\" The game called out, and two large black buttons with the words 'Traditional' and 'Immersive' on them popped out of the top of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I wonder what that does!\" Lindsey crowded in on the device, her blue eyes wide with curiosity as she stared at the chipped white stenciling on the 'Immersive' button. She really wanted to push it...But all four of them were playing together, it would be, like, rude of her to just pick what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of discussion, the four friends decided on playing the game in...</span></div></div>",

How would you get 'Immersive' with like, a karaoke machine anyway?\" Lindsey nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two males were either too busy getting cozy with/ogling their crushes to really do anything by mutter in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okies!\" Lindsey bent over in front of Eugene and pressed the large black button that had 'Traditional' stenciled on it, pushing it back down into the machine which began whirring and clacking. Lindsey leaned back and without warning began lowering herself down towards Eugene's chair, and the overweight nerd as forced to sit up straighter and scooted back as the skinny blonde's small booty plopping down between his legs. Then the blonde LEANED back and rested up against Eugene's flab, and the geek was reduced to a reddening mess that was desperately trying not to pop a boner into Lindsey's back. The rainbow-blonde pushed herself further onto Eugene as she stared innocently at the machine as it processed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if we'll need, like, microphones or something though? I've, umm, got a couple of headset up in my room...\" She wondered out loud, scooting back just a hair more and trying not to break character as she felt her toy tense up even more from the slightest touch. But then the machine chittered to itself for a moment before there was a loud SPROING and four small cylinders rose slowly from the game's plastic surface, each with a small, grid lined globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this thing had microphones built into it!\" Peter exclaimed in amazement, \"Geno, this thing is so cool. I wonder what else it can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, but right now...\" Lindsey popped up from her seat and Eugene visibly, if silently, relaxed as she collected the four audio input devices. She turned and handed one to Eugene, giving his tomato-red face a playful wink before bouncing around the coffee table and handing two more to Peter and Judy...Who fixed her friend with a knowing look, and receiving a quick stuck out tongue in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I think we're ready? I wonder what do we do now?\" Peter said, and in return the game buzzed once more, a tiny screen near the middle of the machine blinking 'TV INPUT REQUIRED'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...\" Lindsey looked at the currently off TV that hung on the dorm wall. The students hadn't turned it on in the weeks since the Pandemic hit, mainly because all it played were the local news station, the college news station, and CNN. With a shrug, shepicked up the machine, letting out a quiet 'oof' at the deceptively heavy chunk of plastic and moved it over to the inactive television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do Eugene, do you, um, have any adapter cables? I think we need to run some AV cable through a co-ax and then use my HDMI adapter to fit it into the back here\" Lindsey said, setting the game machine down on the shelf that sat under the TV and was filled with such educational VHS titles as 'The Economic Process of the Soviet Union circa 1974' and a well used DVD of 'Shrek 2' that clearly hadn't been moved for at least four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I mean...\" Eugene blinked dumbly at Lindsey's question. What was a co-ax cable? And then even MADE adapters for the old red/yellow/white cables? But he didn't want to look stupid and was about to answer when the TV flickered on by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!\" Lindsey cried, taking a step back from the machine in caution while similar noises came from her three friends. After a moment of flickering, a pixelated logo appeared on the flatscreen, a twisting map of pathways the curved in and around each other before terminating into a empty circle in the middle, within which were the words 'Morphmanji Entertainment System'. The TV speakers spat out a short, very chip-tune-esque fanfare before two more buttons popped up on the machine's surface, and Lindsey could have sworn she hadn't seen any openings or any grooves in the plastic that may have appeared to be an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn them were the word \"Head to Head\" and \"Team Game\". The blonde relayed this information to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of wanted a team game...\" Judy said, curling a finger around Peter's ripped abs, staring up at him dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, maybe since you and Eugene can't, like, sing, maybe we should do, like, Head to Head so me and Judy get to play against each other?\" Lindsey said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Petey, but I've heard you sing in the shower, you're no Whitney Houston\" Lindsey stuck her tongue out again, and Peter just shared a look with Judy and Eugene. Judy scrunched her face into a dramatic scowl for a moment, before giving Peter a nod and a shrug, breaking out into a smirk. Eugene simply looked away, not wanting to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'M a good singer\" Peter pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE GAME TYPE\" A accented female voice said from the TV speakers, and after a moment, the group chose...</span></div></div>",

Sound fair?\" Judy offered, getting a disappointed sad puppy look from Lindsey before she went perky again with a nod. Peter and Eugene, the jock knowing that it was decided the men had long since been locked out of the decision making process, just nodded, giving Eugene a look that quietly meant 'Just shut up and nod, dork'. The flabby brown haired boy blinked for a moment before catching on, nodding vigorously as Lindsey looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okies, team game it is!\" Lindsey bent over and tapped the large black button, causing the TV screen to flicker as the game's female voice spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEAM GAME SELECTED. SELECT TEAM ON MIC. TWO TEAMS OF TWO REQUIRED FOR PLAY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet looked at their microphones and saw a tiny horizontal toggle near the base of the microphone's head, and a tiny button on the underside of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These buttons must be what we confirm with?\" Lindsey said, eyeing the firm dark plastic, trying to figure out how it all worked. There was NO way that this was a mass produced game, this had to be someone's personal invention or something, the technology of the 80s (which was when the game had collectively assumed the contraption had been built) wasn't refined enough to fit into such small spaces. And then the mysterious power source it had...And how it somehow interfaced with a modern television without any form of input. All of this had to be custom made...And that just made her engineer senses tingle even more. If the machine ever broke...Lindsey had to make Eugene promise her that she got first dibs on taking it apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just be Team 2\" Judy said, flicking the toggle on her mic and Peter's over to the miniature number 2 that was on the far side of the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that means we're number one, Genie!\" Lindsey said, turning off her intellectual musings again and bounced back over to the lounge chair her friend had taken up residence in, and the two geeks enjoyed a moment of playful bonding by counting down from 3 and flipping the switches on the mics in unison, Eugene quietly thankful the peppy, flirty blonde had chosen to set on the floor instead of practically in his lap again. He wasn't sure if he could have held off another boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEAMS SELECTED. LOADING TEAM NAMES. SELECT TEAM NAME BY PRESSING INPUT BUTTON ON MIC. PRESS TWICE TO CONFIRM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this is a LOT of sitting around and talking for a game that is supposed to be relieving boredom\" Peter said dryly, getting a look from his girlfriend, \"What? I'm just saying we could have already gotten a pizza or something in the time it's taken us to play\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush\" Judy said with a poke to her jock's stomach, who feigned being stabbed. After a few more moments, a list of team names flashed on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Eugene said, peering at list, \"A lot of these seem, uh, region themed? I wonder if they determine the kinds of songs we sing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, the game can't be THAT advanced, Eugene\" Judy said, sitting up from her nook in Peter's arms, \"I bet it's just so we don't have to type in our own to keep score\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Eugene shrugged after a moment of thought. He looked at Lindsey, and for a moment he thought he saw something else behind those normally bright blue eyes, something that momentarily betrayed her typical flightiness...But then it was gone, and her eyes glittered with the playful mischief that he'd been stuck by the moment the nerd had first met her. She gave the button on her mic a click and the selection bar moved down to the first two team names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you guys want to be? Looks like we, um, gotta pick together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short discussion and scrolling through the list of names, the friends settled on...</span></div></div>",

No one really uses it anymore except to be obnoxious. Was sort of a 'early Internet' thing. Hackers used it a lot before it went mainstream and then people just used it to seem like they were smarter than they really were. You just take numbers that look like letters and stick 'em into words. You can have a lot of fun trolling people who don't know it\" Lindsey said absent-mindedly.

What's it say Eugene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Uh, right...Well, looks to me like someone was trying to spell...\" Eugene furrowed his brow in concentration as he tried to remember his L337, \"I think it's supposed to say 'Jewels'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, what kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene just gave Lindsey a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever.

MEGATORCH!\" Peter yelled, and distortion crackled through the TV speakers as the group grabbed their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, ow?\" Lindsey said, giving Peter a look of her own, to which he simply grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! So I wonder what kind of songs we're going to get? This thing is from the 80s right? So...Are we looking at Classic Rock or bad pop music or something?\" The muscled athlete scratched his chin with the back end of the microphone as he started at the retro-styled screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't let it be 'classic' Country music. The only half-way acceptable stuff is the 90s Garth Brooks stuff\" Judy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we won't know until we start playing so...\" Eugene gave Lindsey a soft nudge with the end of his microphone, and his perky team-mate pretended to explode (with a giggle) before clicking the button on the bottom of her mic twice. The two band names turned opposing colors; J3/3LZ in blue and MEGATORCH in a fitting red as the machine beeped...and blue light began glowing from the inside of Eugene and Lindsey's microphones as a red light burned to life inside of Peter and Judy's. The four students looked at their microphones and then back at the TV as the game began to speak and text began to scroll by on the TV screen itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<div align=\"left\">TEAM NAMES CHOSEN. WELCOME TO MORPHMANJI MUSIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GAIN 180,084 POINTS ACROSS FIVE ROUNDS OF SONGS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nROUNDS CONSIST OF THREE SONGS FOR EACH TEAM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAT THE END OF EACH ROUND BOTH TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN A BATTLE OF THE BANDS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EACH SONG COMPLETED.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPOINTS ARE SUBTRACTED FROM EACH TEAM APPEARANCE FOR MISTAKES. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERFORMANCE COUNTS TOWARDS POINT TOTALS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTEAMS THAT WIN EACH ROUND CAN CHANGE THEIR NAMES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTEAMS THAT LOSE MUST STAY REMAIN WITH THE SAME NAME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAT THE END OF THE GAME.THE BAND WITH THE MOST POINTS AND BATTLE OF THE BANDS VICTORIES WILL BE DECLARED THE VICTOR AND GIVEN A COPY OF THEIR PERFORMANCE VIA LASER DISC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLOSING BANDS WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE GARAGE TO TRY AGAIN. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK TWICE TO CONTINUE\"</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game spoke the words as they appeared on the screen in a very 'active typing' sort of way, as if someone was communicating to them in real time rather than a programmed message, but the four friends didn't seem to notice the slight delay between each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems simple enough. Actually seems a lot like that old game...Guitar Hero? Or Rock Band? But I wonder what it meant by 'Losers have points subtracted from appearance?\" Eugene had only played those old games once or twice on a friend's old PS2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or umm, Dance Dance Revolution? Ooh, I wonder if the game has that? That one is SUPER fun with the right partner\" Lindsey said, curling an arm around Eugene's leg and the geek tried not to gulp too loudly with nervousness, his own question forgotten as she leaned against his ambulatory limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'e never played either of those. But what does it mean 'Losers get sent back to the garage'?\" Judy wondered, staring at the words on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just there for flavor, Jude. You know, 'all bands start out in their garage', probably just means the band that loses the game\" Peter said with an unconcerned yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shrugged. The logic made sense, she'd seen plenty of cover bands in basements and in garages in the past couple of years, so it clearly just had to be whoever programmed the game being clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys?\" Eugene asked as he read over the directions one more time, \"What do you think it means by \"Losing team gets points subtracted from their appearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey had already clicked her button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME STARTED. SELECTING STARTING TEAM\" The game announced, and a white box began flashing between the two team names on the TV, moving in random order as the game began to count down from five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Lindsey giggled in excitement as the timer clicked down to zero, the box stopping on...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After another boring day of lock-down due to the global pandemic in the town of Gunner's Butte, Colorado, four college friends find themselves out of work, their classes cancelled and one of the lucky handful of students that are too poor or simply unable to go home that get to stay in their campus dorms. With nothing to do and their former party school now anything but, the quartet of geeky Eugene, peppy Lindsey, jockish Peter and gothy Judy spend their days being bored out of their minds until one of them returns from the nearby mall with something interesting and new in his hands...A board game? Or at least, something that looks like a really old computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anything else to do, the group settles down to spend the evening playing this strange game called Morphmanji, and all of them in for a unexpectedly exciting (and potentially dangerous) ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>-Rules of the Game-<br>\r\n</b></u></div><br>\r\nMorphamanji is a unique game in that it can be programmed to suit almost any form of setting. From fantasy to sci fi and EVERYTHING in between, the game has nearly limitless customization options to give players a unique experience and different scenarios every time the game is played. It also has two modes of play: Traditional and 'Immersive', each with their own rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><u><b>-Traditional Gameplay Rules-</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">-Each player chooses their avatar and must play as that avatar for the duration of the game or are given the option (or command) to change via an Action Square or a Special Card.<br>\r\n-Players move via dice rolls performed by a single six-sided dice roll. Singles and double rolls get a second turn.<br>\r\n-Players can roll one at a time or simultaneously.<br>\r\n-Players that roll a 6 must always pull a Challenge Card even if they land on an Action Square.<br>\r\n-All players must pull a Challenge Card every three turns.<br>\r\n-Action Squares: Action Squares will generate randomized encounter or challenge for the player that lands on them. The player is not allowed to roll again until they have completed the action or challenge. Action Squares can involve one or all participants.<br>\r\n-Challenge Cards: Challenge Cards act in the same manner as Action Squares. Challenge cards are also randomly generated and are not marked on the game map and can occur at any time. Challenge Cards can be far more specific in action or encounter and can affect one or all players.<br>\r\n-All players much reach the end of the game before the game may end. Players who reach the end of the game map are immune and exempt from all dice, Action Square or Challenge Card effects.<br>\r\n-Any attempts to alter the natural flow of play will result in the offending player being issued a Penalty Card and sent back six spaces. Offending players must follow the instructions or consequences of the Penalty Card before they may roll again.<br>\r\n-All morphs that occur during the game are permanent until the game ends. If any player quits the game voluntarily, they will not be able to revert or otherwise change themselves back (unless they initiate a new game).<br>\r\n-The longer the game, the more complete the change. The longer games last, the more likely that 'personality bleeding' from the chosen avatar on to the player's psyche will occur.<br>\r\n-When all players have reached the end, they must shout 'Morphmanji!', eliminating any and all transformative effects on them.<br>\r\n-The player that reached the end first is the winner and is granted one wish.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><u><b>-Immersive Mode-<br>\r\n</b></u></div><br>\r\nIn Immersive Mode, all players will be transported the the game world, taking the form and role of their avatar. Players must follow the prompts and clues in order to progress the scenario's story and be able to exit the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">-Players are given five lives to be used during the adventure.<br>\r\n-Players can gain additional lives through completing bonus objectives.<br>\r\n-Players that lose lives will adopt more traits of their avatars as punishment.<br>\r\n-Players that lose all lives will become part of the game world and no longer treated as players.<br>\r\n-Players can be transformed through various means, items, events and opposing characters.<br>\r\n-Players can find and equip items to improve their avatar abilities.<br>\r\n-Successfully navigating scenario events can award players with unique items and abilities.<br>\r\n-To end the game, the players must navigate the entire scenario from start to finish and declare 'Morphmanji' upon completion of the scenario. <br>\r\n-Upon completion, all players that have not used up their lives will be returned to their original world. Players that use up all their lives will remain in the game world permanently.<br>\r\n-the player to declare 'Morphmanji' will be given one wish.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>-Interactive Rules-</b></u></div><br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Read before posting</div></b><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Failure to adhere to these rules will result in content being deleted.</b><br>\r\n<b>As owner of this Interactive, I reserve the right to make edits to content or remove any content deemed unsuitable for this Interactive without any prior notice.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.
