Situated in the foothills of the Colorado Plateau, it's main draw was North Point University, which like everything else, was suffering under the strict lock-down and quarantine that had gripped the entire planet and human civilization as a whole. Most of the student body and faculty had been sent home save for a handful of students that simply were too poor or were unable to go home because of the restricted international travel. The handful of students left had initially looked forward to having no classes and taking full advantage of the nearby campus strip and it's bevy of stores, night clubs and bars...Only to find that like everything else, those too had been shuttered save for a handful of 'essential' stores in the nearby mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dreary life in the high desert, as the college that was known for being more of a 'party' college was reduced to anything but. With nothing to do, nowhere to go and bored out of their minds, the stranded students could do little but sit around in their dorms and wait for something to happen. And for the four students that currently inhabited the Oak Hall dorms, something was indeed happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a name is 'the Third Wish'?\" Peter Tzimeros grunted as he settled down on the worn out couch of the dorm's common room. the football player wasn't used to playing complicated board games like the one in front of him. He'd only ever played games like Sorry! or other simple games as a kid..But there was only so many times he could watch old replays of sports on TV now that everything had shut down and had left him stranded, his parents having been in Greece visiting his grandparents when everything had gone to hell. Still, he could have done a lot worse and been stuck with a bunch of jerks instead of his girlfriend and two cool (for dorks) freshman kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cool name! Y'know, like with the genie and stuff? Aladdin? Ugh I LOVE that movie! We should watch it later!\" Lindsey Michaels chittered as she bounced into her bean bag that she had hauled down from her new room on the fifth floor. Despite her usually 'bimbo blonde' looks, the currently rainbow haired ex-sorority girl was currently taking a break from her IT course, one of the few classes that hadn't slammed to a sudden stop. But she HAD been affected, her Gamma Upsilon Rho Lambda (GURL) sorority house closing down and forcing her to move into Oak Hall. But the Freshman had remained chipper about it, and the fact that with her barista job gone she lacked the funds (or desire) to move back home to Seattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The technical term is Djinn, actually. And I second Aladdin, but only the live action one because it's more historically accurate. But yeah, sounds cool! Maybe we could check it out later? You said it's like a off-brand Hot topic, or something, right Eugene?\" Judy Ross said, the top-heavy, purple haired goth said as she walked across the room with a bowl of popcorn and settled onto the couch beside Peter. Judy was majoring in mythology, and despite her punkish exterior was actually quite sweet. She was, in her own words, 'just going through a phase', and she had refused to go home, citing 'lifestyle choices' with her heavily conservative parents. She was Peter's girlfriend, the two somehow coming together across the vast social divide of 'arts nerd' and 'scholorship jock' to end up as freshman sweethearts last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, the all-american freshman geek on campus, blushed at the attention. The slightly overweight 18 year old had stumbled onto the strange store on his way back from a solo outing to the otherwise deserted Plateau Heights mall on the near side of town. Stranded when his flight back to California was cancelled and without a car and unwilling to put the burden of his already struggling mom, Eugene had been lucky enough to get on the list to stay at the dorms. Besides, he sort of liked having all this time to hang out with Lindsey. She was into computers, and he loved playing video games on computers and they had a lot of geeky stuff to talk about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Eugene replied as he pulled one of the lounge chairs over to the wide table that his recent purchase sat upon, \"It was cool but...Really weird? You guys remember that old store called Spencer's?\" A trio of shaking heads forced him to re-gather his thoughts, \"Well, it was this old store that used to sell all kinds of weird shit. Like they had a bunch of geeky stuff that you and I would like, Lindsey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, like what?\" The girl cooed as she reached over and grabbed a handful of popcorn from the large bowl that currently rested on Judy's fishnet-clad knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything. Like movie props and video games and jewelry...They even had like costumes and anime and normal clothes. Well, normal for Judy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" The goth chimed in through her own mouthful of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But yeah they even had like, dildos and fleshlights in the back, right? So the Third Wish was a lot like that only without the sex toys or the blacklights and loud music. It was kind of like a counter-culture antique store? They had a LOT of 80s and 90s stuff in there. Anyway it's like the only store in the mall that isn't closed right? So I go in and it's empty, I don't even see anyone at the front desk and I think maybe it's closed and they just forgot to lock up or something...But then POOF! this girl pops up behind me! And she goes something like, 'Hey, do you need any help finding anything today?' And I, you know, tell her no, but then she goes off, grabs this thing and brings it right back to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a little creepy, Geno\" Peter said as he draped a muscled arm around Judy, who snuggled in closer, her eyes wide with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what I thought too! But then she starts talking about this game and I'm not gonna lie I started geeking out a little bit because of all it can do! Here, let me read you the rules...\" Eugene reached down and picked up the empty shell the game had come in and began reading off the text that was printed on the back of the weathered cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a game that you will find, brings excitement in boring times. Comes with infinite games that come with two modes, each with it's own rules. We can play it like a traditional board game or we can play something it's calling 'Immersive Mode', which if I'm understanding this right, is sort of like playing Dungeons and Dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know how to play that\" Peter said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither\" Judy said as she set the popcorn bowl on the table next to the hub-capped shaped game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I do! But I've only played once. I was a gnome! I stabbed some guys in the legs and stole their treasure. It was cool but the guys never invited me back to play again\" Lindsey said, and Eugene tried not to just start nerding out over that fact. \"But umm, like, where's the board? Or the little action figures? You need those to play either, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no, the game is all in there!\" Eugene said, pointing at the game, which to him looked like an old 1980's prototype game console, \"It's like a computer, we turn it on, and then we slide a keyboard out from that latch on the side and type in WHATEVER we wnat as a game! We can make it as long or short as we want, and it has four pre-installed game modes but we can program it to make whatever we want! It even has a little printer for the game map and see that little black box on the side? I can even program in MORE with my computer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Dude, this must have set you WAY back\" Judy said, leaning up off the couch to inspect the game more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I only spent like fifteen bucks!\" The girl was way nice, she said she knew what it was like to be cooped up with nothing to do for a long time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know right? But yeah, it also has little cards it'll dispense if we play traditional, like Monopoly cards or something to 'add challenge' to the game. We use one dice, singles and double rolls get two turns and high rollers have to always draw a card...And there's little action spaces that are a lot like the cards. I guess it's all there to make the game more interesting? Anyway, whoever gets to the middle has to yell 'Morphmanji!' and they 'get a wish', whatever that means. With immersive mode it sort of sounds like we have to RP our characters through the game and complete the quest, we get five lives but if we use up all of them we can't play with them anymore...But whoever wins has to yell the same thing and get a wish like Traditional. There's something on here about how if players leave the game before it's finished that can't play again...And this thing must be really old, most of the print is rubbed off here\" Eugene said as he squinted at the faded text as it trailed off. \"Oh well, how hard could it be, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this kinda reminds me of an old movie...\" Lindsey said, leaning back in her bean-bag, \"But maybe I'm just having a blonde moment. Who made it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, there's no logo on it\" Eugene said, looking at the box and then around the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we're going to do this, let's do it already!\" Peter said with a yawn, \"I like you guys but this geeky stuff just makes me even more bored\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's play!\" Lindsey seconded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Just press this button here...\" Eugene said, pushing on the Big Red Button in the middle of the console's top. There was a series of synthetic beeps and boops, and with a metallic click an old mechanical keyboard slid out of the base of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE INPUT GAME TYPE\" A robotic voice squawked from a speaker near the power button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Lindsey squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, what do we want to play first?\" Eugene asked as he positioned his hands above the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment. the group decided on...</span></div></div>",

And besides, it seemed a little complicated for his tastes anyway. But Judy was clearly interested so maybe he'd just stick with it. But damn, this was a lot of talking for a game! He was used to just loading up Madden or something in his Xbox and getting into the game immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush. It's old\" Judy said, \"It's not like your football game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you just gotta give it time and junk\" Lindsey nodded, backing up her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we want to play?

Three other heads nodded in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, adventure mode it is!\" Eugene leaned over and carefully typed the word 'Adventure' on the small keyboard, taking his time to not spell it wrong or accidentally break the rather fragile looking keyboard. When he was done he pressed enter, and the machine made a clicking sound before mechanically intoned....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME TYPE: ADVENTURE.

A pampered existence, waited on hand and foot, every whim satisfied, and ultimate authority coming from royal privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was thinking the same thing, trying to decide if it was even 8-bit, 16-bit, or some hybrid machine. Guessing it was pre-playstation... playstation one, even. He agreed, his expectations were lowering with each minute.

Only an oasis here and there, and a temple half lost to the dunes would be enough for whatever processor was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay and Peter were more interested in each other than the game.

They did pass a few people...if you could call them people.  There were a number of women who were dressed similarly to Eugene who would simply bow to Judy and walk off while only muttering 'Princess' before they walked off.  There were also men with swords standing in front of doors that not even a princess might be allowed in.  As they walked along Eugene and Judy could swear they even saw the same woman and guard multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene sighed to himself as he muttered, \"Probably a memory limitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Memory limitation?  What do you mean by that?\"  Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the fact that we're seeing the same model multiple times and the fact we probably can't enter all of these rooms is probably a memory limitation of that game.  It's not truly an open and immersive world, it's a little disappointing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?  We got...sucked into this world after you pushed a few buttons and you're complaining how it's not high tech enough?\"  Judy said exasperatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an observation...\"  Eugene said shrinking a little under Judy's gaze.  The two continued to walk along in silence until something caught their attention.  Off in the distance the voice of a woman called out, \"What the FUCK is going on here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing they finally had a lead on their other friends Judy and Eugene sprinted towards the angry woman's voice and when they got in visual range they saw quite the sight.  A beautiful woman was pacing back and forth in a fury.  She was wearing a red harem outfit with layers of see through materials, she was also adorned with a jewels, not as nice as Judy's but eye catching never the less.  But there was one piece of jewelry she had Judy didn't.  A bronze collar with a chain attached to it, and at the end of the chain was a large man standing almost 7 feet tall with a large black beard and muscles that were easy to admire with since he was only wearing a loin cloth.  But despite his impressive physique, he looked oddly scared.  He said with a deep voice that did not convey the confidence one would expect, \"Let's just stay here and, like, take a breather and figure stuff out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure stuff out?  I don't want to figure anything out.  I want to wake up from this freaky dream because that's the only logical explanation for what's happening!\"  The harem girl screamed at the giant man and she tried to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\"  The man said as he tugged at the chain and sent the now coughing girl to the floor.  \"OHMYGAWD I'M SO SORRY!  I just...I just don't know my own strength!  Are you ok?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Eugene and Judy had gotten to the two fighting and Judy helped the harem girl up and said, \"This might sound like a weird question...but are you my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at the princess and hugged her, \"Judy!?  Oh man I was afraid I'd never see you again!\"  Peter said, but as the hug went on and he felt his very large breasts mashed up again his girlfriends he backed off.  \"I mean, I had everything under control.  I was just going to go off to find and save you, but the Hulk over here wouldn't let me.\"  Peter glared at the giant man who looked like he was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just didn't want to risk you getting hurt.  You don't have the muscles you have in the real world and there are some scary looking people around.\"  The manly Lindsay said eyeing some guards that were passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Well maybe you could have used your muscles and go...\"  Peter said starting to get confrontational with Lindsay when Judy said, \"ENOUGH!\"  Peter froze in his tracks under his girlfriend's command.  Judy continued, \"We don't need to fight each other.  We're on the same side.  We're playing this...crazy game and we should...just play it.  And fighting isn't going to solve a damn thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah you're right.\"  Peter said as he looked up to Lindsay, \"I'm sorry.\"  Peter simply said.  Judy sighed, her boyfriend was good about apologizing when he knew he was wrong, but wasn't really good with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too.\"  Lindsay said wiping the last of the tears from her eyes and she looked at Judy and Eugene.  \"You both also look so beautiful, I'm jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\"  Eugene said while blushing.  He'd never expected to be told by his crush that she was jealous of his looks.  Then again he also never expected to be immersed in an Arabian game world where he was some sort of hand maiden so it was a day full of surprises.  Eugene shook his head to get focused, \"We've all found each other, that's a good start, but now I think we have to keep playing the game because we need to be it in order to get back I think.\"  Eugene said as he wondered where the heck the group was even supposed to start.</span></div></div>",

Eugene immediately sank down, intending to crawl towards the door, and let some light in from the next room, or sneak some daylight in from a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he reached the floor, he was confused. His hands discovering chill stone, rather than carpet. Running his hand over the flat surface he could feel it wasn't even plain concrete. A frown formed invisibly on his hidden face, as he stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...\" he called out, suddenly aware how quite they were... How quiet the whole room was. There wasn't any answer, \"Not funny...\" he said with a faint quiver in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I could see...\" The words were barely louder than a whisper, as he spoke to himself. Eugene was startled to see a pale grid fill the air in front of him. He was more surprised to recognise it. It was an inventory list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely an illusion, his hand reached up to swat it away, like a prop his friends had constructed from... luminous painted wood. Or for his hands to pass through it, like the drug fuelled illusion it had to be. Eugene knew he was a geek, even more than his friends, but he never thought they'd doze him with something for their amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene's hand passed into the grid, he felt something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electronic chirp sounded, and he found himself with a torch in his outstretched hand. He almost dropped it in surprise. Only fear of being burned meant he tightened his grip instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was illuminated in the flickering yellow glow of the torch flames. Holding it high, he could see the vague shape of an ornate ceiling above him. He was able to see around him, a faint glowing sphere of light. The shapes in the darkness were tantalizing. His footsteps echoed as he explored, already enjoying the immersion. Approaching one shape, Eugene discovered it was a statue on a low plinth. A naked woman, dressed only in a diaphanous cloth. Moving around he discovered more statues. Some of the women were blessed with full breasts, others with wide hips. Each had a look of grace, poise and ecstasy on her face. One with a look of beatific satisfaction, a hand cradling a belly swollen with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting his mental bearings, he realised there were three statues on each side of the room. He thought of them as side, the room felt longer in the other axis. Walking up the centre of the room, he headed for one end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he found a set of ornately carved steps. Walking up them, he could only praise the realism. His feet scuffing over the stone. His hand feeling the warmth of the flame, and his palm the rough bound wood that made his torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the torch higher, he lit the base of the largest plinth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could make out the shape of a woman's feet and lower legs. She was scaled beyond human dimensions. The statue was twice or three times her real size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting some writing in the stone platform, Eugene read it. \"Aphrodite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he had to admire the artist's work, the perfect woman carved exquisitely in the richest marble. Delicate details taken even with her insignificant toes. Even from his low vantage point, he admired the swell of her bust, and the lewd detail given to those stony nipples.</span></div></div>",

As he explored it, Sun started to fill the temple, flooding into the main chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked over the other statues, showing the different women. He recognised each of them as typifying some aspect of femininity, virtue, grace, fertility and so forth. As the flame on his torch guttered and went out, the temple was illuminated by the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisposing of the extinguished torch, he was able to admire each of the women. He flexed his hand, which was cramping from holding the coarse wood for so long. Curious to see how different sensations could be created by the game, Eugene ran his hands up and down one of the pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he found himself drawn to one of the statues. A svelte, athletic woman, he pressed his hands against the chill stone of her body. Running it over the cool stone, from thigh up her flank. He was startled to hear a powerful womans' voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your compliment was kind, but your transgression needs punishment. I shall combine them to reward your generous words, and remove your masculine offence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene bucked like a landed fish, as he hunted for the source of the voice. It filled the air without seeming loud, his hunt limited by the ways his hands felt stuck to the stony body of the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he knew this was Aphrodite speaking directly to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe half wanted to fall to his knees, but his frozen hands made that impossible. Part of him wanted to curtsey too. A fear gripped him, as he pondered the Goddess' threat of reward and punishment combined. Dreading the myths of the time. He continued to thrash as he felt his body start to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his body was too bright to look at, and Eugene felt ill with worry. With a brilliant pulse, the blinding light vanished, as the statue released him. Stumbling back a few steps, Eugene felt different. Blinking his eyes clear of tears, he took in the changes he could already feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was covered in a toga. A firm, full bust making the material cling to his curves. Hips swelled out, far wider than he liked, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/5d/51/a55d510303cc27cdbd63f4081b8c7129.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/5d/51/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laurel crown marked her as one of Aphrodite's chosen.

Although running was a bit of a over-statement, as the new proportions of his female body caused him to fall to the hard marble floors more than once with a feminine 'oof' in his new sultry new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is NOT happening!\" He gasped as he finally seemed to find the movement balance his still swelling features demanding, finally leaving the chamber of Aphrodite and wiggling and jiggling down the stone corridor. Eugene ran (or rather, it was more of a power walk, or power-strut in this case) through the darkness, squeaking in surprise each time a torch roared to life as he approached. There was also a cool breeze that seemed to be grower stiffer the farther he traveled into the dark, as if something was trying to push him back into the chamber of the Greek goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's with that anyway!? I'm pretty sure, no, I KNOW I typed in '<b>Arabia</b>' into the game! What the HELL am I doing in Greece? Where's all the sand!? The camels!? I should be wearing a turban not...\" Eugene paused for a moment to look down at his cleavage, frowning from the unwelcome mounds of flesh before smushed his new toga-puppies against himself with a unflattering grunt to finally reveal his new tiny feet, \"NOT SANDALS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe currently greek geek felt something ephemeral tug at the hem of his toga and, not daring to look back because he suddenly got the mental picture of the statue FOLLOWING him like a Weeping Angel or something (not that the statue itself wouldn't be terrifying enough), he went back to sprinting down the corridor at the best speed he could manage without flopping onto his new boobs again. But at least he didn't feel as if he was still, uh, 'growing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it's got something to do with proximity to the statue? Really I just would like some goddamned answers alreaDAAAAAAHH!' Eugene let out a girlish squeal of terror as the hard stone beneath his feet gave way to something soft and slick as he comically slid across the substance and into a rather firm piece of topiary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh!\" He flailed, distangling himself from the poking branches and spitting a mouthful of leaves out. \"AND WHY AM I EVEN HERE!?\" He shouted, his new voice echoing into the pin-pricked darkness above him as stars (and other things) began to come into focus around him as his eyes adapted to the dark. Behind him was a massive columned temple, the pillars lit by large braziers. He'd sprinted out of some kind of...side entrance? And around him were the carefully maintained gardens that surrounded the temple; expertly sculpted statues depicting Aphrodite and the other Greek gods...And a bunch of normal looking statue people embracing each other. Here and there were fountains and the entire perimeter, as far as the new blonde could see in the moonless night, was a wall of carefully cut hedges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..Is that Peter and Lindsey?\" Eugene crept close to a statue of a muscled man embracing a rather stick-like girl. The resemblance was a little off and clearly not his friends, but Eugene couldn't help but scratch his head. That was ANOTHER question; Why had Eugene and Lindsey been fawning all over each other before...Whatever happened and he'd been sucked to the <b>WRONG</b> part of the antique world!? Peter and Judy were the couple...Eugene was still working up the nerve to ask his rainbow haired crush out yet suddenly the freshman girl was sitting in the sophmore jock's lap and NO ONE was saying anything? Was that why Judy was acting all weird and quiet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid...Was the game doing something even before he'd pressed start? Before the transformed teen could ponder the potnetial editorial blunder further, something shifted out of the corner of his eye and he looked away from the mistaken statues and directly into the eyes of a much smaller Aphrodite statue that he KNEW hadn't been looking that direction when he'd walked over here. Large marble eyes seemed to bore into his soul and he felt...calm? Or maybe just at peace. Aphrodite WAS a peaceful goddess, why was he running away from her presence? But then he felt a tingle from his new female assets and his toga grew tighter as his breasts swelled once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And with a comical 'NOPE!', Eugene threw caution to the wind and dove head first through the hedges, cursing as he felt his fair (and sensitive) skin receive more than a few scratches. He shielded his eyes with a dainty hand and pushed (as best as a buxom woman suspended in topiary could)  forward through the vegetation, finally emerging out onto a...</span></div></div>",

She also caught many of the women looking at her, an admiring glance, a respectful tip of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to have some respect for looking like a devotee of Aphrodite. Stepping onto the cobbles, she was soon forgotten allowing her to browse the various stalls set up around the marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to forget her new gender, as her bust constantly shifted with every move she made. If the opportunity arose she'd have to invent the bra. The humiliating movement seeming to add to her conspicuousness. Drawing eyes, there was also a growing awareness of how that felt to herself. The constant friction rubbing back and forth over her new, wider nips was just a constant tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only consolation Eugene realised belatedly was along with the gift of her full breasts and wide hips, Aphrodite had blessed her with a money pouch. It bounced against her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar caught Eugene's attention, and she raced towards it. Afraid of vanishing into the background unless she took deliberate risks and actions. She didn't want to find herself absorbed by a role, she hadn't wanted to play. Serving as a temple girl for her Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiggling and swaying, Eugene tried to keep your bust under control, and her pace rapid. Leaving the market, she hear the same bellow, this time clearer. Something tells you he's outside now, rather than simply nearer. Rounding a corner, she found herself at the foot of another set of temple steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man stood half-way down. An Adonis of a man, with intriguingly powerful muscles rippling in the sun. Filling his leather armour in ways that excited and teased Eugene. A short cotton kilt or skirt, barely covered a taut and toned ass that kept drawing Eugene's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter...\" she asked, looking up at the surprise and recognising the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, and answered with a quaver, \"I'm... Judy... Are you ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she replied, \"I'm Eugene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blessings of Ares.\" he explained with a powerful shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blessings of Aphrodite...\" Eugene answered, with a similarly mortified smile.</span></div></div>",

The wind rippled and fluttered up Eugene's toga, and she shuddered at the feeling, having suddenly been getting a little warm (though she wasn't really sure from what). And why did her skin feel so...sensitive all of a sudden? And why were Judy's pecs so...well oiled? Seriously, it was night, the nearby torches of the Greek city they found themselves in weren't so bright enough as to make him appear like it was the middle of the day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Didn't you say...Arabia?\" Judy said a cough, suddenly looking away, giving his armor a shake as something very large and very alien pressed painfully against the primitive codpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No I...I was just doing what you said to do when Lindsey and Peter started acting all weird! And YOU never gave me and answer about what game mode you wanted so I just picked Immersive since I figured it was what you wanted! so really this is all your fault, Judy!\" Eugene said, stamping her tiny foot petulantly, which only served to send her divine assets jiggling, which made Judy's intense smoldering eyes bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...WELL YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THAT WEIRD GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE!\" Judy roared, not expecting his new voice to be that...powerful as Eugene staggered back and several of the torches behind the exquisite blonde fizzled out, and at least one jar was lifted from the ground and tumbled end over end and shattering to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Eugene squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" Judy gasped, \"That...did we get powers from those gods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Well, it IS a video game...\" Eugene said, squinting in the darkness, deep in thought. If the game had deposited them in Greece instead of Arabia, and was, uh, 'rendering' Judy's 'model' as if it was being lit by daylight when it was clearly night...Maybe it was just glitching? The game had seemed pretty old, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her thought process was interrupted as a hunched figure came shambling out of the darkness behind Eugene, a cane tapping loudly on the uneven stones that made up the street. Eugene turned and gasped in surprise. Judy scowled and took a powerful step forward, his new stride almost double of what his old, short body had been capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh champions of the gods....\" Came a shaky voice as an old, balding man came into view, his tunic hanging loosely off of an emaciated frame, \"If you have questions you should seek the oracle. Her wisdom is beyond all others, a sacred blessing from Apollo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I know who that is! The Oracle of Delphi, otherwise known as the Pythia!\" Judy's eyes ceased their scowling and she felt elated to finally put some of her classes to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you know of her...I can point you to her for a coin or two...\" The old man grinned, his mouth missing a few teeth as he outstretched a leathery hand, pointing to the small satchel hanging off of Eugene's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go on, pay him Eugene!\" Judy said after an awkward moment, in which the old man seemed frozen. The two peered closely at his near-rictus grin and Eugene noticed that every few seconds his feeble tottering was repeating, clearly on some kind of a animation loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's an NPC\" Eugene said, taking a step back, brown eyes wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't think you're allowed to call people that anymore, Eugene\" Judy frowned at the poor choice of words...But he hadn't pegged Eugene to be one of THOSE people that just called people NPCs for disagreeing with him. The currently buff and male goth girl wasn't really into video games, she only really knew a little of the offhand parlance and NPC was one that was currently more associated with right-wing Internet trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Eugene looked up at Judy, confusion in her big eyes before realization hit her, \"Oh. OH. No I mean, NPC means a 'non-player character'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just blinked dumbly back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. You know...something being run by the computer? Like this guy isn't really real, he's just, uh, I think he's trying to give us a quest or something. See how he keeps moving a certain way every few seconds? That's his animation loop.\" The knockout geek tried his best to explain the concept to her friend, walking around the old man (whose head and eyes creepily stayed locked onto Eugene's face) and point at the repetition in his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at Eugene and then at the old man. Then at Eugene again and gave a shrug. \"Well, when in, uh...Athens, do as the Athenians do?\" He wasn't entirely sure this actually was Athens, but seeing as how, if his memory served, Rome wouldn't be founded for at LEAST a couple of centuries, it seemed an appropriate phrase. \"Just pay the man and let's get going! Maybe he'll lead us to Lindsey and Peter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I kind of have a thing against using money at the start of a game...\" Eugene cocked a hand on her hip and jingled the coin pouch, \"Generally it's sort of a waste, you're better off finding your own way forward since its sort of obvious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, if either of the two had happened to look UP (a common problem in game development, the vast majority of players often simply lock their eyes forward and rarely utilize the vertical camera control to do more than aim a weapon) they would have seen another temple on the hill above the city, the emblem of the Olympian god Apollo adorning the side through an elaborate use of bricks and tile, all lit by large braziers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene I'm a dude and you're a chick that looks like she just stepped out of the 'Perfect Woman' catalogue. I don't really think we should be trying to use video game logic here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm perfect? Eugene said with a blush and a smile, flipping her golden hair with a tiny hand and wondering where the breeze had suddenly gone. She was getting all hot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I mean you've got great curves, most girls would kill to look like you!\" Judy said with an enthusiastic nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's ever called me perfect before...\" Eugene purred softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe they're just blind...\" Judy said as the two moved closer to one another. A tiny set of fingers casually began strolling their way up Judy's pecs as Judy cupped a impossibly small chin in his hand, faces swimming closer and closer to each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cough behind the two that jerked them out of their 'moment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few coins I can point you the way to the oracle, champions\" The old man said again, hand still outstretched and rather creepy frozen smile still locked on his leathery face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm just throwing this out there but I'm started to get creeped out by this guy, and he's not even looking at me!\" Judy said with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, NPC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another brief moment of bickering over whether to pay the old man or not, Judy and Eugene decided to...</span></div></div>",

It was destroying her self-confidence, the constant vulnerability and the need for a man by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene wished again and again that he'd never groped that statue... never complimented that Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair walked, Eugene became aware that Judy was struggling too. In just as alien a body, his hands were restless. Eugene realised that Judy was trying to hide his reaction to her proximity. The supple flesh she was pressing against him and his armour. Her fawning need for a champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene blushed crimson as she caught the straining outline of the erection she was inspiring from Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try to forget about it... It'll go away...\" she whispered as a sympathetic suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know another way to get rid of it...\" Judy suggested. His voice not sounding quite right. Eugene was unsure whether he was joking, being serious... Did she want her to blow him?... a Hand job?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sincerely hoped this was an awkward bluster. A act of male bravado, or a suggestion that she stopped pressing her magnificent body against his.</span></div></div>",

That curiosity turned icy, as she realised she'd be on the receiving end... She'd be the one who'd end up pregnant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene didn't want to experience that even in this surreal world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to get us back on course...\" Eugene said, trying to steer the conversation and her own thoughts back to their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, it's just us that's displaced. If we sail to Arabia, we could complete the quest.\" Eugene's tone finished more hopeful than expectant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy agreed with a too quick nod of his head. The silence drew on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The harbour?\" Eugene suggested to break their feeling of being lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sea air, and the seagulls made their direction easy to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as they noticed the increasing frequency of the taverns, and brothels that they realised they were close to the harbour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ragged figure appeared from a side alley. Crashing into Eugene the pair collapsed to the ground, in tangle of limbs. Judy drew her sword, before seeing it wasn't an attacker. The man was babbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Exotic creatures from far and away, you bring hope on the darkest day. The viper of the sands, the beauty'd jade, I come before thee, my hands splayed. Deliver to me that which I desire, the secret to save Greece from the fire. Completed be your noble quest, I release thee to a deserve'd rest\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words seemed to hold them, taking on a weight and significance neither player were capable of ignoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words returned to random babble, as he moved off. Apparently unaware of his recent tumble. Eugene shrugged her toga back into place, when an embarrassed Judy noticed that she'd slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on the right track...\" Eugene said, her face red. But determinedly not admitting she'd just tuck a full breast back out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whores outside of the brothels seemed oblivious to Eugene. Studiously ignoring her, as they focused purely on Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was rather easily distracted by the women, and their bawdy displays of flesh. The taverns tempted him too, and Eugene had to keep a firm grip on his arm. This time not cowering against her protector, but instead keeping him from straying from the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the brothels behind them, Judy seemed to come back to herself, an odd sight in his manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet Lindsay ended up as the jewel...\" Her tone dripping in envy sounded wrong coming out in a mans' voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Viper?\" Eugene asked, not sure whether she wanted that to be their villain to defeat, or if it was Pete. It was an internal battle, if the Viper wasn't Pete, they still had to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just shrugged, unsure how to answer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning a corner they were both surprised to be hit by the smell of fish, the broad sea wall was visible beyond a stretch of water. Ships were moored against the stone of the Quayside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked the most vibrant part of the city they'd seen. To Eugene also the least reputable. They walked the length of the harbour looking for someone to hire. As they reached the last of the ships. They were hailed from the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather Judy was hailed. A broad beaming smile, and a wave of recognition startled them both, but nothing more than the cry of 'Captain'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy hid her surprise, and nodded instead. Climbing the gangway, they were greeted by a crew that looked ready, willing and able to serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few jokes were directed in Eugene's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We set sail for Arabia...\" Judy said, uncertain whether it was a command or a question. But the crew set to work untying the ship from the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rumble of amusement, as a door opened. A woman stepping out, her attention focused on Judy. She spotted Eugene, and her eyes narrowed, the jealousy hard to disguise. Crossing the deck, her hips swaying, she wrapped Judy in her arms, and gave him a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnmistakably marking him as her possession. She smirked, sneered at Eugene over Judy's shoulder, her expression hidden from her Captain. Eugene was relieved, to have the role of Captain's Wench so thoroughly and enthusiastically filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not going questing for Harem girls, and sluts to steal?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze fixing Eugene as she said the word '<i>sluts</i>' with deliberate emphasis.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was an awkward silence between the two as they strolled through the night. All around them were the sounds of ancient Greece, the wind in the olive trees, the distant sounds of conversation, the sputtering of torches and the distant sounds of the sea. Part of Eugene wanted to be amazed at how remarkably detailed the game world was, even if it did have...glitches (luckily Judy's 'model' seemed to have worked out the glitch as was now lit properly for a night time setting), and wanted to think about the possibility of this being some kind of high tech VR...But the hot, growing sensation beneath her toga was growing increasingly hard to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs were the pained grunts of Judy as he walked beside her, a powerful (and large, so very large) bulge pushing against the armor he wore. Part of her wanted to see it. Just for, uh, scientific reasons, of course. When she had been a man she'd never had much of a penis, and was still very much a virgin due to her interests and (then) weight problems. She had hoped Lindsey, who despite being far too pretty for her, would be a ticket out of that department given their similar interests...But now it seemed a bit impossible. And to be honest, not really all that interesting anymore. Not when SHE was now the hot chick and could very easily have any man she wanted with her divine good looks. Eugene found herself regretting having fled from Aphrodite before the goddess could finish bestowing upon her the final parts of the blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh\" Eugene said, trying to make conversation to take her mind off her...things, \"Where do you think we are?\" She was aware that Judy was making Arts her major, and had been in the middle of studying for a big exam concerning the finer points of Greek mythology when the Pandemic had hit and shut everything down (and landed them in this current mess). Again, had either of them cared to look upwards, they would have found their current location rather obvious. For Judy, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to, eurgh, say\" Judy did her best to hide the pained groan as he shifted his large stride to try to give himself more room for...himself, \"Honestly I can't really think right now. Pretty sure it's not Athens or Sparta, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's not big enough to be Athens and there are no dudes walking around with mohawk helmets. Ugh, wait, I've gotta...I've gotta do something about this!\" Judy groaned again, louder this time as he staggered against a nearby house. The outer wall creaked and groaned as he slid up against it, his godly strength threatening to knock it over. Eugene half expected a family to come pouring out of the hovel as it shook, but no other NPCs appeared. There was a jingle and click of metal as Judy fiddled with the straps of his armor, and then with a rustle of metal and fabric the constraining codpiece dropped to the ground with a noisy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh GODS that is better\" Judy moaned in relief as the javelin under his tassles stretched further and further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Eugene said quietly as his eyes locked on the enormous erection, and the pulsing urge in her grew more and more hot until she felt as if the only way to ever cool down was to shed the flimsy toga entirely and be free to the night air. Tiny hands fiddled with what few straps kept the together on her blessed form, and in a manner of seconds it was sliding loose around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene....\" Judy gasped, looking upon the former nerd with an expression that could only be called 'concerned lust'. Gone was any thought of Peter, or the jock's adulterous actions with Lindsey while Judy, his GIRLFRIEND, was sitting right there. Now all that matter was the woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I' don't think the house has anyone in it...\"Eugene purred, letting the toga slide completely off, coming closer and closer, teasingly close to Judy's enormous cock, \"Why don't we...Check to make sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she was pressed against Judy, a hand stroking the erection and sending waves of pleasure rocketing through Judy's body. They slid along the wall until they were at the darkened door, growing closer and closer until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a giggle and a grunt as the two slipped closer and closer to the doorway, not knowing that it was a threshold in more way than just being a door. They were so close, Eugene couldn't think of anything else other than getting indoors and then getting a particular divine warrior in her door. Judy was the same, there was a beautiful woman in front of her, ready and willing to be mounted on his 'wall'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when a frantic male voice began crying out: \"Heroes! Oh chosen of the gods! I bring a dire message from the oracle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me\" Judy said as the skinny man appeared from around the nearby corner, a scroll in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Eugene purred as she ceased to stroke Eugene's penis and began to actively guide it towards the burning wet furnace between her perfect legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, Eugene, I think the game is trying to make us do something again!\" Judy said, physically pushing Eugene away and giving him a very, very light shake in order to remove the dazed, blank stare on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Eugene groaned as she held her head, giving it a shake to clear...thoughts from her mind and then loking over at the newcomer, giving a panicked eep! and scrambling to pull her toga back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to the gods that if you start asking for money I'm going to snap you in half\" Judy grumbled as she stalked over to the much smaller man, who instead of looking intimidated clearly just looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank Olympus, master hero! I had thought that you were too consumed to be bothered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit. It. Out.\" Judy wanted to get back to...whatever that had been. It had felt incredible and she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The message is not mine to tell, only the oracle may reveal it, and your true purpose here. Please, join me as I escort you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, I...I think we should do what he wants. I think the game is trying to get us to the oracle. It's just...gonna keep happening until we do\" Eugene slipped the toga back over her barren shoulders and gave Judy an apologetic shrug. The desire was fading once more, and as she eyed Judy's member she could see that it, too, was beginning to droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, doing so will restore order, and you will be granted riches beyond your wildest imagination!\" The NPC said as he reached the end of his idling animations.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine, whatever, take us to this oracle!\" Judy growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most excellent, champion! This wa,y quickly!\" The messenger said with a wave. He turned to race away, to lead both heroes to his mistress when Eugene reached up and grabbed him by the arm with a small hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, before we go, can you tell us where we are?\" She asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my lady\" The messenger said, confused, \"We're in the city of Thespiae! Home of Eros!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains a lot\" Judy grumbled as she picked up the codpiece and slowly fitted it back onto her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I've never heard of this place. Isn't Eros like the god of deception or something?\" Eugene said with a tit of his blonde head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're thinking of Eris, and she's goddess of strife and discord. Eros was the god of, welll\" Judy looked down at himsefl and Eugene before looking back up, \"He was the god of sex\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. Here, let me explain it to you...\" Judy leapt into a full explanation of the strange forces that were clearly a part of the game world as Eugene released the messenger, and the three made their way towards the large temple looking over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, elsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of alarm split the otherwise still desert night, and a few moments later came the deafening ring of alarm bells as they were rung around the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned, dark haired girl ran, blood thundering in her ears as her body rebelled painfully against her. Large sandstone steps smacked hard against her tiny and soft feet as she fled from a massive palace that stretched towards the sky, lit in the dark night only by giant braziers and bonfires that lit the entire structure. A bell tolled from within as the large gates at the front of the decadent structure swung open, revealing a large mass of very angry bearded men as they raced after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little clothing she had been wearing was long since torn from exertion, but she didn't dare stop as she scrambled across the palace courtyard and out through the front gate, as it was swinging open to allow a small party of robed men in. The guards faces shot up in realization, their faces angry as they reached for the girl...but then suddenly she was a dozen yards ahead stumbling to a stop and blinking in surprise as her figure rippled with pixels and polygons, struggling to seal themselves back around a wireframe skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the girl had little time to ponder what had just happened, as the guards at the gate turned on their heels, their bodies frozen until they faced her once more, and began charging at her as if nothing was wrong. The girl gasped and took off once more, diving into the dark city that stretched out in front of her and deciding the best place to escape through was the rapidly emptying marketplace. Behind her were the furious roars of dozens of men, their swords and torches high in the air as they chased after their quarry. The girl leaped over a earthen pot, dashed through an empty store stall and shrieked as a wall appeared in front of her...but again her body shifted as she passed through it with a buzz, before finding herself out in the middle of a large bridge that spanned a massive, mighty and dark river that stretched into the night. She looked back at the wall, only to find it missing entirely as half the city was replaced by a muddy void that flickered as blocky looking buildings began popping back into existence, along with their inhabitants that would start out doing one thing, then suddenly would pop into another position doing something else. But then things seemed to stabilize  as a throng of armed men led by a older yet powerful looking man wrapped in a white turban and astride a black horse<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man closed in on her, the woman gave them a defiant look, quickly bundled her cascading dark hair into a haphazard bun, and jumped. There was a rush of air in her ears as she struggled to calm her breathing just enough to get a lung full of air and prayed to whatever god might have been watching over her that she didn't just land on a rock and snapped like a twig. She managed to suck in a breath as she positioned herself like a knife; feet and legs stretched out and downwards whlie her arms were wrapped as best they could around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she hit the water, and everything went black, cold, and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the river, crowding around the spot the woman had been just seconds ago, was the small army of men that flanked either side of the dominating figure on the horse, who glared angrily down at the powerful current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Search every house and boat on the river! Close the harbor, I want that bloody whore found!\" He snarled, guiding his horse through the crowd and racing away on it, the hooves clattering into the night as the crowd of man scattered to do their jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the water below and already quickly downstream, the young woman could struggled against the current and broke through the water's surface, gasping as quietly as she could for breath. She knew this river flowed to the harbor, and then the harbor emptied out into the ocean. It didn't really matter where as long as the ship wasn't carrying the Black Plague or anything, but she had to get away from this city at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just prayed that she wasn't late, or had used up whatever luck she had to survive the fall.</span></div></div>",

As she floated she pulled her hands out of the water and stared at them in what little light there was. They were dark, of course, and she felt the weight of her soaked hair pulling at the back of her skull, and of course, her large breasts, which were bobbing gently up and down in the water, the remnants of her silk dress plastered against them. She could feel the water-tight metal canister bump against her right leg as she paddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt...familiar? But yet at the same time very, very strange. When she'd awoken in the bedroom, something had clearly gone wrong. She knew that she wasn't supposed to be there, that she was missing...someone and...something? She didn't even know her name, or how she'd even gotten there! All she'd known was the pressing need to Get Out and take the strange metal tube that was in her hands with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd dressed in the only thing that she could find: A skimpy blue outfit that reminded her of something...An old story, maybe? There were many things like the girl felt she was supposed to know but instead of answers there was simply the emptiness of uncertainty. And also the four black bars that were tattooed on the underside of her left wrist. There had been fine, but her first attempt at escaping out of the palace window had ended less than successfully as her bed sheet rope hadn't nearly been long enough...And had decided to vanish from her hands in a storm of pixels and reappear buried halfway inside the tower wall as she free-fell to a painful end in the courtyard below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd awoken once more in the bedroom, she'd decided to try the door, and had bluffed her way past the burly, shirtless guard outside and his large scimitar...But that had only lasted long enough for her to get to the stairs out of his line of sight before the guard had started yelling about her escape. The girl had been lucky enough to be both quick on her feet and a quick thinker and had avoided the MASSIVE influx of guards as they started pouring in from all parts of the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the...glitch? happened again, allowing her to pass through the guards at the front gate like a ghost...And then allowing her to move through the wall and somehow get to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was going on? Who was she, WHERE was she? And who were these others that she felt the desperate need to find?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot up ahead caused the girl to lower herself into the water until only her piercing, intense eyes were visible, her dark hair giving her a natural camoflauge as she approached the mouth of the river, where the docks were located. She raised herself only periodically, just enough to get a fresh breath of maritime air as she moved unseen through the tall forest of masts and sails...Only for the glitch to happen once more as she approached a broad ship that sat low in the water. One moment she was reaching for the mooring lines...And the next moment she was standing, dripping wet, in a long and dark cargo hold. The only light was that from the deck streaming through the cross-hatched doors that periodically pierced the ceiling, and she could see, in the gloom, a series of mirrored benches on either side of her, huge paddles sitting at rest. Along the floor were many bodies of men and women in various forms of undress, many curled into balls, some draped over others, but all of them were chained to the benches, and luckily, most of them were fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave for the young Oriental woman that was staring at the girl wide wide, tear-filled eyes, around one a dark bruise was already forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who-who are you!?\" She whispered as the girl looked around for an escape, \"P-please, help m-me! I...I don't know what's happening! I don't even know how I got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ceased her search for an escape and very carefully and very quietly made her way over to the slave girl, keeping the metal container danging from her wide hips from making any noise by pressing it against her wet skin. When she'd crossed the landscape of slumbering flesh, the girl crouched down and placed a small hand on the barren shoulders of the shivering girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know how I got here either. Do you know what your name is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I woke up up and s-some guys were trying to b-buy me! I think I'm a s-slave!\" The mistreated girl sobbed as quietly as she could, \"A-and then when I tried t-to escape, then knocked m-me down and started k-kicking me! And then they threw me i-in here! and c-chained me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escaped girl followed the enslaved girl's trembling finger to the heavy chains that bound her to the rest of the slaves that were in the cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the c-captain has t-the k-key! P-please, help m-me! Don't l-leave me here!\" The slave girl pleaded, reaching out to grab the girl's arm in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry. I have to...I have to go\" She said, feeling the drive to escape this horrible place before she wound up the same as the girl in front of her. She pulled away as the other girl let loose a sobbed \"No!\", but then she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, illuminated by a flicker of torchlight from above, were five bars printed against the slave girl's skin. She...She was like her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's desire for answers over-rode her desire to escape. She HAD to help this girl, and together, maybe they could get some answers. She cast a glance around the hold, spotting a short ladder at the far end leading up to the deck. Well, she'd already died once and lived to tell the tale...If she couldn't pull this off maybe she could try it from a different angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here. I'll be back\" She whispered to the slave girl, and made her way towards the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so Eros is the son of Ares and Aphrodite?\" Eugene asked as they trudged up the long stairs that led to the oracle's temple. She'd long since crossed her arms to keep her overly generous bust from bouncing with every step, but there was nothing she could do to keep her hips from whipping to and fro, or her large rear from jiggling. But luckily this time she was behind Judy and was able to distract herself by looking down at the quiet city below and pondering about, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And since he's the god of sex and we're, uh, the living embodiments of his parents, that must be why we came on to each other. We're probably extremely vulnerable to his influence...\" And Judy was distracted himself, rattling off ancient Greek history, eager for a chance to put his (expensively) gained knowledge to use. Not that he didn't still feel the urge to glance back every once and a while at his bestowed friend. Just to make sure she was okay, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And since this is a video game, stuff like that probably exists for as long as we're within the city limits\" Eugene finished, adding in her own area of expertise. She was already glad that the height of the temple seemed to be clearing her head, but getting out of the town entirely as soon as they could would be optimal. Not that she wasn't...curious about what might have happened had they not been interrupted by the messenger, who walked ahead of them, ascending each step with the precision of a NPC (though here and there his body model seemed to get caught on something invisible, his leg stretching unnaturally before it would snap back into it's proper place some several steps ahead).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene had remembered that it was actually day when he'd arrived in the temple, but when he'd exited, it had been night. And the way the lighting on Judy had freaked out, and now the sometimes herky-jerky movements of their messenger guide...She wasn't going to say anything, but given they were supposed to be in Arabia and all the other problems, Eugene was starting to suspect that something had gone VERY wrong when the game had loaded. Maybe it was broken to begin with and they were now trapped in a game with no visible way out, as were Peter and Judy, WHEREVER they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eugene didn't feel like freaking out Judy with that particular thought. Not just yet. Maybe it was just early loading glitches that would smooth out the longer they played, or would fix itself as they moved things forward. Either way, any further rumination would have to wait as they reached the top of the massive flight of stairs, the temple of the oracle towering above them as braziers as large and Judy was now tall blazed with fire and bathed everything in a red-orange hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where I must leave you, oh chosen champions\" The messenger said with a bow, and without another word simply turned and walked away, getting stuck on one of the pillars fro a moment before simply blipping out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" the chosen of Ares and the blessed of Aphrodite said in unison, but before they could do anything else, the heavy wooden doors of the temple swung open and revealed a lavish and extravagant temple interior that was piled high with gold offerings, silks and incense.At the far end of the chamber was a dais, upon which a beautiful woman (though a pale shadow compared to Eugene) sat, a serene smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\" Eugene cooed, unable to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the oracle\" Judy whispered, \"I, uh, wasn't expecting her to actually live up the stories about being so pleasant to look at\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me!?\" Eugene huffed, suddenly offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I uh, I mean, uh, for a mortal?\" Judy stumbled, suddenly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I'll remember that, buster\" Eugene said with an icy tone, turning her nose up at her flumoxed friend and striding in, putting ALL of her curves to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just mentally kicked himself as he followed after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judy trudged along behind Eugene, head hung low in shame as his miffed near-lover strutted ahead in indignation. They passed the untidy mounds of offerings that ranged from simple coins to elaborate golden statues to even...wait, was that a SHIP hanging above them!? Judy and Eugene craned their heads as they passed below the enormous hull, from which draped even more coins and various trophies, some of which appeared extremely exotic in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" He muttered, wishing he could see the rest of the vessel. Ancient Greece was somewhat known for it's elaborate temples but actually seeing one, well, one that hadn't been decked out in weapons and wall sized depictions of gory battles and a very beefy, very angry looking god pointing a spear in his face, back when she was a she, was pretty damn amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. This ALMOST makes me want to forgive you for calling me ugly\" Eugene said in partial awe, but there was no hiding the venom in her voice. SHE was the blessed of Aphrodite, and SHE was the most beautiful in the room. In ANY room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\" Just began, but he stopped. There was no use arguing with her. 'Ugh, women' He thought as they approached the dais and the silk-clad oracle. There was a moment of silence as the two players were at a lack of what to do, the woman's creepy serene smile and her unblinking stare at both of them beginning to give Eugene the willies. But then the silence was broken as Judy and Eugene found themselves locked in place, unable to move as the oracle came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh chosen of the gods, you have truly saved all of Greece! You journeyed far and against the odds and faced down our foes in the terrible East!\" The Oracle rose from her seated position and stepped down the small flight of stairs towards Judy and Eugene, her silk robes flowing in the night breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this only the greatest tokens, know this for I have spoken. I bid thee congratulations on your quest, now go to your reward, and take some rest. For soon thou face the the darkened door, the fiery shadow of raging war, and without the secrets you have brought, all of our lives would have been for naught\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle smiled at the two heroes, and then turned away, walking over to the empty space next to the changed college students, who suddenly found themselves able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what just happened?\" Judy said, rubbing his massive arms to get rid of the numbness that had filled them while the computer character spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think we're in a cutscene? But it's messed up-\" Eugene was cut off as the Oracle began speaking once more to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Exotic creatures from far and away, you bring hope on the darkest day. The viper of the sands, the beauty'd jade, I come before thee, my hands splayed. Deliver to me that which I desire, the secret to save Greece from the fire. Completed be your noble quest, I release thee to a deserve'd rest\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle stood there for a very long moment, hands outstretched into nothing as her animation cycle began to loop before in the blink of an eye, she reappeared on the dais, the same smile on her face yet she stared straight ahead at the door, as she had when Eugene and Judy had entered the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, don't, uh, freak out...But I think our game is bugged. I think we somehow skipped to the last level!\" Eugene's big, brown eyes were open wide as she looked around in fear. If this was the penultimate level...They didn't have the key item they needed to move forward! They really had skipped directly to the end but they were stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. So you're telling me this is the end of the game? Dude, we can totally just end the game and get back to normal! BOOBS I'M COMING HOME!\" Judy bellowed in excitement. Not that it hadn't been fun seeing what it was like as a really strong guy, but he was definitely ready to be a she again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We...Judy, we need to give the Oracle whatever it is she's looking for! Without it, we're...we're stuck like this!\" Eugene's eyes were welling up with tears as she looked down at her incredible body. The whole 'sex god influence' moment aside, being a woman had been fun...But she definitely wanted to go back to normal! She wanted to go home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Was all Judy could say when the realization hit him. The juggernaut of muscled manliness staggered as his knees grw weak, and he collapsed against the dais. \"Peter!\" He wailed, tears finally filling his own eyes. He...SHE didn't want to be stuck like this! She had such a future ahead of her! Getting on at a museum! Maybe writing a novel! Having kids and being a better mom than hers ever was! It...it couldn't be gone! Not like this! All because she wanted to help some poor nerd ask his crush out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was in similar straits, though vicious sniffling and sheer man (or woman) power keeping them at bay as she went through her own mental anguish. So much for hooking up with Lindsey, or getting on at a game company. Or seeing mom again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy...Peter and Lindsey! THEY must be the 'viper' and the 'jade' things the Oracle was supposed to be talking to! If...If things are messed up, then maybe we just need to go find them? Maybe we just have to load into, uh, different levels! If we're near the end, then maybe they're back at the beginning! We just have to find them!\" Hope sprang into Eugene's bountiful chest as HE threw together the barest bones of a plan. \"This world is immersive, right? And we were supposed to be in Arabia, right? Then we just GO there and start looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wiped her nose on a bronze bracer, leaving a streak of snotty slime, \"O-oh y-yeah? How are w-we supposed to d-do that!? We don't e-even know what they lo-look like!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do!\" Eugene's voice was full of determination as he strutted over to Judy and lifted his slender arm, \"We just look for people that have <b>THESE</b> on their arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, tattooed against the flawless flesh of the geek's wrist, were five black bars.<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave one last look into the darkness of the slave ship, giving the terrified looking slave girl a grin that she hoped looked more confident than she felt. And then she was up the ladder, moving slowly and steadily and praying that the wood or the hatch didn't creak as she raised it up just enough to peek out onto the deck. Four shirtless men moved about the deck, one with a rag, the other carrying a crate, a third one messing with some rope and another one that the girl couldn't see, but could hear. The one that she assumed was the captain sat at the far end of the ship on a chair, grunting orders at the others in between drinking and fondling another girl in chains. She'd have to move fast and somehow take them all out, she'd only have one shot at this and if she failed, well...She had to suppose it said something about her state of mind that she ended up dead rather than chained below, waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was certain that, in this particular city, that was the Old Man on the Horse. And she was particularly certain that she had to stay away from him at all costs. Luckily though, there had been a large drum near the ladder, and by a even greater stroke of luck, one of the heavy mallets used for striking out a beat to the slave rowers had been left unattended. It hung heavy in her arms but it was the only thing that she had, and she'd have to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of peeking and memorizing the crew as they moved back and forth in almost predictable patterns, the girl summoned up her courage and lifted the hatch all the way up, barreling out of the hold as fast as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The crew member with the rag said dumbly as he spotted the blur of brown motion charging at him in the torch light. He had just enough time to scream before something fast and hard caved in his face. He gurgled once and slumped to the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One\" The girl grunted as she pivoted towards the crewman with the rope, who was now shouting at her. The man thrw the rope and the girl felt it slide around her, and she let out a raspy 'oof!' as the man tugged, the rope tightening around her throat and cutting off her oxygen. She resisted the urge to fall to her knees and her rapidly graying vision as she swung blindly ahead...And gasped sharply as the crewman flew over the side of the ship with a canned scream that sounded VERY familiar, as if it had been used in hundreds of movies and TV shows before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl rounded on the man with the box, who simply threw it at her before charging. She easily ducked beneath the box and thrust the drumstick forward, catching the man in his crotch. He squealed and fell to the deck, where she finished him off with a couple of rapid kicks to the head. The girl spun around, looking for the fourth crewman, only to hear a heavy tump behind her, and massive arms wrap around her tiny body, locking her in place as she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Bring her to me\" The captain slurred, and the girl felt herself lifted up like she was nothing. A giant must have been holding her as she was carried across the deck before being deposited on her knees at the foot of the captain's chair. She looked up, hared in her eyes for the leering man, glancing for just a moment at the slave girl next to him, who looked at her with sympathy but didn't dare move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you could escape? I don't know how you got out...but you'll wish you'd stayed in those chains, girl...\" The captain said as he held the girl's face in his leathery hand.  Another hand brushed away her stray hair before slipping down to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Fazad! Women are such mewling creatures, they desire to be shown proper dominance and...discipline.\" The captain licked his lips, \"I believe I need to sample my property before I sell it. You're very lucky, slave, only the luckiest get to know this pleasure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain leaned in for a sloppy kiss, and the girl spat in his face, mucus dripping off his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INSOLENT BITCH!\" He roared, raising his hand to strike her...</span></div></div>",

And then what, we stick out like a couple of olives in a date market while we poke around looking for Peter and Lindsey?\" Judy flicked away the tears in her smoldering eyes with a harsh laugh, \"You'd have better luck trying to sell a wooden horse to a bunch of second generation Trojans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all we've got, Judy! Unless you wanna stay here with Ms. Smiles over there or move into that house you almost broke and end up drunk cause we look like some god's mom and dad? I'm really not interested in being the starring role in some Greek comedy\" Eugene said, cocking a hand on one of his wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't complaining before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because we were being stupid and not paying attention to GAME. MECHANICS. But now we know that we're in a bugged game, right? I'm Good. At. Video. Games. and I think that if we just pay attention we might just be able to fix things before we really do end up stuck here and I'm popping out demigod babies every nine months until we both die five times from something you can take a goddamn Tylenol for back home!\" Eugene stamped his foot and ignored the jiggling of his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's still a literal world away! Do you even know how big the world is perceived to be now? Let's say that we do this, and we use your game mechanics, right? But if this...world is so detailed and life-like, it will take us weeks, if we're lucky, to get to Athens. I could probably make it, but YOU'RE not built for cross-country. And even if we made it without getting eaten by some mythological beasts, since if the gods are acting through us right now, you can bet there's a goddamn hydra out there, or a cyclops, just waiting to eat us. And then, and THEN, we somehow get a boat that is willing to sail into the HEART of Greece's most hated enemy?\" Judy got up, dusted her bulky body off and leaned against the Oracle's dais with a derisive snort, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weeks at sea, dealing a crew, probably a sea monster, pirates, and then it's just, you know, the tiny detail of trying to navigate what was then the LARGEST NATION ON EARTH and some how not die in our sleep five times simply because we're Greeks in Persia. Assuming, of course, we can even 'load' earlier 'levels'. Forget it, I may look like Hercules but I am NOT a fighter!\" Judy flexed a bicep for show, but it was true. She had NO idea of what to do if they actually got into a fight. Would the game take over? Or was it up to her just to swing a sword around and get lucky? And then what use was Eugene? He just looked gorgeous and hadn't demonstrated any kind of 'gameplay power'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want to wait here, like a coward? I don't know why it's not affecting us here, but Judy, if we DON'T take an active role in events, we're GOING to become part of the game, lives or not! What would have happened if we just went into that building and fucked? Do you really think it's just some coincidence that every time we were about to bang the game interrupted us? It WANTS us to play! If we just sit here we could end up as a couple of NPCs and NEVER get out!\" That was something Eugene was pretty concerned about. Down in the city everything had gotten...swampy, there were so many torches, and according to Judy's earlier history lesson when walking up to the Oracle's temple, she'd mentioned something about torches being a symbol of Eros. And there were a LOT of torches down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Like I told you on the stairs, Oracles were Apollo's domain! No other god can interfere in an Oracle's temple! Look, we're clearly supposed to 'rest' after turning in the quest, right? So to me, that means free room and board for the night. Given we can't advance anything, we can just live here until Peter and Lindsey catch up with us! And then we turn in the quest, fight the boss and go home!\" The towering goth stomped around the temple, kicking scattered tribute lightly as to not accidentally damage their potential future home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, what if THEY get stuck? We were given these bodies for a reason, there's clearly specific roles that WE have to play in order to beat the game! You're the warrior, the tank, you take the hits and give them. I'm clearly the money man...Well, woman, but I'm the one with all the gold right now. Maybe I have another power, who knows, but you don't have any cash, I do, so clearly what we are serves a purpose. What if Lindsey is a healer? Healers ALWAYS die first in video games, and what if Peter is some kind of a spell caster, or a stealth melee class? Or an archer that can't win a fistfight? Neither of those survive long without the support of the party\" Eugene was stretching the truth a little bit, he'd played World of Warcraft long enough to know that really, really good players in those classes could solo group content or take on enemy players teams on their own, but he had to convince Judy to get out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to believe that this game, as powerful and detailed and CLEARLY magical, would be that short-sighted and not let 'Immersive Mode' be free to do however you wanted. I'd honestly rather take my chances with trying to walk through the mythological nightmare. I'm not fucking leaving Eugene, so...Get used to those boobs. Maybe you can invent the bra why we wait\" Judy stepped up on the dais and shoved the static Oracle out of her way, taking a rather violent seat on the lavish pile of pillows and furs that were stacked behind the frozen soothsayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene fumed at the goth's stubborness. But then he got an idea. If reaching out to her and trying to make her see video game logic wasn't working...The blonde beauty that was actually a fat little nerd looked around the temple room for a few minutes, casting glances at Judy, who was busy rubbing her temples and muttering to herself. There was so much treasure here, there had to be a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Eugene cried out, his voice echoing off the high ceiling of the temple interior as he pulled a jewel encrusted sword out of a pile of gold coins, disrupting the balance of the pile and sending the currency spilling out across the stone floor noisily, causing Judy to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Gene, what are you doing?\" Judy tried not to chuckle as the geeky blonde struggled to hold the sword over his head, his arms wavering and impossibly pretty face scrunched in exertion, a shiny sheen of sweat already forming on his otherwise immaculate brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm gonna...oof!\" Eugene stopped trying to hold the sword which shouldn't have been that heavy, fall to the floor with a CLANG. He let out a long and heavy exhale from the strain and tried to lift it again, only managing to lift the blade about an inch from the floor this time. 'Well, this is awkward...' He thought, his plan already falling apart. But he wasn't going to give up, and began crab-walking as best he could towards the temple doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" Judy said as she stood up from the bed of cushions behind the unmoving Oracle, amused and confused as her friend slowly made his way out of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene groaned as he dropped the sword once more, \"Ugh, why didn't I wake up in the temple of Athena? At least if I had to be a chick, I'd have some muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed and stepped down from the dais, taking three long strides with her powerful legs until she was next to Eugene. \"Athena is a bitch anyway. Did I ever tell you what she did to Medusa?\" She hefted the sword onto her shoulder with minimal effort, earning a tired grin from the weak beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna sacrifice a goat?\" Eugene made a slicing motion with his tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl could do nothing against the muscles that restrained her, pinning her face down against the deck as her curvy rear was thrust up into the air. She could feel the captain's leathery hands as they caressed her buttocks, and she gave a pleading stare up at the motion-less slave girl next to the captain's chair, who simply looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe this piece of meat will fetch quite a sum tomorrow at the auction...Though I could just keep it all for myself. What do you think, Fazad?\" The girl heard the ripping of fabric as what was left of her dress was torn apart, her bare skin shivering in the cool sea air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a wordless grunt in reply. There was the sound of metal jingling and the girl felt a large amount of clothing suddenly collapse over her feet. There was a sharp slap of her rear and she couldn't help but let out a whimper, fearing what was to come. Why did she have to play the hero? She scrunched her eyes tight, mentally preparing herself for what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, I am getting a bit bored with the other one...Wait, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl cracked open a dark brown eye, and through the veil of her dark hair could see something misty and...green? creeping over the deck railing in thick tendrils. The broken slave girl let out a scream as it curled around her and the girl swore that it looked like some kind of...dragon? The slave seemed to fade away into the green mist, her voice growing fainter and fainter as she disappeared from view...And the pair of iron shackles that had been around her wrist fell to the floor with a loud clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this!? What are you doing, witch!\" The captain roared behind her, and the girl was suddenly freed from the crushing grip. She spun around to see both men suffer a similar fate as the green mist curled around them. The two seemed to evaporate as they swung wildly at the mists, screaming as the strange mist dragons consumed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they were gone, their clothes fluttering to the floor in silence as the mist quickly retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to question providence, the girl quickly pawed through the captain's abandoned clothes and pulled out a large iron ring of keys and scurried back into the ship's hold, and the other tattooed girl.</span></div></div>",

It had been weird, one moment she'd been absolutely adamant about doing anything else in the game, content to just sit in the oracle's temple until Peter and Lindsey caught up to them but then Eugene had started had started talking. Not that they hadn't just spent a large amount of time arguing like an old married couple but this time Eugene's words had been...different? Regardless, the spiel about sacrificing a goat to the gods for guidance seemed a lot more reasonable that the 'video game logic' the buxom boy had tried pulling on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now here they were, stalking around on top of a hill, at night, looking for a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh you know what, this isn't going to work, Eugene. Let's just go back inside and...\" Judy had started, but then a surprised, girly shriek of terror, loud braying and a crash came from around the corner of one of the temple's side buildings. The former goth warrior felt a surge of adrenaline as she rushed forward, sword drawn...Only to find Eugene cutely blowing a large piece of hay out of her blonde locks as a pair of white and brown goats sniffed and nuzzled him in quiet animal curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Found the goats\" Eugene said with a sheepish (goatish?) grin as he extricated his curvy form from the small pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Judy found herself suddenly very worried about the little geek that was still little, but now much larger in different areas. Judy wondered what it would feel like to be that pretty. She had had big breasts before but not that...perfect looking. Nor had all of her curves been so defined and sharp enough to cut cheese on, given her old tiny body and slight layer of pudginess. Not that she had been fat, but the 'big titty goth girlfriend' jokes she'd overheard from Peter's sports buddies hadn't been any less hurtful. Judy couldn't help but think about how they'd felt like before they'd been interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Just wasn't looking...Thanks, though\" Eugene said with a smaller, warmer smile and a flick of his golden hair, blushing at how nice Judy was being. He was used to being the 'fall guy'; his slightly clumsiness combined with his overweight old body and decidedly average looks meant that he was still getting used to having friends, even in the more 'liberal' college atmosphere where it was easier to find birds of a feather. And it was especially still odd, but really nice, that someone so...built like Judy would care about him. How it felt to be wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared in silence at each other for a moment, their gazes drifting up and down each other's bodies before the same thought seemed to enter their minds, their eyes going wide as they turned away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, so we found the goats. Now what?\" Judy coughed, looking out over the dark countryside and trying not to notice how all the torches in the city below flickered and danced as their linked animation cycles repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'retheArtsmajoryoutellme!\" Eugene blathered, pushing certain...thoughts out of his head. And a certain head away from his white toga as one of the goats had wandered over and was now attempting to nibble at it. The last thing he needed was to start losing clothes to some animal like Natalie Portman had in the worst film of the Star Wars Prequels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this was your idea! Ugh, FINE. There's, uh, always some kind of platform around a temple where they'd do this. Gods can't eat mortal food so it was all about the smells and the, uh, essence of the sacrifice that would let them feast, right?\" Judy pulled on her knowledge base and looked back at Eugene, who simply shrugged, sending his assets jiggling, \"UhyeahsowejustfindoneofthoseandIguessI'llcutthegoatopen\" She said turning away before the...thing in her pants started growing again. This far away from the temple proper, around the torches that lined the temple grounds, it was clear they were somewhat falling back under Eros's influence again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we lead the goat there though?\" Eugene silently admitted he hadn't fully thought this plan through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Eugene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't blame me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ABOUT this is YOUR fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, just...take off your belt and I'll make a lead out of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was about to complain and say no when she felt the ...weirdness again, and she quickly undid the tanned leather strap that held her exterior armor around her wait and codpiece, handing it to Eugene who mumbled something under his breath before trying it around the goat's long neck. Now with a way to lead the goat around, the two went back to wandering the temple grounds, and eventually came upon a small, wide platform near the rear of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing else around that looks like this. Guess this is where, uh...\" Eugene stammered, pulling the goat forward with as much force as he could muster in his weak arms, causing it to bray in complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Hey, uh, Eugene? I've...I've never killed anything before\" Judy muttered quietly. She hadn't really been thinking about the dark deed she was going to have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't either. Uh, outside of a video game, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked down at the goat, who was attempt to get close to Eugene, it's teeth snapping as it continued to try to nibble at the toga that was straining to cover the nerd's curves. \"That doesn't exactly make me feel better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's either we do this, or you listen to my 'video game logic' or we sit around and wait for help that may never come. Given we don't want to do what the other suggests...I mean it's a video game goat. We're CLEARLY in a video game if all those glitches haven't pointed that out to you yet. This guy will probably respawn after a while anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respawn? Oh it, uh, means the game will reload the goat into the game world back where we found it. Games do that to make the worlds seem more real\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Judy said, and the two lapsed into silence as the stared at the dais in front of them. Eventually the two gathered up the courage, Judy lifting the goat onto the platform, where it began bleating, braying and struggling in her powerful grip. She felt tears welling up in her eyes. Sure, dad had always been a hunter but she was always expected to be a girly girl and not...This just felt so mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Just don't think about it okay?\" Eugene whispered, looking away from the goat and fightingback warm tears of his own. He hadn't expected to actually be affected by this. 'Why did this game have to be so real!?' The bodacious blonde thought coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of continued waffling from BOTH of them, Judy pulled her sword out and slowly raised it, pressing the tip against the goat's neck, who struggled even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" She cried, and with a high pitched squeal of mortified disgust, pressed the blade into the small creature, who immediately went limp, it's stomach splitting open from neck to tail as it's guts spilled out over the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EW EW EW EW!\" Judy let go of the goat AND her sword, which clattered to the ground, \"DAMNIT EUGENE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, l-look!\" Eugene blinked and wiped away a stray tear as his unease turned to fascination as the sacrificial altar began to glow as small clouds of golden light began to shimmer around the carcass. Then a disembodied male voice spoke, powerful and commanding, yet not nearly as deep as Judy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This sacrifice shall be rewarded<br>\r\nA audience with the gods awarded<br>\r\nArrange the entails of that which bleats<br>\r\nAnd be granted a divinely Cheat</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell, this...This must be how you enable cheat mode!\" Eugene fought back the urge to fully geek out. He had expected and hoped for something to happen...But this? They could fix everything right here! \"Judy! Stick your hands into the guts and spell out something! Like, uh...Oh, maybe try 'Whatisbestinlife'! That's an instant win code from a game, maybe we can just win by default!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? I'm...I'm not sticking my hands in that! They're already bloody!\" Judy showed Eugene her gore-drenched hands, \"You do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you DARE say you're a girl, Eugene Mann. Don't you even THINK it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! I did my part, now you do yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene complained some more, but Judy just looked away in silence. Defeated, Eugene slowly, carefully reached into the slightly steaming bloody pile of organs as began to spell out the Starcraft II cheat code...And trying not to barf. After a few minutes of effort, the entrails were arranged in a VERY rough configuration and Eugene, lacking any input from Judy, placed his hands upon the altar and looked up at the sky and for lack of a better idea, yelled \"MORPHMANJI\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distant clap of thunder as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a distant clap of thunder as the sky grew cloudy, roiling black clouds forming out of the otherwise clear night sky and coming to an angry collision over the temple. Lightning flashed from within the unexpected storm and the wind began to howl, whipping across the temple grounds like a hurricane, growing so powerful that Judy was forced to grab onto the bloody, smelly altar...And then onto Eugene, who screamed as the wind lifted him off of his tiny sandal'd feet and threatened to carry him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUDY!\" He screamed, and the goth grunted as she reached out and physically tugged the terrified blonde back to earth, pulling him in close to her muscled body as she tucked them both as close to the ground as possible. Her American Midwest upbringing had prepared her this; in tornadoes, barring any actual cover like a bathroom or a basement, you just got as close to the ground as possible to avoid getting pulled into the air or whacked by debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of debris...The Oracle's temple suddenly uprooted itself from the hill-side with a might CRASH and began swirling around in the sky above as a thick, electric green tendril of energy descended down, touching the altar and covering Judy and Eugene in what looked like a net as the ENTIRE game world began to dissolve around them.There was a second mighty crack of thunder and a second beam of energy shot out from the cloud and into the distance, the front of it disappearing over the massive void where the sea had been, heading for some unknown location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe howling became louder still, and there was a burning sensation as Judy's armor and Eugene's toga were lit in green fire, the two terrified students screaming in terror as the world ended around then with a loud BANG and a flash of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what happened?\" Eugene muttered, as he pulled himself off the cold tile floor. He blinked the blurriness out of his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief as he recognized where he was: They were back in the common room of the dorm! There was the TV, the bathrooms, even the game itself which was dead quiet, looking like a lifeless piece of plastic once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene grinned and heaved himself upwards, brushing a golden strand of hair out of his face as he...Eugene froze as he stared at the tiny hand that was in mid-swipe of the almost glowing errant bang. And at the five bars still imprinted on his slender, pale arm. And then his vision turned south towards the canyon of cleavage that was pressing through his much tighter feeling t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Oh no\" He whispered in a high female voice that was unfortunately familiar. But his incoming panic attack was put off by the deep grunt next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Did it work? Eu...gene?\" Judy rubbed her eyes and then paused, another large hand touched her face before she snapped to her feet, casting a wide-eyed look of terror between Eugene and her unfortunately still male body, now cloaked in a pair of jeans, a white t-shirt and a North Point letter jacket covering her bulging arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M STILL A GUY!\" She wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girl blinked as the world swam back into view. Instead of night, it was now...sunset? And instead of the cool night air of the desert harbor, there was now a much colder breeze whisking across her dark skin, which was now clothed in strange clothes that while not completely unwelcome, were the exact opposite of her ruined dress. Strange blue fabric covered her legs, and a tight blue shirt covered 'most' of her torso, her abdomen and belly button bare to the world. Her arms were covered by a black leather cloak of some kind, and the cylinder that had been tied to her waist, was now gone, instead replaced by a small white pouch that hung off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/QLI5Sa1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/QLI5Sa1.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around in confusion at the strange place she had been deposited in. Instead of the vast expanse of desert, or the harbor, or the tall, tapered tower and vast city...She was now in the middle of a city she did not recognize, with ugly, rectangular buildings that rose low into the sky. Instead of cobblestone paths or the might river, instead a wide, gray-black network of streets connected to each other amidst the maze of ugly structures, and great, noisy chariots traveled them, as alien and unfamiliar as anything else the girl had seen was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft groan next to her, and the girl looked down to see the exotic slave girl from before, her cuts and bruises gone, along with all the strange green blood that the girl had found pouring out of a self-inflicted wound. Instead she was exquisite, her own dark hair flittering in the breeze. Her rags had changed as well, a pair of short, lighter blue fabric extending down to knees and leaving the rest of her legs exposed while a deep, jade green hood cloak of some kind was draped off her body, almost too large for her small frame. A large brown pouch, larger than the girl's own, hung off her rounded shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RgIwy8I.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/RgIwy8I.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave girl stared at the other girl in confusion before looking back at herself, touching her slender neck where a large gash had been, the self inflicted mortal wound gone, as well as all of the strange symbols she had painted onto herself in an effort to save her would-be rescuer after she had been captured on the upper deck. She had done the only thing that she actually knew how to do, using a sharp piece of wood in the slave ship to slice open her throat and began painting symbols onto herself and the hold's deck, calling upon the green mist and the dragons within to save her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her rescuer had returned, the slave girl had been fading away from the blood loss while her rescuer tried in vain to save her again, unlocking the slave girl's bind and trying to do...something to stop the bleeding. But then there had been a massive clap of thunder, a wave of green light and now they were here, in another strange land. She felt a hand grab her arm and looked up into the deeply concerned brown eyes of the darker-skinned girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Her rescuer asked, and after a moment, the slave girl nodded, slowly pulling up the green fabric on her arms to reveal four bars tattooed on near her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Did I save us?\" The slave girl asked quietly, rubbing her hand over the smooth skin of her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? But where did you take us?\" The dark skinned girl looked around at the strange symbols that she recognized...But didn't know why. She pointed to the strange emblem on the exotic girl's cloak\"What is \" North Point University Gunner's Butte Colorado?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I thought the magic would just save you, not take us somewhere else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked around in confusion...and at the handful of lighter-skinned people in strange clothes of their own, including strange facial coverings that went from pale blue to wild illustrations that passed by. Many of them were giving them hard looks, and after a few minutes a taller, lighter skinned man in a blue uniform approached them, wearing a mask of his own and covered in strange emblems, with several items hanging off his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies, I'm Officer Peterson, I'm with the police department. A couple of the shop owners have asked me that if you're gonna stand around out here, can you practice safe social distancing? Do you have your masks?\" Kyle Peterson hoped the girls spoke English, one was clearly Chinese and the other looked...Iranian? Someone from the Middle East, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other in confusion, and the possible-Iranian tensed up, tiny hands curling into fists. Kyle sighed in annoyance and placed a hand on his taser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I'm gonna ask you to take a step back, please. I'm trying to help. Now, do you girls speak English?\" The slightly older officer didn't want to zap either of the admittingly pretty girls, one of which was clearly a student at the college, but still, he had to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls shared another look before the Chinese girl nodded to the Middle Eastern girl, who visibly relaxed her fists. Kyle allowed himself to grin under his own mask. He kept his hand on his taser, but he felt the tension in the situation drop considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell us where we are? We were on a boat and there was a flash of light and now we are here. What is North Point University Gunner's Butte Colorado?\" The maybe-Iranian said , pointing at the Chinese girl's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes narrowed, \"Miss, that's the nearby college. Are you girls students there? Do you have identification in your purses?\" The officer pointed at the brown and white satchels the girls were carrying, and they looked quizically down at them, as if seeing them for the first time. Something was definitely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what did you mean 'on a boat'? there's no rivers around here...Are you girls from around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OKAY!? I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS EITHER!\" Eugene screamed at the top of his new voice as he stared up at Judy's face, her eyes bulging with anger as her face grew a deep shade of angry red. The goth had only gotten angrier as a quick check of her new wallet and Eugene's new purse revealed that reality had somehow altered. Judy was now 'Jonah Ross', while Eugene was simply 'Jean Mann'. A quick check of their rooms had revealed similar changes, Eugene's now VERY girly and filled with makeup and fashionable clothes, while Judy's was filled with sports memorabilia and weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THAT...THAT THING WITH YOU!\" Judy roared and felt the urge to pick the game up and send it shattering against the nearby wall. She took a step towards it, only for Eugene's bouncy form to dart in front of it, his arms stretched wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Maybe if we turn it back on we can...We can go back! Maybe we have to win to change back!\" He pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt like just shoving the tiny but buxom blonde out of the way and breaking the machine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Najida didn't like this 'police station'. It was cold, it was oppressive, way too bright and loud, with all the strange devices constantly ringing. And there were far too many of these 'police officers' giving her dirty looks. What was worse is that they'd pulled her away from Jiang, the girl she had been in the process of rescuing before they had been suddenly brought to this...very strange place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer, Kyle Peterson, had asked them for 'IDs', which after some frustratingly slow questions and examinations of the satchels the girls now carried (called purses), had revealed a couple small, hard tablets that had their likenesses imprinted upon them along with a LOT of information, including, at least, their names. Najida el-Rahaim and Jiang Ruogang. They were apparently in some place called 'America' on 'student visas' from a place called 'Tehran' and 'Beijing'  Najida had no idea what a 'visa' was or where those places were, but the word student was clear to her: Wherever she and her friend were, they were here to learn?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from what Najida had seen so far, well, she wasn't exactly confident that these 'Americans' could teach her anything. Most of them seemed horribly out of shape, and the amount of food markets they'd passed on the way to the 'precinct' in Officer Peterson's 'car'. The whole experience was turning into a deluge of new words that Najida...understood, but at the same time had absolutely no understanding of. It was another of many questions that she wanted answer to, but knowing their names helped. A LOT. Right now it was simply a case of trying to convince the officers that they did not have something called 'Covid-19' and were not victims of 'human trafficking' (which seemed a lot like slavery, apparently common for young woman that looked like Najida and Jiang).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they had been cleared to go after their 'identities' had been confirmed with the place of learning called 'North Point'. She and Jiang were waiting for 'campus security' (which sounded a lot like palace guards to Najida but Jiang was urging caution over action) to take them back to their dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajida looked over at Jiang, who was fishing through the practically endless 'purse', looking at objects, a strange case of what appeared to be makeup, including mirrors so the two girls could look at themselves and get a better feel of what they each looked like (those strange 'IDs' had terrible images that made them look somewhat distorted) and it was very clear that wherever they now came from...Jiang and Najida were very pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Najida couldn't help but steal a few looks in Jinag's direction. Now that she could see the exotic girl in full light, now that they just had a moment to exist...Najida could feel her breath getting caught in her throat. Jiang's breasts were not as large and her own were, but her hips and legs, the roundness to her face, the dark hair and full lips and the way she moved with such...grace. It was no wonder why the slavers had captured her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Jiang had an aura of innocence about her, Najida was clearly more intense. Her body was more athletic, despite being the more physically attractive of the two, and her large breasts pushed against the fabric of the shirt she wore, and more than once she had to adjust the straps of the 'bra' that now pressed against into her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Jiang had pulled out the tiny rectangle, randomly pressing the buttons and the two marveling at the picture that came up on the front screen of a city of massive steel towers, far higher and larger than anything the two had ever seen before, spanning out into the distance beyond the horizon. A few more experiments and they'd discovered the screen could be moved around, even changed! They'd browsed through what was clearly an image glallery, and many of the photos were of the two of them in various activities in life, and even one of them in dress that looked VERY similar to what they had been wearing before appearing in this place...But they were surrounded by other people in costumes, and holding strange bright red cups in their hands. Several pictures of Jiang staring intently into books and painting some kind of picture with the same symbols she had been using with her magical blood on the slave ship...only this was clearly some kind of paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajida's phone was much of the same. The large picture screen was of a sunset over a sea, however, and there were more pictures of some kind of athletic events. Some kind of track around a garden that had white stripes painted across it with large prongs at either end. Pictures of her in a VERY small outfit running along it with great difficulty, given her breast size. But then another picture of her climbing some giant mountain...And one VERY intimate picture of her and Jiang cuddling in a large bed with hardly anything on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere...Were they lovers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajida was about to show the image to Jiang before she second guessed herself and moved to another image, one of her, Jiang, a VERY well endowed light skinned woman and VERY tall man with muscles the size of Najida's head all standing in front of a large ugly tower, smiling as they posed, their arms raised in some sort of victory pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a strange place. Why are there answers here, but not where we came from?\" She asked Jiang quietly, who let out a squeak of surprised, her image device falling from her hands and clattering on the hard plastic bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's okay. I was just...\" Jiang's face turned red as she grabbed the device and cradled shoved it back in her 'purse'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what was on it?\" Najida curiously, craning her neck to peer into her...friend, lover? In Jiang's purse where the device was still glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nono! It's fine! All good!\" Jiang squeaked again, closing the purse and trying to hide the intense blush on her face. \"It was nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been a good nothing\" Najida smirked playfully reaching a hand towards the satchel only to have it batted away by another small hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did you find on yours? Jiang said, setting the purse farther down on the bench beyond the darker skinned girl's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly the same\" Najida showed her device's screen to Jiang, the picture of the four of them rotating and becoming wider by some strange magic neither of them could see. At first her almond-shaped seemed rather disinterested, another strange picture of the two of them with strangers...And then they went wide as she pointed a finger towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Najida...that man and woman...they have the same marks as we do! Look!\" Jiang said in an excited, but hushed whisper as another officer walked past, given them an odd look. As her friend pressed the small box up into Najida's face, her eyes throbbed painfully from the sudden unfocused (and bright) image...and then she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, on the wrist of the impossibly strong looking man and the woman that appeared more hips and tits than person, were five black bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut any further introspection was disturbed as Officer Kyle Peterson walked up to the two girls, and Najida quickly pulled the picture device out of Jiang's hands and pressed it face first into her leg as he approached, two clipboards tucked under his arm and two small white cups of steaming liquid in his free hands. He stretched out, extending the cups towards the girls who, after a shared look of uncertainty, reached up and took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajida sniffed the dark liquid and winced at the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Do you not drink coffee? I know you peop-uh, I mean, I know that there are, uh, a lot of different...customs about stuff from where you're from and uh...\" Kyle trailed off before he stumbled into a PR faux pas. \"Anyway I thought you girls might like something warm to drink after all this. Even in summer Colorado can be chilly, especially in this area\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It is very much appreciated\" Jiang's voice was carefully neutral, and despite her small nose scrunching in distaste, she took a small sip of the hot liquid and did her best not to jerk in discomfort as it attempted to burn the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hey you, uh, you gotta let it cool a little first, miss!\" Kyle resisted the urge to pull the cup away as the Chinese girl's face turned red and he swore smoke began to spill out her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-its\" Jiang swallowed the liquid and let out a raspy cough, \"It''s good!\" She looked at Najida, who looked angry...But then again the other girl almost always looked upset. She gave her friend a pleading look and turned back to the officer, \"Sir, do you...do you know when we can travel home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulled the clipboards out from under his arms and held them out towards the girls, who quickly set their cups aside. \"That's why I came back, your ride is outside. I just need you to sign these release forms\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release forms\" The Middle Eastern girl said warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they, uh, basically just summarize everything. Got a call saying two confused students were not social distancing, we brought you in to confirm your identities and call the university, etc. It's just something we have to do before we let you head back. Paperwork, you know how it is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls truly didn't, but they uncapped the small writing quills and signed their names on the bottom of the forms, quickly handing them back to Kyle, who looked them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's it then. C'mon, I'll escort you girls out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It honestly didn't bother her one bit, she really just wanted to see the cool and totally retro looking machine in action and if it really did all the things Eugene said it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majority rules, I guess\" Eugene said with a (mostly) mock sigh of disappointment. He settled his fingers over the keyboard and carefully typed in \"GREECE\" and hit enter. The machine made a buzzing sound before it began a series of mechanical clicks and something that Lindsey pointed out sound like an old dial-up modem, which only she had really any true knowledge of because of her computer classes and they were all young enough that they never knew of a time where one could not be on the Internet and use the phone at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of internal noises from the machine, silence returned to the room with a loud POP as two large black buttons snapped out from the top of the game, with the words 'TRADITIONAL' and 'IMMERSIVE' stenciled on them in chipped white lettering. A flap on the side flipped open and a tray holding four small figurines, each lacking much detail and each a bright primary color, slid out. There was what looked to be a blue large, muscled man holding a sword over his head, a yellow shorter human figure in what looked to be a toga carry what appeared to be a rock and chain in it's hands, a red half-horse, half-man creature with a bow and arrow...And what was very clearly Medusa, a green molded plastic tail extending from a human torso that was topped by a fanged head that was ringed with delicate looking plastic snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CHOOSE A GAME MODE\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? MORE choices?\" Peter complained as he rubbed his forehead. This was too much thinking for something that didn't involve a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush\" Judy said, softly bapping his left knee with a slap, \"It's just one more, right Eugene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. We just...\" Eugene paused and pulled up the game's box again to read more of the instructions, \"After we choose a game type, it'll let us choose our avatars. Then we just type in 'Player' and the number on the back of the miniatures, then just type in 'start' and it'll begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's pick something already!\" Peter said impatiently from his spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Eugene mumbled as he squinted at the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" The jock groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we choose Traditional mode, we have to input the number of spaces and then wait for it to print out the game map. Then it'll our dice and THEN we type in start\" Eugene said as he scratched his head. 'That was weird, was all that text really there just a minute ago?' The geek thought as he stared at what he had just assumed was an empty section of the box. He pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes; he just must have been seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked back to his friends, Judy who was frowning slightly, Lindsey who had pulled out her phone and Peter who was staring up at the ceiling. They were getting bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what does everyone want to do? Majority rules votes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fine, Eugene\" Judy said, slapping Peter's chest with a long nailed hand, \"Doesn't it Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, whatever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, show of hands, who wants...\" Eugene began.</span></div></div>",

He felt himself deflate a little; the geek had been hoping for Immersive mode to see just what exactly the game would do. Would it have played the role of dungeon master, or something like one of those old fashioned MUD games?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, democracy works!\" Eugene chuckled and with a tiny bit of dramatic flourish, stuck out his right index finger and pushed the big black button that read 'TRADITIONAL'. There was an audible click, and a whirring noise emanated from within the machine as a soft breeze of warm hot began to blow out from a tiny vent on it's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE INPUT GAME LENGTH\" The game spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, last big choice, how many spaces do we want to have?\" Eugene said as he glanced at the box and the column of rules that were under the word 'TRADITIONAL', \"We each get one normal dice to roll, singles and double rolls get two turns...If anyone rolls a six they have to pull a 'Challenge Card'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are those?\" Lindsey said, scooting her beanbag closer to the table. Eugene forced himself not to look at the blonde's breasts as they bounced up and down with each consecutive scoot and instead buried his head in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traditional mode has 'Action Squares' and 'Challenge Cards'. If we land on a square, the game will announce an action for us to perform...And the cards are sort of the same thing but they're just much more specific. They're kind of like Monopoly cards, they make the game more exciting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What game? All we've done is talk\" Peter muttered, getting a soft elbow to the ribs from Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please continue, Eugene\" Judy said sweetly as she glared at her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Uh...Players can't roll again until they've done the Action Square or a Challenge Card, and we ALL have to reach the end of the game before the game ends. Whoever gets there first has to wait on the others, and then we all have to say 'Morphmanji!' for the game to end...And whoever got to the end first gets a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Three heads said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. That's all it says. 'The Player that reached the end first gets to make a wish'. I guess maybe one of us will have to type in something and we'll get a special ending?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds dumb\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It does! It's just a game, not like it can actually make wishes come true or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene shrugged, \"It's old. You know how old games can be. Anyway, since at max we can only move six spaces at a time, how many squares do we want? it will generate the Action Squares and Challenge Card spaces at random so we don't have to put those in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there, like, a default number of spaces?\" Lindsey said, giving the machine a curious poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the default is 36 spaces, but we could make it longer or shorter if we wanted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like 36. It totally sounds like a good number to play with the first time through\" Lindsey continued to poke the machine, her desire to crack it open and see how it worked growing stronger by the minute. It was just so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36 fine with you and Judy, Peter?\" Eugene asked, and his friends on the couch nodded. Satisfied, he looked down at the keyboard and typed in 'DEFAULT' on the small keys and watched as the word lit up on the one screen the game machine had, the red lights glowing brightly as they spelled out his choice. The geek pressed 'enter' with a chunky finger and sat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE WAIT. PRODUCING GAME MAP.\" The machine called out, and yet another unseen flap opened on the domed electronic device as paper, somehow already loaded, began slowly inching out of the set of rollers as the sounds of a printer buzzed from inside the faded plastic shell. The group took this time to use the bathroom or get some refreshments, and five minutes later they returned to the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table, draped off the side due to the game machine taking up most of it, was a black and white paper game board that had a set of four elaborate tiled paths that curled and twisted around and across each other, each path broken only by the words 'Action Square' and 'Draw Card' interjected at random points across the map. The only place that seemed to have a uniform symmetrical dispersion of 'Action Squares' were the points were each path intersected with each other, and at the very center was a small circle that had 'Morphmanji' printed across the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE SELECT AVATAR AND INPUT PLAYER ROLL ORDER. TYPE START AND ENTER TO BEGIN\" The game buzzed, almost as if it was slightly annoyed that it had to wait on the young adults to return to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard it. Let's pick who we're going to be.\" Eugene said, reaching out a hand as the lid of the miniature case flipped open and tiny servos raised the plastic figurines out to be selected. The nerd had thought about it, and how Peter's show of muscles had made his insecurity about his weight flare up...Even if it was just pretend, maybe it'd be nice to be the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIBS ON HERCULES\" Peter shouted, a freight train sized fist shooting forward and gabbing the muscled, sword swing warrior, knocking Eugene's hand out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER TZIMEROS, STOP!\" Judy shouted right as the jock's cable-like fingers wrapped around the blue swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Peter whined back, but then stopped as he saw that look in her eyes. He knew that look, and it always meant trouble. He let loose a mental sigh as he sat back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eugene's game. It's only fair that he choose first\" Judy said, matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Peter began, but fell silent as Judy's glare intensified, \"Ugh okay. Geno you get first pick bro\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks, Pete\" Eugene stammered, and with a shaking hand, pulled the blue muscle man out of his cradle, Peter letting loose a sigh of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIBS ON THE CENTAUR DUDE!\" Lindsey shouted, darting out to pluck the equinoid. Peter stared wide eyed at the development. BOTH of the muscled guys were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine\" He pouted, and reached out towards the machine, \"Guess I'll just play as Medusa then\" Peter's hands clasped the tiny gorgon and brought it up to his face, examining the yellow monster. \"Man, I can believe that someone this ugly WOULD be a monster! She must have been a horrible bitch\" He chuckled, and was promptly swatted on the back of the head by his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did NOT just say that! I'll have you know that Medusa is a VICTIM, not a MONSTER!\" Judy reached out and plucked the tiny yellow snake-woman from her boyfriend's palm, \"She was RAPED by Poseidon, and then tries to defend herself to Athena, supposedly a 'good' goddess, SHE just turned Medusa into a monster for daring to speak out against the gods! And then she got stuck in a cave and had to fight for her LIFE every DAY because of all the assholes that tried to KILL her just for their own personal glory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Eugene and Lindsey simply stared wide eyed at the now red-face goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, Medusa was a victim against impossibly hopeless circumstances, and since I'm the only one who wrote a paper about her,  I'M going to play her!\" Judy's nostrils flared with indignation as she stomped over and grabbed another lounge chair, abandoning Peter on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, babe, I didn't-\" Peter stammered as he tried to wade out of the emotional hot water he found himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Just pick the Or-The mace-guy and let's get started, okay?\" Judy said, plopping HER Medusa down on the game board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mace-guy? For someone majoring in mythology that sure doesn't sound like a technical term\" Peter said, and instantly regretted the petty comment. Not willing to risk getting sucked out deeper into the boiling hot water sea, he shut his mouth and grabbed the tiny red figure that was holding the rock and chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...We don't have to play if-\" Eugene suggested, but only received an angry sigh from Judy in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we've come this far, we're going to ALL play this game, Gene\" She said slowly and carefully, while staring daggers at her boyfriend who simply withered under her triggered gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...'kay\" Eugene mumbled. \"I guess give me your numbers and I'll type them in then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm player 4\" Judy snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, 3?\" Lindsey squeaked timidly as she put her green centaur on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two\" Peter mumbled, doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay uh just, uh, just a second!\" Eugene sputtered and he quickly typed the information into the game's keyboard. With Judy's Medusa entered, Eugene typed in START and then pressed ENTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGINNING QUEST OF THE TITANS. ALL PLAYERS ASSUME STARTING POSITIONS. DISPENSING DICE\" The game intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, my stomach hurts!\" Lindsey cried out suddenly, rolling off her beanbag, hands clutching her abdomen. Her numerous bands of jewelry creaking as her arms began to swell and change color, as if she was having an allergic reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey!\" Eugene shouted, but suddenly he felt hot. Really hot. he was instantly soaked in sweat as his breaths turned heavy and fast as the world suddenly became hyper-defined and over saturated with color. The geek collapsed backwards into his chair and felt impossibly heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I, Did-did someone spike my...drink?\" Peter said woozily as the world began swimming. He...he didn't do drugs they...drug tested players and...Peter's mind failed to finish it's train of thought as he toppled sideways on the couch and passed out, long strands of black hair falling across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Judy, a splitting migraine suddenly filled her skull, as did the intense urge to vomit. She stood and lurched towards the bathroom...Only to find her legs tripping over each other as she fell to the floor with a heavy, hissing thud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene was, literally, paralyzed. His body throbbed with what felt like electricity as he lay frozen and sprawled across the suddenly tiny feeling lounge chair. He could what felt like boulder sized droplets of sweat boiling up out of his skin and soaking every single article of clothing he wore as they hung heavily of of him, but there was nothing he could do. All he could do was stare up at the flourescent bulbs on the ceiling of the common room as their buzzing and off-white colors continued to intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he having a stroke? Did the machine explode and electrocute him? What was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the ringing, the buzzing stopped and the colors of the room returned to normal. And then a loud creaking noise filled his ears as the lounge chair burst apart and dropping him suddenly, and painfully, to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Eugene cried out, and was immensely relieved at the face he could talk and move again, pulling himself upright. He wiped his face and then froze as a giant, gloriously golden-browned tanned wall of flesh with fingers attached flew at his face. But when he froze, so did the giant hand. \"Wait, what?\" And that was when he noticed the deepness of his voice now, the thunderous rumble a far cry from his normally reedy, nasally tones. Strands of brown hair slid into his vision, and he cautiously raised what was obviously his had up to feel a mane of hair that was clearly NOT the short ear-length hairdo he preferred. He stared at the hair for a moment and then followed the alien hand down an arm that looked as if he'd spent a lifetime lifting impossibly huge weights. And he had TWO of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he looked down, and was greeted by a body that looked as if it had been expertly chiseled out of stone and laid bare to the world. Gone was his t-shirt, he was naked from the top down to his barely covered groin, with swollen, muscled pecks that topped what felt like an endless column of rippling abs that ran all the way down to twin trunks of legs that were swollen with powerful, tightly bound muscles. A loincloth covered his groin, made out of some kind of scaled and tanned leather...And he was absolutely sure about what was between his legs didn't belong to him. It was definitely NOT as huge as it currently felt, cradled in what felt like animal fur? Eugene was afraid to look and instead examined the elaborate laced sandals that wrapped his slab-like feet and ran up most of his shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been transformed! But..How? And why? Did the game do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, look at me!\" Eugene rumbled, but his eyes went wide and his jaw went slack as he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch across from him lay a stunning brunette woman, easily the prettiest he'd ever seen. Her angular features were still, her long-lidded eyes closed and her puffy red lips parted as she breathed slowly in and out, he large breasts rising as falling beneath the white toga that draped her frame. Long slender legs spilled from the bottom of the toga and ended in tiny feet that were wrapped in similar, if smaller sandals to Eugene's own, and two womanly arms hung limp and were decked in large bronze bracelets, one of which was attached to a heavy chain that spooled off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\" Eugene gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my stomach!\" A voice almost deeper than his own complained next to him, and Eugene's he snapped towards the source, his eyes practically exploding as he saw a MASSIVE creature, half-horse, half body-builder human struggle to sit up. Four powerful legs kicked slowly and a hairy tail thumped against the floor while the bearded, wild haired man-half groaned...And then froze in shock as red eyes snapped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH. MY. GAWD!\" The man roared in terror, \"I'M A DUDE HORSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey!?\" Eugene gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!?\" The centaur that was obviously his friend and current crush screamed, her legs kicking wildly and knocking the table across the room, the game machine clattering noisily as it threatened to tumble over the approaching table edge. Strangely enough though, the four tiny figurines and the similarly colored dice did not move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! It's me Linds! It's...It's Eugene!\" The geek scrambled to his feet and suddenly realized he TOWERED over everything. Before he'd been a fairly normal 5 foot 6 inches but now...He was WELL over 6 feet tall. \"Woah...\" He whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EUGENE!? LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED!?\" The half-equine former female whined as Eugene held out a hand, and was surprised at the powerful grip of the rough, leather hand that grabbed at it. \"Like, help me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene tensed his muscles and pulled against Lindsey's manly hand, silently lamenting the fact that this was the first time he'd held her hand and it had to be with her as a horse-monster. A MALE horse-monster. But he had no time to contemplate or complain, Lindsey's massive body came flying up at him as he clearly over-compensated his new strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEK!\" Lindsey bellowed as she FLEW across the common room, Eugene letting go of her hand in shock as she sailed into the kitchen area and crashed to a halt against the refridgerator, practically crumpling it in half. There was a moment of shocked silence before she stumbled to all fours and grabbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooww!\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jesus, I'm sorry!\" Eugene cried, but as he attempted to go help, a feminine grunt came from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, who...who spiked my drink? Ugh did I get sick or something, why does my...voice\" The woman on the couch said, her accented voice groggy as she pushed herself upright before freezing in place, staring down at her chest as her eyes widened in horror. \"HOLY SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\" Eugene said, caught between helping Lindsey and a sudden urge to help the former beefcake jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?\" The woman screamed as she scrambled across the couch, tripping over herself and as the chain drew taut, was pulled backwards with a screech. Eugene looked at the object that had weighed her down and blinked. It was...a rock? Or maybe a large pot? It was roughly cone shaped and was decorated head to toe in elaborate carvings. He couldn't read the words but the images certainly looked like greek things he'd seen on Wikipedia and in video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eugene!\" The newly giant teen explained to the shocked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Lindsey!\" The centaur wailed as she trotted back to the common room before stopping her tracks. \"OHMYGAWD THERE'S SOMETHING HANGING OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey flailed and twisted, trying her best to look under her hairy new body, but Peter and Eugene's eyes zeroed in on what it was: There, like a tank rifle and a pair of oil drums, was a large penis and balls dangling for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Linds?\" Eugene said, wondering if his new body had a package that large, \"You, uh, you're a guy now so, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG OMG OMG OHMUHGAWD!\" She roared and began prancing around bucking, which did NOT h elp matters. 'GET IT OFF! I WANNA TURN BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we can't!\" Came a oddly distorted voice from behind the couch. Lindsey stopped her wild bucking and clopped to a stop, her new manhood swinging wildly as she, Eugene and, after a moment, Peter looked around for it's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guysss heard Eugene, we have to finisssh the game before we can change back!\" The voice said with a soft hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Wait, Judy!\" Peter gasped and looked over the back of the couch, \"OH FUCK!\" He screamed again and tumbled backwards, landing on the floor of the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don-don't look at me! I'm a...I'm a gorgon!\" Judy wailed from behind the upholstery, \"If I look at you I'll turn you to ssstone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rustle and multitude of smaller, quieter hisses as scaly green shoulders rose above the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Eugene mumbled in shock as the head that followed was a twisting next of angry looking vipers who coiled and twisted and slithered back and forth. Long, similarly scaled arms were raised, elongated talon topped hands covering the entirety of Judy's new face as she slowly turned, revealing her reptillian new form. Her torso was a soft tan, the scales longer and more sequential and they flowed over a pair of modest breasts that were cupped in a silver and leather breastplate...And that was all she wore. A huge tail coiled and rose above the top of the couch as Judy rose high and higher, rising to ye level with Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all...mythological beingsss. The game changed usss. I'm a gorgon, Lindsssey isss a centaur, Eugene you're sssome kind of demigod, obviousssly and Peter...Oh Peter, I'm sssorry!\" Judy said as she bobbed and curled around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Did YOU dod this Judy?\" Peter said, rising unsteadily to his new feet and wobbling as his new curves jiggled, \"I...YOU SAID I WAS GONNA BE A MACE GUY! I'M A CHICK! AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ROCK!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sssorry! I wasss upssset! You're an oracle! The Pythia! You can sssee the future! The rock isss the Omphalosss Ssstone! It givesss you the visssionsss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, how can you, like, see us if you're covering your face?\" Lindsey asked with a involuntary clop of a hoof on the kitchen tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'sss the sssnakes! I can sssee out of them! It'sss asss weird for me asss it isss for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TURN ONE START. ALL PLAYERS MAY ROLL.\" The game announced from it's new spot in the corner. All four pairs of eyes (or at least three pairs and a multitude of small heads). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Guess We better start playing\" Eugene said, walking over and grabbing the small blue cube that rested next to the figurine he now macro-embodied.</span></div></div>",

It was so light (or perhaps h was just so strong) that he didn't even feel what little weight it would have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene! Be careful!\" Lindsey said, chewing on a rather blunt and dirty looking nail, her red eyes filled with worry. Judy simply bobbed up and down on her massive tail, head still in her hands and all the tiny eyes of the vipers staring at him. Peter wrung his tiny hands and kept glancing back and forth between Eugene and the canyon of cleavage that now hung from his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's...there's no skill involved right? Well, here goes...\" Eugene said, sucking in a breath and holding it as he tilted his hand sideways and watched as the blue cube seemed to fall in slow motion down towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dice clacked against the table and bounced along it's surface before spinning to a stop, revealing four white circles facing upwards towards the ceiling. Eugene let out the breath he had been holding, only to suck in a lungful of new air as he watched, in amazement, as his figurine moved four spaces on it's own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Guys, did...Did you see that?\" Eugene said, pointing a finger at the figure as it slid across the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it just move by itself?\" Peter said, taking a few steps forward before being stopped by the rock, pulling at the chain with a annoyed girly grunt as the Omphalos Stone slid forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It totally did! OMG!\" Lindsey said as she moved on all fours out of the kitchen and into the main common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you land on one of thossse sssquaressss, Eugene?\" Judy said as she slithered carefully around the couch. Her new form was MASSIVE, even longer than Lindsey AND Eugene were now tall. The newly empowered teen shuddered involuntarily as he watched the former goth uncoil before watching the tiny blue miniature come to a stop on the final square which had the words 'Action Square' typed upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION SQUARE: YOU FIND YOUR PATH AHEAD OBSCURED. CONSULT AN ORACLE FOR GUIDANCE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to face Peter, who blinked in confusion. \"What?\" He said dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby...You gotta give Eugene guidance. That'sss what an Oracle doesss...\" Judy hissed softly, slithering around to her now much smaller boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how, uh, how do I do that?\" Peter said, nervously eyeing Judy's new body and shying away from the hissing vipers that now made up Judy's hair. He took a step backwards and Judy flinched, stopping in her trac-well, slither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Judy mumbled, arching backwards away from Peter, clearly hurt by his reaction, \"Well, uh, you have to look into the Omphalosss Ssstone and breath deep itsss myssstical vaporsss. That'sss how it worksss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Peter said is disbelief, looking at Judy and then at the decorated stone that he was chained to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think you, like, have to get high, Peter!\" Lindsey offered, but was then distracted as one of her hooves clacked against something shiny. She looked down and cried out, \"Oh! Oh no, not my Lake Reno bracelets! I got those with Bethany in high school!\" She pouted, awkwardly lowering herself down to scoop the fragments of metal up in her own large hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, these oracles were just pot-heads? I thought they were like demigods?\" Peter asked, bending down to peer into the opening at the top of the cone-shaped rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda? The sssmoke wasss sssupposssed t come from the godsss...\" Judy said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do I light it? Do I use it like a bong or something?\" Peter looked the rock over and found four additional openings opposite of each other on the sides of the artifact, but he couldn't see anything on the inside, just darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh...\" Judy couldn't help but let loose a snarled chuckle, \"Oraclesss often danced to gain the godsss attention, and then the godsss would allow the ssstone to work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" Peter deadpanned, staring up at his former goth beauty with a blank face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta dance! Ssshake that thing, girl!\" Judy said as she double coiled over in a hissing fit of laughter. Even the snakes on her head seemed to take on a jovial appearance as they bobbed up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't dance! I'm...I'm a football player not a ballerina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, um, kinda look like a stripper now though\" Lindsey joked, looking up from a VERY concentrated effort to get her broken jewelry back on her hairy arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up you bimbo!\" Peter pouted, crossing his arms as best he could in front of his new assets. \"Ugh, how do you chicks do ANYTHING with these!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here honey, let me-\" Judy said, lowering herself down and sliding her hands off her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUDY DON'T!\" Eugene cried out, and her turned away as Judy's newly uncovered eyes turned towards him, flashing a sickly green-gold before she cried out and covered her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod! Eugene, Peter I...I'm sssory! I wasssn't thinking! Are you guysss okay!?\" Judy curled in on herself, the snakes darting back and forth between the shaken oracle and the hiding geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're fine, uh, fine. We're gonna need to fix that though, we can do this if you can't look at us\" Eugene said, letting out a sigh of relief. He looked around and after a moment of thought, grabbed one of the two destroyed lounge chairs and stripped the fabric from them, fashioning a crude blindfold. He walked over towards Judy's cowering form and slowly brought his hands close to the intently staring nest of snakes. After a very tense moments of shifting hands, claws and scales around, Judy was now fitted with a dull blue band of upholstery, blocking her deadly gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Eugene!\" Judy said as she patted her face, which was actually still quite attractive now that Eugene could see it. It wasn't really all that bad to look at save for the instant death part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, um, now what?\" Lindsey grunted as she dropped her ruined bracelets back to the floor, \"Those were my favorite ones...\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, I guess you gotta do a dance or something Peter. Rules say we can't roll again until we do what the game wants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is complete bullshit! Like what kind of dance am I supposed to do?\" Peter stamped a sandaled foot in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...Oh, what about Wrecking Ball!\" Lindsey offered, a large grin on her rugged face, showing off a myriad of teeth that were in dire need of a trip to the dentist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT twerking!\" Peter hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jussst do sssomething Peter. There are no godsss ssso we jussst have to pleassse the game\" Judy groaned, \"The quicker thisss isss over the quicker we go back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then...Uh\" Peter looked around and took a deep breath before he...</span></div></div>",

Her snakes drooped in clear reptile disappointment. \u201cYou decssssided to do the Hokey-Pokey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShu\u2026. Shut up.\u201d puffed Peter in the midst of shaking his leg all about. He tried to turn himself around, but the weight of the stone was too much for his reedy arms. he dropped the stone with an ugly <i>CRACK</i>, and fell back on the couch, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe floor!\u201d cried Judy. Her lithe snake body glissaded across the room to the Omphalos and the circle-shaped indent it was resting in. \u201cThe RA\u2019sssss gonna <i>kill</i> ussssss, Pete!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026. put a rug over it\u2026 Jude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr we could totally wish for a new one!\u201d Lindsey rumbled, goofy grin spread across her chapped lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wheezed and extended a dainty middle finger at the horse-man-girl, whose responding laugh sounded an awful lot like a whicker. He slumped onto the couch, chest heaving from the apparently unaccustomed effort of doing <i>anything</i> it seemed, a pool of black hair spilling onto the cushion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, uh, alright there, Pete?\u201d ventured Eugene, reaching a hand out towards his friend before thinking better of it, despite some quiet, remote urge <i>insisting</i> that he do. He never was a touchy-feely kinda guy and with these big hands and Peter\u2019s new\u2026 everything, helping him out seemed like a danger-fraught idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had less qualms about Pete\u2019s new smooth bits and wiggled over quickly, gently stroking his forehead with a taloned hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe massaged her throat to soften the natural growl of her voice. \u201cAre you okay, babe?\u201d she rasp-cooed as best she could. Peter nodded, his half-lidded eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene smiled absentmindedly at them. It was sweet to see how much the two cared for one another. Still, that little voice in the back of his head said that this was <i>wrong</i>, that such a wretched <i>monster</i> shouldn\u2019t be anywhere <i>near</i> such a delicate and helpless damse\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene pinched the bridge of his nose, <i>hard</i>. Damn intrusive thoughts. Must be all this testosterone and muscles or whatever. Man, Peter had to have some serious fortitude to be a nice guy with all of <i>this</i> against him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene was pondering the pitfalls of his physique, Lindsey had lifted the Omphalos to Peter\u2019s face at his behest. He furiously sniffed at it, face alternating between sultry concentration and smoky disgust, full lips almost always drawn up in a bow of consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells like <i>rock</i>,\u201d he whined in between sniffs. \u201cThis is the shittiest superpower <i>ever</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could see Judy\u2019s brow underneath the azure cloth, but if her practically-spitting snakes were anything to go by, she wasn\u2019t pleased with her prophet-boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ssssss not a ssssuperpower,\u201d she explained, voice edged with strained patience. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessssssssing of Apollo. You\u2019re a vehicle for the word of the <i>godssssss</i>, Petey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had given up on huffing rock-gas and had purloined a couch cushion instead, sulkily hugging the pillow in front of his chest-pillows. \u201cSo what, I\u2019m supposed to make this pervert Apollo-dude <i>horny</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ssss not\u2026\u201d started the gorgon, before bringing a grimy yellow nail to her lips. \u201cActually, that might work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was <i>kidding,</i> Jude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know some good moves!\u201d Lindsey piped up \u201cBody roll, th\u2019 belly dance, and\u2026\u201d She turned her fiery gaze downwards at her abbreviated torso. \u201c... I prob\u2019ly can\u2019t teach you any of \u2018em now, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene kept a polite distance from the conversation. Peter didn\u2019t seem in the mood to take any male-advice right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, meanwhile, was lifting her petite boyfriend up by his armpits, his tiny feet pinwheeling out from under his toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLe<i>ggo</i>!\u201d he moaned. A stray foot caught Tudy right in the scaled ribcage, and Peter balked. \u201cOhmigodareyoualrightbabe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, who didn't even flinch at the accidental kick, gained a predatory-in-two-senses curve to her lips. \u201cPeter.\u201d Her snakes moved closer to her boyfriend\u2019s face, but she flicked them back with a toss of her head. The oracle flinched. \u201cRight now, honey, I\u2019m a sssssssssnake-lady that killsssssss anything ssssshe looksssss at. If you\u2019re a good boyfriend \u2014 <i>and I know you are</i> \u2014 you\u2019ll wiggle your assssss for <i>five sssseeecondsssss</i> so I can be <b>normal</b> again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded numbly, and Judy returned him to the ground with a smile. Peter cleared his throat with a pitched cough, and, in an attempt to regain some male ego, leveled an imperious finger at Gene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> doing this in front of him, though.\u201d A brief flicker of remorse flickered over his face and he shrugged at the musclebound nerd. \u201cUh, sorry, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Lindsey\u2019s mouths opened to protest the <i>obviously</i> unfair treatment, but Eugene was already walking around a corner, hands raised in mock surrender. \u201cAll good, man.\u201d he cried over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll good.\u201d he mumbled after safely out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the next five minutes trying to convince the weird intrusive voice that things <i>were</i> all good, that the <i>right</i> it was insisting that he had to march in there and guide the nubile Oracle\u2019s movements himself really didn\u2019t exist and plus that might ruin their friendship and oh yeah Peter was a <i><b>GUY</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sibilant instructive hisses coming from Judy and Peter\u2019s sullen moans didn\u2019t help much in that department, and only really exacerbated his brain-horniness. Fortunately, the baritone giggles and didactic tittering from Lindsey made it so the massive thing in his loincloth didn\u2019t actually move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK?!\u201d came a soprano screech from the commons, and Eugene leaped to his feet and rushed to the noise, hand jumping towards where a scabbarded sword would hang (if he'd had one, as the game had failed to provide weapons or objects outside of that weird stone when it changed all their clothes and bodies).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 to see Peter in what appeared to be mid-hip-shimmy, hands raised Shakira-style in the air, the fulsome flesh of one cheek outlined by the white cloth of the toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>second</i> thing he noticed, and the thing that everyone seemed to be reacting to, was the clouds of blue smoke billowing out of the grounded Omphalos. Both Judy and Lindsey were slithering and backing away respectively, and Peter was testing the limits of the chain in an attempt to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Peter?!\u201d boomed Eugene, stepping towards the frightened brunette, but a cry from Judy stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ethylene gasssssss, Gene! You\u2019ll passssss out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud rose to cover the aghast Peter, \u201cThen why -<i>kaff</i>- am <b>I</b> -<i>cough</i>- good in\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence fell over the commons that no one dared to break. The quiet hiss of gas and Judy\u2019s snakes were the background noise to the loud thumping of everyone\u2019s hearts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA footstep sounded from the cloud. Then another. And another, until Peter emerged from the smoke, eyes half-lidded, secret smile on his face and hips pivoting wildly with each catwalk strut towards Eugene. The Omphalos was tucked underneath his left arm with no visible difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Pete?\u201d half-laughed Eugene as he took a nervous step backwards, but Peter\u2019s languid gait only lengthened its stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeero,\u201d breathed what might be Peter, in an accent that was far thicker and steamier than a few minutes ago. He was upsettingly close to Gene, enough that he could feel the erstwhile-beefcake\u2019s breath on his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Brave, <b>strong</b></i> hero.\u201d hummed the oracle, who absentmindedly traced a finger around the square bulk of one of Gene\u2019s pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Hey.</b>\u201d growled Judy possessively, dragging herself forward before Lindsey\u2019s thick arm impeded her path. Contrite at her near-gaffe, the gorgon folded her arms and slumped back on her coils, the angry flick of her tail betraying her true thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was looking dead forward, eyes rolled up towards the ceiling, not wanting to piss off Peter when <i>hopefully</i> he turned back to normal. His breath was hitched in his chest, as if its release would spell the start of a <i>very</i> bad decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter drew in a breath, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter took a deep breath, his bountiful boobs swelling just enough to brush against Eugene's lower torso, a slender arm outstretched towards his face and Eugene felt something massive twitch within the primitive pants he wore as he chanced a look down at the oracle. Peter was wreathed in the blue gas as it curled lazily from the Omphalos, pooling down around his tiny feet and drifting lazily along his arms and between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's tiny hand reached up and jut barely reached Eugene's towering chin, pulling his head gently but forcefully down to stare into the oracle's big brown eyes. The blue gas curled along Peter's fingers and drifted across Eugene's chiseled face as tendrils entered his new nostrils. Just a whiff of it made Eugene's head swim. He reached out and set a hand on Peter's wide hips to keep himself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh brave, strong, <b>HANDSOME</b> hero, born again no longer a zero\"</i> Peter intoned,<i> \"Strength you desire of body and mind, you seek to leave all weakness behind. Your path ahead is fraught with peril, your group should find some new apparel. The first object that you hold, will help you be fierce and bold.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's head was submerged in thicker bands of the blue gas and he closed his eyes as he wobbled on his feet, pulling Peter closer for...support. The two of them began to sway as if moving to some unheard music. Someone said something off to the side but Eugene couldn't tell who it was or what they said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Long shall be your current quest, there will be time of much needed rest. At touch of night, on turn of three, with great haste come back to me\"</i> And then to EVERYONE'S surprise, Peter lurched up, grabbing Eugene by the back of the neck and pulling him down into a startled (and deep) kiss, his free hand slid down Eugene's chest, a soft palm dancing lightly along the bulge that was pressing against the leather and fur loincloth...And then with a soft breeze from an unknown source, the blue clouds retreated swiftly back into the interior of the Omphalos, and Eugene opened his eyes. Instead of a pair of dreamy, sparkling brown pools instead there were two brown pinpricks amid a sea of terrified white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips parted with an audible pop. And then the screaming began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK FUCK FUCK GROSS FUCK SHIT WHAT THE FUCK!?\" Peter screamed, dropping the prophetic gas device to the floor again as he violently shoved against Eugene, the giant geek not moving as Peter flopped backwards with a girlish 'EEK!' as his boobs threatened to smother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\" Judy hissed in alarm, uncoiling and sliding against the tile, curling up around the feminine form of her boyfriend, who was currently spitting and blowing raspberries as if to banish the taste of his friend from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HATE THIS GAME! WHY'D YOU DO THIS TO ME JUDY!?\" Peter sniffled as watery tears formed in his wide brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sssaid I wasss sssorry!\" The scaled goth whined, reaching out to grab the stricken young adult in a tight embrace, her tail coiling around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! LET ME GO!\" The reluctant priestess squirmed against his girlfriend but given how small and weak his body was, and how Judy was now basically one giant muscle, it was a futile effort. He glared daggers past the vipers that were flicking their tongues across his closest cheek and smearing salty eye-water across his face. \"HOW COULD YOU!?\" He said, pointing a twig-like finger at Eugene's dumbfounded, if hunky, form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, dude I...I didn't-It was the gas!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE! JUDY STOP I CAN'T BREATHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon had steadily been coiling tighter and tighter around her beloved, not just out of comfort because it had felt...right? She blinked behind her haphazard blindfold and relaxed as Peter sucked in a huge gulp of air. Judy stared out of the multitude of snake eyes at him, growing more and more used to the 'double reflection' vision, like how it was when you closed one eye and possibly stood on your head. He was so small now, so vulnerable and confused. She loved Peter, he could be a bit of an ass, especially about his former body but now she just wanted to hold him close and stare into his new womanly eyes....Forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt a taloned hand brush against her blindfold before she shook her head, her snakes hissing in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sssorry, babe. I'm jussst, I'm sssorry you had to do that! It'ssss okay, it'ssss just...It'ssss jussst the game. It doesssn't mean anything!\" She slithered about until she had mostly unraveled, her new bulk taking up a rather large portion of the common room, but still kept her arms wrapped protectively around Peter's tiny waist. A single strand of her snake hair reached out and stroked against Eugene's neck before a tiny hand smacked it away. Judy resisted the sudden urge to hiss and squeeze the tiny human in her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the guy that STOLE MY MUSCLES! What's next, is the game gonna make me fuck him or something?\" Peter pouted, still glaring at Eugene who gave an apologetic shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy figured it was probably best to not mention that most oracles, at least according to the greek legends, remained virgins, only stepping down from the role AFTER they had sex. She wasn't sure if any of them could handle that particular revelation...Or if t would cause Peter to get some crazy thought in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, what was that like Pete?\" Lindsey asked with a swat of her tail. The long hairs tickled as they whisked along her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bad! That's what it was like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's REAL descriptive, totally the answer I wanted\" Lindsey crossed her bulging arms and her thick lips turned into a frown. She snorted like a horse and tapping a hoof on the tile impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene was pondering what the Oracle Peter had said. Seek new apparel? Did that mean armor or something? But all their clothes had changed...What if he went back to his room and put on a new shirt? And what was that about the next object he would hold? The geek looked down at the scattered debris from both his and Judy's lounge chairs, spying a splintered chair leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder...' He thought, bending over and reaching a hand out towards the ruined furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what the hell is it like for a girl having junk the size of my head, Lindsey!? Everything got all blue and shiny and it's like I HEARD the words before I said them and I was moving like a damn robot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally didn't look like a robot tho. But you were, like, acting like a such a slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter bristled at the insult but couldn't exactly deny it. His description of what had actually happened was a bit of a lie anyway. When the gas had taken hold it seemed liked nothing really mattered aside from getting close to Eugene, touching his muscles and telling him that...Fortune? Prophecy? Whatever it was, Peter had WANTED to do it. \"Well whatever. That's what it was like. I saw Geno reach over and grab part of one of those chairs like he's doing right now and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white light as Eugene's fingers curled around the tiny chair leg, it's ruined form gorwing large and heavy as it morphed into a large sword almost as long as Eugene was now tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG!\" Lindsey gasped. All of Judy's vipers curled away hissing from the light, and Peter simply stared at the magic scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was just like what I saw! Did...I really did see the future!' He thought as his jaw went slack. \"Dude...\" Was all that came out of his mouth, watching as the light shimmered and danced across Eugene's seemingly naturally oiled muscles. The buxom boyfriend didn't realize he was biting his lower lip as he stared at what had once been his little pipsqueak nerd friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light faded as Eugene slowly brought the sword above his head. It still shimmered with a magical light, but only along the edge of the blade. It had a comfortable weight, heavy yet balanced, and it made a soft whistling noise as he swung it in a lazy arc through the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool\" He muttered to no one but himself, not noticing Lindsey and Judy wincing with each swing. 'I wonder if putting on new clothes will give me armor?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION COMPLETE. CONTINUE TURN ONE\" The game buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, it'sss your turn\" Judy hissed softly, uncoiling her boyfriend's fragile female form towards the game, scooping up the Omphalos since outside his 'oracle' form, Peter seemed rather incapable of any physical exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Uhh...\" Peter mumbled, looking away from Eugene for the first time in several minutes, still not realizing he'd been biting his lip, and took a tiny step towards the game that had, for now at least, ruined his life.</span></div></div>",

Some mewling little woman that only seemed capable of doing anything when high as a kite of god-gas...Or whatever the hell it was that made him see the future and grope Eugene up and down. As they reached the table Peter cast a look over his shoulder and moved his waterfall of silky black hair out of the way to stare at his friend in worry. Now that he was only inches away from the clearly magical and VERY dangerous machine, it suddenly seemed a LOT safer over by Eugene. Especially with that sword and those muscles...And he wasn't quite comfortable with the fact that he was also inches from a snake-lady with instant death vision, even if she had been his girlfriend. Hell, it even looked safe with the burly, unclean centaur than where he was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete?\" Judy rasped softly, placing a large clawed hand on his barren shoulder, causing her boyfriend to shake in surprise. Or had it been a flinch? It was hard to tell anymore with the little human female. The strong confident male he'd been just a little while ago seemed to be gone and really it just made Peter look even smaller to her. Weaker. Feminine. Pretty. Like really pretty. Pretty like Judy USED to be. The vipers attached to her head began to hiss intermittingly but she silenced them with a somehwat violet shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, it'sss your turn\" Judy released Peter's shoulder and reached down towards the yellow die that was on the game map, grasping it between her talons and pulling...Only for it to not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" She said, casting a blindfolded look at her boyfriend before trying again, only to get the same result. The small yellow cube refused to move from it's place on the table. \"It's, uh, not moving guys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Here, maybe you just can't get a good grip with those terrible nails\" Peter said batting aside Judy's claws and plucking the dice off the table, \"See? Easy! So easy a WOMAN could do it!\" Peter said, sticking a soft red tongue out and then immediately regretting the annoyed look on most of Judy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's, um, part of the magic?\" Lindsey called out from behind them, \"Like how only Thor can use his hammer in the movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get it\" Judy said, turning towards her fellow monster and nodding, \"Sssort of a 'only THEY who be worthy can possssssesss the power of Thor' type sssituation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it is, I'm rolling\" Peter huffed, and dropped the dice back towards the table. It bounced and rolled and came to a stop, five black dots shining up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice\" Peter said with a grin that revealed his perfect white teeth. And then he gasped, \"GUYS ITS MOVING AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the small yellow plastic figure that was a gross misrepresentation of the body Peter now possessed was moving across the board, skipping the Action Square on the third tile and landing safely on a blank space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOO! I don't have to do anything!\" He cheered, giving a victory hop that he immediately regretted from all the things on him that now jiggled. He stumbled, but felt a scaly weight pressing up behind him. He looked and saw part of Judy's tail curled upwards, preventing him from another comical fall backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" He said dismissively, \"So, who's turn is it ne-\" Peter was eager to move back to the safe area over by Eugene when the music let out a tiny DING, and a blue card slid out of the mysterious machine. It was almost as if the machine was building these ports and interfaces the longer it was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what now!?\" He whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That mussst be a Challenge Card\" Judy said, reaching out and pulling it slowly from the previously unseen slot. She handed it to Peter because she obviously was having trouble looking at things right now. \"Here. Read it.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter took the card from Judy's green fingers, cleared his throat, and read what was printed on the card's surface in bold print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A priestess has no need to carry her own riches. Find five individuals among the masses to serve and carry your burdens. Upon task completion, you will be able to move one additional space per turn. Failure to complete challenge will result in moving one less space per roll.\" Peter flipped the card over and looked for any more text, but it was blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what does that mean?\" He asked, looking at Eugene for answers, who simply shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, um, it seems like you need to find five non-players and it'll give you a mobility boost so if you roll a three, you move four. Or if you don't do it, the next time you roll a five you'll only move four spaces. Or whatevs\" Lindsey said, clopping forward.\"I don't think it means us because we're players...So do we have to go out into town and find people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peter and I will be the only ones able to go out since you and Judy are, well, uh, monsters\" Eugene said, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! We're already gonna attract a shitload of attention with me looking like Conan and Peter looking like Gal Gadot. And Peter can't carry that rock he's chained to on his own! And what happens when we find five people? How do we convince them to just follow two random cosplayers back to the dorm?\" Eugene said, sliding the giant shining sword into the scabbard that had appeared around his loincloth's waist roughly around the moment the broken chair leg had transformed into a giant sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess you'll have to find out, unless you're good with not getting a movement bonus, Pete\" Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they could BOTH usss sssome fresssh air away from usss monssstersss\" Judy hissed in anger. She released her grip on the Omphalos and turned away from Peter, who, not expecting the weight, was pulled down to the floor with a girlish 'oof' as she slithered away and sat angrily on her coils away from the group. She should just show them who was the monster! One look at she'd be able too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she shook the notion off. After a few minutes of discussion, Eugene and Peter decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well if I can get an extra roll that means we can beat the game faster\" Peter said matter-of-factly, pulling himself up off the floor and brushing his white toga off with a couple of indignant swats at the fabric. He pulled at the gold chain connecting him to the Omphalos and began stomping towards the dorm's main doors...Only to get stuck walking in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH THIS STUPID ROCK!\" He screamed, turn around and giving it a petulant kick with his sandals, which only succeeded in nearly knocking him over again. There was a hissing cough from the corner as Judy began snickering, a yellow claw pointed at him mockingly. His full lips parts in anger as he was about to rattle off another insult to the hideous creature when Peter's line of sight was blocked by a wall of muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Pete. I'll carry it for you\" Eugene said as he lifted the Omphalos up with a single giant hand, palming it like Peter used to palm basketballs in the gym. The beefy geek effortless tucked the magical stone under his arms, the muscles flexing like well oiled machinery. Really well oiled. Peter closed his mouth and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks, Geno\" He said, feeling his face run hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's the least I can do. We'll never get anywhere if you can carry it, plus this is sort of all my fault\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is. Also, is anyone else really thirsty? Because I'm totally thirsty\" Lindsey quipped as she headed back towards the common room's kitchen, gently opening the ruined fridge and pulling out one of the crudely disguised six packs that the students had hid in a box of Coca-Cola cans. \"Really if you'd just stayed in we could be watching a bitchin' movie right now. Also pick us up some more beer while you're out? These are totally mine now\" The centaur pulled a can out of it's plastic ring and with dexterity that her new fingers shouldn't have had, popped open the top and began chugging it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash similar to how Eugene had gained a sword, the tiny can of beer shimmered and glowed, expanding outward until it was a massive urn held aloft in one hand by the sorority girl, rivulets of what looked and smelled like wine running down into her messy beard. Setting the urn down, the usually well mannered blonde let out a thunderous burp and looked down at the changed beverage in surprise before breaking out into a whickering chuckle. \"Uh, nevermind. Guess whatever we use now turns period appropriate! Man, this is really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Eugene just blinked as they watched their friend take another long, messy drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, let's walk. I don't want my truck turning into one of those horse carts\" Peter said, looking up at Eugene, who had a look of disgust on his face as he started at Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itsss called a chariot you bimbo\" Judy muttered quietly from her sulking corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I don't think I could fit in a normal car anyway right now. But yeah, let's get out of here and do this thing\" Without bidding the two former girls as much as a goodbye, Peter and Eugene hustled towards the door side by side. Peter opened the glass doors and moved through first as Eugene ducked as they exited out into the warm summer evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took a deep breath of fresh air as they stared out over the deserted campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Where do we find five people, and how do we convince them to just follow us back here?\" The towering titan wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what we should do first, we should go to the mall and get that chick at the store to fix this!\" Peter said, pointing a nail in the direction of the shopping center. \"Tell her to give you your money back and end the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't\" Eugene replied with a shake of his head, his brown, Fabio-like hair flowing in the soft breeze, \"It's after 5. The mall closed twenty minutes ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods damnit!\" Peter kicked a small rock with his sandal, \"Well, we could always try the off-campus frats? I know that Psi Iota Mu Phi Sigma still has some guys staying there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good a place as any to start, I guess\" Eugene shifted the Omphalos under his arm and then took off walking, long strides almost jerking Peter along before the currently athletically incapable jock whined, slowing their pace to a much more manageable stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Jeremy is gonna say when I show up looking like this, though. Dude's a bit of a horn dog\" Peter wondered out loud as he trailed behind Eugene, his eyes absent mindedly settling on the rear of the loincloth, the shifting gluteous muscles pulling the raven haired former man into an almost hypnotic trance. It was a nice distraction from his own jiggling, bouncing bits and Peter off-hand began thinking about stealing a bra from Judy's dresser. Not like that scaly, flat and currently-acting-like-a-bitch bitch needed one anymore with that tacky metal breast plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I don't think he'd try anything with me standing there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I really appreciate it...Even if this is, like, your fault\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm sorry. Hey, you, uh, wanna talk about what happened?\" Eugene cast a look over his shoulder to look at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. OH! No. Absolutely not. we're never going to talk about any of this again! And if you do I'll kick your ass. Or something!\" Peter blinked rapidly and shook his head, sending his long black mane of hair flying as he pulled himself out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Fair enough\" Eugene chuckled. All things considered it hadn't been TOO awful. For a moment after the game had started he'd half expected to have to fight his friends or some cyclops or something would have come charging out of the game. So far, outside of the transformations, it really hadn't been all that terrible. Definitely not 'full of peril' like the oracle next to him had decreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked for a few more minutes in silence, the jingling of Peter's chain the only real sound outside the normal late afternoon ambiance of the town. Even in lock-down there was still the distant roar of traffic as the world continued to spin beyond the otherwise closed college campus. It was pretty peaceful, even if the high desert breeze felt a little chilly on Eugene's bare chest. But that peace was broken as they rounded the corner or the Sciences building and ran smack dab into campus security. Specifically Perry Logan, the security guard who thought of himself as the World's Best Cop but was very much the opposite in almost every way. The man was short tempered and had trouble hiding his dislike of individuals that were not American. He typically only worked during the day when classes were in session, but with half the campus security leaving for lockdown, the ugly man had chosen to work a double shift for more pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, its Officer Friendly\" Peter groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balding, middle-aged man had just been starting his smoke break when two had appeared. Some Kevin Sobro-lookalike and some chick that wasn't wearing enough clothes. He made it a point to know most of the 'characters' on campus, and he didn't recognize these two at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' tourists\" He muttered as he threw his cigarette to the pavement and rested a hand on the tazer strapped to his hip. \"Folks, hate to interrupt your...evening stroll but this campus is closed. Authorized personnel only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked up at Eugene, who had a look of confusion on his handsome face, \"Uh, you catch that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh. Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry rolled his eyes. \"Great, just great. Listen, I don't know what the hell you're saying, but in AMERICA. WE. SPEAK. ENGLISH.\" The security guard said loudly and slowly, and let out a sneer of frustrated disgust. Why did he always have to deal with the weird people? FOREIGN weird people? He rubbed his thick moustache for a second and then pantomimed at the nearly naked dude and his (admittingly fucking hot) girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU. LEAVE. BEFORE I. ZAP\" Perry pointed at his taser and then pointed at Eugene and Peter again, before making a shooing motion. After another moment of confused gibberish, Perry just shook his head. He couldn't ACTUALLY zap them, not unless they attacked him first, so maybe a little physical encouragement would help speed things along so he could get back to his smoke break. HE stomped forward and grabbed hold of the pretty girl's forearm and began pulling her towards the street. The girl had shouted something in surprise while the big man yelled, clearly angry...Perry unclasped his taser and spun around to point it at the big man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then Peri blinked, letting go of her mistress's arm, gasping in horror at daring to touch the Pythia without permission. She collapsed to her bare knees, silken fabric swirling in the breeze as she settled to the rough pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MISTRESS, FORGIVE ME! I knew not what I was doing! I am forever your faithful servant, please, tell this worthless handmaiden what she must do to earn the forgiveness of the gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter and Eugene looked at each other in shock. In the span of a moment they had just seen the pushy security morph just as the chair leg had. Just as Lindsey's beer had. The overweight man's body had shimmered as it slimmed dramatically, his hips flaring out, breasts emrging as his guard uniform shrank and shifted into a revealing toga similar to Peter's. A balding pate had exploded with soft brown hair, and a veil had settled over a definitively face. And the security guard's rough smoker voice was replaced by a soft girlish one, and speaking in a language that the two could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what the ACTUAL fuck!?\" The two transformed students yelled at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Eugene, making sure to keep the Omphalos chain loose by extending his arm, took a step away and Peter felt an unexpected stab of pain in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt <i>bad</i> to have Gene be repulsed by him, to have his rippling, impressive bulk out of arm\u2019s reach. He opened his mouth to say something to the bronzed demigod, to maybe bridge the gap that had developed between them ever so quickly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he shut the fuck up when he saw what Geno was actually doing. An electric blue flower, the exact color of the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Zeus-device</span> Taser, had fluttered to the floor alongside the prostrating\u2026 luggage-girl that the dickhead security guard was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Pete,\u201d breathed Eugene. \u201cThat was\u2026 weird. But, uh, impressive! I didn\u2019t, um, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019ll be fine if you touch <i>me</i>, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter dumbly nodded. \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019ll be good. We, uh brushed against each other when we left the door, \u2018member?\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely sure if it was a lie or not, but the thought of <i>never touching Gene again </i>felt... <b>bad</b>.  \u201cPlus, I, uh touched Jude too. After the card-thing.\u201d <i>That</i> he was sure of. He couldn\u2019t possibly forget having her slimy, disgusting coils all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Cool.\u201d Eugene sidled back to arm\u2019s-reach-distance, and Peter felt <i>secure</i> again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attention was once again turned to the feminized form of their resident Sgt. Dickhead, whose veiled forehead was still practically scraping the pavement in her extended bow. Peter would <i>never</i> admit it, but having a superpower that didn\u2019t result in him draping himself over the sturdy, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">handsome</span> form of Gene was pretty badass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the new-girl\u2019s tits were smaller than his! Just like a handmaiden should be, less beautiful than their Mist\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peter scowled and pinched his arm to dispel any sense of possession or pride related to his burdensome funbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, think you need to tell her to do something.\u201d mumbled Eugene, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cAnd he was speaking, like, some other language, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit, yeah,\u201d Peter waved a hand at the prone form of the\u2026 what should he call her? Or him? \u201cYou may rise, girl.\u201d he commanded, waving an arm imperiously. \u201cThere are, uh, things to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stifled a chuckle. \u201cYou, uhm, started strong, but the finish was \u2014.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut <b>up</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Peter\u2019s quiet awe, the girl-cop seemed to lower herself <i>further</i> into her apology-bow. \u201cYou are too kind, Mistress, but <i>please</i>, you musn\u2019t restrain yourself. Shall I partake in a round of self-flagellation \u2014\u201d Peter looked questioningly at Eugene, who mimed whipping himself \u2014 \u201c\u2014 alk over burning coals?\u201d She crawled towards Peter\u2019s sandalled feet. \u201c<i>Please</i>, Mistress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter blinked. People didn\u2019t normally ask him for advice, or commands, or the minutiae or methods of harming themselves. But \u2014 besides the last one \u2014 this felt pretty alright. People <i>should</i> listen to him. Still, he had to rein this masochist in a bit. He didn\u2019t want her to throw herself off a cliff before she could give him the movement bonus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, or at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your penance, um, feeble\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeri, mistress, but there\u2019s no need for you to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your penance, Peri, you must\u2026\u201d Peter put a nail on his lip, miming deep thought. \u201cRub your stomach and pat your head! <i>Simultaneously!</i> <b><i>For ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY seconds</i></b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, I \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT IS WHAT THE GODS WILL!\u201d Peter thundered. Or rather, yell-squeaked. The little stomp he gave to cement his authority didn\u2019t really feel stompy or authoritative, too. Just jiggly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silken robe of \u2018Peri\u2019 swirled as she rose from her bow. Her veil shifted rippled with every pat of her head, sniffles of gratitude slowly graduating to full-on joyful crying, which made the tummy-patting a bit awkward to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene coughed. Peter shifted from foot to foot. Both tried not to look at the girl sobbing happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh, we gonna go through with this?\u201d Eugene said, shifting the Omphalos from hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Yeah.\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like this is gonna last forever. Plus, Psi Iota has some real dickheads. Gonna go in there like Rambo with girl-guns.\u201d He shot finger guns at the distant frat house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene weighed the morality of turning some frat bros into weepy handmaidens versus the benefits of winning the game, plus the weird part of his brain that said that more soft, small damsels around was a big plus no matter which way you looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d shrugged the nerd. The latter side won out. <i>Hard</i>. \u201cHey, do you think we\u2019re, uh, talking differently?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard Perry before he went all\u2026 this.\u201d A large hand was waved at the mid-penance-sobbing maiden. \u201cEither we have, like, dysphasia or our Broca\u2019s area got blasted by the board game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rubbed his eyes and leveled a sour look at Eugene. \u201cYou goddamn nerd.\u201d He waved a pale hand at the heroic dork. \u201cC\u2019mere. I\u2019ll\u2026 say stuff, and you try to see if my lips are, I dunno, pulling bullshit or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene complied, and sidled up two feet away from the oracle. Suddenly, the two were acutely aware of how close they were to the other, and that, frankly, both were paragons of their respective gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright.\u201d mumbled Peter. He stood on his tiptoes and swayed vaguely towards \u2018Gene\u2019s bronzed bulk. God, he was tall. \u201cLet\u2019s do this. \u2018Ba-na-na.\u2019 \u2018Kum-quat.\u2019 \u2018Wa-ter-melon.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene probably would have made a snide comment about how Peter\u2019s mind was always on food if he wasn\u2019t absolutely and utterly entranced. Everything about Peter was thrown into sharp relief: his long ringlets of dark hair; the immaculate pink skin of his full lips; the way that he could practically see down his toga \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY MISTRESS?!\u201d rung out through the warm air, breaking the two out of their shared reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to face the frankly furious Peri, who minced over to stand between the two, extending her arms to protect the befuddled Pythia behind her, and setting an expression on her face that seemed like it was <i>supposed</i> to be threatening, but, ultimately made her look more like an angry Chihuahua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow <i>dare</i> you approach her without cleansing yourself, how <i>dare</i> you gaze upon her unveiled \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, Gene, that\u2019s a rookie mistake,\u201d teased Peter who was rather enjoying the sight of someone else getting the third degree for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene would have responded with a pithy remark, but he was pretty sure that the former mallcop would probably try to kill him if he did so.

They did <i>not</i> need another two-minute apology session. \u201cNo hard feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri tilted her head at the unfamiliar idiom, but otherwise got the message. She curtsied to Eugene \u2014 who wasn\u2019t entirely sure if that was period-appropriate \u2014 and turned to Peter eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I divest you of any burdens, Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter scratched the back of his neck. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I have right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s this.\u201d Eugene waved the Omphalos around with a cheeky grin and set it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Pythia shot a pointed look at the Herculean geek. \u201cDude, she might hurt herself, don\u2019t be a \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handmaiden hoisted the Omphalos into her arms with a soft \u2018Oof\u2019, cradling it like it was her baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014dick.\u201d finished Peter, sullen pout on his face. \u201cHow come <i>everyone else but me</i> can lift that thing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could carry <i>any</i> burden for my Mistress!\u201d proudly announced the handmaiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Eugene said, trying to pull Peter out of his fourth weakness-realization funk that day. \u201cJudy might have swallowed Lindsey whole by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter laughed nervously at the joke before setting out.

Easy enough that his gaze would wander over to his sculpted pecs, impeccable biceps, or <i>crazily</i> tight ass if Peter\u2019s focus lapsed\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wrenched his attention back to walking. Peri better not have noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few drew a few looks from pedestrians as they walked outside the campus. Eugene couldn\u2019t whether it was because they were <i>smokin</i>\u2019 hot, or that they weren\u2019t wearing masks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould representatives of the Gods get COVID? Hopefully not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was half-tempted to go out and high five a disapproving old woman who <i>definitely</i> tutted and scowled at them into servility, but Eugene dissuaded him. Other people would <i>definitely</i> notice the geezer losing forty-five years and eighty pounds, and plus, she might have a family or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Psi Iota Mu Phi Sigma boys\u2019 only family was the platonic idea of partying. When the toga-wreathed boys trod back to their frat the next day, they\u2019d probably be met with raucous cheering and no questions about where the hell they were the last day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they might object to seeing their bros feminized in a flash of light. The Morphmanji players looked up at the frat house gravely, contemplating their options. Surrounding the brown-glass littered porch was a flat roof, and presumably, a wealth of dorm windows, which equalled more baggage-girls for Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that roof could hold my weight?\u201d mused Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised the <i>dorm floor</i> holds your weight, Geno.\u201d snarked Peter with a flick of his hair. \u201cI should be the one to go up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you gonna move the Omphalos, dude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if you <i>hurt yourself</i>, Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rolled his brown doe-eyes. \u201cThe chain\u2019s long enough if you just, like, set it down a foot away from the edge, man.\u201d He turned his attention to the histronic handmaiden. \u201cAnd, uh, the Gods said that they\u2019d protect me and stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri\u2019s contrite expression slid into a mask of joy. \u201cI see! My apologies for doubting you.\u201d Another deep curtsy followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another problem,\u201d Eugene hooked a thick thumb at the door of the frat, that was seemingly scribbled over in red oil marker. \u201cThat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter shrugged his pale shoulders with a roll of his eyes. \u201cOh <i>no</i> frat bros don\u2019t have respect for rented property, what<i>ever</i> shall we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dude, I mean, can you read that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter squinted at the red-marked wood. On second glance, the scrawled ink <i>did</i> look like letters, just in no language he recognized. \u201cNo.\u201d he lamely admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that community forum post from a couple months back?

Rising from the couch amidst much clattering of beer cans, he staggered to the door, stepping over the prone form of his frat bros who were <i>waay</i> morre partied out than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a pizza call? At \u2014 he squinted at the grandfather clock in the foyer \u2014 five PM? A bit early, but hey, food was food. It was his turn to pay anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door\u2026 to a petite brunette who was nine kinds of cute, her face pulled into a charming pout of concentration that quickly shifted into a gasp when she saw the beleaguered frat bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much greetings!\u201d she cheered in an accent Jeremy couldn\u2019t place, throwing her full body into a wave. \u201cI am being a dys-track-shen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy blinked. This was\u2026 different. Girls didn\u2019t approach him. Especially cute foreign girls. Also she wasn\u2019t pizza, but he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s real nea\u2014 wait, are you the new dealer? Or a cop, \u2018cuz you have to tell me if\u2026\u201d He stopped when he saw the girl\u2019s face wrinkled in confusion. He\u2019d have to go slower, it looked like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2026 You\u2026 Have\u2026 A\u2026\u201d Jeremy searched his alcohol-addled mind for a query that could cross the language barrier. He settled for forming his hand into a finger-gun and pointing it demonstratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny concern he might have had was dispelled when the girl mirrored his own mimery, touching her index to his and tilting her head questioningly. If worse came to worst, he\u2019d be postively fucking <i>elated</i> to let this chick arrest him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy activated suave-mode, which consisted of him slicking his greasy hair back and lowering his voice half an octave. He threw in a lean against the doorframe to really bring her the smolder. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019re you here for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor Mistress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unexpected answer. Jeremy didn\u2019t let it phase him, though. \u201cUh, neat. So, like, are you a maid or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl broke into a bright smile. \u201cShe is <i>best</i> Mistress!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not really an answer, but she was still adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Peter listened to the cacophonic alien language shouted from the doorstep. It was far easier for Peter to sneak along the white picket fence than Gene, but being too short to be seen was kinda like having a low BMI because your legs got cut off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the corner of the frat, the ideal place for infiltrating. There was a raised patch of ground next to the  low roof\u2019s corner, and three out of four angles of sight blocked by the nearby houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this, Pete?\u201d half-whispered Eugene. \u201cI can try to go up with you, you know..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter tried not to let his flush show. \u201cI\u2019ll be <i>fine,</i> dude.\u201d He looked up at the window and grit his teeth. \u201cOnce one of \u2018em\u2019s a maid, they can probably <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">carry the stupid fuckin\u2019 rock for me.</font>\u201d He set his face into a frown of determination post-grumble. \u201cJust make sure you put the Omphalos in a good place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost-Hercules shrugged. \u201cAlright then. Boost on five?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty braced himself as Geno rumbled a count, ready to step on the interlaced fingers of his friend\u2019s strong arm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why he let out a squeal when that selfsame arm circled itself around his hips and handily hoisting him into a seated position behind his head.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Pete</i>!\u201d Eugene turned his face as far clockwise towards the attractive augur as he could without getting a noseful of thigh. \u201cThis is supposed to be <b>stealthy</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2014 you \u2014\u201d spluttered the shame-mantled soothsayer, \u201cYou said you would <i>boost</i> me, dude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I <i>boosted</i> you onto my shoulders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter most definitely did <i>not</i> think about how he could <i>feel </i>the rumble of Gene\u2019s voice from his firm seat. \u201cThat\u2019s not a \u2014 fuck, whatever. Just get the rock up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter watched the flex and ripple of the nerd\u2019s arm as it hoisted the prophetic rock, teeth teasing at his lip <i>for no reason at all</i>. With a bit of a scrape, the Omphalos was placed, base down, around the midpoint between two windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Might use my wish to keep these.\u201d Eugene experimentally flexing a bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded his agreement as soon as the words left Gene\u2019s lips, and then was immediately glad that the dweeb couldn\u2019t see his head. \u201cFuck that, dude. I\u2019m winning with my plus-one movement and wishing for a badass mansion, with a fuck-ton of workout rooms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I drop you here, huh?\u201d teased Eugene, faking a drunken stagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare</i>.\u201d hissed Peter. The mock-wobbling soon approached the shakes of <i>real</i>, oracle-dislodging wobbles, forcing the jock to cling to the rectangular prism of a skull in front of him for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Eugene who first realized what the twin softnesses pressed against his parietal bone were. It was also Eugene who realized that Peter\u2019s soft skin had the sweet scent of violets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter reached the same conclusion Eugene had shortly thereafter, and disentangled himself with a mumbled apology. Eugene returned the same contrite murmur, and the two went about their next task silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was able to clamber up Gene\u2019s raised limbs surprisingly easily, considering his utter lack of muscle tone. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">His</span> The oracle disappeared from sight, forcing the board-game-owner to listen intently for signs of mission completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light tapping on a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muttered curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light tapping on a window left of the first tapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlass-muffled thumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coo of (what he hoped was) mock-femininity from Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of very fast glass-muffled steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creaking of a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he could <i>see</i> the flash of light.

He didn\u2019t need to be nervous. This would be <i>fine</i>. Everything would be <i>fine</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he spared a couple of concerned looks at the window as he padded back to the front of the frat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she is dancing, like <i>pow</i>!

He could probably sway them into a threesome with his raw sexual charism\u2014 <i>wow that guy was big</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone who looked like Kevin Sobro mixed with prime-Schwarzenegger with the hair of Fabio strode into Jeremy\u2019s line of sight, his ripped top half completely unclothed, and a Big Fucking Sword sheathed at his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy risked a small wave of acknowledgment, and the man returned a distracted nod, staring up at the windows of the house. Concern jolted through Jeremy \u2014 was he about to get <i>robbed</i>? \u2014 but the short unconcerned look the foreign girl shot the bodybuilder relaxed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn\u2019t moving, he wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl moved, pushing past him into the frat with an excited \u201c<i>Mistress</i>!\u201d Jeremy turned to see a gaggle of five togaed girls descending the creaky stairs, all of them surrounding a grumpy looking bombshell with <i>massive</i> tits, who was chained to a rock\u2026 for some reason. His conversation partner joined the herd, jabbering excitedly in some foreign language into the black-haired girl\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, can I help you? Hey, is that a six-pac\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl pushed past him \u2014 and took a moment to frown at her hand, as if she expected to push <i>through</i> him or something \u2014 then hailed the bodybuilder with a tired wave and sulky foreign grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their conversation heedles of jeremy, but to be fair, he wasn\u2019t too focused on the anachronistic couple, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved to the girl he\u2019d been talking to for the last twenty minutes with a \u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did that cute full-body wave, adding in a \u201cGood-bye-bye!\u201d to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have, like, a number you could give me or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a tiny finger to her lips in concentration, shouting \u201cFifty-<i>two</i>!\u201d at the befuddled wannabe-playboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy watched them trundle towards the campus, shrugging at the seeming-security-violation.

The Omphalos was nestled comfortably in the arms of Peri who had quickly caught up with the group and had, after a very brief argument had quickly been chosen as the 'leader' by Peter (who was, frankly, already growing tired of the entourage even if it did mean a movement bonus and no longer dealing with the gods damn rock of destiny).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, can you guys just be quiet for two seconds!?\" Peter groaned as they reached the halfway point, and the fraternity turned sorority went dead quiet for exactly two seconds before chattering once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene chuckled, getting a punch to the forearm that, had they both been in their previous bodies, would have landed painfully on his shoulder and possibly sent Eugene flying.

Your, ugh, mistress commands it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you will it, it shall be done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what great and wonderful wisdom you possess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the wisest commands flow from your lips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great and powerful warrior, accept my my humblest apologies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By your command, my mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Peter groaned. When he'd gone about turning all the guys he'd actually gotten a little bit of a thrill. His own personal little army that were worshipping him! It had been fun but the last five minutes of just nothing but the tittering, the gibbering, and oohs and aahs and the word 'mistress!' popping up every five seconds like the seagulls from that one Disney movie with the talking fish he used to watch as a kid. It was extremely grating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're totally raiding Judy's and Lindsey's closets when we get back to the dorm. I can't believe I've been walking around commando this whole time\" He muttered, stomping off, the handmaiden harem buzzing along behind him in constant adulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you know what it feels like for me\" Eugene chuckled, taking two large strides before being right back at Peter's side, where he belonged, \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah\" Peter said with another wave, but a part of his mind giggled at the random thought of Eugene somehow wearing his loincloth as a shirt in somewhere. After all those signs typically didn't say anything about pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what are we gonna do about this whole 'English is a foreign language' thing now? I don't know about you but that's freaking me out a little bit\" Eugene asked as they approached the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry hero, Mistress said I did a good job on our quest! If you or mistress need assistance with these outsiders then it would be the greatest of any honor to translate for you!\" Peri said cheerily from just a few steps behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I've got my own text-to-speech device. It'll be fine\" Peter said as he reached for the dorm's door, only to blink in surprise as five pairs of hands shot out in front of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've got it mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jest, I'VE got it mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me, mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me, grace of Apollo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY! GODS, I GET IT! YEESH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT A WORD, MISTER\" Peter let out a womanly harumph and sashayed into the dorm lobby, Peri following closely behind. Eugene moved towards the open door, but it swung shut as the almost comical pile of girls funneled in behind Peter's flowing toga robe, leaving the geek to blink in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. This is still so cool\" He muttered as he very, very carefully pulled the glass door open...And then completely ripped it away from the door frame with a crash of twisting metal and shattered glass as a wall of high pitched screams washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER!\" Eugene bellowed, tossing aside the ruined door like it was nothing and charging into the tall building, hand leaping to the hilt of the sword and pulling it out in one swift motion. It even made 'sching!' sound and everything. But as cool and Eugene may have found it, his mind was focused on one thing as he charged through the dorm lobby, leaving cracked tile in the vague shape of large feet as he headed for the common room: His friend who was currently a vulnerable girl. As he rounded the corner and ducked into the common room, the geek stumbled to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the somewhat clinical environment he and Peter had left, the large communal room now resembled the inside of some ancient temple! There was a roaring fire in a large pit in the center, the couch and the three other lounge chairs were gone, replaced by elaborate marbled little stools and benches that were covered in lavishly colored drapes and primitive looking pillows. Jars are all sorts dotted the room, and in the center, past the currently screaming pile of women and one very confused and distressed looking oracle, was Lindsey, calming rotating what looked like a plucked chicken over the roaring fire. The only trace of Judy was the end of a scaled tail that was slowly winding it's way into the dark opening there the bathroom doors had been. Near it was the table and the game machine, untouched and modern looking as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene cautiously entered the transformed room, sword at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GODS will you guys shut up!?\" Peter cried, and then the weight of the six bodies pulling and pressing upon him, looking to shield him from the terrible creature that seemed rather non-plussed by it all, was too much for his legs to stand, and the entire entourage collapsed to the now straw-and-animal skinned floor with a collective girly 'OOF!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHALLENGE COMPLETE\" The game buzzed, \"PLAYER 2 AWARDED ONE ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT SPACE PER TURN\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lindsey? Judy?\" Eugene approached the sweating horse-bulk that had been his crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Whozzat?\" The transformed sorority girl slurred, turning around clumsily, a piece of oily looking meat hanging out of her broad mouth, her red eyes dull and unfocused as they searched for the unfamiliar voice. Then they locked on Eugene before darting over to the pile of terrified looking former frat boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Geeno! Yer back! Dude we can, like, totally keep playin' now!\" Lindsey bellowed spewing half-chewed food everywhere as the centaur scrambled to her hooves, knocking over a large clay pot that shattered noisily. After a few uncertain steps forward and a leering smile at Peter that made Eugene's blood run hot, Lindsey made her way over and draped a smelly, hairy, sweaty arm across his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get this\" Lindsey burped, and Eugene waved the smell invisible ball of gas out of his face with a large hand, \"So me and schales over there got s'bored when yoo guys left so we started lookin' at the game again an' I decided tuh roll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Lindsey, you were able to roll!? But shouldn't it have been locked until Peter finished the Challenge Card?\" Eugene blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gezz so! An'way, So I rolls a 3, right? And it lands on an Akshun Skquare! And the game goes, it goes \"Dion...Dee-ooh...The party god! IT goes 'The party god blesses yoo! Show yer 'preciation by throwin' a party! Then POOF all this schtuff shows up! But then it wuz jus' me an' Judy and shee was all grumpy and shit. But now yer back! And y'guys brought girls! Woo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur gave Peter and the handmaidens a sloppy grin and a wink before bursting out into laughter despite their terrified stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon lez drink Geno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey, you...you never get drunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz you, like, dun't know me very well, heh! C'mon Geeno, les have some fun! Tis s'pposed tuh be a party skool an'ways!\" The centaur let go of Eugene and stumbled back towards the fire, scooping up a small earthen jug and chugging it, dark liquid splashing over the floor as Peter and Eugene shared a VERY concerned look at each other.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Party? Lindsey I don't think that...\" Eugene said, reaching out for the former girl, but the centaur shrugged off his grip, turning to toss the jar she'd just been chugging towards the former chubby freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, Geeno! Thas yer prob'em. Yer thinkin'! T'game said party so we gots'ta party! C'mon girls!\" Lindsey said, reaching over and pulling one of the handmaidens out of the pile of silky togas and frightened stares. Eugene wasn't sure which one it was, it definitely wasn't Peter or Peri, but he felt the blood thundering into his temples as the girl screamed in terror as Lindsey threw her over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LINDSEY!\" Eugene snapped, hand going once more to the sword on his waist. This...This was NOT cool! In fact, this didn't even seem like Lindsey! He didn't want to have to fight the girl he'd been crushing after but...Eugene took a step forward but movement out of the corner of his eye made him pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! LET HER GO!\" Peter screeched, shoving aside the frozen handmaidens, all of them squeaking as they toppled onto one another. The former athlete rose to his tiny feet and and began stomping towards Lindsey, who was currently settling back into place next to the fire, depositing the absolutely petrified and teary eyed auburn girl roughly between between her hooves. The girl recoiled as Lindsey's large penis flopped with a thud against the floor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Petey! C'mere, room fer another!\" The inebriated sorority girl said with a phlegmy laugh, patting the scattered hay next to her. But Peter wasn't deterred, stomping on his sandals until he was in Lindsey's face, Peri scrambling wide-eyed behind him, Omphalos in her hands. the other handmaidens were cowering against themselves as they watched their mistress stand up to the horrid, disgusting creature that had taken the most sensitive of their sisterhood captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense moment as Lindsey simply grinned up at the scowling Peter, before the irate oracle raised a tiny hand and viciously slapped Lindsey across the face. The centaur's head snapped to the right and her red eyes went wide in surprise before she burst out into a another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Im only doin' what the game sez...toots. Can' roll 'til we party! I wasn...I wasn't gonna do nothin!\" Lindsey chuckled, reaching down and wrapping an arm around Talia, who simply whimpered as she struggled to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give. Her back. Now. Lindsey\" Peter said, ice in his usually pleasant (even when upset) voice. Eugene took a step forward and opened his mouth to speak but the oracular athlete stuck out a palm towards him, not breaking eye contact with the girl that had, little more than an hour ago, been half his size and more or less a stick. But now Lindsey was literally the size of a horse and even drunk had muscles that Eugene thought might give him a run for his money if he really did have to settle this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire crackled and the fatty grease on the chicken popped and sizzled as the two sized each other up...And then Lindsey laughed, releasing Talia and pushing her upwards with a dismissive smack on the rear. The girl let loose a frightened sob and rushed around Lindsey's hooves towards Peter, who grabbed his handmaiden and pulled her in protectively, a hand running down the curly locks soothingly as Talia tried her best not to openly weep onto her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stretched, all six limbs stretching outwards and joints popping like trees in deep winter, 'S'fine. Gezz we're stayin' like this then. S'not so bad really. Kinda like bein' a dude\" She yawned before reaching off and tearing a drumstick off the charring chicken and scooping up another jar of what was obviously wine. \"Hey Petey, lemme know if y'change yer mind in a'month. Might wanna party then!\" The girl cackled before loudly taking a bite out of the chicken, grease splattering and dribbling down her beard as Peter slowly turned away and guided Talia back to her sisters, who reached out and took the traumatized girl while Peri followed dutifully behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scaled tail slithered further into the cavern, disappearing from sight. Eugene gave it and Lindsey a wary look before padding over to the group of former men who were all cooing and soothing and quietly praising Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, you were so brave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly the greatest of Apollo's chosen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was going to be fine! Mistress is so fierce and strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Koren\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-thank y-you muh-my mis-mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah\" Peter said, his quietly letting loose a breath he didn't know he was holding, casting a glance through his hair back at Lindsey, who was already draining another jar of wine. All of which seemed to be appearing out of no-where. After a moment Peter looked at Eugene, and the titanic late-teen could see the fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, I uh, I gotta say that for someone with no balls, that was pretty ballsy\" Eugene said, reaching out and brushing away a few stray hairs that had decided to cling to the beauty's face. Peter nuzzled against Eugene's large fingers for a moment, closing his eyes and willing his heart to stop racing...Or at least stop racing out of fear...Maybe just a few moments like this to catch his breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Geno\" Peter leaned into Eugene's handa bit more. It was soft but firm and warm on his flushed and clammy face as the adrenaline drained away, \"I just, I HATE guys like that. That's the reason I left my frat. Just a bunch of 'roiders getting drunk and being really rough with the girls that they'd trick back there. Just pissed me off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo would be proud, mistress\" Peri said, setting the Omphalos down, \"No other priestess would have confronted such a beast for their handmaidens\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I couldn't just let it happen. You girls are only here because of me. I, uh, gotta look out for my squad\" Peter said, opening his eyes and giving the first of his six followers a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri didn't quite understand what the oracle was saying, especially 'squad', given that they were handmaidens and the farthest thing from a military unit...But she just returned the smile with a bow of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...I mean SHE is right though\" Eugene said with a hushed voice, pulling his fingers away after a moment, Peter turning to watch with more than a little regret as Eugene's fingers trailed away to rest on those popwerful, bulging knee caps, \"We've got to have SOME kind of party, even if we have to fake it. Otherwise the game won't unlock\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't look at me! The only 'greek party' I know of involved getting fuckin' wasted and then puking my guts out and then ending up naked on the roof the next morning! Somehow, given that farce I had to do just to make my stupid rock work I don't think that's what the gods are looking for here. Maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked once more towards the dark, sinister looking entrance into what had been the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's one person that would know. Besides, we need her to roll when the game unlocks\" He said warily, and Peter followed his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Peter groaned as a shiver ran down his largely naked back. The last thing he wanted to think about after confronting a sloshed centaur was another monster. Even if it had been his girlfriend at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, don't think you should go with me\" Eugene said as they rose to their feet. You might actually be safer out here given how mad she was at you when we left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she wuz totally pissed!\" Lindsey answered between noisy wet chomps of what remained of the chicken, which she was now eating right off the roasting spit. But before the two other players could reply she simply pointed to her pointed, furry ears. \"Ima part hu-horse, 'member?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Peter shared a look and then a shrug. It was the least weird thing about all of this right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll go in and get Judy. You stay out here and if, uh, 'anything' happens I'll run out and deal with it\" Eugene thumbed towards Lindsey and then patted the pommel of his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aight. I guess I can uh, try to do something out here? Maybe I just earned some karma points or something\" Peter said with a hopeful shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took a deep breath and nodded. Peter could take care of himself. After all, he doubted that even if Lindsey got...frisky again, she was probably too drunk to chase them very far. With a smile downwards he took off walking for the cavern opening, ignoring the wave from Lindsey as she slurped down another jar of wine, coming to a stop in a heroic pose that he didn't intend to do. He felt cool air leaking out of the darkness, and somewhere within it something tumbled, followed by a distant raspy breath. He reached into the darkness, his slab-like hand disappearing from sight near instantly. It would be next to impossible to see in there and the lair of the gorgon wasn't one that you wanted to wander into without a light...Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene pulled out his sword, the blade ringing and glowing as he pointed it into the darkness, the abyss giving way to a mess of broken tile, bathroom stalls as...stone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, whatever. Here we g-' Eugene thought as he took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GENE, WAIT!\" Peter's voice rang out, and he turned to see the former linebacker practically tossing himself into Eugene's arms, a startled looking Peri stumbling behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...Be careful, okay? I-We can't finish this without you...\" Peter cooed softly, and the smell of violets filled Eugene's nose. He lifted Peter's small chin and gazed into those big brown eyes, so full of concern, glistening as the beginnings of tears began in their corners...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. It's just a gor-It's just Judy\" Eugene said, and then blinked in surprise as Peter darted up and planted a soft kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For uh, luck. Or something\" Peter said, turning away to hide the deep red blush on his face why he mentally kicked himself. Why'd he do that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm the hero. I don't need luck\" Eugene chuckled, and Peter felt his knees tremble. And then Peter was gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene very much wanted to close his eyes as he passed through the clearly magical barrier and into the darkness, but he fought against the cowardly impulse and soldiered ahead, his path lit only by the glowing edges of his sword (that had once been a chair leg). He stopped a few paces in and turned to look out into the common room again, waving a beffy hand at the worried stare of Peter and Peri, but the two women, one reluctant, one oblivious didn't seem to acknowledge his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess they can't see me...\" He muttered, kicking a stray piece of water looked like a sink with his sandal, the piece of debris clattering in the dark stillness and it's echo carrying on far longer than it should have. Eugene watched as, after a few moments Peter took a deep breath, his breasts heaving, and then the somewhat imperiled athlete turned and looked around the common room, with one final glance at the cave entrance before waving a hand and striding back over towards the clustered handmaidens, Peri following dutifully (and closely after him), the former security guard casting a wide eyed look of fear backwards before quickening her own stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess it's just me now\" Peter said with a determined nod, and he felt a chill run down his spine as a hissing laugh began echoing all around him. He spun, sword waving wildly for any sign of his foe...Of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isss jussst you, hero\" Judy sneered from the darkness, staring at the hero below her, her eyes fully uncovered as the ragged blindfold hung limply off her nose like a ill-fitting surgical mask, like the ones all the humans were wearing now because of the plague. Her scaled form clinging effortlessly from the stone above. Her raspy voice bounced off the walls of the former lavatory, it having altered along with the common room when the dullard horseman had landed on the action square.Both the womens and the mens bathroom had been slammed together, and the cavern had grown to consume at least the second floor bathrooms as well, giving Judy more than enough room for her lengthy body to finally stretch out to it's full extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eugene made his way slowly into her lair, the gorgon slithered along silently above, musing on her plans as she avoided the rays of Apollo's light from the magical weapon. She grinned, ducking just low enough for her fang-filled face and forked tongue to glisten in the pale light, and then darting back into the darkness as the muscled demigod turned to look, only to see more crushing darkness. Judy glanced behind her and saw a few stray pebbles lined along the edge of the small crevice. She sent them flying with a wiggle of her muscles and let loose another hissing rasp of laughter as they clattered noisely among the tuins of the bathroom below, and slithering out of sight as Eugene turned to look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, as nice as this cave was, it wouldn't hurt to have a little more. She just needed to figure out what to do with all the humans first. The hero would be easy, just wait until his back was turned then slither down...Afterwards she'd just claim the oracle's eyes for herself and turn all of those pretty girls into the most delightful statues. She'd position them at the doors, and if that horsebrain would listen, maybe Judy could include her in her own plans...And if now, well, she wasn't particular about her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy slid down over the edge of lip of the small ravine, poised like the snake she was, near motionless  and mere inches from Eugene's face. It would be all over soon and then she'd have her justice. A whole tower to herself, to gaze out the windows and feel the warmth of Helios upon her skin. It would be a small justice for the wrongs against her, to finally not have to hide in some wet dank cave like a...like a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Monster</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blinked and suddenly pulled the blindfold back up over her eyes as she realized what she was doing. The word rang in her head like a church bell, she could hear the voices behind them and even in the darkness, she could see the crying 18 year old as she sped away from a large white house in the suburbs, two judgemental, unforgiving faces glaring at her from a picket-fenced yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat...What was she doing!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene! Eugene I'm right...I'm right here!\" Judy cried out, slithering her bulk down into the warrior's path with a mighty crash. The geek shouted in surprise and brought the sword up to strike, his eyes clamped shut. His mighty muscles tensed as he prepared to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait! It'sss me! It'sss Judy! I'm...I wasss jussst playing, okay!? DON'T SSSWING!\" She cried out, waving her clawed hands in the air. The snakes in her hair hissed erraticaly, slithering in every direction as they fed off the panic the goth girl was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene had just begun his downward arc when the gorgon had cried out. He froze and felt the weight of the sword knock off his balance almost in complaint of his hesitation. He decided to take the risk and peeked open one eyelid by barely a centimeter, and than relaxed as he saw the blurry form of Judy stopped so low she was practically touching the ground, her hands straight up in the air in a clear gesture of surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Hera, you scared the piss out of me, Judy!\" Eugene said, lowering the sword to the ground. And it was the truth, or extremely near to it. Maybe he wasn't as good at this hero thing as he thought...Or maybe Peter's good luck kiss had some oracle magic looking over him. Either way, he was pretty sure that if the gorgon had wanted him dead, the inexperienced hero would already be gathering dust in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sssorry about that...Don't know what came over me. But sssee! I have the blindfold on and everything!\" Judy pulled herself back up to the closest thing she had to a 'sitting' position, which was rather hard to do when properly using chairs as designed was a physical impossibility for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted. Why are you down here anyway?\" Eugene said pointing at the darkness around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It jussst felt...right? Like it wasss where I wasss sssupposssed to be. Plusss I couldn't take Lindsssey charging around like a minotaur in a pottery shop anymore. I think...I think sssomething isss happening to usss Eugene! More ssso than what already hasss!\" Judy pointed a claw to her writhing, living hair, \"I think the game isss messsssing with our brainsss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't really noticed anything really different. I just really love this feeling of being strong though!\" Eugene flexed his muscles as Judy's snakes, once again her only way to see without hurting anyone, looked on with a frown on her face. Eugene honestly didn't know what the creature was saying...And quite frankly felt like he couldn't trust her anymore anyway. He was pretty sure he'd been inches from death. He still WAS inches from death, if this was all just some clever ruse to get him to drop his guard. Plus why wouldn't he enjoy this? He could FLEX his PECS just like they Terry dude from Brooklyn 9-9 could! How could anyone not think that was cool! Especially when Peter stared at them. He eventually ceased his impromptu display of manliness with a hissing sigh of impatience from Judy. \"Well, maybe you're just paranoid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT paranoid! Eugene, I almossst killed you! I think your sssword isss-\" Judy whined, pointing to the glowing blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't. And now we're talking sooo...\" Eugene trailed off. It was hard to keep his focus, staring at her scaly skin and disgustingly mobile hair, \"Anyway, I came in to get you. We need to figure out how to throw a good party in the way that the gods will like it so we can keep playing the game. It's, uh, your turn next, by the way\" Eugene added the last bit as an after-thought, a mild incentive to get Judy out of the cave without either killing her or knocking her out and dragging her enormous bulk back into the common room and dealing what would happen when she woke up. But Eugene knew one thing if he still had to resort to that option; definitely tie Judy up before waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon shifted her full body into what looked like a cocked head turn, \"What, you guysss don't know how to throw a party? that sssoundsss lame\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shoot me or something\" Eugene shrugged, \"Can we get a move on? Quickly we get back to playing the game, the quicker one of us gets the wish at the end\" Judy tightened his grip on the sword, and the many snake heads of Judy shifted towards the action, and then back to Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really a request\" He growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHERO! HERO COME QUICK! THE PYTHIA NEEDS YOU!\u201d Peri\u2019s voice echoed through the darkness, and Eugene turned away from Judy, whose threatening hisses ended with a questioning grunt as she looked up towards the mouth of the cavern, a claw pulling away from the weak binding that kept her deadly power sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemigod looked at monster, all of the previous animosity between the two vanishing as they simultaneously said \u201cPeter!\u201d, and began rushing upwards out of the dank underground abyss, the light of Eugene\u2019s sword guiding his mighty strides while Judy rippled effortlessly over the maze of debris that filled the throat of the cave. And then they were out, the flickering light of the bonfire casting long shadows as they gazed upon the scene in front of them. Peter was floating slightly off the ground, arms out-stretched and his torn robe red and dripping from being doused in wine, his gods-given breasts revealed for the world (or at least the gathered players plus\u2026\u2019guests\u2019). A rather sizable portion of the formerly white robe was hanging from one of Lindsey\u2019s outstretched and gnarled hands, and the centaur herself was openly ogling Peter\u2019s body, her massive horse-cock straight as a rod and throbbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Peter spoke, his voice once more heavily accented, but not soft and silky like it had been before. This time his voice was loud, powerful, and had a rather masculine reverb echoing off of it. His brown eyes were open wide and glowing with angry looking light, tendrils of magical, clearly divine, energy flickering out of Peter\u2019s eyes as she glared down at Lindsey, who was clearly too drunk to be anything more than amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIf thou act a beast, my anger you should fear the least. So given to your craven desires you have provoked the gods\u2019 ire. Blessed you were, and so shall stay but now no woman shall look your way. A more fitting form you\u2019ll find for thee, perhaps a horn or two or three. Cursed you are, from friends be riven and banished, no longer will you have centaur magic. Take delight in your feotid breath, be thankful that you face not DEATH. Apollo strikes thee with his light, now cry foul heathen for his delight!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter spoke a dark cloud gathered along the common room\u2019s ceiling, rippling with flashes of lightning and thunder. Something seemed to pass over Lindsey\u2019s face and the drunken, leering grin faded away to uncertainty, and then out right terror as the impossible storm whipped itself into a maelstrom of thunder and lightning, a pinprick of light appearing at it\u2019s core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene felt the urge to race across from the cavern\u2019s opening, to tackle the possessed Peter to the ground and roll him out of danger, but a thick tail wrapped around his legs and he turned with a growl towards the Gorgon looming out of the shadows behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go, Judy!\u201d Eugene rumbled, grabbing at his friend\u2019s coils, but then the sound and noise stopped, and Peter let loose a shriek as he dropped to the ground, the gaggle of handmaidens rushing forward and dragging their beloved mistress over to the small fort made up of hastily overturned benches and chairs and more than a few pots. Meanwhile the light continued to grow in intensity in the center of the storm before a thematic WOOSH shook the entire dorm building as an arrow of what looked to be pure light shot down from the glowing portal above the stricken sorority girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!\u201d Lindsey roared as her drunken form was struck squarely in the chest, and suddenly a vast pillar of fiery golden light erupted from her broad, hairy chest, growing quickly to consume her entire form as she roared and screamed in terror and pain. Eugene was suddenly VERY afraid that if the gods really did exist (because of course they did, who else would have given him all of this?) then they were smiting his former crush from existence. And without her\u2026They couldn\u2019t finish the game and Eugene wouldn\u2019t get his wish! But in moments the light began to fade and the silhouette of something MUCH smaller than a centaur lay curled in the fetal position as smoke curled off it\u2019s form and that of the scorched\u2026tile? Stone? Eugene was sure what the floor was made out of anymore. And then with another ominous rumble, the clouds overhead rolled away to whatever nebulous realm they had come from. Which was Olympus, obviously, but Eugene didn\u2019t bother entertaining the preposterous idea any longer as Judy pushed past him, her coils releasing the greek geek from her clutches as she slithered towards what was left of Lindsey. Eugene tromped behind the massive snake, careful of his heavy strides to not accidentally step on the gorgon and once again set off her temper. So long as the monster would play nice, Eugene would as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, curled into a tight ball of smoking fur, lay a half man-half...goat looking creature that had two large horns, the ugliest face Eugene had EVER seen (and he'd seen Judy's current one) and a long, but thin, penis that hung out hard and stiff from under a poorly fitting loincloth.. The new creature was also extremely small, it's two legs bent backwards and forwards and ending in two stubby cloven hooves. In fact Eugene wasn't sure if the creature's constant erection wasn't nearly as long as the animal man was tall.It's baby-like arms and tiny hands were clutching at five long connected tubes as it spasmed and twitched in the aftermath of the divine strike. A black card that read PENALTY lay attached to it's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What is that?\" Eugene said, pointing at it with his sword. The creature groaned as it's wrinkly eyes fluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I think Lindsssey jussst turned into a sssatyr...\" Judy hissed as she slithered around her former friend. 'Ssso much for a tower guardian...' Part of her mind thought. Another part of her mind suggested that the satyr was small enough that she could probably eat it in a few bites, but Judy ignored both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lindsey!?\" Eugene gasped in surprise, \"Pete, you...\" Eugene's eyes stretched wider as he realized that Peter wasn't by his side, where he belonged. The hero spun on his sandaled heel and looked at the small crowd of handmaidens as they fan and massaged the oracle, who was groaning softly, a delicate hand on his forehead while her breasts hung out, open for the world to see. He felt a twinge of something but his concern overrode his 'hero' thoughts. \"Peter, what...What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri looked up with worry in her eyes, \"Oh hero! When you were in the cave, our mistress was trying to show up how to dance! She called it 'The Shakira Thing\" and said that maybe if we all started dancing, maybe the gods would help us with the 'party' she says we need to have!\" Peri frittered about, making sure the other handmaidens were doing...Whatever they were doing right. Eugene really had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then the Pythia is dancing, doing the most magnificent moves when all of a sudden that ghastly, beastly centaur gets up and starts dancing with her! And drinking! He was so clumsy, and now he's paid the price!\" The former security guard said with a girlish grunt of feminine approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but WHAT happened, Peri? I saw the light-show, and Peter didn't sound like himself!\" Eugene pointed up to the ceiling, \"Where did those clouds come from1?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Apollo of course! You see, sir hero, the centaur tripped and dumped all of his wine over our fair, pure mistress! And then he laughed like he did with Talia and grabbed Apollo's Grace! And he ripped off her robe! So then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then the blue smoke came out of the rock and I turned into Super-Bitch\" Peter groaned as he pushed himself upright. \"Ugh, my fucking head...Is that what it's like to have a god in your brain? I, uh, think I preferred it the other way\" He chuckled, wincing at the headache that had descended up his skull. But he was extremely glad that Eugene was okay, and took a little solace in the fact that Eugene was now rushing to his side and worrying about him. He gave Eugene a smile as his tiny hand disappeared inside the titan's, \"And hey, you brought the gorgon back! Wonder if we can roll again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wasn't really sure what had happened, though. One moment he was staring in outrage as Lindsey paraded around with the remains of his top, and then the next moment it was like he could see EVERYTHING. And then something spoke THROUGH him...It was definitely different from last time, when it had just felt like a compulsion this had felt like a full override. Peter had just been a passenger in his own body. And he wasn't sure what to think about that. On the one hand, magic game...But...Apollo? In his head? Oy vey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, by the way\" A high pitched neighing voice said, and all eyes turned to focus on the tiny creature as it staggered to it's feet, seemingly permanent erection smacking painfully against the floor and showing in the tiny man's beady eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" Every other person in the still-transformed common room groaned in disgust. One of the handmaidens...Koren? The blonde one, seemed to throw up in her mouth a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Whaaat!?\" Lindsey said, arms splayed wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsssey, you're a sssatyr, honey\" Judy rapsed, \"Sssatyrsss are the dregsss of Dionysssusss'sss court. They make crude, crasssss jokes and have to live with, um, thossse\" The gorgon seemed to be the only one in the room unaffected by Lindsey's new grotesque appearance, pointing at the awkward perma-boner that was sticking out of the loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? LIKE OMG!\" Lindsey cried out, spotting the ungainly appendage for the first time, \"First I get one big enough to kill someone and now it's all long and hard! Why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you apparently insulted the gods, specifically Apollo\" Peter said, not making direct eye contact with the creature, \"So do you guys think this means we don't have to have a party now? Judy, can you roll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let me sssee...\" Judy slithered over and grabbed her green and white dice, dropping it on the game map. It came to a stop and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tiny plastic cube dropped from Judy's clawed and fell to the game table while the entire group (plus the gaggle of concerned and confused handmaidens that couldn't figure out why their mistress was not freaking out about the enormous gorgon or covering herself and instead intently focused on the strange device near the gorgon's cave) held their breath in anticipation. Perhaps, with some luck, Lindsey's error might have voided the ACtion Square's lockout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the four players let out of a collective sigh of disappointment (for Lindsey it was more like a burp) as the die clicked and clattered across the table and the tiny figure that Judy had taken the shape of did not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! And it wasss a sssix too!\" She hissed, resting her vicious looking hands on what amounted to her hips where the human aspect of her body ended and the lengthy muscle mass of her snake attributes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's back to figuring out what a party was like in ancient Greece\" Peter said, finally accepting a pillow to cover his breasts as he finally felt sturdy enough from the divine possession to sit upright without his pretty head throbbing. \"Thanks, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koren, oh most illustrious, most graceful, most beautiful and greatest vessel of Apollo's, um, greatness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're the one they keep telling to shut up, arn't you? Here's a tip girly, being a kiss-ass only gets you so far in life\" Peter groaned as the perky blonde turned beet red and looked down at her feet, the rest of the handmaidens sharing small grins and even a quiet snicker. But they all went quiet save for a whimper from Talia as the gorgon slithered over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually we don't have to. In ancient Greece, partiesss were called sssymposssiumsss, and they involved a lot of drinking, eating but also danssscing and sssinging...And it wasss usssually ssscentered on a debate between two men, generally in posssitionsss of power. They'd make their ssspeechesss and then the gathered party-goersss would vote to ssseee who made the better pointsss\" Judy said, doing her best to fight off the impulse to lunge at the whimpering girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you're telling me all those nerdy debate clubs started off as ragers?\" Peter blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss! Maybe if you'd lisssten to me once in a while you'd actually learn ssssomething!\" Judy stuck a forked tongue out at Peter, earning a wave of satisfying gasps of shock from the small harem, save for the one that seemed to be constantly carrying around the Omphalos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you speak to the mistress that way, foul creature! She should call upon Apollo and have him smite you like she did the centaur!\" Peri fumed, finding the courage within herself just as her mistress had with the centaur that her mistress, the bulky hero and the gorgon were all referring to as 'Lindsey' which seemed a very strange name and was now a foul little creature that was currently playing with it's disgusting privates...But Peri was beginning to realize that her mistress was more than a little unorthadox. Still radiant and wonderful, but definitely unorthadox. The transformed security guard placed two dainty hands on her hips and stared at the gorgon. If mistress could be brave, so could she!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, chill out Peri!\" Peter said with a roll of his big brown eyes, reaching forward and pulling the feisty handmaiden back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mistress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine she's, uh, okay with the gods. I think. Just chill out and uh, go get me an aspirin?\" Peter rubbed his temples with his free hand, his words once again calming the gaggle of girls, but not completely setting them at ease like it had with Eugene. Probably because Judy was a monster and not a demigod ripped straight from all of Peter's fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass per wren? Mistress, is this another outsider word?\" Peri felt just AWFUL about letting her mistress down, but she kept using all these strange words and terms. She was doing her best but it was a base part of translating a foreign language to at least have some context of the words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods are you kidding me? Over there in the kitchen there's a cabinet with a tiny blue bottle...DUDE!\" Peter exclaimed, pointing a finger towards what had once been the common room's kitchen. Instead of the broken fridge, a microwave and stove and sink was now a vast looking pantry filled with all sorts of foods from dried fruits, crisp looking vegetables all the way to various skinned animals hanging from hooks from the ceiling! Large pots that were filled with spices that were all manner of reds, yellows, oranges and browns, and even more capped pottery shaped like the ones Lindsey had been drinking from. There was even a small fountain filling a basin, the water pouring in from a gap in the wall that had NOT been there before the game had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow\" Judy gasped, as if seeing the complete changes to the common room for the first time. If only she could look out of something other than these snakes...But she pushed the notion aside as she felt a claw tease the edge of the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like, yeah! Where did you guys think I was getting all the wine and chicken from?\" Lindsey cackled, but frowned as everyone ignored her. She sighed again and went back to trying to hide the skinny rod that was poking out from her, wincing from the pain as it bounced against the floor and was constantly throbbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should have gone back to Seattle and just dealt with that jerk' She thought darkly, draping a silky sheet across her cursed erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress...Should your temple NOT have a full pantry? Are your ways so different from that of Babylon's?\" The exotic voice of Farah trilled. She questioned many of the things these foreigners did...But she still loved the divine Pythia. She doubted any other priestess of the gods would have pulled a Persian from the auction block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Peter just blinked dumbly at the former Farad, \"Oh wait, isn't that the place Xerxes was from in 300?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah turned away in shame while a hiss of disapproval washed over the other handmaidens, typically involved the word 'fiend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am sorry I have made you utter such a cursed name, my mistress!\" Farah said, falling to her knees. This was it, she was going to be kicked out! She would be put up for sale or worse! Greeks hated Persians and she wasn't safe without her mistress! \"Please, forgive me! I shall...\" Farah looked around before forcing herself to stare at the greasy satyr, \"...Punish myself by laying with the satyr!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG!\" Lindsey said, just happy that someone was paying attention to her again. She felt the narrow shower curtain hanging off her throb again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! Uh, no it's fine. It's fine! I was just, uh, thinking out loud HEY LET'S GET THIS SIMP-POSER THING STARTED OKAY\" The overwhelmed oracle just willed himself to ignore the headache and push the hideous mental picture of one of his handmaidens getting skewered by the little imp-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to do, Peter. We have to have at least two guys, right? I'm the only dude here. Pretty sure THAT doesn't count\" Eugene said, finally speaking up from his somewhat amused silence at watching Peter handle his 'squad'. It was actually amusingly charming to watch his oracle sputter about like a mother hen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plusss we have to have a unbiasssed crowd to vote afterwardsss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we going to do? If we can't end this dumbass party we'll never get to the end of the game and get that wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISTRESS!\" Peri squealed loudly as a DELIGHTFUL idea popped into her head. She hopped around to face her wonderful Pythia, bowing low as she spoke quickly and excited, \"I know where we can find another man! The boy from before! The one I distracted! And I'm sure he will know of others than would love to make a pilgrimage to your temple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? You mean Jeremy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demigod, gorgon and oracle looked at each other. The satyr looked as well but she was once again relegated to the background as part of her cursed appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it's a shot...But I really, really don't want to walk over there again. Does anyone have their Hermes? I think mine, uh, got Omphalos'd. Or something\" Peter grumbled, lamenting the loss of the expensive device. He doubted he'd be able to get another one, not with the plague outside and Antikythera being so far away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we lossst whatever we had on usss when the game ssstarted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have mine!\" Lindsey offered, scrambling over to where the pile of pillows that had been a bean bag lay scattered. She dug around with her grubby hands before pulling out the small rectangular device that was powered by Zeus...Only to watch it POOF into a blank stone and chisel. She looked up at the others...Only to see they'd continued to ignore her, their discussion having drifted farther away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peri, since you offered...Do you know the way back to the house?\" Eugene asked. He'd go himself but with the whole 'no English thing, the VERY eager handmaiden seemed the best choice for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh most definitely, great hero! I won't let my mistress down!\" The perky former guard said, staring eagerly at her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, go and do my, uh will?\" Peter said with a shrug and a wave, and then blinking as the girl sprinted away with a squeal of delight, moving as if she had been blessed by Hermes himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY TELL HIM IT'S A TOGA PARTY\" Peter yelled at her retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">will</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">mistress!</font>\" Peri's voice was already distant as the handmaiden raced out the ruined lobby doors of what had once been a student dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed and leaned back, the other handmaidens surrounding him, eager for their own instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssso Pete, where'd you get these girlsss from anyway?\" Judy asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day at the temple this has been...\" He sighed as he began the tale.</span></div></div>",

She laid a delicate hand across her forehead and stumbled in appropriate near-swoon fashion. It <i>felt</i> like she did, but\u2026 she couldn\u2019t\u2019ve!

He practiced his smolder as he rush-lurched to the door, grasping the bronzed knob and throwing the oak slab open to reveal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer. The cute, no-named girl from earlier, freckle-spattered nose scrunched up, cupid-bow lips drawn into a deep frown, and balled fists placed huffily on either side of her hips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, was she mad? That wasn\u2019t good. In his limited experience with girls \u2014 he\u2019d only really grown into his good looks once he started playing club rugby a year and a half ago \u2014 they didn\u2019t generally agree to, well, <i>anything</i> when they were mad, be it going out (or in, considering the \u2018demic) for coffee, or \u2018Mistress\u2019-Jeremy threesomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter start it off safe regardless. \u201cHey!\u201d he ventured, spreading his arms welcomingly. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you again\u2026 uh, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl screwed her ice-blue eyes into cutely-menacing slits and growled \u201c<i>Jey-rum-ee</i>,\u201d in a voice far too soft and pitchy to be intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frat bro scratched his head. \u201cUhhh, didn\u2019t think <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">anyone\u2019d name a</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">girl that...</font>\u201d Wait, that was bad. Casting aspersions on her parents was a big no-no. \u201cHey, that\u2019s my name too! Neat \u2014 oh and, uh welcome in.\u201d The last part was hastily muttered as the girl ducked underneath his arm and entered his abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a beeline for the commons room, his nap-spot that was currently littered with beer-cans and a big, empty pizza box. It wasn\u2019t exactly a den o\u2019 love, and Jeremy quickly tried to smooth over her (potential) disappointment with white lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me n\u2019 the guys had a bit of a party, earlier, heh. I was about to clean up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl-Jeremy stooped over to pick up the greasy box and aimed a harsh glare at the befuddled lad. \u201cThis is <i>fire hazard</i>!\u201d she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy blinked. This was\u2026 less welcoming than before. Did he piss her off or something? Or was she just <i>really</i> concerned about cleanliness? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff and a roll of her eyes, his bipolar crush dropped to her knees and started sweeping the cans into a pile with a thin arm, murmuring unfamiliar, foreign-sounding syllables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy, after gawping at the deep neckline of her toga, realized that it might be a dick move to just watch someone clean up the giant mess you\u2019ve made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStooping down, he reached for a beer can\u2026 right as Other-Jeremy did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one moment of glorious hand-contact, images of sappy-romcoms and tropey meet-cutes danced through Jeremy\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl practically <i>ripped</i> her hand away with a mix of a grunt, squeal, and splutter while retreating to the opposite side of the room, and the frat bro desperately wanted to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man</i>, this sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri was fairly certain that her face was hotter than Hephaestus\u2019 forgefire right now. What was <i>wrong</i> with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a lot, apparently. Two voices warred in her pretty little cranium; a loud gruff voice that insisted upon women doing women\u2019s work and general aggression towards the befuddled boy a few feet away from her. The other part, though a tetch more positive, was equally unhelpful, consisting of inarticulate squealing over the fact that she nearly <i>held his hand</i> and that she should <i>thank the gods that he <b>remembered </b>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe half-wanted to return to Mistress, to receive some sort of guidance and \u2014 <i>oh gods, she was supposed to bring him back</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri chewed on her lip and risked a gaze over her shoulder. The boy seemed despondent, one arm limply batting around a beer can, head perpendicular to the lacquered boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Good,\u2019 harrumphed a part of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018NOOOOOO!\u2019 moaned another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeri, for her part, whimpered quietly and drew her head to her knees. This was <i>haard</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Painting an insincere smile on her face, prepared to endure anything to spend time with her Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if he was blowing any social cool he had, a glance to Judy saw her smiling too. A broad smile as wide and genuine as his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" She answered, seeing his furtive glance. She gave a quick thumbs up, before returning both her hands to the controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immersive it is.\" Eugene said, listening for any hesitation amongst the loose knit group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumbing the button, it gave an cheap, chiming tone, the music changed to deliver a brief crescendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that Eugene discovered quite what 'immersive' truly meant. He yelped, as the controller seemed to sting him. Looking to his hands to see if it was a short-circuit, or a spark that had caused him the pain, he saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't look quite right. Oddly more pixelated, his eyes darted to his friends, or rather their hands. Each of them was looking to their hands in horror, as they started to shift from crude jiggling pixels to a finer resolution, then that turned to smoke, and was drawn towards the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay started to shriek and freak-out. Her elbows jerking wildly as she tried to toss the controller aside. It remained stuck to her hands, even as they disappeared, even as the effect worked rapidly up her arms. All of them were freaking out, as the pixelation reached their bodies. Only Peter was holding his breath as if about to submerge beneath the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was whimpering a quiet prayer to herself. While Eugene was trying to work out how this was a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was indifferent to their reactions. All of them, as their heads turned to smoke and shot towards the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour controllers, fell unobserved to the floor, as the screams turned into electronic noise before the room fell silent.</span></div></div>",

Eugene loved the Indiana Jones films... Well the first three, and was happy to compromise with a different world. His friends were more engaged with the idea nodding along, and compromising on each of the different features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you think we should set it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do Arabia, it's such an exotic place!\" Judy said, already halfway into a daydream of her lounging about in a palace as an Arabian princess not unlike Jasmine from the live-action Aladdin, a Sultan's daughter caught up in a whirlwind adventure carrying her across a moonlit desert on a magic carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! We should totally do Greece! I wanna kick someone off a cliff in that old 300 movie!\" Pete said, \"After all I'm part Spartan anyway. This is destiny at work here\" The born-in-America athlete said, standing up from the couch and flexing his muscles in front of Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, gross\" She said mockingly, rolling her eyes as she play-acted. But she did give Peter a small smirky grin as she snuck a peek at his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we could also do something a little more modern?

And the first quest is to find your friends in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? How am I supposed to do that on my own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By using intuition. Just think. This world is a creation based on what you all wanted to create. Where would they be based on that?\" Eugene conceded and tried to think about where they might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wanted to go to an Arabian setting like a princess. So she was probably living in luxury, meaning she was probably safe and would be the easiest to find. However getting to her would be the trickiest part, having to both cross a desert and get through a sultan's palace to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter said he wanted to go to Ancient Greece, like Sparta, so he was probably in a greek, or greek-like, city state with a strong military based culture. Or was he one of those guys who mixed up Sparta with Athens and he was actually in a philosopher's city? Eugene wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's Lindsey. She said she wanted a \"modern\" fantasy. It was already bad enough that it was a vague definition. What's worse is that Eugene had no idea what would qualify as \"modern\" in a medieval world.

As he typed, the letters appeared in bright red on the tiny display screen, a multitude of small red lights forming the words. When he was done, Eugene pressed the 'ENTER' key on the keyboard and sat back to watch what would happen. The machine began to buzz and make several mechanical noises not unlike the sound a floppy disc would make as it was loaded into a old computer. The sound was harsh and metallic, and the group shared a look of concern with each other when the machine began screaming what sounded like an old dial-up Internet dial tone before suddenly, with a loud beep, all the noises stopped...And a latch opened on the sides of the machine's sloping dome, showing four hard plastic, primary colored game pieces: A astronaut, a alien and a retro styled robot and rocketship. And next to that flap, two big black buttons popped out of the side of the machine like two pieces of toast from a old toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both about the size of a thumb and, in faded and flecked away white lettering, were labelled 'TRADITIONAL' and 'IMMERSIVE'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CHOOSE A GAME MODE\" The game's electronic voice buzzed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, MORE choices, Peter groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we want to do guys?\" Eugene asked again, leaning forward and holding a finger over the buttons. Personally he sort of wanted to try Immersive mode, but again he wanted everyone to have a good time. It was why he had bought the game machine in the first place. There was only so much Internet and video games that someone could take in all this lockdown nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If we go 'traditional' then we'll probably have to, like, type in a bunch of stuff and wait for it to get printed out, right? I kinda want to see that\" Lindsey said, resting her pretty, Legally Blonde face on her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, let's just do this already. You and Lindsey can just tell us what to do if we do the DnD one\" Peter said, finally helping himself to a massive fist of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a round of discussion in which Peter largely tuned out because it was all nerdy talk, it was decided, the group would play their first game in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After another short discussion (and another slightly futile examination of the faded text on the game's box), the four friends decided that they'd try the 'Immersive' mode for their first run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go slow for me and Pete, okay? This stuff is new to us\" Judy said as she leaned took the popcorn bowl back to the common room's kitchen area. She was slightly disappointed it had vanished so fast...But then again Peter's hands were large enough to be digging buckets on construction equipment. He'd practically emptied the bowl in two scoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah DnD is pretty easy to pick up. Maybe it'll print out character sheets or something? I've got some spares in my room I can grab if we need them\" Eugene said as he pushed the big black button that had the word IMMERSIVE stenciled on it. The button slid back into the game machine with an audible click, and there was a whirring sound that emanated from within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, that sounds like an old VHS tape!\" Lindsey said as she marveled at the machine. It was, like, totes tripping all of her nerd buttons. She felt an urge to grab a screwdriver and take it apart like one of her computers and see all the old gizmos inside it...But she also didn't want to ruin Eugene's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IMMERSIVE MODE SELECTED. PLEASE SELECT YOUR AVATAR AND ENTER THE WORD PLAYER AND NUMBER ON THE BACK INTO THE KEYPAD. TYPE START AND PRESS ENTER TO BEGIN THE GAME\" The synthetic voice squelched, and the small tray holding the four game pieces slowly rose up until the astronaut, alien, robot and rocketship pieces were within easy reach of the four students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who wants what?\" Eugene asked, pointing to the figures, \"I figure if this is like DnD then they might stats or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs on the rocket!\" Lindsey said, plucking the small yellow ship out of the machine with two sparkling bedazzled nails, \"Um, guess I'm player 4\" She said after looking on the back, holding it out to show Eugene who tried to be cool about the attention his crush was giving him. The rocket really was retro styled, it was a pointy dart-like shape that had three fine near a tiny engine, and even had two ray guns sticking out the front with three little rings around each sphere topped weapon. The only thing that looked a little out of place for the time period was the small bridge that poked out from the top of the ship and its row of little yellow windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rocket?\" Judy called from the kitchen as she fixed herself a cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz it's sooo retro!\" Lindsey yelled back, \"This whole thing is so totally retro and I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll take the alien\" Peter said, leaning forward out of the couch and gingerly grabbing the tiny green, large foreheaded alien out of the tray. The jock looked at the number printed on the back of the alien, not really giving his chosen piece a detailed inspection, \"Looks like I'm player 2 Geno\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy, do you want the astronaut or the robot?\" Eugene said as Judy rejoined the group, sipping on the glass of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just take whatever one is left, its cool\" The goth said as she readjusted her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're cool with being a robot then I'm gonna be the astronaut\" Eugene reached forward and plucked the solid blue spacefarer from its cradle and inspected it. Much like the other game pieces, it was retro styled. The helmet was a bubble that linked directly into a collar of a poofy spacesuit that looked like it had been pulled out of a 1950s pulp comic. On the back of the astronaut was a white number 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm player one\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah but are you like, um, ready?\" Lindsey said, giggling at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that means I'm the automaton\" Judy said as she set her glass of tea on the table and plucked the tiny robot out of its perch. She stared at it for a moment with her dark brown eyes, the egg-shaped head with antennas sticking out from the sides, hands that topped ribbed tube like arms that stuck out from the front of the robot and its large, blocky feet. \"And by process of elimination, also means I'm player 3\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Give me a second...\" Eugene bent over and carefully typed in the information for each of them into the game machine. Despite the somewhat tedious nature brought on by the game's analog and primitive interface, he couldn't help but be excited. How long had it been since this game had been played? He definitely hoped it wasn't a disappointment and a waste of fifteen bucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we go!\" The geek said as he typed in the word START and with a little bit of dramatic flourish, pressed the enter key on the small keyboard...And frowned as nothing happened. There was just the same whirring noise from inside the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did it work?\" He said, looking around the machine for a newly revealed button or some indication that it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its busted\" Peter said with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it time to, like, think, okay? Old machines are old\" Lindsey offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my dad had something old like this when he was a kid. One of the old Nintendos. He said he had to blow on it to get the dust out or something\" Judy said, taking another sip of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you would have made me a glass, babe\" Peter said as he watched his girlfriend swallow a mouthful of the dark liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't ask so bleh\" She said, sticking a studded tongue out of her black lipstick colored lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banter, however, was cut short as the machine emitted a deafening fanfare of digitized sound, and the four friends covered their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGINNING STAR QUEST. ALL PLAYERS ASSUME STARTING POSITIONS\" The mechanical voice boomed on top of the pulpy soundtrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT! Turn it down Geno!\" Peter roared over the emulated trumpets and strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, there's no volume button!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys is anyone else feeling kinda...dizzy?\" Lindsey shouted, before her green eyes rolled up into her head and went limp in her beanbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey! What happened to...her...\" Eugene said, leaping from his seat before a wave of light headedness forced him back down. He cast a blurry look over at Peter and Judy, whose heads were lolling about as they slumped onto each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to...turn off...game\" Eugene muttered as the electronic anthem carried on, growing more muffled as a ringing filled Eugene's ears. He struggled to lift himself out of the chair, but the world spun and went black as he lost conciousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cold, sharp air filled Eugene's nostrils as his mind slowly regained consciousness. He groaned and pulled himself upright as he blinked his blurry vision, bringing a hand up to his head...Only to grunt in surprise as it palmed a surface that was definitely NOT his head. Instead it was smooth and hard, and come to think of it, most of what Eugene could feel was a large amount of padding as if he was wearing a heavily insulated glove. The world finally swam into vision, and the first thing the young man saw was an arm at least twice the size of his own currently plastered to a wall of slightly reflective glass some inches away. It was like staring at the arm of a huge winter coat, and was covered in a blue suit that had white pinstriping and nodules. Eugene moved his left arm to wave, and the arm resting on the glassy surface waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh no way!\" Eugene said, his voice coming out out of a grill near the base of what he could only assume was his helmet, a harsh voice that wasn't his own. With some effort, Eugene rose to his feet and bent over and stared down at himself the best he could; the rest of his suit being the same blue as his arms and covered in straps, nodules and other doodads that looked like a mix between the astronaut suits of the early 1960s and something clearly designed for fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" He whispered. He..He was the astronaut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a door to Eugene's right slide open as a tall, leggy, barely clothed woman stepped into the sparse chamber that Eugene had awoken in. It took the transformed student a moment to process that the creature he was looking at wasn't quite human, despite most of her body looking like that of a supermodel. Or a porn star. For starters, under the white and silver strips of what Eugene assumed to be cloth that barely covered her heaving breasts and hung off her wide hips and down over her crotch, her skin was entirely a shade pale green. Her face was mostly human, high cheekbones, puffy lips, a slightly upturned nose...But then the similarities stopped. Where the ears of a normal human would be were just two bony looking protrusions, sparkling silver chains hanging from each of them, and her wide black eyes that were filled with pinpricks of violet light, and her head was overall slightly swollen, her forehead riding up farther than what looked natural and two antennas stuck out prominently from her green flesh, topped with faintly glowing white orbs. Two tick...tails? Tendrils?...Tentacles? hung down off the back of her head and out from underneath a vibrant mane of hair that was rapidly shifting between bright red, white and blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2291\u235c\u2330\u22ac \u2307\u2291\u27df\u23c1, \u2359\u2291\u235c \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22ac\u235c\u238d!?\" The clearly alien female said in a language Eugene couldn't possibly identify, her voice high and breathy as she leaned against the door, her exquisite legs turned inwards, knees knocking together as she was clearly struggling to walk in topless heels that looked almost comically impractical, revealing tiny two toed feet. Her sleeveless arms were thin and lacked anything that Eugene could identify as muscle mass. And both of her hands were tipped in fingers that looked just slightly too long and only had four fingers on each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't understand you!\" Eugene said, taking a step back. Part of him was clearly turned on...But the sudden appearance of a real alien had taken him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u2385\u27df\u2385 \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u2307\u23c3\u22ac!? \u27df \u260a\u23c3\u22cf'\u23c1 \u238d\u22cf\u2385\u27d2\u2340\u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u22ac\u235c\u238d! \u235c\u2291 \u238e\u238d\u260a\u260d, \u23c1\u2291\u27d2\u2307\u27d2 \u2291\u27d2\u27d2\u2330\u2307 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u260d\u27df\u2330\u2330\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u22d4\u27d2! \u2359\u2291\u27d2\u2340\u27d2 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22d4\u22ac \u238e\u2340\u27df\u27d2\u22cf\u2385\u2307!? \u2359\u2291\u22ac \u23c3\u22d4 \u27df \u23c3 \u260a\u2291\u27df\u260a\u260d!? The alien chittered again, and took a uneven step forward into the compartment...Only to fall flat on her, well, breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene couldn't help it. Despite his fear he raced forward as best as he could in the cumbersome suit and knelt next to her, a heavily gloved hand outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, of course, was when the next visitor arrived, a seamless portion of a nearby wall sliding open and a retro-monstrosity clanking out, a clear glass head showing a multitude of spinning antennas, self-flipping switches, gauges and a Jacob's Ladder looking contraption that rose out of the mechanical mess, purple electricity constantly dancing upwards. It made a sound like an old fashioned calculator and began flailing it's stubby clamp-tipped arms about in a wild motion as it clomped forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS UNIT IS EXPRESSING SHOCK\" The robot boomed, \"UNIT WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS. UNIT DOES NOT LIKE THIS. UNIT WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO PLACE OF MANUFACTURE\" The robot's voice was deep and masculine and had a buzz at the end of each word. The mechanical being took another step forward before it stopped it's flailing approach, and brought it's primitive hands up to what Eugene could only assume was 'eye level'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wait...Judy!?\" Eugene gasped in surprise. His eyes felt like they were about to pop out of his head, and he looked down at the sexy green alien woman that was pulling herself off the floor. \"Oh god, PETER!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u23c1\u2291\u27d2 \u2291\u27d2\u2330\u2330? \u2359\u2291\u27d2\u2340\u27d2 \u2385\u27df\u2385 \u23c1\u2291\u27d2 \u23c1\u27df\u22cf \u260a\u23c3\u22cf \u260a\u235c\u22d4\u27d2 \u238e\u2340\u235c\u22d4!? \u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u27df\u2307 \u27df\u23c1 \u2307\u23c3\u22ac\u27df\u22cf\u260c!? \u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u2307\u23c3\u22ac\u27df\u22cf\u260c!? \u2359\u2291\u22ac \u23c3\u22d4 \u27df \u23c3 \u260a\u2291\u27df\u260a\u260d!? \u2307\u235c\u22d4\u27d2\u235c\u22cf\u27d2 \u23da\u27d2\u23c1\u23c1\u27d2\u2340 \u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u2340\u23c1 \u27d2\u2316\u233f\u2330\u23c3\u27df\u22cf\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u235c\u2340 \u27df'\u22d4 \u260c\u235c\u22cf\u22cf\u23c3 \u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u2340\u23c1 \u23da\u238d\u2307\u23c1\u27df\u22cf\u260c \u2291\u27d2\u23c3\u2385\u2307!

The alien woman said, looking up at Eugene with big dark eyes that glittered from within. Her breathing started to increase dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, if that's you, I can't understand what you're saying! You're speaking an alien language! Judy, can you translate what he's saying?\" Eugene said, looking back and forth between his radically changed friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Error. Error. Unit Judy is suffering from calibration errors. Unit Judy cannot translate without a translation matrix. Unit Judy desires to return to place of manufacture. Unit Judy does not enjoy this\" The Judy-bot said, wiggling it's tube-like arms as if it was anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm...I'm sorry! I didn't know this would happen! Wait...Where are we?

Eugene, I think I turned into the rocketship!\" Lindsey's voice crackled out through the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Eugene said, looking around him at the barren chamber in shock, and then out through the door which led down a rather empty, technicolor hallway that was lined with bright yellow pips, domed ceiling lights and doors that seemed to be random colors with no identification, \"Lindsey, where...Where are we, how did we get here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are currently orbiting Rigel-IV, captain\" Lindsey's voice lost it's accent and inflection suddenly as she spoke in a monotone voice, \"We arrived here on orders to meet the Jaxerion Warlord Nuk'ar and negotiate the release of Space Force hostages in return for saving his daughter, Solaria, who is currently in your custody\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like OMG, that was SO weird! I suddenly just KNEW all this stuff that I didn't know before! It was like a switch in my brain flipped or something, it felt SUPER weird! Eugene, I don't think I like this!\" Lindsey's bodyless voice said again, her natural way of speaking returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is...We're in the game!\" The newly minted astronaut said as he lifted Peter to his uneasy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Query: Captain Eugene, can you get your current crew out?\" Judy said, taking a thundering step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene shook his head, \"I...You say the rules. That must have been what it meant about playing our characters. It also means that we...\" Eugene looked down at his suited arms before grabbing one of Peter's arms and rolling it over as he gibbered in protest. There, on his hairless fore-arm, were five black bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be our life count\" Eugene said softly. He immediately regretted ever buying the game, this was just too dangerous, how could this even happen!? It was just a game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Eugene? I think there's like, another ship or something getting close. I can, um, hear it? I think I might have like sonar or something\" Lindsey said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"this must be level one. Well, I guess we have to start playing. Only way we get back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unit Judy is not okay with this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2291\u27d2\u2330\u2330\u235c? \u260a\u23c3\u22cf \u22ac\u235c\u238d \u238d\u22cf\u2385\u27d2\u2340\u2307\u23c1\u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u22d4\u27d2!? \u23c3\u22cf\u2385 \u2330\u27d2\u23c1 \u260c\u235c \u235c\u238e \u22d4\u22ac \u23c3\u2340\u22d4!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uneasy glance at his friends, Eugene turned and marched down the hallway, Lindsey guiding the group to her bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Alien Translator located here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lingojam.com/AlienLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">https://lingojam.com/AlienLanguage</a> ))</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eugene and his transformed friends had only made it partially up the single large corridor and ran the length of, well, another of his transformed friends and current crush when Lindsey's 'computer' voice spoke out over the series of speaker boxes that were located at the top of each otherwise blank door that led to a different compartment within her dart-shaped hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning. Warning. Incoming attack. All hands brace for impact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was immediately followed up by \"OMG THEY'RE SHOOTING AT ME! HELP! AAAAAAAAHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later a violent, deafening crash rammed into the ship-into Lindsey's side and Eugene dramatically staggered back and forth before knocking his bulbous spherical helmet against the technicolor wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2291\u235c\u2330\u22ac \u2307\u2291\u27df\u23c1! \u2359\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u2359\u23c3\u2307 \u23c1\u2291\u23c3\u23c1!?\" Peter cried out as he FELL dramatically against Eugene, his knockout curves pushing against  the teen turned astronaut's suit hard enough that Eugene could actually feel the curves. But the geek had little time to appreciate the feeling before another impact caused them both to go tumbling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Error. Error. Unit Judy cannot compute! Cannot compute!\" The robot that had just minutes ago been a short stacked goth girl buzzed as her torso started a full 360 degree spin as the collection of antennas, diodes and other mechanical doodads began to glow dangerously red within her transparent eggshell head.. Her simplistic jointed legs tottered back and foot on top of the large bricks that were now her feet, and the metal clamps that replaced her once delicate hands dangerously flailed about inches from Peter and Eugene's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u23c3\u23c3\u23c3\u2291\u2291\u2291! \u260d\u27d2\u27d2\u233f \u23c1\u2291\u23c3\u23c1 \u260a\u2330\u23c3\u22cf\u260d\u27d2\u2340 \u23c3\u2359\u23c3\u22ac \u238e\u2340\u235c\u22d4 \u22d4\u27d2!\" Peter squealed and buried his pretty face into Eugene's suit as his supermodel body shook with fear. Eugene's own face was filled with a carpet of multi-color hair that shifted across what had to be all different colors of the rainbow before then were suddenly bathed in harsh red lighting. Eugene pushed his changed friend off him, causing Peter to wobble and fall on his rather expansive butt with a angry sounding \"\u235c\u235c\u238e\", but he ignored the jock's intelligible muttering to face Judy, who in her panicked state and the grim lighting looked more than a little terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If she's left like this she's gonna explode or something!' Eugene thought as he looked at the bright, angry glow emanating from what had to be Judy's new 'brain'. He'd seen metal get that color before, in those 'will it melt' videos he watched on YouTube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You're gonna explode!\" He cried out, but his malfunctioning robot simply continued to spin and flail, shouting out \"ERROR. ERROR.\" In her booming masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. Uh...\" Eugene searched his brain for a solution as Judy's own grew brighter and brighter, and he could see the glass shell begin to scorch internally.  Maybe...maybe he had to give her a command? Like a real astronaut captain in whatever this 'Space Force' would do?\"Uh, UNIT JUDY, COMMAND DIRECTIVE OVERRIDE! INITIATE COOLING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMMAND DIRECTIVE ACCEPTED. INITIATING COOL DOWN AND REPAIR\" Judy boomed, her spinning body locking in place and a sharp screaming whistle began as a cloud of super-heated steam or gas or something spewed out from several different vent openings on her blocky body. Her arms went still and limp, and the glowing mass of metal that made up her new head began to cool as the electrical arcs between her pylons flickered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus\" The intrepid astronaut rasped. He turned and stared up at the nearest speaker, \"Lindsey, you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning. Warning. Structural integrity compromised. Hull strength at 42% and falling. Captain to the bridge. Captain to the bridge.\" Lindsey's 'ship' voice said calmly, which was instantly followed up by a loud cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOWWW! I'VE BEEN, LIKE, SHOT! I WANNA GO HOME!\" Lindsey said, her voice strained and wavering, \"OH NO, THEY'RE COMING BACK! WE'RE GONNA DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!. Pete, c'mon!\" Eugene yelled, taking off down the corridor towards the large heavy door at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, since he currently lacked anyway of being understood or understanding anything the strange astronaut, the creepy looking robot and the other voice were saying, simply looked at the retreating suited figure before looking at the deactivated automaton behind him, and then grimacing at the two fleshy Mt. Everests that he'd woken up with, giving one a squeeze while brushing the constantly shifting hair that was EVERYWHERE out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have told those nerds to shove it and just played some Madden. Where the fuck am I!? Who the hell was that!? Where the HELL are my THUMBS!?\" He muttered, staring at his new hands in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Eugene had finally reached the hatch that he assumed led to Lindsey's bridge. He spun the old fashioned crank latch until it unlocked with a heavy clunk and he pulled the door open with all of his strength, a creaking metallic grind ringing in his ears as it slowly swung open to reveal a room that looked like it had been ripped directly from the original Star Trek show, if only a little smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle was a single rectangular chair that floated in the middle of the bridge from what looked like thin...wires? There were two smaller chairs that were firmly secured to the floor just a little in front and below the central chair, two consoles of large blinking square lights and bulging screans that had the word 'WARNING' slowly flashing across them. The walls of the bridge were dotted with similar consoles, a sea of blinking toggles, switchboards, what looked like old fashioned computer servers with the giant tape reels, and on each side were three large circular portholes. At the very front of the bridge was a large window, and as Eugene focused on it, his breath caught in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in front of him stretched the cone of the ship as it came to a tipped point. But beyond that was the blinking black abyss of space (as portrayed in movies). And a massive neon purple planet floated there, encircled by rings of tumbling rocks that glittered like diamonds in the light of the distant giant star. This was something Eugene had long since made peace with never seeing. Space. He found himself blinking away tears as he took a hypnotic, slow step onto the blinking bridge, and the sight of another rocketship, much larger and resembling more of a 1950's monorail covered in spikes than the retro-styled rocket Lindsey had been changed into, slowly began drifting into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Was all Eugene could say as he stared out into the cosmic wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proximity alert. Hostile vessel within firing range\" Computer Lindsey said before her normal accent snapped back into place, \"EUGENE, DO SOMETHING NOW PLEASE\" She screamed, and her shrill cry roused the teen from his mesmerized state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Oh hell! Lindsey, is that the guy that shot us!?\" He said, staring at the angry approaching ship. He suddenly felt like he was being eyed by a shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. Scans have identified it as a Jaxonian warship. Their initial attack has rendered us combat ineffective. Ray cannons are offline. Shields are offline. Hull integrity is at 42%...Ugh, that is SO annoying, other me!, but yeah those are the guys that shot ME! they SHOT ME, Eugene!\" Lindsey said, her voice filled with anger and annoyance, \"Like, you didn't have to feel it! I feel like I've been in, like, a car wreck of something but I'M THE CAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Lindsey. I didn't know any of this would happen! I thought we'd just be playing DnD or something!\" Eugene gave an apologetic shrug, \"The girl at the store tricked me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, you have a incoming message from the enemy warship\" Lindsey said without any trace of emotion, \"UGH I HATE BEING AN ALEXA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, you mean we're being hailed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, captain. Shall I acknowledge it? And they, like, better not shoot me! Tell them whatever they want to get us out of here sooner!\" Lindsey said, playing back and forth with her 'other' self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah. Yeah put it on screen. Maybe this is how it's supposed to play out?\" Eugene said, making his way to the floating? Hanging? chair that he felt was HIS seat. He sat down slowly in it and half expected the thing wire, which didn't look all that different from fishing wire, to snap and have him fall on his ass. But instead it held his weight, and the moment he seemed to settle, the wires...disappeared? He wiggled the chair and it made a soft humming sound as it hovered in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh cool!' He thought to himself, but he had little time to play around as the starscape that dominated the screen blinked away, and was replaced by the looming figure of an alien...that looked exactly like Peter! Only this one was clearly a male, his head was larger, bald, a pair of horns were in place of the glowing antenna and a sinister looking goatee ringed his fanged mouth as two long Fu-Manchu strands of facial hair hung from his smiling mouth...With was filled with pointy teeth. The alien was dressed in an elaborate robe of silver and white that seemed to glow in the over-saturated color of the transmission, and was partially open, revealing a body-builder physique and a chest of jet-black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you have arrived\" The alien said in heavily accented English over Lindsey's speaker system, accompanied by an ominous string quartet. He pointed a silver-claw tipped four fingered hand directly at Eugene, \"Now I finally get to see the vaunted hero of the so called Space Force. Remove your helmet so that I, Nuk'zar the Dread, Supreme Warlord of Jaxonia, Conqueror of the Stars may speak face to face with the famous Captain...\"</span></div></div>",

Nuk'zar\u2019s lips were unreadable, and whether it was because Gene was on the verge of a panic attack or the whole alien-language-thing, Eugene couldn\u2019t tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gloved hands scrambled for the back of his helmet, counting one aaand <i><b>two</b></i>! Anxiously, he slapped it, hoping against hope for Monica to be some sort of space-age unisex name and for \u2018Mistress\u2019 to be a coincidental alien-homophone for something else. Miserable memories of awkward cons and public-speaking faux pas chose this inopportune moment to flash into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for his helmet to unseal\u2026 and waited. And waited. Nothing seemed to be happening \u2014 but the way Nuk\u2019Zar leaned eagerly forward brought Eugene pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He leaned forward as best he could in the bulky suit\u2026 which was easier than he was expecting. He must\u2019ve gotten used to the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he realized belatedly, he hadn\u2019t, unless the chill on his legs was from an excess of comfort. Heart pounding, he leaned forward, only to choke back a scream that was rather high pitched now that his neck-speaker was seemingly disabled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo from the <i>right</i>, realized Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bulky white suit was traveling up through a series of confusing folds, mechanical creases, and a whole lotta <i>click-chnks</i> that were extra<i>ordinarily</i> upsetting to have roaming up your body. His legs were\u2026 weird, too: they were a lot less hairy, and definitely tapered more than he was used to than he remembered before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was even able to keep up his denial when he saw the white kitten heels, rationalizing that it was probably to prevent muscle atrophy in low-grav environments, but when it reached his hips, a sense of dread resignation engulfed the geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShip-computer-Lindsey-whatever, <i>mute the line</i>. Or stop video-audio feed, what<b>ever</b>!\u201d he hissed, Nuk\u2019Zar\u2019s face twisting with indignance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour disgusting primate allure aside, you <b>cannot</b> cut transmissions with \u2014\u201d was all the warlord could get out before the vast expanse of the galaxy stretched across the hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, Capta\u2014<i>AGH GENIE YOU KNOW I <b>HATE</b> THAT,</i>\u201d moaned the compsci-major-computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m a <i>girl</i>, Lindz!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a period of nothing but the electric hum of the bridge before Lindsey responded. \u201cI think that I, like, <i>kinda</i> knew that, but\u2026  huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you <i>mean</i> that you <b>knew</b>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother electronic huff escaped the crackly speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, in my computer-brain, I dunno. It\u2019s just, uh, I\u2019m not <i>surprised</i> that you\u2019re Monica Maxwell, chief diplomat of the Sol system and <i>ohmigodyou\u2019re<b>stacked</b></i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit\u2019s inexorable progress had indeed reached Gene\u2019s chest, which was downright <i>intimidatingly </i>big. Maybe Judy tier. Maybe <i>beyond</i> Judy-tier. Gene hoped that maybe <i>anything</i> would look big from first-person, but the way they had just, well, <i>bounced out</i> was evidence of their magnitude. It also explained the spot of breathing trouble he had had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Why does everything here <i>suck</i>,\u201d pouted Gene in a breathy voice that he couldn\u2019t <i>believe</i> belonged to some sort of senior official. He wiggled in his seat to hopefully find an angle that didn\u2019t make his foil-latex whatever dress ride up but only succeeded in bumping his wide hips against the wire loop. \u201cWhy would you wear a dress in <i>space</i>!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Captain, Space Force research indicates that, throughout the seven currently known galaxies, that those of sex known to us as \u2018Female\u2019, generally wear garments that are more \u2018flowing\u2019 and \u2018revealing\u2019 compared to their \u2018Male\u2019 counterparts, and so a uniform embodying those aspects was promulgated amongst our female diplo\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you can stop, Lindz, sorry.\u201d Gene fiddled with the neckline of his dress, trying to pull it up over the vast expanse of cleavage revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Genie, be more careful.\u201d whined Lindsey, \u201cWell,\u201d she started, with an undercurrent of simulated mischief in her voice, \u201cI guess <i>redheads</i> <b>are</b> bitchier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha \u2014 OH COME <b>ON</b>!\u201d moaned Gene, who had finally caught the reflection of his now-clear helmet in the ship\u2019s vast window. Waves of red curls pressed up against the edge of the dome, the hair framing a face that, at the moment, was curled up into a pout, full wide lip pushed out into a dramatic pout, wide green eyes glittering with humiliation. \u201cWhy do I look like some kinda centerfold?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey paused before letting out a sigh of relief. \u201cThank <i>god</i> stupid Clippy-me didn\u2019t come back. I think that, like, we\u2019re retro-thingies. I look like Deep Blue, Jude looks like a windup toy, Peter looks like some kinda Trek-y alien babe, and you, uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>what</i>.\u201d hissed Eugene, who was trying to fix his face into something that looked less alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd, you\u2019re some kinda space pin-up model, <i>jeez</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of comforting, Compu\u2014\u201d Eugene blinked away the mistake with a flutter of his long eyelashes, \u201c\u2014uh, Lindz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was kidding about the bitch-thing, but it\u2019s totally true,\u201d Lindsey scowled with a bitter, electronic trill. \u201cI\u2019d roll my eyes if I, like, still had \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Eugene tried to take a deep breath to calm down, but it mostly just reminded him how tight his dress was, forcing him to doff his helmet with a hair-flick straight out of a shampoo commercial. \u201cThere\u2019s just... I\u2019m pretty stressed out right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me <i>too</i>, Genie!\u201d retorted Lindsey. \u201cI\u2019m gonna, like, dream of electric sheep \u2014 and yeah, there\u2019s a space guy who\u2019s <i>pissed</i> at us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene paled. \u201cShit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna <i>do</i>, Genie?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek knockout took a diaphragm-centered breath to not stretch out his dress anymore, unconsciously crossed his legs at the thigh, and decided to\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In all honesty she couldn't really, like, blame him. If she hadn't currently been several miles of data-tape, hard drives and annoyingly primitive cameras and speakers she herself might have been rendered speechless. But computers didn't have emotions, or at least not emotions such as 'lust'. The former sorority girl was quietly both thankful and terrified about that, and ever wary of the OTHER her that was routinely taking over her thought processes. Even now the part of her that was only the computer was feeding her information about her own new body; damage reports from the opening salvo of weapons fire, the amount of fuel they were burning, their relative velocity and even the air quality within her sleek hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what code I'm running on?' Lindsey thought idly to herself as she processed the information faster than she ever could before. Really everything happening between her <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">organics</span></span> friends and the alien dude seemed to be playing in slow motion, a testament to the power of her electronic brain (even if it was hideously primitive in comparison to her gaming rig, or her laptop) and she was already getting bored at how long everything was taking, especially with Eugene to absorbed by his own tits. Then her brain lit up as her new eyes/ears/nose/senses detected something outside the ship beginning to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ohmigawd!' Lindsey thought as the enemy ship powered up it's cannons once more, 'I am NOT, like, getting shot again!'. The feminine computer flashed through her archaic database and found a file called HVRCHR, which was currently toggled as active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder what this does?' She queried herself, and as her computer self responded, if she'd had lips, they would have curled into a mischevious grin. With chuckle that resonated through her speakers, Lindsey flipped the file's toggle from 'active' to 'inactive', and giggled in delight as the hoverchair in the middle of the bridge dropped like a rock and sending Eugene pouring out of it like some kind of buxom liquid as he was sent, squealing, to the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the HELL, Lindsey!\" The fleshy, not flabby nerd screamed at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! But we totes got a problem! That dude is powering up his weapons! I am NOT getting shot just because you can't handle a pair of titties, Genie!\" Lindsey growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! If he shoots me again we're gonna die! My structural integrity fields are, like, bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene pulled himself off the deck plating and stumbled to his feet, trying his best to straighten the WAY too short piece of fabric the game was trying to pass off as a dress and tried not to shiver at the cold, dry air caressing the inside of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine just put him back on the screen or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, captain\" Computer Lindsey chimed, followed by an annoyed sigh as the starscape shimmered away, replaced by the VERY angry looking alien that was called 'Nuk'zar'. Eugene fought back a chuckle as he realized the alien, from this angle, sort of resembled a green MegaMind, one of his favorite movies when he was a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You play a dangerous game, Captain Maxwell! But I am NOT some weak minded Iotalon!\" Nuk'zar growled, a four-fingered fist raised high in the air, \"Now you WILL listen to what I have to say or I will destroy your vessel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! I, uh, apologize! I think my ship is, uh, malfunctioning. Or something\" Eugene said with a sheepish smile and a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Lindsey grumbled, and flicked the hoverchair's toggle back to on, the sci-fi furniture lurching back into it's position and bumping Eugene painfully on his new rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" He squeaked, glaring upwards at the bridge camera and rubbing his new ass with a slender hand before he realized how sexy it must have looked as Nuk'zar's face was twisted into an outraged, toothy grin. Eugene coughed and pulled his hand off the supple flesh of his barely hidden rump and clasped them as tightly together as he could, silently fuming at how his breasts then squished together. Why was everything he was doing making him look sexy!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, uh, prepared to listen to what you have to say, uh, Nuk'zar\" He offered as diplomatically as he could. This seemed to please the warlord, as he settled his muscular green bulk back onto the gaudy throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. But first you have something, or rather someone, I want to see. Tell me Captain Maxwell, where is my daughter? What I have to say involves you both\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's face paled. Daughter? Wait did he mean Peter!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she's onboard your ship, captain. There is no sense in trying to delay further. But I do wonder, how were you able to understand her? She cannot speak Earthling, or even Martian. And her translation matrix is still in my possession...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That must be why we can't understand Peter!' Eugene mentally yelled as his eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perhaps the rumors of the Mistress of Mars being a unflappable diplomat are untrue. How disappointing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can you wait here for just one moment? I will, uh, go get him. Her. Go get your daughter, who is in fact a woman. Like, uh, me. Yes.\" Eugene fumbled, holding up a long finger before he turned and wiggled his way across the bridge, only stumbling in the ungainly heels once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not tarry long, Maxwell, you have already tested my patience!\" Nuk'zar growled from behind Eugene as the formerly tubby teen opened the bulkhead door and wiggled into the hallway, the heavy hatch shutting automatically behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie, I REALLY hope you've got a plan. Those guns of his are still pointed right at, like, me!\" Lindsey buzzed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter is playing his daughter, right? Well maybe he'll listen to 'her'?\" Eugene waved a hand in the air as he strutted towards the equally busty green form of Peter...Who was still feeling his new alien anatomy up while Judy's large, boxy form still stood inactive and hunched over, her mechanical brain dark and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETE!\" Eugene screamed, and the female alien's head jerked up from it's inspection of it's heaving breasts, the antennas on the former athlete's head bobbing and twisting while his hair shimmered between white and purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2359\u2291\u235c \u23c1\u2291\u27d2 \u2291\u27d2\u2330\u2330 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2-\u2359\u235c\u23c3\u2291\" Peter's sing-song alien voice began but then trailed off, as his large eyes grew even wider and locked onto Eugene's shifting breasts in the exceedingly small 'uniform'. He remained transfixed until Eugene grabbed him by his tiny arm, and he immediately jerked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey chicka, I don't know who you are, but what the HELL is happening!? Where are my friends!? Where's Judy? WHY AM I A CHICK!?\" He screamed back in a voice that was still way too high for his liking. The impossibly hot chick (maybe even as hot as himself, Peter had come to the realization that if he had been a dude staring at his current body, his dick probably would have shot straight off his body and exploded. And the athlete turned space princess wasn't sure why he felt so proud about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, I can't understand you and you can't understand me, but\" Eugene began pantomiming as best as he could, \"I. Need you. To come. With me!\" Eugene's arms and hands flailed about and he let loose a womanly groan of irritation as Peter took another step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Genie I think...Let me try something!\" Lindsey chirped from a nearby speaker. The comp-sci computer almost felt her data-tape scrunch in conversation as well as run in reverse as she played back her memories (which was, like, CRAZY) and focused on Peter, lifting his alien language out of the video recordings and stitching them together into an audio file. Honestly it made Lindsey feel a little like she was scrapbooking with her nana...Or possibly like one of those serial kills with newspaper clippings, but finally she had combined enough of Peter's recordings together to make what she hoped was a convincing enough translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u233f\u27d2\u23c1\u27d2 \u2359\u27d2 \u23c3\u2340\u27d2 \u22ac\u235c\u238d\u2340 \u238e\u2340\u27df\u27d2\u22cf\u2385\u2307 \u2359\u27d2 \u22cf\u27d2\u27d2\u2385 \u22ac\u235c\u238d\u2340 \u2291\u27d2\u2330\u233f! \u2307\u2291\u27d2 \u27df\u2307 \u27d2\u238d\u260c\u27d2\u22cf\u27d2!\" Peter's voice played over the communication system, a jarring mess of weird pronunciation and emphasis on the wrong syllables. But it seemed to work as Peter's eyes went from alarmed to..less alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Geno!? Dude, you're stacked! Not as stacked as me but...Wait, so who is the robot? Where's Lindz?\" Peter said with a giggle and twinge of...something towards Eugene. He should have been turned on but instead he just felt...defensive? \"Weird\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"nO tIMe! gO wITh HiM!\" His voice warbled back at him from the nearby speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment glancing back and forth between the speaker and the ungodly attractive redhead in front of him, Peter slowly stretched out a hand towards Eugene, who seized the spongy flesh and with ah arsh jerk, began pulling Peter towards the bridge, the sexy green alien letting out a complaintive grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, Lindsey!\" Eugene said, giving a nearby camera a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, f'sure!\" The digitalized blonde said with a giggle.Finally, they seemed to be making progress! As the two attractive females stumbled onto the bridge, the looming face of Nuk'zar twisted into a cruel grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, DAUGHTER!?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>In a shop that may or may not have existed, buried deep in some nearly abandoned portion of a nearly dead mall, a woman flicked her long hair as she watched the group mull over their choices through the primary security camera feed in her back office. Though the terms 'office' and 'camera feed' were a bit inaccurate, given how the woman could shift and adjust her view point with a wave of her hand, whisking it inches in front of Eugene's face without the overweight boy knowing or seeing anything. And she wasn't exactly using a TV to look through and was instead gazing into a large green portal that was projecting a live feed of the dorm's common room, all unseen and unheard. Magic was just like that, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the office could barely be called an office because it was barely larger than a normal sized closet, tiny, cramped and just large enough for the woman to sit in without losing circulation to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand cue the note card\" She whispered quietly as she used the magic to nudge one of Peter's subconscious thoughts into the forefront of the athlete's mind. As she watched the athlete's eyes glaze over as he spoke, she pulled out a keyboard and began typing, a small smirk on her face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows about Star Wars, right?\" Peter said after a moment of awkward silence, \"This thing looks like it was made for that movie so let's just do that\" In secret the football was more intrigued by sports, but he was currently the only sports enthusiast in the building, so he went with the suggestion that he figured would make the geeks happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, good idea Pete!\" Lindsey said, reaching up to shovel another handful of popcorn in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought I was only attracted to your muscles\" Judy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, well, Eugene was thrilled that they had picked his favorite topic to begin with. But right as the geek was about to enter the command into the machine and start their gaming experience, Peter suddenly lurched up from the couch and almost mechanically walked over and lifted up the machine with his hands, grunting at the surprising weight of the old plastic and circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! This thing is a LOT heavier than it looks. How'd you cart this thing all the way home, Geno? You've got, like, no muscles and this has to be at least a hundred pounds, easy!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! Be careful!\" Eugene cried out in annoyance, but his complaint was cut short as he spied...something attached to the bottom of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, curiosity satsified I guess...\" Peter went to place the machine back on the table but was interrupted by a loud \"WAIT!\" from his rotund and unlikely friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude there's something under it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I see it too!\" Lindsey chirped, and Judy un-beached herself and joined the group as they stared at the rectangular piece of...paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, much as I like showing off, can I set this down? It's starting to get, like, really heavy\" Peter groaned as the device's weight seemed to increase with every passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, 'kay...\" Eugene reached up and picked at the tape that covered the piece of paper for a moment before he turned and looked at the curious goth peering over Lindsey's shoulder, and then at the long purple and black nails that topped her fingers, \"Uh Judy, little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time has come\" She intoned far too seriously, while Lindsey giggled at the reference. The two girls had watched Kung-Fu Panda again the other day and Lindsey had been educating the surprisingly sheltered goth on what 'memes' were. The rainblonde scooted over as Judy took her place, a look of concentration on her slightly chubby face as she picked at the sticky adhesive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please hurry up?\" Peter groaned again as his face began to turn red and sweat began to bead up on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, man-slave\" Judy hissed, \"Half-rations for talking back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter groaned again and Lindsey erupted into a fresh fit of giggles, while Eugene blushed and looked away from his crush's pretty face, trying not to get too turned on by her laugh, her glittering eyes and, uh, her boobs (even if they were entirely dwarfed by Judy's). A minute or two passed in silence save for the scraping sound of Judy's nails...And then a triumphant \"I GOT IT!\" rang out as the purple haired sophmore pulled the paper free of the game's base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank GOD\" Peter gasped as he, somewhat violently letting the game flop back to the table with a lound CLANG. The athlete could feel his muscles burning as if he'd just spent the last few minutes in the weight room down at the sports complex on the other side of campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Peter!\" Judy scolded her boyfriend as he collapsed backwards on the couch, wiping away the sweat on his forehead with a muscled forearm. She handed Eugene the card before she stood and joined her boyfriend back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is NO way Geno carried that all the way from the mall here, that thing weighs a fuckin' ton! No, uh, offense, buddy\" Peter said with a loud exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken\" Eugene nodded, a neutral look on his face but inside he felt the sting of the accidental insult. He'd learned to tune out the insults of his weight and general lack of athleticism over the years but hearing his friend say it did hurt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenie, what is ittttt,\u201d whined Lindsey, sidling close and propping her elbows on Eugene\u2019s knee \u2014 far too close for the geek\u2019s comfort. \u201cYou\u2019re all mysterious n\u2019 stuff and I wanna knooooooooow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy tossed a knowing look at Peter, but the jock was staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling, his nostrils flaring as he sucked down air. The goth suddenly felt a little concerned, either Peter was far more out of shape than he looked, which could have been true given lockdown, but he still looked more than capable of lifting a video game. But before she could voice her concerns, she looked back to see Eugene handing the piece of paper to Lindsey, his face red as a beet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNotecard.\u201d He mumbled as jerked his hand away from Lindsey as the two brushed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainblonde seemed not to notice the boy's discomfort as she pulled the card in front of her and looked at it for moment, her eyes squinting in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh just read whatever it is already\" Peter whined from his position of the couch, earning him a dark look from the sorority girl before she gave a little cough to clear her throat (which sounded adorable to Judy) and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">To whomever this probably concerns,<br>\r\nHeya! If you\u2019re reading this now, you probably have excellent taste, or you just like looking at the bottom of random game boards, you weirdo!<br>\r\nSo I\u2019m supposed to keep things interesting or whatever, so I added in some more game for you!

The game did come pre-loaded...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can, like, restart it if they\u2019re boring too, so, go for it, Genie!\u201d cheered Lindsey, pumping an enthusiastic pink-nailed fist in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The woman grinned in her office as the group of students chatted about the turn of events. This was surprisingly more fun than what she'd been doing before. All things considered, this REALLY wasn't all that bad! She did feel a little bad about messing with reality to humiliate the jock, but she had felt like being a little mischievous with the boy, having felt a sudden spike of strange jealousy towards the boy. But now reality was restored and luckily things were proceeding fast enough that the group was already forgetting about the weirdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she had to do, as the students reached a consensus on what to do, was wait and see if she'd had to put on a costume or not. This was going to be so much fun, and definitely sitting around with nothing to do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're all decided then?\" Eugene asked his friends and receiving three nods back in return. They'd decided to push forward and try out what the notecard had suggested, and a thumbs-up Eugene began to type in...</span></div></div>",

The other three looked questioningly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the yellow wedge. Trivial Pursuit. History Questions. You guys have played Trivial Pursuit, haven't you?\" When the other three students shook their head, Pete couldn't help but laugh. \"I guess I'm the biggest geek here then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete relayed some of the background of his upbringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete had always been a physically active child, but academically, he was a bit slow. He wasn't stupid or anything. It's just school never caught his interest. The same with playing board games when he was growing up. The simple ones like Sorry were fine, if the weather didn't let him go outside. But anything more complicated than that quickly lost his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete scraped by in elementary and middle school, but only did that well because his parents had their own \"No pass no play rule.\" And even when he was small, Pete loved playing football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in eighth grade, Pete met Coach Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Runner was both the eighth grade football coach and its American history teacher. A number of coaches placed in this position would have relied on media presentations and rote memorization from their students. Coach Runner, however, took several trips to historical sites across the country during the summer, from Jamestown to Cape Canaveral. He had a way of making history interesting even to a student like Pete, who was only interested in keeping his grades up high enough to be eligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach Runner kept in contact with me after the eighth grade,\" Pete concluded. \"Believe it or not, my senior years, I had to take remedial math, and was barely getting by in regular English, but I made an A in Honors History. That's why I'm minoring in History. If I don't make the pros when I graduate, then when I start teaching and coaching, I can teach history, just like Coach Runner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also started playing Trivial Pursuit when my Dad's family got together once a month. I suck by myself, but everybody wanted me on their team for team play. I was always good for the orange and yellow wedges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three looked absolutely dumbfounded about this revelation of their football playing friend. Even Judy hadn't seen this side of Pete. Pete could have been insulted, but instead he just found the whole thing funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if this is Adventure History, I bed it's things like the Moon Landing and Climbing Everest and finding the Source of the Nile, and things like that,\" Pete theorized. \"I'm good at regular history, but I'm really, really good at sports history and adventure history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Eugene finally got out, still flummoxed at this unexpected intellectual facet of Pete's personality. \"So do you guys want to play the Adventure History Immersive or Traditional?\"</span></div></div>",

There might have even been some talk about steampunk in there. Pete was surprised that Judy was right in there with all the talk. But she seemed excited about the opportunity. And they all wanted to play the Lake Victoria immersive version of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete would have rather done the traditional form of the game. History trivia questions were more his speed. He thought this immersive game was going to be roleplaying or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pete was just as surprised as anyone with what happened next. As soon as Eugene selected 'Lake Victoria,' it looked like a hundred lasers shot out of that game console, blinding everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his vision returned, the world had changed in a big way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them were standing at the base of these huge waterfalls, that looked about hundred feet high, if not higher, and a quarter mile wide. Well, they weren't standing directly at the base, but they were close enough that they could feel a faint spray from the waterfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the weird thing. Pete had concluded that the lasers that had blinded him were projecting the image of the waterfall on the common room walls, But how do lasers make water spray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and the other players realized that the world they found themselves in wasn't just a laser display. And the first clue was the bodies they found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete found himself in the body of a five foot tall potbellied Asian man in his late forties who, though dressed in safari clothes, looked and talked like he was from those old movies about the Chinese-American detective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked and talked like that English actor who had played James Bond, then was in that movie with Robin Williams, where Williams played a nanny or something. Well, Eugene was a little bit more muscled in his new body than that actor, and looked like he had a three day beard on his face, but the resemblance was still remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey looked like Lindsey. Mostly. She was wearing a white blouse that clung to breasts that Pete was sure were larger than Lindsey had started off with in the real world. Lindsey was wearing a brownish skirt that fell to her ankles. Her hair looked to be reaching to the middle of her back, but it was blonde now, in a loose ponytail and had a slight wave to it. Her eyes were now an ice blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's appearance had changed drastically, though not as drastically as Pete's and Eugene's. Judy's hair was dark, long and straight now, reaching to her waist, and her skin was a dark olive color. She had also gotten a lot fitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete had always been turned on by Judy's body, and it wasn't like she was flabby. But she wasn't athletic like Pete was. She had a hint of a muffin top around her waist, her breasts were a bit saggy, and she had some junk in the trunk. Pete still enjoyed Judy's body, but he always wished she was in better shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was. And everyone had seen it. Because Judy had appeared in this world wearing a grass skirt, a pair of sandals, and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was so stunned, that for half a minute, Judy just stood there, her flat stomach and firm, large breasts on display for everyone to see. And Judy's breasts were very firm. Her dark brown nipples had hardened at their exposure to the air, and pointed slightly upward<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Judy realized she was exposed, she screamed and ran into a nearby tent, with Lindsey right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time that Pete had yelled out for the fucking game to end. The game ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was less than thrilled that Eugene had seen his girlfriend's breasts. That was going to be yet another thing on the list of things to pay Eugene back for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, Pete had to grit his teeth and suffer. Everyone else had fit bodies that were in their twenties, while Pete had an overweight, middle aged body. Everyone else had cool skills, while Pete's skills centered around camp management and detecting stuff. Who needed Sherlock Holmes in the middle of the jungle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete and Eugene were sitting in folding chairs in front of a campfire, surrounded by a circle of tents, and eating a meal that Pete had prepared. Pete had to admit it was pretty good, but he didn't want to be the group's cook and butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Judy emerged from one of the tents, with Lindsey carrying what looked like a rolled up map in her hand. Judy was wearing a dress like Lindsey's, though her breasts were really stretching out the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stared at Judy's chest, then quickly looked away. Judy still caught Eugene staring, and blushed in response. She also had a little smile on her face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy didn't even bother looking in Pete's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete added something else to pay Eugene back for, when this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was oblivious to the emotions simmering underneath the surface. Instead, she waved the rolled up document in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this in the supplies tent,\" she said. \"This is probably where we have to go, to win this game. It's a map to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that pissed Pete off more than anything. Pete was okay when Eugene was the little wimp hanging around. But now that the roles had been reversed, Pete didn't like it one bit. So Pete had promised himself to give Eugene a beating when the game finally ended, and things returned to the way they were meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you guys talking about it, before we started the game,\" Pete continued, \"But I didn't catch the details.\" What Pete could have said was that he wasn't paying attention, but he didn't see it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\"  Eugene began, but a melodious soprano voice interrupted him before he could continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the source of the fabled wealth of King Solomon,\" the voice explained. \"During the nineteenth century, when Europeans discovered the ruins of ancient city near the shores of Lake Mutirikwe in East Africa, they were baffled by its location. Numerous explanations were put forth for its existence, but the one that captured the popular imagination was that this ancient city had once served to shelter and protect the workers in King Solomon's mines in the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. Here, it was believed, could be found the source of the King Solomon's legendary treasure of precious metals, gems and magical artifacts. For several decades adventurers and fortune hunters sought the legendary mines, but without success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the camp firelight there stepped a beautiful brunette whose light olive skin and exotic facial features spoke of an Eastern Mediterranean ancestry. Her long dark hair was bound in a simple ponytail that reached to the middle of her back. She was dressed in the same \"Safari dress\" that Lyndsey and now Judy were wearing, and filled out the dress very pleasantly. There was a hint of mischief in her smile and, though she looked to be in her twenties, there was something in her eyes that hinted at an old soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes!\" Eugene said excitedly. \"This is the girl who sold me the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, Lindsey and Judy might have been stunned by this revelation, but it only made Pete see red. In front of him was the unknown girl who had put this whole insanity into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yell of \"You Fucking Bitch!\", Pete charged (or, considering his body shape, quickly waddled might have been a more accurate description) right at the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette didn't even blink. And one second, Pete was charing/fast waddling. The next, he was frozen in place. His breathing was visible, and his eyes were darting around, but otherwise, Pete was frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette eyed Pete a moment, then decided to</span></div></div>",

I want to go back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of them could react, though, Pete grabbed the game console and smashed it against the wall, sending thousands of pieces flying across the room, into the air vents...just basically anywhere and everywhere, where it could never be assembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why it kicked back here, and I don't care,\" Pete huffed. \"But if you motherfuckers think I'm going to allow something like that to do what it did to me ever again, all I have to say is fuck you, fuck you, and most importantly, fuck you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Pete stormed off to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, Eugene and Lindsey just stared in disbelief at the game, completely destroyed and beyond repair.

Some would be identical to ours, except maybe one little difference, like you miss a flight in one and don't in another, things like that. Some of the universes would be wildly different, like magic could exist in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're game here is from another universe,\" she said, pointing at the console. \"It's alive too, and has created an extension of its universe into the common room. And while we're in that extension, it can change us, or take us to different places, like it did to Pete. I don't know where Pete is, but according to the rules, at some point we should be able to bring him back. Actually, we have to bring him back, to end the game, and get out of this extension of the game's universe. The good news is, once the game is over, everything will go back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords appeared on the screen as the game replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>That's mostly true<br>\r\nBut not quite factual<br>\r\nThe winner's wish<br>\r\nCould make some changes actual<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also there are<br>\r\nThe Challenge Cards<br>\r\nSome can make changes permanent<br>\r\nBut those are very hard!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's that,\" Lindsey sighed. \"There are these Challenge Cards, which we'll get every three turns, or if we land on certain spaces. The rules are sort of ambiguous about what these cards are, but I guess we're going to learn about them in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we really don't have any choice but to continue playing the game, do we?\" Eugene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey shook her head. \"No we don't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that she had been out of shape before, but now she felt like she was in the best shape of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a buckskin dress with one strap over her shoulder. Her cleavage made her think the game had bumped her cup size from her usual \"B\" to a \"C\", and she could tell she wasn't wearing a bra, nor did she need one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress fell to her knees, and there were long fringes that ran along both the hem of the skirt and her bust line.

The fact that the game could change their bodies at all was mind blowing. Eugene was still convinced that, even after everything that happened, this was still all some very, very VERY sophisticated virtual reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, the screen displayed the following message (which was surprisingly rhyme free)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Yes Eugene, you read that right.

Lindsey got Eugene interested in physical fitness, and within two years, the two were running triathlons together. After graduation, Lindsey and Eugene got married and started a very successful dot com venture, making millions. They now have a small family, and one of their claims to fame is that they were major investors in the Jumanji remake and its sequel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what happened to the game?

The glow surrounding Eugene was so bright the other three had to turn their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the glow vanished, the three gasped at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still Eugene, but it was a different Eugene. It was a Eugene that might have existed if Eugene's parents had been Spartans, and sent their son at age seven somewhere to train and fight wolves in the snow for the next eleven years, before sending him off to a podunk college when he turned eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the laser had hit him, Eugene had been wearing an oversized T-Shirt with the college logo on it and baggy jeans. His reddish-brown hair had been unkempt, and his face, sporting spotty whiskers, hadn't been shaved in two days due to a combination of apathy and really, no necessity to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eugene who emerged  from the beam hair that was short and clean cut. His face had also been recently shaven with a straight razor. Eugene was only wearing regular jeans, and his bare chest was muscled and well defined. Not overly muscled, but you knew Eugene's total body fat was a single digit percentage. A <b>low</b> single digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's chest was smooth and unblemished, save for an odd tattoo of Celtic letters on his right pectoral muscle. There was an air about Eugene that made you think that, unless you had five heavily armed guys backing you, you would not want to fuck with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene, is that you?\" Lindsey asked, reaching out to touch him. Before her fingers could even think about reaching him, Eugene's hand moved faster than the eye could follow, grabbing her wrist. The grasp wasn't too tight, but it was just precisely the amount of force necessary to stop her hand's movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's this body,\" Eugene said apologetically, in a voice an octave deeper than he was talking with just a few minutes before. \"It has reactions and...sorry,\" he said, releasing Lindsey's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey tentatively reached out to touch Eugene's chest, and hissed in surprise when her fingers met flesh. \"I thought it was going to be like a hologram or something,\" she told Pete and Judy. \"You know, not really there. My hand would sink into the image and run into the real Eugene. But this is the real Eugene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey blushed in embarrassment when she realized that while she was talking, she had been lightly caressing Eugene's chest. She yanked her hand away as if his skin had suddenly become red hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you should touch him if you don't believe me,\" Lindsey added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stood up, curious, but Pete placed a hand around her wrist and pulled her back down to the couch. Pete was uncomfortable, jealous and perhaps even a little bit fearful of this new body of Eugene's, but he didn't want to show any of those emotions. So instead, he tried to pretend Eugene was the same wimpy, geeky guy he was just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Geno,\" Pete began, \"How the hell did this game pull this off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was about to plead his ignorance when another stanza when appeared on the television screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Wow, Eugene, I bet you think, <br>\r\nThat your new body is heaven sent,<br>\r\nBut how 'bout, what do you think,<br>\r\nIf I made your body permanent?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four players just stared at the screen, dumbfounded, until Eugene said</span></div></div>",

All the paths seemed to lead to a circle in the middle, with the word <i><b>MORPHMANJI </b></i>in the middle of the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom right hand corner was a blank square with the shapes of their four tokens in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black square appeared in the middle of the screen, with the following stanza inside it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Welcome to Third Wish<br>\r\nA Game That Will Shape Your Day<br>\r\nWould you Care to Review the Rules<br>\r\nOr Just Go Ahead and Play?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete wondered what the phrase 'Shape Your Day' meant.

Though the terms 'office' and 'camera feed' were a bit inaccurate, given how the woman could shift and adjust her view point with a wave of her hand, whisking it inches in front of Eugene's face without the overweight boy knowing or seeing anything. And she wasn't exactly using a TV to look through and was instead gazing into a large green portal that was projecting a live feed of the dorm's common room, all unseen and unheard. Magic was just like that, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the office could barely be called an office because it was barely larger than a normal sized closet, tiny, cramped and just large enough for the woman to sit in without losing circulation to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand cue the note card\" She whispered quietly as she used the magic to nudge one of Peter's subconscious thoughts into the forefront of the athlete's mind. As she watched the athlete's eyes glaze over as he spoke, she pulled out a keyboard and began typing, a small smirk on her face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if this is Adventure History, I bed it's things like the Moon Landing and Climbing Everest and finding the Source of the Nile, and things like that,\" Pete theorized. \"I'm good at regular history, but I'm really, really good at sports history and adventure history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought I was only attracted to your muscles\" Judy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Eugene finally got out, still flummoxed at this unexpected intellectual facet of Pete's personality. \"So do you guys want to play the Adventure History Immersive or Traditional?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the group had time to discuss their options, Peter suddenly lurched up from the couch and almost mechanically walked over and lifted up the machine with his hands, grunting at the surprising weight of the old plastic and circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! This thing is a LOT heavier than it looks. How'd you cart this thing all the way home, Geno? You've got, like, no muscles and this has to be at least a hundred pounds, easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Be careful!\" Eugene cried out in annoyance, but his complaint was cut short as he spied...something attached to the bottom of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, curiosity satisfied I guess...\" Peter went to place the machine back on the table but was interrupted by a loud \"WAIT!\" from his rotund and unlikely friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude there's something under it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I see it too!\" Lindsey chirped, and Judy un-beached herself and joined the group as they stared at the rectangular piece of...paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, much as I like showing off, can I set this down? It's starting to get, like, really heavy\" Peter groaned as the device's weight seemed to increase with every passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, 'kay...\" Eugene reached up and picked at the tape that covered the piece of paper for a moment before he turned and looked at the curious goth peering over Lindsey's shoulder, and then at the long purple and black nails that topped her fingers, \"Uh Judy, little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time has come\" She intoned far too seriously, while Lindsey giggled at the reference. The two girls had watched Kung-Fu Panda again the other day and Lindsey had been educating the surprisingly sheltered goth on what 'memes' were. The rainblonde scooted over as Judy took her place, a look of concentration on her slightly chubby face as she picked at the sticky adhesive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please hurry up?\" Peter groaned again as his face began to turn red and sweat began to bead up on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, man-slave\" Judy hissed, \"Half-rations for talking back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter groaned again and Lindsey erupted into a fresh fit of giggles, while Eugene blushed and looked away from his crush's pretty face, trying not to get too turned on by her laugh, her glittering eyes and, uh, her boobs (even if they were entirely dwarfed by Judy's). A minute or two passed in silence save for the scraping sound of Judy's nails...And then a triumphant \"I GOT IT!\" rang out as the purple haired sophmore pulled the paper free of the game's base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank GOD\" Peter gasped as he, somewhat violently letting the game flop back to the table with a lound CLANG. The athlete could feel his muscles burning as if he'd just spent the last few minutes in the weight room down at the sports complex on the other side of campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Peter!\" Judy scolded her boyfriend as he collapsed backwards on the couch, wiping away the sweat on his forehead with a muscled forearm. She handed Eugene the card before she stood and joined her boyfriend back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is NO way Geno carried that all the way from the mall here, that thing weighs a fuckin' ton! No, uh, offense, buddy\" Peter said with a loud exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken\" Eugene nodded, a neutral look on his face but inside he felt the sting of the accidental insult. He'd learned to tune out the insults of his weight and general lack of athleticism over the years but hearing his friend say it did hurt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenie, what is ittttt,\u201d whined Lindsey, sidling close and propping her elbows on Eugene\u2019s knee \u2014 far too close for the geek\u2019s comfort. \u201cYou\u2019re all mysterious n\u2019 stuff and I wanna knooooooooow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy tossed a knowing look at Peter, but the jock was staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling, his nostrils flaring as he sucked down air. The goth suddenly felt a little concerned, either Peter was far more out of shape than he looked, which could have been true given lockdown, but he still looked more than capable of lifting a video game. But before she could voice her concerns, she looked back to see Eugene handing the piece of paper to Lindsey, his face red as a beet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNotecard.\u201d He mumbled as jerked his hand away from Lindsey as the two brushed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainblonde seemed not to notice the boy's discomfort as she pulled the card in front of her and looked at it for moment, her eyes squinting in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh just read whatever it is already\" Peter whined from his position of the couch, earning him a dark look from the sorority girl before she gave a little cough to clear her throat (which sounded adorable to Judy) and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">To whomever this probably concerns,<br>\r\nHeya! If you\u2019re reading this now, you probably have excellent taste, or you just like looking at the bottom of random game boards, you weirdo!<br>\r\nSo I\u2019m supposed to keep things interesting or whatever, so I added in some more game for you! Just type 'HISTORY MODE #2, #3', etc and it'll load in some entirely new stuff! <br>\r\nJust give \u2018em a type, I\u2019m sure that you might maybe possibly potentially conceivably like them! Have fun!<br>\r\n~U.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S.  ;) </div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have to read \u2018winky face\u2019?\u201d asked Judy, a contoured eyebrow curved with doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emotional context is important.\" Lindsey said VERY seriously, nodding her head slowly before another grin cracked through the facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo these are, like, custom game modes?\u201d pondered Peter as he pulled himself back up to a sitting position as his body seemed to recover. \u201cThey might be zanier than the default ones it came with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing this on the box,\u201d murmured Eugene, lost in thought. \u201cIt sounds like it'll load in different, uh, scenarios for historical stuff? The game did come pre-loaded...\" History was somewhat Eugene's strong suit, he'd grown up watching Jeopardy! and trivia games like Cash Cab after school with his mom when she had been sick, and had even been part of his high school's scholar bowl team! But his stage fright had kept him benched most of the time, no one wanted a quiz member that froze up in front of an audience so he was more of the 'practice dummy' for the more sociable members of the team. But still, between knowing general history, pop culture and wikipedia dives, Eugene was fairly confident that if this was some kind of trivia game he'd be able to do pretty well at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe impress Lindsey, she seemed to like smart guys. She certainly hadn't shown any interest in Peter, and Eugene's athletically inclined friend was considered pretty hot property that he'd overheard plenty of cheerleaders lamenting that was currently owned by Judy. So maybe...Maybe he had a shot afterall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can, like, restart it if they\u2019re boring too, so, go for it, Genie!\u201d cheered Lindsey, pumping an enthusiastic pink-nailed fist in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The woman grinned in her office as the group of students chatted about the turn of events. This was surprisingly more fun than what she'd been doing before. All things considered, this REALLY wasn't all that bad! She did feel a little bad about messing with reality to humiliate the jock, but she had felt like being a little mischievous with the boy, having felt a sudden spike of strange jealousy towards the boy. But now reality was restored and luckily things were proceeding fast enough that the group was already forgetting about the weirdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she had to do, as the students reached a consensus on what to do, was wait and see if she'd had to put on a costume or not. This was going to be so much fun, and definitely sitting around with nothing to do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're all decided then?\" Eugene asked his friends and receiving three nods back in return. They'd decided to push forward and try out what the notecard had suggested, and a thumbs-up Eugene began to type in...</span></div></div>",

She was a big fan of adventure racing and all the related events. She had always wished she had the discipline to train for such events herself. She had tried to get Pete interested in binge watching all those kinds of shows while they were all quarantined, but Pete didn't even want to feign interest in them. If it wasn't a traditional sport like football or hockey or soccer, Pete didn't consider it a sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete didn't even notice the excitement at the possibility in Judy's voice, but Lindsey and Eugene certainly did.

He pulled out the four tokens. The first looked like a single dumbbell, and was a tan color. The second was a carabiner, and was silverish. The third was a two piece bikini, colored purple, with a tan torse connecting the two pieces.

Hey, Judy, you ought to take the bikini. You fill the top of one real nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed, not looking down at her sizeable breasts. Eugene and Lindsey both pointedly did not look at her chest. Sheepishly, Judy did as her boyfriend directed her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that leaves the carabiner and the sash for me and you,\" Eugene told Lindsey.\"You know anything about rock climbing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I know everything about being a modern day gypsy,\" she laughed. \"And that sort of looks like the sort of thing a gypsy would wear. Do you mind?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Eugene answered. Lindsey smile and took the sash from Eugene's palm, leaving him the carabiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Pete began to ask. And would have asked, if the world of the four students wasn't suddenly composed of nothing but a blinding white light and a screeching noise. Thankfully for the four of them, unconsciousness took them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all four awoke, they found themself standing on a tall cliff, dressed in strange outfits, their bodies changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Pete wasn't dressed in strangely, nor had his body changed. He was wearing the cleats, socks, shorts and shirt he worked out on, when getting ready for football. Of course, the pandemic had prevented him from getting his preseason workout, so he was a tad out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, though, wasn't out of shape. For from it. He was wearing climber shorts, and from his belt was hanging several carabiners and one chalk pouch. He was bare chested, and had a trimmed beard (something he had been unable to grow in real life). Eugene didn't have Pete's big muscles, but he was definitely lean and ripped, and his abs had the classic six pack he hadn't ever bothered fantasizing about having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy also found herself looking trim. She was wearing denim shorts and a bikini top and her stomach, though not defined in the same way that Eugene's new body was, was definitely flat. Her hair was no longer darkish purple, but was a lighter violet. All her piercings and such, even in her ears, were gone, and her face looked freshly scrubbed and makeup free. Her violet hair was bound in a single braid, which hung down to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Lindsey was also taking in the new changes of her body. Lindsey had always been in a good shape (she was a cheerleader in high school, which had put her in good standing with her sisters in Gamma Upsilon Rho Lambda), but she instinctively felt she was in the best shape of her life. She looked down and found herself wearing a leathery two piece jungle girl outfit, with her arms, legs and midriff bare. Her breasts were at last a cup size bigger, and she wasn't wearing a bra, but they were so firm she didn't need to. Her rainbow colored hair seemed a bit brighter, more lustrous and full, and now hung loosely to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four looked at each other, taking in their new forms, Lindsey blurted out, \"Holy shit! I know things! Martial arts and running obstacle courses and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do obstacle courses too,\" Eugene added. \"Climb rock and ice and mountaineering and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to sail and kayak and make lean-tos and purify water and...\" Judy chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three chattered about what they knew, Pete looked on disgruntledly. He hadn't changed at all, and hadn't somehow magically learned anything at all. He was tempted to say the other three were bullshitting, except he couldn't argue with how their appearances had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eugene,\" he interrupted, feeling left out, \"How is any of this happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some really, really advanced virtual reality program,\" Eugene answered, reaching down to touch his own stomach. \"But I have no idea how.\" Eugene had washed his slight potbelly just that morning, but now he had washboard abs to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how we all know this new stuff,\" Eugene added, having not noticed that Pete hadn't contributed to everyone's excited litany of newly acquired skills, \"I haven't a clue. It sounds like something from that old Wesley Snipes movie. What was it, running man, demolition man, burning man?\" Eugene shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is all pretty cool,\" Lindsey said, as she did a standing flip, which got applause from Judy, \"But what do you think we should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waiting for her to answer that question, glowing letters appeared above the four:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Welcome to the Jungle<br>\r\nWe've got fun and games.<br>\r\nCopyright prevents me from singing<br>\r\nBut I'm not naming names<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo read very carefully<br>\r\nHere's the basic rules<br>\r\nYou really should learn them<br>\r\nSo you don't act like silly fools<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start the game with five lives<br>\r\nIn Latin, that's a Vee<br>\r\nLose one, and you get another chance,<br>\r\nLose five, and well, you'll see<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things will happen<br>\r\nSo just be happy, and let things flow<br>\r\nBut there are a few things<br>\r\nWhich the answer is always no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo forward, follow prompts,<br>\r\nBe careful, and it'll be fine,<br>\r\nIgnore directions, or act contrary<br>\r\nAnd your ass is mine/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Other rules will be made apparent as the game progresses)</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules hung in the air for several minutes as the four silently read and reread them, before they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was clear as mud,\" Pete groused, still upset in this strange game that he obviously wasn't given the same advantages his three friends go. \"Can we end this game? I really don't want to play anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see an obvious off switch,\" Lindsey observed. \"Or a prompt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they took in their surroundings,the four found themselves on a high cliff, looking over a deep chasm, There was another cliff about a hundred feet on the other side of the chasm, with no obvious way of getting across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the cliff were a set of stairs carved in the rock, leading downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we take the stairs down,\" Judy observed. As the group was about to take the stairs downward, a chime sounded, and more letters appeared in midair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Your first task is simple<br>\r\nJust cross the log<br>\r\nBut if you fall<br>\r\nYou'll break your nog.</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What log are they talk---\" Lindsey began, when a long board appeared, bridging the chasm. The board is about a foot wide, and looks solidly anchored by large rocks on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four look at the board, when<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsey ran up and hugged him, and he found himself enjoying the feel of her body pressed against his new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was look you've been doing it all your life, right?\" Lindsey said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly how it felt,\" Eugene agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy searched her memories, and found ones with her walking the masts of a tall ship. There were even memories of her doing so during storms, without a worry. Focusing on those memories, she began her crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Eugene and Lindsey before her, Judy found her body knowing exactly what she needed to do. And like the other two, she crossed the log with ease. The three friends exchanged a group hug, then turned their attention back to Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy, Pete,\" Judy yelled to her boyfriend. \"Your body will know what to do,\" she added, not knowing that Pete, unlike the other three, hadn't acquired any new skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Pete knew he hadn't. He began regretting just snatching the dumbbell token out of Eugene's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete looked at the log, and decided he would just take it slow. Watch his feet, not look down, and take it nice and slow. Count his steps, and in no time at all, he would be on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Pete stepped on the log. In a matter of minutes, Pete</span></div></div>",

Womanly screaming. The forest above shook and crashed as someone tall, lithe and thin landed on her ass. Her dark hair was tied in a loose braid, and her breasts were certainly filling out the blue latex jumpsuit she was wearing. Her legs were barely covered by a pair of booty shorts, and her feet were wrapped in stiletto heels. She couched once from the small cloud of dirt drifting lazily past her and then froze, her brown eyes wide as she slowly looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! I'M A FUCKING CHICK!\" She screamed, flailing her arms in panic, not knowing how to handle the sudden jiggling her body was experiencing. The red text over the chasm faded as next words formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Welcome back to yet another try<br>\r\nI've helped you out you see<br>\r\nYou should find the crossing now a snap<br>\r\nNow shut-up, go, be calm you ditz, don't you freaking cry</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman suddenly calmed as light faded from her eyes. She looked at her body, clearly curious, but the panic was long gone replaced by...Well maybe by nothing as she began curling the end of the brain in her fingers. She eventually stopped staring down into her compressed cleavage and spotted her speechless friends on the other side of the gap, and her eyes brightened as she gave them a goofy wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, OMG hey guys! Look at me! I'm TOTALLY like super hot now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Peter!?\" Judy gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Jude! Like, best song EVER! But yeah it's totally me! But um, let's stop yelling! It's totally messing with my, um, voice thingy!\" The woman rubbed her slender throat with a feminine hand and pulled herself upright with a girlish grunt, now several inches high than she had been in her normal body as she walked towards the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Peter don't-\" But Judy stopped in mid-scream as the girl that had been her boyfriend strutted across the board with no difficulty at all. IT barely even swayed or bowed under her long, confident stride, her enormous heels clipping and clopping one in front of the other, Peter looked pretty bored by the entire experience. And then she was on the other side of the chasm and towering over all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that was, like, super easy!\" Peter giggled, striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter? How...But you- I don't-\" Judy fumbled for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a stripper, Pete!\" Lindsey couldn't help but giggle. But it wasn't her normal, air-headed giggle. It was a nervous giggle of someone realizing that maybe, just maybe, they were in over their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what's with...the...\" Eugene was about to point out how Peter was acting, the polar opposite mannerisms and speech patterns, but the look his formerly male friend was giving him was pretty distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heeeey Genie\" Peter purred, walking away from Judy, her eyes fixed solely on the now last man standing, \"This game is, like, really fun...Maybe whenever we get done we can play another...game?\" Peter practically threw himself at Eugene, his new assets on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Was all the geek could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No FUCKING way.\" Judy growled, \"This is not happening. HEY GAME, WHAT THE FUCK GIVES!?\" Judy screamed into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the words appeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Oh poor Judy, don't get be a bore<br>\r\nYour boyfriend was always a bit of a tripper<br>\r\nBut not anymore, bring on the catwalks galore!<br>\r\nNow go on, lest he stay a stripper!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is...this is BULLSHIT! Change him back! Or I'll...I'll fucking smash you with a hammer when we get out of here!\" Judy roared, giving the canopy of trees the finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>That's so cute, a little threat<br>\r\nBut onwards the game must go!<br>\r\nThe next path you face, a challenging race<br>\r\nYou better win before you get all wet!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, too late, silly words!\" Peter giggled, leaning heavily against Eugene, staring down at the clearly uncomfortable geek as Peter's ruby-tipped nails traced paths across his new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking kidding me?\" Judy hissed, staring angrily at what had once been her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross\" Lindsey looked away from the scene in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was a rush of wind, and a thick wall of fog closed in around the previous area, blocking out the chasm while the fog wall behind them fell away. In front of them, at the bottom of a steep, muddy slope, was an obstacle course made up of several different paths that hung low across a wide river that sat in front of a colossal, thundering waterfall. A massive mesh canopy soared above the course, sheltering most of it from the hot sun that was now directly overhead as the mist and fog curled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" Peter gasped in  simple amazement at the obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rotting rope bridges, several having already collapsed partially or completely, leaving what looked like a series of parkour platforms hanging over the river. There were several enormous fallen trees green with moss but otherwise sturdy and straight, thick hanging vines and, sticking out of the rushing water, a multitude of rocks and boulders. On the far side of the river, up another muddy bank and anchored securely into a cliff-face, was a metal platform with a large red buzzer on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before anyone could ask a question, the sky overhead darkened and there was a rumble of thunder, followed by large, heavy drops of rain that quickly turned into a full on downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, my hair!\" Peter cried out in dismay as she clung to Eugene, who wanted to be exactly anywhere else but there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think we gotta get over before the river floods!\" He yelled over the downpour, pointing at the obstacle course, which was, thanks to the canopy, dry save for the spray of the clearly rising river, \"I think the buzzer is the goal! We have to get there before the water takes out the paths!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't the game say it was a race?\" Lindsey yelled back, her soaked outfit clinging to her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So I guess whoever gets to...the buzzer first...wins?\" Judy trailed off as the the three friends shared a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what are you silly bitches talking about?\" Peter giggled despite having his hair, like, totally ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another, louder crack of thunder directly overhead and the three competitors took off, sliding down the muddy embankment towards the course as the river continued to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! LIKE, WAIT FOR ME!\" Peter cried, strutting after them as fast as he could, and screaming as the soaked ground slid out from underneath him, sending his curvy form speeding down towards his friends in a mudslide.</span></div></div>",

But at least they were out of the sudden downpour of rain and under the massive tarp that stretched the length of the obstacle course. He stomped on the plain metal, dislodging as much of the mud as possible and otherwise cleaning off his gear..And then sneaking a peek at Judy and Lindsey, who were wiping the mud off their new forms with similar dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's so hot' Eugene thought and tried not to be too obvious about staring...But then he didn't have to worry at all, as a high pitched, girly scream came from above where the woman that used to be Peter lost her footing and began messily sliding down the embankment...And bringing most of it with her as a mudslide began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...RUN!\" Eugene cried out to the two girls as he darted forward the first path he saw: The water-bound boulders that were slowly disappearing beneath the white-topped rushing water of the river. His rapid movement felt strange but also natural, most likely in part to the knowledge that had been bestowed to him by the game. He scampered across the stones, heading for a larger, more vertical rock that was clearly designed to test his new climbing ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls blinked in confusion, turning to see what the newly fit geek was fleeing from...only to see the blue-clad Peter, his over-done angular face screeching in absolute terror as he flopped hard on the metal next to them, the rest of the bank close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!\" Judy and Lindsey screamed in unison, and they turned towards their own respective paths, Lindsey racing for the vines and broken bridge platforms. The muddy haired girl carefully climbed on top of the metal landing's railing and pushed off, leaping onto a dangling vine and swinging across to the first of many different platforms that were hanging precariously in different states of disrepair. The soggy wood creaked as Lindsey lined herself for the short wall run she had to make next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy herself eyed the deceptive safety of the more intact rope bridge and made her move towards it...only to look back at the muddy form of Peter, who was whimpering dumbly in the growing mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh GET UP YOU BIMBO!\" Judy screamed, and wasted valuable seconds to pull Peter to his heeled feet and shove him towards the path made up of slippery long logs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like-\" The jock turned stripper whined, but Judy was already gone, jumping over the rising mud and onto the rope bridge, which swung perilously from side to side as she started to make her way across. Judy grabbed both of the mossy, thick robes and began to take each step as quickly as she could as the bridge attempted to start barrel rolling...Or just fall apart entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Poop!\" Peter cried with a petulant stamp of his muddy heel as he tip-toed (literally) out onto the first log, using his newfound (but hadn't he, like, always had it?) balance to stay upright despite the slick moss and his mud encrusted heels and body, \"This is, like, the WORST vacation EVER!\"</span></div></div>",

Ahead of her was a trail of vines and collapsed bridge sections; some hung vertically, creating wall-like sections while others were flat like the one she stood on now and spaced between thick vines that hung down from above through slats in the tan-colored canopy. Here and there were metal bars that hung from thick chains and presented some form of swinging challenge. Some of the platforms rocked and bucked while others looked safe and still, and at the far end was a huge gap that was punctuated only by single rotten looking boards, vines and several rusty metal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just like those old Prince of Persia games!\" The sorority girl thought to herself with a grin. She had always been good at those games, so that skill had to translate over to...whatever this was. It certainly felt like real life...But real life didn't work like this. But she had all these skills in her head now and this new body, so it couldn't be all that hard right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a careful step back to give her just a little more space to get up to speed for the wall-run section ahead, took a couple of quick breaths and pushed herself forward, her muscled legs pumping as she raced across the section of collapsed bridge she was on. There was the ledge and...NOW! Lindsey leaped into the air, her body tilted at just enough of an angle to maintain momentum across the wall board....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she screamed as the board flipped end over end from her landing and she went crashing, hard, into the water below, bouncing off a barely visible rock with a loud \"OOF!\" before disappearing beneath the current. There was a chime as Lindsey fell from the sky and landed noisily on the muddied platform at the start of the obstacle course, a red <span class=\"clred\"><b><i>5</i></b></span> turning into a <span class=\"clred\"><b><i>4</i></b></span> appearing above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" She cried, pulling herself through the (thankfully) slowing mud to start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Judy was making progress. She figured that she had the easiest path, after all outside of Peter's current...situation, her body didn't seem the same level of athletically inclined as Lindsey and Eugene were. All of her knowledge seemed more focused on general survivalism, and she wasn't sure how filtering the rushing water below into something safely drinkable would help her in this case. And she didn't see any sailboats or kayaks rushing down the rapidly flooding river, so she was stuck with traversing the long and rickety bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step she took was slow and careful, testing the weight of each board as she moved forward. Some were sturdy enough to put her full weight on, many were dangerously soggy, but many of the boards were simply in such bad condition that they snapped with the slightest touch, dropping into the water below with a CRACK and a SPLOOSH. And each board lost, the bridge became more unstable, it's rocking more severe as it swung back and forth above the river, trying it's best to buck the goth off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll...have to try better...than that, game!\" Judy sneered through the struggle of holding onto the moldy ropes as she neared the halfway point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the collapsing river bank behind her caused the bridge's supports to loosen, a sudden slack catching Judy off balance and she stumbled forward directly into a patch of weakened boards, all of which snapped and fell away underneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME O-\" She howled as she tumbled into the rushing rapids, feeling the sting of the impact and the sound of water rushing up around her. Than the soaked goth was falling, landing knees first back on the starting platform, waist deep in the sucking mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK this game!\" Judy hissed as she fought her way out of the mud, ignoring the live counter over her head as it subtracted a life, bringing her down to four. She stepped up to the even more rickety bridge and began her slow trek once more, the water now just a little bit closer and rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was having more luck than the others, the rocks he was clambering across gave him a height advantage from getting wet. He was moving like a fluid pro. First he'd practically skipped across the first few rocks, slippery as they may have been and landed safely on the first of six different shaped boulders that sat astride the river like large fat men taking a cleansing bath. The first boulder had been easy, the hand-holds apparent and obvious as he'd made his rock up it's vertical bulk to the flat top. The next rock seemed a little trickier, there were not as many hand-holds and they were spaced apart...And the only way to the top seemed to be a deep crack in the side. He'd have to use a carabiner to get to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Geno\" He said, calling himself the name that Peter calle-well, used to call him before the game transformed the jock into a brain-dead stripper. He risked a look at his transformed friend who was making his (or would it be her?) way slowly and steadily across the first fallen tree, wobbling every few steps and saying something that her couldn't hear because of the roar of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Peter's moving so slow, so I can't rely on him. This is my fault, he's stuck like that because of me. We're all stuck here because of me! I'm the only guy left and I have EPIC muscles...I've gotta save us!\" Eugene psyched himself up, allowing a macho feeling her very rarely felt fill him up as he gave the rock ahead a serious look. He gripped a fingerless gloved hand around one of the carabiners and with a wordless shout, took off running across the boulder he was on as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heroic looking geek just didn't remember to take into account that rocks in rivers often had tiny divits and pools where water spray collected and were not perfect running tracks. Right as Eugene approached the edge, he splashed into a small puddle of clear water he hadn't seen, felt his ankle slip and twist under him, and the teen left loose a muffled \"WHAAA?\" as he tumbled over the edge of the boulder and impacted with a heavy thud near the bottom of the second, sticking just enough to the rock-face to realize he'd messed up before gravity peeled him off and dropped him unceremoniously into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chime sounded and Eugene fell through the air, landing on the mudslide and sliding face-first into the collected mud on the platform below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEH!\" He spat and looked above him to watch his life counter tick down one life. He spit out more of the cloying wet dirt and crawled over to the rocky starting point, looking on in despair as the river had almost covered the smaller stepping stones. He was running out of space! With a groan Eugene pulled himself up and began his trek once more across the drowned terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd meanwhile, unnoticed by all of his other friends including that, like, dreamy hunk Eugene, Peter was continuing to make his way across, putting his cat-like balance to the test and just not looking down at the totally scary amount of water that was rushing past beneath the path of fallen trees. His breasts wibbled and wobbled, his ass jiggled to and fro, but Peter knew his body (despite having only been in it for a grand total of about fifteen minutes) and trusted his perfected stripper skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, totally gonna speak to the travel agency about this!\" He muttered in his childish voice, trying not to scream as he felt the tree dipping lower as it's perch on the muddy bank grew softer and weaker. \"I'm, gonna totally have someone, like, fired! I'm SUPER sure this isn't the way to the spa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter let loose a terrified squeak when he reached the second fallen tree that was lower and closer to the water, lodged in place against a craggy pile of boulder-ettes. It was SUPER slippery, and after a long moment of, like, deep thought while he rested his glorious rear on the edge of the fallen tree, Peter removed his heels and dropped carefully to the log below, his manicured and painted toes squishing in the slick layer of moss that had grown across the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo, not my nails! UGH THIS IS SO GRODY!\" Peter whined as he began making his way across the second log, ruined heels dangling from his tiny muddy hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsey jumped on the  first vine on her chosen course and swung carefully back across to the first wooden platform, steadying herself as it swung lazily from side to side. The sport teen stood there for a moment, watching the wall section she had just tried to run across continue to sing back and forth, and she kicked herself for being so...well, dumb. Of COURSE it couldn't have worked, there was too much slack in the line and the section wasn't connected to anything! She should have read the terrain better before wasting one of her lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept of multiple lives was also something she wasn't trying to think too much on. If this had been real life and she'd done that...She would have been dead. A shiver not totally related to the cool air of the overhead storm or the wind racing through the river canyon crept down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, focus Linds\" She said to herself, \"You still have to get a running start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey walked over and inspected the vertical sections of the ruined bridge and realized that there were several areas where, if she was careful, she could crawl along one before leaping to the other. Then she just had to make that fine up ahead to the next platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems...simple enough\" Lindsey said with a shrug. She moved back to the start position on her platform, took a deep breath...And sprinted forward, racing across the boards and with a mighty leap, reached out and...snagged her hand in one of the gaps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" She screamed in exhilaration as she pulled the rest of her body up onto the section and with a excited giggle, began crawling across it towards the second section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy struggled on the slippery wood, now having to climb up at a bit of an angle due to the new slack from the bridge's supports coming loose and having the added challenge of all the loose wood she had stepped on before being completely gone, leaving a haphazard path back to where she had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First it takes my boyfriend, then it MURDERS me...fuck this game. I don't care if my body feels great, just...fuck this thing\" Judy muttered as she leap-frogged from solid plank to solid plank, using engaging her core muscles as she launched herself back up the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ropes twisted and turned from the rough action as the bridge began to violently swing from side to side, and Judy screamed in terror and frustration as it spun completely upside down as she approached the gaping hole where she'd lost her first life, her legs leaving the uncertain safety of the boards as she hung suspended over the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! NOT AGAIN!\" Judy roared as she clung tightly to the ropes, her hands aching from the exertion as her knuckles turned white. She wasn't going to lose another life! She had to win...She had to get Peter back! After a moment terrified desperation, she began pulling herself upwards, redistributing her weight as she hooked a leg around one of the bridge's rope supports. She grunted again and swung her other leg up, securing herself in the ropes and from another plunge into the greedy white waters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! TAKE THAT, ugh, GAME!\" Judy screamed in primal fury. She carefully rotated herself upside down and began pulling herself along the upside down bridge, blinking water out of her eyes as she grinned like a mad woman at her progress (and the fact that even she had to admit, this felt pretty damn awesome like an action movie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene skipped along the disappearing path of smaller stones as carefully as he could, the rushing rapids of the river consuming his path forward far more quickly than the others due to their proximity to the water. Before they'd been a comfortable four or five feet above the water line, but the river was rising so rapidly that now they was being constantly splashed and soaked by the flood waters, making Eugene's trek quite risky as he nearly slipped twice on his return trip across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" He swore as he pushed off the final stone and onto the first boulder, right as the rising tide swallowed the rock whole. He looked back and groaned with worry; the entire path was now GONE! He'd have to try one of the other paths if he wanted to cross the river...And outside of the three taken ones, the only path left was the rather risky looking two vines that he'd have to crawl back up the muddy embankment to get to...And then swing like hell and hoped he wasn't just mistaking environment detail for part of the actual competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut time for reflection was over as water lapped against his climbing shoes, and Eugene forced his new body to move as he clambered up the rock with less ease than he had before, given his soaked and doubly muddy clothes. But he made it once more to the top, swinging a leg over the lip of the boulder and pulling himself up with the leverage. He hung there for a moment however, feeling his muscles ripple and flex, expecting a burning pain...Yet all he felt was exhilarated energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is what Pete always feels...felt like?\" The normally overweight boy wondered, and then he pulled himself on top of the boulder and made his way, much more carefully this time, to the far lip and inspected the second of the three massive stones he had to cross. Running and jumping was out of the question, what with all the deceptive pitting (biopitting, his knew knowledge based warned him) that caused him to fail the first time. Now that he had taken the time, he spied a small grouping of potential handholds one the backside of his own boulder. They'd allow him to get a better, more secure base to leap across onto the second boulder, rather than his reckless movie star stunt that had ended in failure before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong, not dumb\" Eugene mumbled to himself, reminding himself to not get overly reliant on his new body as he lowered himself down for a second traverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Peter, poor Peter, was still inching her way across the second large log, squealing each time the log rocked was the water rushed against it, threatening to dislodge it from it's precarious perch on the disappearing rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, like, don't think about it girl!\" She whispered to herself, keeping her eyes locked straight ahead, her legs mincing forward like she'd done a thousand times before at work. This was, ummm, this was like no different than her routine! Yeah! Just ignore all that totally super grody stuff squishing between her cute little toes and messing with her pedi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log rocked again, harder this time, and Peter screamed as she tilted dangerously from side to side, her assets threatening to lose their delicate balance. Her heels clopped together as she stuck her arms out trying to regain her balance and she felt the added weight of the mud-laden stilettos pulling her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WooAAAhhh!\" She cried, and Peter gave her beloved heels a pouty look before she released them from her tiny hands, the heels dropping beneath the rising water with a PLOOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were, like, my best pair! Like, I'm totally never coming here again!\" Peter slowly regained her balance as the log shifted below her, tilting slightly upwards. The stripper took a nervous ragged breath, refocused on the log's horizon, and tried to play the music of her routine in her head as she moved towards the end of the log. Ahead of her were a collection of large flat stones that would take her up towards a shining metal pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I, like, know ALL about poles...\" She thought airily, thinking of a certain pole she'd prefer to be looking at, stealing a glance over at the super hunky Eugene as he heroically leaped from one big rock thingy to the other like a total movie star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her tiny feet started to lose traction, and Peter shook the errant thought from her mind as she looked away. She, like, didn't want to go swimming in some dumb river! She was pool-side only!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus it would, like, totally ruin my hair\" She pouted, already forgetting her black mane had been ruined on her tumble down the hill, now being filled with mud, twigs and properly soaked all the way through.</span></div></div>",

The footholds were certainly a great help, but now he <i>had</i> to jump. With a galvanizing motivation of him leaping across, getting the third boulder in no time, slamming his massive palm down on the button, with Lindsey <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">and Peter</span> cooing in admiration at his feat, he <b><i>leaped\u2014</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grabbed onto the slick surface of the boulder, scrabbling for a solid hold as the breath was driven out of him. Thankfully, his hands managed to grab what he feared he couldn\u2019t, and Eugene sagged spread-eagle atop the curved surface of the great boulder, a sense of relief suffusing his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill one more to go, Geno,\u201d he mumbled, standing up to attempt the final jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stared at the vine in her hands. She tugged it. Picked at it with an errant fingernail. Was this\u2026 really what she had to do? Swing a vine across a thirty-foot crevasse? This was something for, like, Tarzan, not <b>her</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had to do it. People could get <i>hurt</i>. And, uh, Peter\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey afforded a look at the spandex-clad football-player, practically tip-toeing through the muddy riverbank, squealing and shaking (his? her?) hands with disgust with every step through the muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey shivered. Eugh. So totally not her type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a running start and a mighty yawp, the girl jumped off the platform and onto the vine \u2014 which held her weight securely this time \u2014 soaring through the humid jungle air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grit her teeth as she stretched limb after burning limb across the worm-eaten bridge planks.

Judy looked down \u2014 up, whatever at the grinning visage of her girlified boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should <i>totes</i> try not to fall!\u201d cooed the stripper with a thumbs up that might have meant to be encouraging, all before strutting off across the remainder of a moss-slick log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d Judy growled at the game, the slutified parody of her boyfriend, whatever. With a mighty jerk to the left, then right, then left again, Judy <b>yanked</b> the bridge to the side\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd back to an upright position, miraculously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEAT. <i><b>SHIT</b></i>!\u201d was screamed at the canopy, before Judy realized that <i>yeesh</i>, she better get moving before the ropes gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen the some<i>thing yad-da</i> done, <b>girls</b>!

Her cute widdle toes: encrusted with mud and bits of lichen. Her tight shorty-short shorts had a rip in \u2018em at the right hip: kinda smexy, but, like, a di<b>sas</b>ter for her routine \u2014 she was supposed to show \u2018em what was covered, not, like, what was already hanging out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, deserving of a pout. Peter did so as she combed her hair, fortunately the one last thing to be untou\u2014 <i><b>wait</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that, like, a <i>twig</i>?! And \u2014 Peter choked back a wail of despair \u2014 a split end?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <i>gawd</i>, she\u2019d have to get a haircut, an\u2019 she <i>totes</i> wasn\u2019t, like, built for short hair an\u2019, an\u2019!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sagged in despair, the swell of her tightly contained breasts <i>plapping</i> gently onto her thighs. This <i>sucked</i>. What was, even, like, the point of this? All these rocks might give her <i>muscles</i>, and, like ruin her whole look and she didn\u2019t <b>wanna go on\u2014</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mighty \u201cOOF\u201d of effort drew the smudged-mascara eye of the former football player. It was that <i>hunk</i>, Eu-genie, doing a movie-star leap onto the metal-thingie that, <i>unf</i>, did wonderful things to his sculpted bod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting a full lip, Peter swayed to her feet and took a step on a stone. Maybe some hunky lovin\u2019 would take her (mostly empty) mind offa things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene clutched at the slippery corrugated metal with both thick hands before he could get a leg up. With a heavy sigh and, still, less effort than he was expecting, he made his way up, and \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOALOOKOUTGENIE!\u201d sounded from his left, and the a-dork-nis darted forward just in time to avoid getting kicked in the face by Lindsey, who braced her landing surprisingly effectively against the wall with both arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa-uh,\u201d Eugene stammered before collecting himself with a deep breath. \u201cNice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Genie, I, uh \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle, <i>ugh</i> help, please?\u201d sounded from their collective right, and the two whirled around to see the now-braided Judy, who was a rotted-timber-leap away from the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe totally have you.\u201d \u201cJump, Jude!\u201d sounded in unison as Judy braced herself and did so, soaring through the air into her friends awaiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group kneeled, crouched, and sat down collectively to catch their breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was the first to stand up, travelling resolutely towards the button, hand outstretched, before a \u201c<b><i>Wait</i></b>!\u201d stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swinging-sorority girl did so, looking at the purple-haired athlete who had bid so. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, JR?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took in a great breath, grimaced, and pointed a dirty-nailed finger at her erstwhile boyfriend, who had flopped herself, breast-first, onto a large, flat stone. \u201cI <i>huff</i> think we should let Pete get the button. Maybe it\u2019ll <i>heugh </i>un-bimbofy him, because I swear to God, if he \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired model had caught sight of the group, and waved enthusiastically at them \u2014 or rather, the person whose nickname she was elatedly cooing. \u201cHee<i>eeeyyyyy</i>y, Genie~!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group collectively shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe, like, makes it sound so <i>wrong</i>,\u201d groaned Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo \u2018ffense, Geno, but if he, <i>yeurgh</i>, <b>grinds himself</b> on you again, I think I might punch you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few short hops along the large, flat rocks that appeared much like a flight of stairs leading up and away from the still rising water, Peter arrived at the final stony platform that had a long, metal pole sticking out of it, one that led all the way up to the safe platform above. She looked up and blinked the drops of water out of her eyes and silently rued to whatever, like, god there might have been that there would be hell to pay for her ruined make-up...But then her face brightened as three familiar faces popped over the side, three sets of eyes wide in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, she just focused on one specific pair of eyes. Deep, dark, broodingly handsome eyes that made the damp chill she felt (and showed since her, like, titties were pushing HARD against the wet top she was barely wearing now) fade away as heat bloomed from inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie!\" She called out with a loving (and suggestion) blown kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up here you stupid bimbo!\" Judy shouted, her face red with exertion and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like whatever bitch. A real man wants a REAL woman' She thought with a grin, her plump lips parting to show her perfect teeth as she gave Eugene another smile. She reached out with a stained hand and did her best to ignore the, like, totally RUINED paint job on her nails as she swung lazily around the pole. She hooked a leg around the pole and leaned back, her cleavage swelling to full display as she gave Eugene a wink as she began her normal routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to god I'm going to murder him, then you, and then I'm going to bust this game to pieces if we get out of here Eugene!\" Judy growled as she watched the...thing that had been her strong, loving befriend flirt with the now ripped geek, who was caught between trying to look concerned at the plight of his friend, but was clearly more enamored with the now spinning pair of tits that just happened to have the bare minimum of a person attached to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure\" Eugene stammered, and knelt down to hid the find that his dick was starting to stiffen. And given how much more 'substantial' it now felt, he didn't want to reveal it to Lindsey and Judy. Maybe Peter if she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AUGH NO, BAD BRAIN!' The geek reprimanded himself as certain...thoughts entered his mind. Below, Peter just giggled as she spun around on the slick pole, wishing she could be on a certain other slick pole. But there was something hypnotic about the way that physics moved on Peter's soaked body. It was hard to look away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, men!\" Judy snorted in disgust and pushed herself away from the platform, moving to the other side and staring at the still rising water of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she-uh, HE knows what to do?\" Lindsey said, sitting down on the platform and dangling her powerful new legs over the side as she too watched the show below. It was pretty nice but she'd seen better. Probably a 7 out of 10 at best.  But the water beneath the stripper was still rising as the rain continued to fall from what she HOPED was just a simulated sky, already splashing up over the first of the three rocks Peter had just climbed. After a moment of silence she looked over at the formerly rotund rock climber and gave him a bop on the shoulder. \"Hey Geno, you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh. OH!\" The physical contact seemed to finally jerk Eugene out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Genie!\" Peter whined seductively from below, \"Don't stop! A girl, like, needs an audience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a new roar of water as the river rose dramatically, quickly rising up and engulfing the second rocky platform. A snap of wood drew all of the group's attention as Peter's own path was destroyed as Eugene's own path was on the verge of submersion. Judy's bridge bounced rattled as the water began racing across them, and then with a loud CRACK the bridge was pulled away, the rotten planks disappearing under the water as destroyed, rotten ropes smacked the water. After a few moments the only path left unscathed was Lindsey's, and Peter's final rocky outcropping that he now stood upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIKE OMG!\" Peter cried, a formerly manicured hand shooting up to cover her practiced 'O' mouth in shock. That was, like, super scary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! We've got to get her, I mean him, up here! If he dies no telling what the game will do!\" Lindsey said, looking back at the large red button. Eugene couldn't help but look at Lindsey's new and improved bust as it went on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy followed the blonde's gaze from the other side of the platform and narrowed her eyes as she stomped over and placed herself protectively in front of it, \"Uh uh! This might be the only chance I have of getting MY boyfriend back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but if we beat the game, maybe it just all resets!\" Lindsey pleaded, rising to her feet and clomping noisily across the grated metal until she was face to face with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and what happens if we DON'T leave? Or if we go back but we're STUCK like this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Eugene turned his gaze back to Peter, who was whimpering helplessly as water began splashing onto the rocky outcropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genie! Help me!\" She cried up to him, her big, brown, dull eyes glittered with a wetness that wasn't from the rain and the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked back to see Judy and Lindsey now snarling in each other's faces, Judy slapping down Lindsey's outstretched arm as she tried to muscle her way past the fit former goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I WILL! Just help me!\" Peter cried again, letting out a shriek as the water began eagerly slithering across the rock's surface towards Peter's bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, just climb the pole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I caaan't!\" The transformed quarterback displayed her lack of athletic ability as she clumsily tried to pull herself up the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamnit!\" Eugene facepalmed at his sexy friend's stupidity. How was he going to convince her to get up there? She was doing just fine when she was...dancing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's eyes lit up as he leaned back over the platform's edge as Peter squirmed in the very small dry patch of rock left, \"Hey baby, can you dance for me? Let me see some, uh, flying tits? Like you showed me at the club last night?\" The geek put on his best 'suave' voice (not that he had much experience, instead just pulling from his video game and movie knowledge base to give him a rough approximation of a 'hot' male voice). It was a gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to trigger something in Peter's dull eyes, and she bit her lips in excitement as she reached out and caressed the pole, her Ariana Grande routine song beginning to play in her otherwise empty head. Her hand slid up and down the pole suggestively before she leaned against it, pressing the cold metal between her breasts as she slowly began spinning once more. First she went down, squatting low as what was left of her shorts split a little mote, and then she rose up, stretching her body out and whipping it around and around as she flexed as posed in a manner that made Eugene's dick want to detach itself from his body and launch itself at Peter's busty form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround and around she spun, her feet rising away from the rock as the water rushed forward. But Peter was in the zone, her eyes closed as she just remembered that night at the club. Seeing Eugene for the first time as she spun around the pole, her girls hanging low in his face. She'd smiled at the awed, horny look in his eyes as she'd plucked the dollar bill out of his fingers with her lips...The night growing longer as she'd met him on the floor afterwards, guiding him to the backrooms. The REAL backrooms where girls like her could get...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Peter's eyes snapped open as she felt hands on her, the startled cries of her man and the two other girls they'd, like, gotten stuck on the tour group with back at the hotel. Peter let go of the pole and shrieked as she began to fall, but three pairs of hands pulled her up and over the lip of the platform, and the group collapsed backwards with a mighty OOF! as they pulled her out of danger. Peter felt something long and hard and warm pushing against her in all the right places as she laid on top of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey tiger\" She giggled quietly, and leaned in and pressed her lips against Eugene's. She flexed her hips against his groin, her hands traveling across the rock climber's smoking hot body. She, like, had to thank her hero...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO. FUCK NO. FUCK THIS WHOLE PLACE!\" Judy screamed, darting to her feet as she watched her boyfriend start grinding once more, and with a mighty feminine roar she reached down and grabbed Peter, who let out a wordless screech of terror and dismay as Judy DRAGGED the flailing stripper over to the big red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so fucking done with this\" Judy hissed as she grabbed one of Peter's hands by the wrist as the stripper attempted to claw at her attacker, spun him around, and forcefully pressed the tiny hand that had once been able to palm a basketball down onto the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment nothing happened. And then there was a thunderous buzzing noise as the rain stopped, the clouds parted and the river quieted. And there, in front of all of them, red words appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Wow! She did it! She won the race!<br>\r\n\u2018Slow\u2019 and steady indeed!<br>\r\nI think such a show of grace and poise<br>\r\nMight earn Peter back his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first a prize for the lovely dish!<br>\r\nA reward for not failing once!<br>\r\nGain back a life you silly girl<br>\r\nAnd make a single wish!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, huh?\" Peter said, wrenching herself free of 'Jenny' and rubbing her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes went wide. This was it! She reached out and grabbed Peter by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, this isn't you! Please, wish yourself back to normal! Say 'I wish I was back in the body I started with'! Please!\" Judy's voice began wavering as she stared into the dull, confused eyes of what had been her boyfriend. She just wanted him back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked at her, and then at Eugene, who reluctantly nodded.</span></div></div>",

I...I really miss you, babe!\" Judy's voice continued to crack as her emotions started to get the better of her. She just wanted her boyfriend back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of VERY hard thought, Peter nodded slowly, which seemed to make everyone, especially the girl in front of her who pulled her into a huge hug, happy. The girl was, well, tiny compared to Peter's own assets but she had to admit that it felt kinda nice...? Or, like, a little familiar, at least. After a moment the girl pulled herself away and wiped a stray tear from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, chill girlfriend! I got this!\" Peter said with her best winning smile, patting Judy on the head before turning and facing the weird floating words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, word-thingies, I ummm\" Peter trailed off, looking back at the other girl who rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I wish I was back in the body I started with'\" Judy said conspiratorially, fearful the game might do something ELSE to Peter...Or her, if it thought they were cheating. She didn't put anything past this nightmare machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" Peter's eyes lit up as she spun back around, \"I wish I was, like, back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gasped in fear at the wrongfully worded wish. That wasn't what she'd told him to say at all! But then there was another chime from the heavens as the words shifted into new shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\"So you have wished it, so it shall be!<br>\r\nEnjoy your old form restored!<br>\r\nBut it seems a little easy, don't it?<br>\r\nAnd then again, I could be pretty mean...\"</b></i></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud chiming noise as Peter's buxom, uber-sexy body disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\" Judy cried out, the game's last weird rhyme driving a cold wedge into her heart. It...Was it like the Djinn? Would it twist the wish in a way that they didn't want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Judy had little time to wonder as there was a loud scream and a CRASH as once more fell from the sky. The impact shook the metal platform, and the three standing friends wobbled and stumbled as they tried to keep their blaance.

His face was definitely the same, but gone was the layer of flab that game had given him. Instead he looked...Mostly the same? Maybe slightly leaner, his muscles not quite as rippling as they had been originally. His clothes were different as well, more of a mesh-fabric that had protective padding along his joints and along his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what just happened? Where...Where the hell is that stupid plank?\" He asked dumbly, looking around the platform and the river below it in confusion. \"Wait...HOLY SHIT YES! I'M A DUDE AGAIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pe...Peter, babe, is...is it you?\" Judy asked as she reached out a hand to stroke the bare muscles on Peter's forearms and the jock recoiled in surprise before bursting out into a loud guffaw that echoed through the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the hell you guys did but YES!\" Peter laughed again and swept Judy up in a wide embrace and spun on the metal platform, the similarly transformed goth squealing in surprise and delight before the two passionately kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Eugene sighed in a mixture of disappointment and relief. HE was glad his friend was back but still...'Petra' had been so into him, and so hot. There was a part of him, a dark part, that was hoping that SHE would have stayed. Next to him Lindsey saw the downcast looked on his face and gave him a reassuring shoulder-bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was below all of our leagues anyway, Genie\" She said softly, and the formerly flabby geek gave her a look before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you! I missed you SO MUCH! I was afraid you were...That you were...\" Judy said as they finally parted, happy tears streaming down her face as she buried her head in Peter's chest, feeling the firmness of trained and toned muscles instead of the soft squish of womanly breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I was what? The last thing I remember was that I was a chick and then I...fell asleep? I don't remember a damn thing, babe. Did you guys carry me here or something? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. You're back.\" Judy gave her boyfriend a tight squeeze and closed her eyes, thankful that the game had chosen to be nice instead of evil, for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked over to Eugene and Lindsey in confusion, and Eugene simply turned away, his face red as Lindsey just gave the reunited couple a thumbs up and a knowing grin. He gave the two a look before kissing the top of Judy's head and returning the squeeze, birdsong filling the quietness before there was a loud chime in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what!?\" Judy snarled as he eyes snapped open, searching wildly for a moment before locking on the red words drifting into existence between the four players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>Aw, how sweet! Lovebirds in the aftermath!<br>\r\nBut a tender moment does not long last<br>\r\nChoose your vehicle, proceed down the path<br>\r\nDon't worry about accuracy, you gotta go fast!</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rustle behind the platform and the group spun around, watching in wonder as the fog pulled away, vines and trees shuffling aside and revealing a path that led into what was clearly the next area: A large open field where a quad-bike, a hang glider attached to the back of a rugged looking single-cab truck, a strange looking mini-sub encased in what looked to be rappelling gear and, on the edge of the engorged river, a yellow kayak and paddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, MORE!? Do we have to?\" Judy moaned in annoyance as she eyed the assembled equipment, \"Let's just go home! WE got Peter back, let's just quit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, 'got me back'? Hang on, what happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh babe. It isn't important\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think it kind of IS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't quit, Jude! You saw what it, like, did to Peter! If we quit who knows what it will do to us? The only way out is to, like, win!\" Lindsey interrupted the two before another long explanation would slow them down even more. She was digging this body but seeing Peter get...erased like that, becoming a entirely different person? All for sassing the game and failing to do what it wanted? That scared the shit out of her, and had convinced her that the only out was forward. And she desperately wanted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Judy started but Lindsey let out a frustrated groan and stomped off the platform, her boots clanging against the metal loudly before it turned to the muted crunch of gravel and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey, wait up!\" Eugene called after the athletically endowed sorority girl, clanging off the platform as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously, what happened to me?\" Peter asked quietly as he watched the geek and his crush wander off down the short path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...You were gone!\" Judy felt the tears welling up again and struggled to keep her voice from cracking, \"But if we...If we can't quit then we should get moving. I'll explain l-later, okay? I don't want this game to...to 'help' us again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter felt like protesting from the denial of what he felt was pretty vital information...But the look on Judy's face, how nervous she looked as her eyes darted around for those weird as hell red words again. After a moment he sighed and gently grabbed her gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, babe. Later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled as best as she could and, hand in hand, the restored couple followed Lindsey and Eugene down the path and into the field, where the nerds were already inspecting the vehicles and talking quietly to each other. From the closer vantage point the two could see that the truck was sitting on what could barely be considered a road that led into the jungle towards a mountain that rose out of the jungle, and the quad-bike was sitting on what looked like little more than a hiking trail, while the weird sub and the kayak sat quietly by the side of the mostly calm river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-telling you, Lindsey, it's based on our skillsets, like the last one was!\" Eugene's voice said as it came into earshot of the jock and the goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but, like, it wouldn't give us two skill based challenges in a row, would it? That seems SUPER derivative, Genie. We just take the things we somehow KNOW that we can use? Where's the challenge in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but what if...What if it isn't? Like have YOU ever played a game with classes, which we clearly are, without it utilizing all the skills of said classes? We just did the physical, so if we play out gameplay logic, then next up would clearly be the vehicle challenge, right? To see if we can use everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Peter were about to offer their own opinions when there was a clap of what sounded like thunder in the distance as the wind began to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, more forced gameplay difficulty\" Lindsey muttered darkly, eyeing the hang-glider truck with apprehension. She HATED flying. It was fine when she could sleep most of the trip like she did when she went to Japan for her honors trip in high school, but being awake? On something that required you to steer it? The idea was getting her anxiety stirred up even more than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Judy asked, but the question was answered by another clap of thunder...Followed by an ominous shudder of the ground beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the side of the mountain exploded as smoke and lava poured forth from a large crack that appeared in the side of the rocky tip, lighting the jungle on fire as it crawled towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Peter yelled, while Lindsey just let loose another frustrated moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ok-ok...Uh, so here's the plan guys, we pick a vehicle and then use it. Based on our skills, Judy, you take the kayak, Lindsey has the hang-glider and...Uh Pete? You know how to use a mini-sub?\" Eugene hurriedly explained to the group as a huge swarm of birds flew overhead, heading away from the, uh, volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! But I can drive that 4-wheeler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Ugh.\" Eugene figured the minisub was for him, but the idea of potentially navigating a underwater cave...He could already feel the claustrophobia kicking in. But his introspection was interrupted as a group of animals appeared, leaping out of the treeline and speeding across the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those gazelles?\" Peter wondered out loud, and then the ground shook again and with a mighty CRASH, a small army of stampeding rhinos burst from the greenery, trampling the vegetation into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell, game!?' Eugene wondered as the animals that, to his knowledge, were not supposed to be in jungles. But then the rhinos shifted course and started heading TOWARDS the group, as a group of elephants began trumpeting as they broke through the shattering tree-line, followed by even more animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guess that means go!\" Lindsey screamed as the group scattered, racing towards the first vehicles they saw (and may have possibly been compelled to use).</span></div></div>",

She slammed the door behind her and turned the keys, the motor groaning as it failed to turn over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh, you are NOT doing this to me, game!\" The usually chipper blonde hissed as she punched the dash and turned the key once more, the motor grumbling to life and the truck beginning to rattle. Wasting no time, Lindsey put the automobile in gear and floored the gas pedal, the truck revving loudly as it chewed the damp ground beneath it, rumbling down the road through the burning jungle...and up the currently EXPLODING mountain, wild animals leaping across the path in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I am TOTALLY not waiting for the others. I'm driving up a VOLCANO!\" She screamed to no one but herself as she struggled to keep the truck on course as the muddy road began to climb upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Judy was gasping in fear as she threw together the paddles and launched herself into the kayak, wiggling her waist into the open hole and then scooting herself as best she could into the swift current of the river. She squealed as she was knocked back and forth and then SPUN as the current took the small boat, and the goth struggled to utilize her new skills to straighten herself out as the dark brown water began to turn to a frothy white as she entered the rapids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her was a maze of chutes and rockbeds, boulders and trees rising up through the water's surface and the ever present roar of something in the distance, obscured by fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't you dare fucking tell me that's a waterfall!' Barely had time to tell herself as she used her paddles to whip herself around the razor-sharp rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Peter had no trouble, mounting the quad-bike in a fluid, heroic looking LEAP as he twisted the ignition key and the small ATV rumbled to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes!\" He grinned, and revved the throttle several times before whipping off into the jungle trail. He may have been shit at walking across a fucking plank, but this? This he was SURE he could do. Of course, that was before the trees started falling around him, the wildlife began joining him on the trail...And the path suddenly dropping off into a sharp slope that was pock-marked by boulders, trees, and sheer drops, and far below, a rather treacherous looking river crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" He screamed as a gazelle barely missed crushed his skull in with a hoof as he banked the quad-bike to a sharp left and prayed that he didn't flip it and go flying, messily, down the ridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, the last member of the group, threw glances at his disappearing friends, the approaching animal stampede, the fire and the confusing equipment in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I supposed to do!?\" He screamed into the rapidly heating jungle air. The minisub had NO instructions and Eugene's nearly implanted knowledge base seemed to conveniently lack the skills needed to turn it on. The rappelling gear, sure he knew exactly what to do with that but after that? He had no idea what to do. Clearly the oxygen tanks for breathing underwater but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thundering hooves and grunts of a violent death grew closer and Eugene fumbled with the mini-sub before finally, FINALLY figuring out how to start the motors, the tiny propeller sputtering to life as smoke began pouring out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Eugene looked at the whining machine for a moment before he nudged it into the water, the whining turning to a gurgle and the smoke disappearing as the minisub took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! WAIT!\" Eugene hurriedly threw on the oxygen tanks and dove into the muddy water, hands slapping against the wet plastic before he found purchase on the handles, and with a last gasp of air before he shoved the respirator into his mouth, descended beneath the churning waters of the the river, headed for a dark opening in the rocks.</span></div></div>",

This time getting louder by the moment. Pete landed with a crash, sending dust flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening up, his friends looked intently at him. Or rather her, as Pete hissed in pain. Glancing to the source of the pain, she spotted one stripe disappear, leaving four lives remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forearm was alien and unfamiliar.

They were walking around Pete, giving him mock wolf whistles, and even teasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm a little jealous,\" Lindsey told Judy. \"The game bumped me a cup size,\" she observed, cupping her breasts through her leather top, \"But Pete got to start the game with a bigger set. They're almost as big as yours, Judy!\" Lindsey reached over to feel Pete's new rack, but he slapped her hand away, which just got Judy and Lindsey laughing harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene could see Pete was seething. Eugene knew some guys who chose a female avatar in a first person game, because if they had to look at an ass through the entire game, they wanted it to be a female one. But not Pete. Pete's whole identity was tied into his masculinity, and the fact that he had been forced into a female avatar in a game, particularly a game as intensively real as this one, was almost too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene wasn't going to say anything, though. At some point, the game would end, Pete would be a burly football player, Eugene would be a nerdy, slightly overweight freshman, and Pete would remember any insults Eugene delivered in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was trying to think of something to say that might diffuse the situation when more instructions appeared above the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>For his rude behavior<br>\r\nYou now have Petra, instead of Pete,<br>\r\nTrust me, she's all woman now<br>\r\nFrom her head down to her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC, D, E,<br>\r\nHow lovely they must feel!<br>\r\nIt's just a game, you all four say,<br>\r\nBut what if it all was real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this second on.<br>\r\nAs you cross field and range<br>\r\nThis simple promise I will make you<br>\r\nNothing more will change<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how about a bonus?<br>\r\nFrom my land into yours?<br>\r\nA change that will last forever?<br>\r\nMorphing that endures?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess my little riddle<br>\r\nSolve my clues, and then,<br>\r\nAll once had all five lives<br>\r\nAnd so they shall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudy on the second.<br>\r\nTrust me, there's naught amiss<br>\r\nComplete the second of the second<br>\r\nThen seal it with a kiss</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's eyes narrowed dangerously. He knew he was all woman now. The game had reduced the size of his equipment before, and had now removed it completely, replacing it with a vagina. The absence there was the weirdest thing he had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only upside was that this new body of Pete's had skills, just like the other three. Pete knew he would now have no problems crossing that board. Heck, he could somersault over it without breaking a sweat. But Pete didn't want those skills. He didn't want to be in a woman's body (except in the traditional male rutting way). He just wanted this game to be over, and the only video game he was ever going to play was Madden football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four studied the instructions in silence before </span></div></div>",

And, I have to admit, it's kind of funny Pete having to play with a girl's body. I mean, he's a good boyfriend and everything, but he can be kind of an asshole too. Plus, his new body seems to have skills that his old one doesn't. So he won't be slowing the rest of us down. Or should I start calling him she?\" Judy said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Eugene and Lindsey noticed Judy never said she loved Pete, but didn't mention that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I said I think that's what the game is promising. I'm not sure,\" Lindsey confessed. \"But I do know if we do solve the riddle, that is to say, perform the answer, then the game will definitely not change our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the answer?\" Eugene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing,\" Lindsey said, deliberately refusing to provide the answer. \"I think if the we act through the answer, it will give Pete his fifth life back. I think it will also make the changes to our bodies permanent. Not only here, but in the real world as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Judy thought about it for a minute, then added, \"I wouldn't mind. I mean, okay, I like this body. It's like the best version of me, even if it is tattoo and piercing free. And maybe I'm through with that phase of my life anyway. But this is just a game. A game can't just give me a body in the real world. Can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this feel like any video game you've ever played?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Judy could only nod in agreement with Lindsey's observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the answer?\" Eugene asked, repeating his earlier question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the second stanza,\" Lindsey said. \"It starts off with C, D, and E. I usually were a 34B bra,\" Lindsey said matter of factly, \"But I think the game made me a C cup. Judy, you're an E cup, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded, blushing at discussing that detail in front of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete's new body looks to be somewhere in between our two sizes. The next line in that poem talks about how they must feel, and then later on it says seal it with a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Judy asked, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the answer is, Eugene here has to feel us up, and give us a kiss while he's doing so,\" Lindsey explained. \"And he has to do it in a certain order. First me, then Pete, than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Judy replied. Her eyebrows furrowed as she thought about it. She looked up at Eugene and said, \"Well, I guess I would be okay if Eugene didn't go around and brag about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross my heart and promise not to,\" Eugene said, as he found himself getting hard at the thought of being able to handle Judy's big breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be okay with me too,\" Lindsey added, which made Eugene get even harder. \"I like this body, and I like being a badass. I'm pretty sure Eugene would like to take his new body back into the real world as well. But do you think it would be okay with Pete? Do you think he wants anyone to grab his tits and kiss him? Do you think Pete wants to get stuck in that body forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Judy said simply. Judy and Eugene Lindsey stared at each other until Pete/Petra called from the other side of the chasm. \"Hey, I'm on the other side! You guys need to get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three moved to cross the board, they exchanged a look. Before Eugene began to cross the board, he said,</span></div></div>",

Like what would be like to <b>use</b> his penis with a member of the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was a virgin and, though he hoped to be relieved of that condition while at college, had no hopeful prospects in the immediate future, particularly with the pandemic going on. He definitely had not considered either of his female friends as potential partners. But now, with this body, maybe he wouldn't be in Lindsey's permanent friend zone. At least not in the game world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, what happens in the game world, stays in the game world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's mind wasn't on sex, however. She felt bad for the way Pete had just shoved Judy away, but in all honest, Lindsey was beginning to think of Pete as a whiner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Lindsey was looking at the log crossing the chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it falls to me to get across the log first,\" she said. Before anyone could argue, Lindsey stepped on the log and began crossing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing. Lindsey's body just knew the right place to put her feet, and how to adjust for the slight bounce to the log, and the occasional errant breeze. Before she knew it, she was on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake,\" Lindsey said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene watched in amazement as the ex-cheerleader made looking crossing that narrow board so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can do this,' he mentally told himself. 'This new body knows how.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that mantra in mind, Eugene stepped on the board and began crossing. Like Lindsey, his body instinctively knew what to do. With a laugh, Eugene almost trotted over the chasm. He and Lindsey exchanged an excited hug, with Eugene forcing himself not to make the hug too long or awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waved for Judy and Pete to join them. Judy tried to make eye contact with Pete, but he was refusing to engage. With a shrug, she began crossing the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's muscles had memories of climbing through the lines and masts of a tall ship, even in storms. A board that wasn't rocking, coupled with calm water, wasn't a challenge. Judy crossed the board quickly and easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich left just Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete hadn't wanted to play the game even before he tried to go down the steps. When the game had shrunk his equipment, he really hadn't wanted to play any more. But it looked like he didn't have any choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Pete didn't have the special skills the game had given his friends. If he crossed that log, it would be as himself.

The football player stared daggers at Eugene. Eugene looked away, and Judy refused to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was possibly the only one of the four who could look at the conditions dispassionately. The game was telling Pete he could wait out the game here, but there were rewards that Pete wouldn't get. And that line about Pete's luck unraveling sounded ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stanza about Pete getting to cross \"for free\" if Eugene got to feel Judy up didn't sound good. On the face of it, it didn't require any sacrifices. But it was sure to drive a wedge between Pete, Judy and Eugene. Just the suggestion of it had already done that. Pete was petulant to begin with. Whatever the game had done to Pete's penis had made his attitude worse. If Pete had to watch Eugene groping his girlfriend, that would be the nail in the coffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was also giving Pete the choice of giving up two lives to cross the chasm. On the face of it, that was also a decent deal. Lindsey had finally deduced that, off all the four students, Pete hadn't gotten any special abilities. Theoretically, if Pete tried to cross that chasm, he could fail five times and lose all five of his lives. So two lives would actually be a good bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey wasn't sure she even wanted Pete to go along with them. She was enjoying the game, enjoying the things she could do here that she couldn't do in the normal world. Pete...Pete coming along would probably just ruin things for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the game ended now, Lindsey was pretty sure she could never be on friendly terms with Pete ever again. But whatever happened next, for better or worse, it was going to be Pete's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete looked at the instructions and decided to</span></div></div>",

She wanted to scream, to rant, to do something to get to Pete to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete just stood there stolidly, not looking back. The board crossing the chasm disappeared, while a mist began rising from the chasm. Soon it was so thick, that Pete and the opposite side of the chasm were no longer visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just stared in the mist silently. Eugene and Lindsey stood there, feeling awkward, wanting to say something but not sure what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Judy turned to the other two, a determined look on her face. \"I guess we better find a way off this cliff. Unless there's another prompt?\" Judy looked up at the open air, daring the game to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game didn't respond to the taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a trail at the top of the cliff leading downward. Lindsey led the way, with Judy in the middle and Eugene bring up the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of rears, Eugene couldn't help but notice that both girls had firm, athletic rears. A little narrow in the hip for some, but Eugene definitely approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene forced himself to stop focusing on female backsides. No telling what would befall him if he let himself get distracted in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path ended midway down the cliff on a wide ledge. Set in the cliff were five doors, each with five different symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the first door was an infinity symbol over the number eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the second door was the number 2425, with a small hourglass shape in the exponential position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the third door was a solid vertical line in the center. On either side of the line were two wavy vertical lines, and on the outside of the lines were two infinity signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the fourth line was a vertical horizontal line, with a pair of concentric circles on either side of the vertical horizontal line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol on the fifth line looked like a left pointing arrow next to a golf tee, with both followed by what looked like a tic tac toe matrix where the ink had run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is bullshit,\" Judy yelled up at the air. \"So first you fuck with my boyfriend, and when he gets tired of your bullshit. you fuck with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air didn't deign to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at the other two, and there was an air of exhaustion and defeat about her. Lindsey stepped up and gave Judy a hug. Judy returned the hug with a fierceness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hug ended, she gave Eugene a hug as well. Startled, Eugene returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's be honest,\" she said, wiping her eyes. \"The game did fuck with Pete, but he was kind of being a baby about things to begin with. So I'm going to forget about him for a while and focus on winning this game. Who's with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the way,\" Lindsey answered. Eugene echoed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shakes her head at the symbols on the door. \"I thought this was supposed to be about adventure sports, not puzzle solving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The symbols might be clues to the next challenge behind them,\" Lindsey opined. \"We get to pick our next challenge, if we decipher what the symbols on each door means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they might be Easter eggs,\" Eugene adds. \"You know, a reward of some kind. The instructions back there said there would be rewards. Maybe we figure out the clues we get the reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever is behind the doors, I can't make heads or tails out of these symbols,\" Judy says with a shake of her head. \"Although...\" She's staring at the fifth door, her eyebrows furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged their observations and theories before deciding to go through the</span></div></div>",

She laughed and said, \"Don't worry, I won't stick you with bikini.\" Eugene gave Lindsey a grateful smile as she took the bikini token, leaving him with the carabiner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the console had heard his question, it's mechanical voice said \"<b>PLACE AVATARS BACK IN DRAWER.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends did so dutifully, and the drawer snapped shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pete could repeat his earlier question, the room was filled with a loud screech and a blinding light. The four students crouched on themselves, until both noise and light stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the four of them opened their eyes, the found themselves on a desolate ocean beach. And there had been changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete found himself in the shorts and shirt he worked out with the rest of the football team in. Pete had felt a little sloppy the last few weeks, since he hadn't been participating in his team's preseason football workout. But that's not how he felt now. He felt at the top of his game. He felt better than that. He felt like he could put up record breaking numbers on the football field, and be in the running for the Heisman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene felt weird. Good, but weird. He found himself clothed entirely in black, with only his eyes visible. His body was fitter than it had ever been in his life. Better than he had ever fantasized. Eugene had two visible blades on his body, and various weapons and gadgets squirreled about his body, and he knew how to use each and everyone of them to their deadliest effect. He knew he could see in near darkness, cross a tightwire even in a moderate wind, climb a near featureless wall, and perform mind blowing acrobatics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was studying a strand of her hair. It was brown now, and fell around her shoulders. She was wearing a khaki shirt and shorts with lots of pockets, each with a different device. The shirt was tied off just below her ribs, displaying a flat stomach and her large breasts which, though always firm, felt a little firmer know. Judy had always been in decent shape, but now she felt in great shape. She knew she could boulder, find a trail up a seemingly featureless cliff face, find the best source of food no matter what wilderness environment you set her in. She was the expedition racing badass she always fantasized about being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was in a wetsuit, though it was unzipped to her waist, revealing her green bikini top encased breasts. Lindsey had started the day wearing a B-cup top, but the bikini top she was wearing revealed she had gone up two cup sizes. She was still a cup size smaller than Judy, but the changes didn't go unnoticed by either Pete or Eugene, who were surreptitiously checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's body was a golden brown, with her hair now a dirty blonde, and reaching down to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey had been a cheerleader in high school, and still considered herself an athlete. But her body was telling her that she was just kidding herself before. Now Lindsey was an athlete. Her pronounced back muscles had become so defined by a body trained to do any variations of surfing and sailing, as well as being able to swim three miles in record setting time. Lindsey's body was telling her it could be one of those people who swam the English Channel, if she wanted to, or set free diving records, or basically do anything she wanted to do in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four just stood there, looking at themselves and each other, a chest rose out of the sand. The chest was small, able to fit into a large palm. It opened up, and from within, the Mechanical Voice that had intoned from the game console said \"<b>CHOOSE ONE TOKEN</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the game has begun,\" Eugene said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you, Geno?\" Pete asked. \"Normally, I'd say you look like a dork, but I don't know. There's just something bad radiating from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad ass,\" Eugene replied. \"I have no idea how the game did this, but all I can say is WOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, WOW, definitely fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the chest intoned \"<b>CHOOSE ONE TOKEN</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we supposed to do?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four suddenly became aware that they were clutching the token they had chosen in their right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we need to put one of the tokens in the chest to start the adventure,\" Judy opined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four discuss the various possible outcomes of putting a different token in the chest, and decide to put in the</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>In a shop that may or may not have existed, buried deep in some nearly abandoned portion of a nearly dead mall, a woman flicked her long hair as she watched the group mull over their choices through the primary security camera feed in her back office. Though the terms 'office' and 'camera feed' were a bit inaccurate, given how the woman could shift and adjust her view point with a wave of her hand, whisking it inches in front of Eugene's face without the overweight boy knowing or seeing anything. And she wasn't exactly using a TV to look through and was instead gazing into a large green portal that was projecting a live feed of the dorm's common room, all unseen and unheard. Magic was just like that, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the office could barely be called an office because it was barely larger than a normal sized closet, tiny, cramped and just large enough for the woman to sit in without losing circulation to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand cue the note card\" She whispered quietly as she used the magic to nudge one of Peter's subconscious thoughts into the forefront of the athlete's mind. As she watched the athlete's eyes glaze over as he spoke, she pulled out a keyboard and began typing, a small smirk on her face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if this is sports stuff, but for a game then it's gotta be like trivia, right?,\" Pete theorized. \"I'm pretty good at that, that's why I got on the scholar bowl team back in high school, I was the sports guy. Also probably why I like hanging out with nerdies like you guys\" Peter said, giving a rather dramatic and not at all serious sigh of disgust, followed by a wry grin at the bewildered look on Eugene and Lindsey's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought I was only attracted to your muscles\" Judy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Eugene finally got out, still flummoxed at this unexpected intellectual facet of Pete's personality. \"Uh yeah I don't really see how we're supposed to actually play any sports on this besides trivia. But I wonder what it means by 'Immersive and Traditional'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traditional is probably the trivia game, Genie\" Lindsey said, laying her arms and head on the table and marveling at how retro the game machine looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but what about 'Immersive'? How would that even work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could, like, just pick it and see what happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the group had time to discuss their options, Peter suddenly lurched up from the couch and almost mechanically walked over and lifted up the machine with his hands, grunting at the surprising weight of the old plastic and circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! This thing is a LOT heavier than it looks. How'd you cart this thing all the way home, Geno? You've got, like, no muscles and this has to be at least a hundred pounds, easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Be careful!\" Eugene cried out in annoyance, but his complaint was cut short as he spied...something attached to the bottom of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, curiosity satisfied I guess...\" Peter went to place the machine back on the table but was interrupted by a loud \"WAIT!\" from his rotund and unlikely friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude there's something under it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I see it too!\" Lindsey chirped, and Judy un-beached herself and joined the group as they stared at the rectangular piece of...paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, much as I like showing off, can I set this down? It's starting to get, like, really heavy\" Peter groaned as the device's weight seemed to increase with every passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, 'kay...\" Eugene reached up and picked at the tape that covered the piece of paper for a moment before he turned and looked at the curious goth peering over Lindsey's shoulder, and then at the long purple and black nails that topped her fingers, \"Uh Judy, little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time has come\" She intoned far too seriously, while Lindsey giggled at the reference. The two girls had watched Kung-Fu Panda again the other day and Lindsey had been educating the surprisingly sheltered goth on what 'memes' were. The rainblonde scooted over as Judy took her place, a look of concentration on her slightly chubby face as she picked at the sticky adhesive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please hurry up?\" Peter groaned again as his face began to turn red and sweat began to bead up on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, man-slave\" Judy hissed, \"Half-rations for talking back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter groaned again and Lindsey erupted into a fresh fit of giggles, while Eugene blushed and looked away from his crush's pretty face, trying not to get too turned on by her laugh, her glittering eyes and, uh, her boobs (even if they were entirely dwarfed by Judy's). A minute or two passed in silence save for the scraping sound of Judy's nails...And then a triumphant \"I GOT IT!\" rang out as the purple haired sophmore pulled the paper free of the game's base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank GOD\" Peter gasped as he, somewhat violently letting the game flop back to the table with a lound CLANG. The athlete could feel his muscles burning as if he'd just spent the last few minutes in the weight room down at the sports complex on the other side of campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Peter!\" Judy scolded her boyfriend as he collapsed backwards on the couch, wiping away the sweat on his forehead with a muscled forearm. She handed Eugene the card before she stood and joined her boyfriend back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is NO way Geno carried that all the way from the mall here, that thing weighs a fuckin' ton! No, uh, offense, buddy\" Peter said with a loud exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken\" Eugene nodded, a neutral look on his face but inside he felt the sting of the accidental insult. He'd learned to tune out the insults of his weight and general lack of athleticism over the years but hearing his friend say it did hurt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenie, what is ittttt,\u201d whined Lindsey, sidling close and propping her elbows on Eugene\u2019s knee \u2014 far too close for the geek\u2019s comfort. \u201cYou\u2019re all mysterious n\u2019 stuff and I wanna knooooooooow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy tossed a knowing look at Peter, but the jock was staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling, his nostrils flaring as he sucked down air. The goth suddenly felt a little concerned, either Peter was far more out of shape than he looked, which could have been true given lockdown, but he still looked more than capable of lifting a video game. But before she could voice her concerns, she looked back to see Eugene handing the piece of paper to Lindsey, his face red as a beet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNotecard.\u201d He mumbled as jerked his hand away from Lindsey as the two brushed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainblonde seemed not to notice the boy's discomfort as she pulled the card in front of her and looked at it for moment, her eyes squinting in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh just read whatever it is already\" Peter whined from his position of the couch, earning him a dark look from the sorority girl before she gave a little cough to clear her throat (which sounded adorable to Judy) and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">To whomever this probably concerns,<br>\r\nHeya! If you\u2019re reading this now, you probably have excellent taste, or you just like looking at the bottom of random game boards, you weirdo!<br>\r\nSo I\u2019m supposed to keep things interesting or whatever, so I added in some more game for you! Just type 'SPORTS MODE #2, #3', etc and it'll load in some entirely new stuff! <br>\r\nJust give \u2018em a type, I\u2019m sure that you might maybe possibly potentially conceivably like them! Have fun!<br>\r\n~U.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S.  ;) </div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have to read \u2018winky face\u2019?\u201d asked Judy, a contoured eyebrow curved with doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emotional context is important.\" Lindsey said VERY seriously, nodding her head slowly before another grin cracked through the facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo these are, like, custom game modes?\u201d pondered Peter as he pulled himself back up to a sitting position as his body seemed to recover. \u201cThey might be zanier than the default ones it came with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing this on the box,\u201d murmured Eugene, lost in thought. \u201cIt sounds like it'll load in different, uh, scenarios for adventure sports? The game did come pre-loaded...\" Though despite walking through the logic chain Eugene was a little confused as to how much mileage they could really get out of something like sports. It wasn't his favorite topic to begin with and, well, there were only so many sports out there, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can, like, restart it if they\u2019re boring too, so, go for it, Genie!\u201d cheered Lindsey, pumping an enthusiastic pink-nailed fist in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The woman grinned in her office as the group of students chatted about the turn of events. This was surprisingly more fun than what she'd been doing before. All things considered, this REALLY wasn't all that bad! She did feel a little bad about messing with reality to humiliate the jock, but she had felt like being a little mischievous with the boy, having felt a sudden spike of strange jealousy towards the boy. But now reality was restored and luckily things were proceeding fast enough that the group was already forgetting about the weirdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all she had to do, as the students reached a consensus on what to do, was wait and see if she'd had to put on a costume or not. This was going to be so much fun, and definitely sitting around with nothing to do!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're all decided then?\" Eugene asked his friends and receiving three nods back in return. They'd decided to push forward and try out what the notecard had suggested, and a thumbs-up Eugene began to type in...</span></div></div>",

Maybe it'll like a scavenger hunt?\" Judy offered after the group had discussed the options (while Peter had more or less checked out, laying his head back and closing his eyes as he fought the urge to just go play some more Madden).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yeah! Like, it'll probably give us prompts as players to find items and then we type in the objects we find and it'll respond like a MUD! Oh I bet there's a procedural algorithm in there!\" Lindsey said excitedly as her green eyes glittered with energy, only yo be met with a confused stare from the surprisingly sheltered goth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's a 'MUD'?\" Judy asked slowly, suddenly unsure about suggesting immersive and feeling a bit embarassed about the technical terms that the surprisingly bright blonde was tossing out. The first thing that came to mind was going out and diving in a mud pit, and Judy definitely was NOT going to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what!? How can you have, like, not known about MUDs! They're SO fun!\" Lindsey gasped in shock. Already the geeky, code-crusader portion of her brain was kicking into high gear, having already been stoked into activity by the retro-styled machine on the table between the four friends. But right as she was about to launch into a detailed explanation of MUDs, there was a cough from Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an old text-based computer game, Judy. It plays a lot like Dungeons and dragons but you can just type the stuff in and the game will respond on it's own\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pouted as the wind was taken out of her proverbial sails. Usually she didn't mind playing the 'fool' as it helped her stay on the low end of everyone's attention, which was pretty advantageous for sneaking into places under the radar, but something about the way Eugene had just said that, she felt EXTREMELY offended and talked down at. And just when Lindsey had been getting closer to letting down her guard and letting the little fatso loser into her 'inner circle' of friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just play, please?\" Peter groaned from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all this talking is, like, SO boring!\" Lindsey said as she nestled back into her bean-bag, a dark look on her face, \"Kinda feel like just watching a movie now. Oh, maybe we can WATCH a mystery? Maybe then you won't have to explain things for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the situation begin to deteriorate, Eugene quickly leaned over and typed in MYSTERY on the console's tiny and fragile looking keyboard, pressing enter and earning a shriek from Judy, who had been leaning in to inspect the machine just as two large black buttons labelled 'TRADITIONAL' and 'IMMERSIVE' popped out of the top of the machine like two pieces of toast from a toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Was it supposed to do that!?\" Judy gasped as she flopped backwards onto the couch as Peter's head snapped upwards as he searched for the source of the disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think so? I think a lot of this is analog...\" Eugene muttered as he leaned in to inspect the buttons. They were large ovals, about as large as his thumbnail and made up of thick looking plastic. On the tops there were the words 'Traditional' and 'Immersive' in chipped and faded white stenciling along the top. \"I guess this is how we choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, guess so Eugene. You seem like a pretty smart bean\" Lindsey yawned with (well done) feigned disinterest as she pulled out her phone as Eugene's face fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's pick this one, Gene\" Judy said, shooting Lindsey a dark look. Lindsey was pretty chill but sometimes she could get pretty pissy and petty. The goth leaned forward and pressed the 'Immersive' button, the hard plastic sinking back into the machine and locking into place as the machine began to buzz loudly like the old fax machine that had been in her dad's home office when she was little. A burning smell filled the room and Lindsey did her best to ignore anything that was happening while the others wrinkled their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...Is it on fire? Smells like melting plastic!\" Peter grimaced as he waved a hand in front of his face while Judy just covered her face entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Eugene said, his eyes stinging as he moved around the device, searching for some spark of flame or trail of smoke. He really, really hoped he hand't been duped out of fifteen bucks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few moments the noise and the smell faded away, and with a mechanical clack and a DING! a small tray slid out from the side of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SELECT AVATAR\" The game blared noisily, causing Judy's hands to spring from her face to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this thing so LOUD!?\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. Probably because it's old or something\" Lindsey said, continuing to look as disinterested as possible as she scrolled through her phone, looking at...nothing, really, as she nursed her bruised ego. As Peter, Eugene and Judy leaned in though, she flicked her green eyes upwards and caught a look of the small tray filled with bright figurines. She couldn't help but feel her curiosity begin to poke through her bad mood and she gave a dramatic sigh as she pulled herself up from the bean bag and joined her friends in inspecting the small pile of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must a be 3D printer...Though I've never seen one this old be this...small' The mercurial young adult thought to herself as she inspected the pile of plastic. Either this machine was not as old as it looked or whoever had made this was REALLY ahead of the curve. And the details! Lindsey's eyes wandered across the somewhat messily deposited pile of plastic as her eyes were drawn to the four figurines that were set apart by all the rest, widening at how each little character had more details than modern 3D printers were capable of doing, especially so FAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I really want to take this thing apart now' The rainblonde whispered to no one but her own mind as her eyes settled on the four figurines that were raised above the rest on tiny black spars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue, classic Sherlock Holmes styled inspector, long jacket, deerstalker and crooked tobacco pipe all modeled with remarkable detail, a red figure with slicked back hair, a cape and a knife held in one hand, a yellow, skeletal figure with sharp facial features and a twin-tailed coat, and the final figurine was a green figure in what was clearly some sort of evening gown and a exquisite looking brooch above a dangerously low neckline. On the back of each character was a bright number, Blue was 1, Red was 2, Yellow was 3 and Green was 4, clearly indicating their starting position in the game. The strange thing was that there didn't seem to be any defining characteristics beyond their overall silhouettes and the defining objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pile though, Lindsey spotted a mixture of other characters, such as a gumshoe detective, a racy looking femme fatale, a fat figure with a cigar, and a short, stout looking figure with a stylish hat and a tommy gun. There were many, many others though, but in her mind she'd already come to the conclusion that whatever the pre-loaded games were, the four offered figurines were clearly meant to be played first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we pick one of these? Did the box say we pick a character and type in the number and press start\" Peter said, reach across the table and grabbing the box, pulling it upwards and reading over the faded, scratched text, \"Yeah, we just pick and play\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds simple enough. Eugene, it's your game so you choose first, okay?\" Judy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he's clearly the smartest one in the room. Just pick Sherlock Eugene\" Lindsey said snidely as she leaned back in her bean bag and stared, non-plussed, at the annoyed looks on Judy and Peter's faces and ignored the hurt look on Eugene's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything on here saying all FOUR players need to participate, Lindsey\" The athlete hissed, crossing his muscled arms. The sorority girl just shrugged and placed her phone back in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of tension, Judy coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, if we're playing, let's...pick our guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! Yeah let's, uh, g-get started!\" Eugene stammered as he eyed his muscled friend as the jock loomed over the unimpressed blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Lindsey said, tossing her phone down on the inflated bag of beans as she reached up and swiped a piece from the tray at random. The goth, geek and jock shared a look of concern, anger and dismay as they reached up and grabbed their own pieces before Eugene quietly typed in the information into the game's tiny keyboard.</span></div></div>",

The moment the geek pressed the button, however, all four college students went limp in their positions; Eugene's head plummeting down on to the table, Peter collapsing backwards onto the couch, Lindsey's head lolling limping as her phone slipped form her hands, and Judy sliding slowly to her side, her head coming to a rest on Peter's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing any of them heard before unconsciousness overtook them was the game's synthetic voice screaming out \"STARTING GAME: MYSTERY BY GAS LAMP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The year is 1890. King Edward VII sits upon the throne of the British Empire, the unchallenged ruler of the world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice spoke as moonlit clouds swept by underneath, a sea of soiled white that split apart to reveal the sea of lights and smokestacks. London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT is a time of great change, but also great poverty. The age of technological advancement on the cusp of a new century. Workers young and old stoke the fires of industry, Horseless carriages grow closer to realization, and great written works are published, though only the wealthy upper class are capable of reading them. The working class toils under coal and soot, living brief, violent lives while the wealthy live in luxury and ease, and the British Empire rules over India and gazes across the ocean at its lost colon,l the United States of America\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cityscapes blurs and shifts, showing scenes of factory workers, men, women and children of all walks of life struggling to survive amid horrid working and living conditions. A immaculate palace hall filled with well dressed and well spoken members of high society, plentiful food, the luxuries of wealth. A hall of politicians squabbling and looking disdainfully at a large map showing the United States of America. The scene shifts once more, as the British inhabit the exotic palaces of far-off India while the native population is treated and seen as backwards and little more than savages in the dark and ominous jungles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great ships plow the Atlantic, and the locomotive is the preferred mode of transport across vast distances of land, each with their own unique ecosystems defined by social status and financial worth. The wealth of the first class partake of fabulous meals, exquisite cabins, cigar rooms, fine brandy, even entertianment, while the lower classes are pressed together like the cattle they are seen as, suffering in silence, unheard over the sheer power wielded by the upper class\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisions of passenger ships, colossal vessels of steel and steam cross the dark, cold Atlantic ocean, once more scenes of the impossibly rich living pleasant lives while the unwashed masses are pressed together, some never seeing the sky once on the long voyages. The roar of a passenger train as it charges down the long narrow tracks, mean and women of status sitting in comfortable chairs and sleeping in fine beds while the poor are forced upon hard wooden benches and rarely any place to sleep. The train roars past as the location changes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story shifts suddenly to a well dressed older gentleman, clearly a lord of some kind, standing in a well furnished study as he stares out a light-soaked window, a glass of whisky in one hand, a cigar in the other. On the table is a tightly bound satchel emblazoned with a personal crest similar to the one that hangs from the nearby wall. There's a sudden crash, the man turns, and his confused face contorts with fear as he cries out, a gloved hand holding a large knife plunging downwards into the old man as he falls to the floor, blood pouring out of his wounds as he reaches weakly for the satchel. The knife rises to the old man's throat and with a swift motion, slices open the wrinkled flesh and the lord goes limp. The knife clatters to the bloody floor, splashing the rapidly expanding pool of blood everywhere while the gloved hand reaches for the satchel and grabs it, the grisly scene fading to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is here our story begins, as poverty, desperation and survival begin to clash with the have-plenty's, the fortunate and the long-lived. A wealthy industrial magnate, Lord Tiberius Lochley, friend of the royal court and owner of the vast Lochely Steel company has been found victim of murder most foul. The legal details of his estate are missing, and his company, vital to the continued success of the British Crown, teeters on the verge of collapse.  His heirs, Lord James Lochley and the Lady Catherine Lochly are the prime suspects after the initial investigation has uncovered precious few clues. With no known witnesses, very few clues and a race against time before the industrial hear of the British Empire collapses, you must <b>find the last will and testament of Lord Tiberius, find his killer, and save the Empire before it is too late!</b>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pained grunt in the darkness as the world returned.

Or you serious?\" Judy asked incredulously. \"You mean marching around and playing soldiers? Or answering trivia questions about what battles happened where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, military history is pretty cool,\" Eugene responded. Looking at Pete, he made a motion with his right hand over his chest, then pushed his hand out. \"Strength and honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete grinned as he returned the salute, repeating \"Strength and honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete added, \"Ready your breakfast and eat hearty.\" Eugene joined him as the two said in unison \"For tonight we dine in hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that last movie wasn't real,\" Judy retorted. \"It was based on a comic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graphic novel,\" Lindsey corrected her. \"And it's actually based on a real life event, the Battle of Thermopylae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey closed her eyes as she recited:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u014c ksein', angellein Lakedaimoniois hoti t\u0113ide<br>\r\nkeimetha, tois kein\u014dn rh\u0113masi peithomenoi.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then translated, \"'Oh stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians that we lie here, obedient to their words.' It's what on the stone marking the burial mound of the Spartans who died at that battle. Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing what this Military mode is like. If it's ancient military history, I'm a big fan of Archimedes and Boudica. Or maybe the immersive game is playing <i><b>Risk</b></i> or <i><b>Diplomacy</b></i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that show where Archimedes invented the first death ray?\" Pete asked Eugene. The two began relating to each other the details of the show in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wasn't surprised that Pete would pick military. He was a big fan of military movies that weren't too realistic, and had the requisite amount of violence in them. And she knew that one of the few things he and Eugene would watch together were the shows about Military History. But the fact that Lindsey knew things like that, or knew about military board games, surprised Judy. It was easy to think of Lindsey as an empty headed cheerleader, or a geek girl caught up in her own world, because Lindsey seemed to enjoy floating between those two personas at random. But then Lindsey would demonstrate that she knew things that didn't involve either one of those personas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy found Lindsey to be a riddle wrapped up in an enigma tortilla, then deep fried in mystery batter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Judy conceded. \"We can play the Military choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Eugene said, typing in the group's choice, then asking, \"Which mode are we going to play in, traditional or immersive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four talked it over, and decided to choose</span></div></div>",

When he was a kid, he had been big in swimming, but he had gotten away with that. Plus, he never watched sports at all, and the only sports he had taken in high school was the haly year PE requirement in his junior year, which had been a struggle for him. But the group had chosen Sports (or more specifically, Pete had chosen Sports, and the girls had acquiesced), so Eugene wasn't going to fight it, Pete probably wouldn't play if the group picked another category. Plus, if Pete liked the game in sports mode, he might be inclined it later in its other modes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm up for a little Sports Trivia,\" Pete said, smiling. He wiped the smile off his face when he caught Judy glaring at him. She was still a little pissed off at the way he had just made the decision for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls just nodded in agreement, Lindsey looking interested but Judy still irritated at Pete. Eugene typed in the word Traditional, and in response, a small drawer opened, containing four hard plastic tokens in four different shapes and colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Choose your tokens, then input your choices</b></i>,\" the game intoned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Easy one,\" Pete said, reaching into the small drawer and grabbing the dark brown token shaped like a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If nobody minds?\" Lindsey said, reaching for the white token that looked like a pair of pom poms. Lindsey had always been a tech geek, even in high school, but she had also been a cheerleader The contradiction in her two inherent social crowds bothered a lot of people, but Lindsey seemed the thrive on it. When no one objected, Lindsey happily took the pom poms token.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only two tokens left, Judy picked one up the yellow one that looked like a canoe paddle. A little smile lit on her face. In recent years, she had been butting heads with her conservative parents over her appearance choices. In a lot of ways, Judy was almost as conservative as her parents, But she wanted the opportunity to experiment a little. Nothing drastic. No major lifestyle changes, really. And Judy was definitely avoiding drugs and alcohol. But she didn't want to get pigeonholed either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter their arguments, the family always had its summer float trips, And for those three weeks, all familial arguments were put on hold. In Judy's eyes, those three weeks were the most wonderful time of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Eugene with a blue marker that was shaped like the top half of a swimmer doing the American Crawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eugene was twelve, he had really been into youth competitive swimming. He had been good. He had been really good. As in, even at that age, his coaches were talking about him being in the Olympics in a few years, when he got to college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then disaster had struck Eugene's homelife, and he and his mother had to move out of the gated community there were living in, including the swimming league that Eugene had been in. By the time Eugene was eighteen, he was still able to go to college through a combination of scholarship, grant and savings, but his dreams of being an Olympic swimmer had disappeared years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Eugene secretly kept up with the sport, though he told no one that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene typed in everyone's names and token choices, and the game instructed, \"Choose Era.\" The game didn't list any dates, though, but instead listed five places. The group perused the list and chose: </span></div></div>",

A borrowed console, from an uncle introduced him to 'Hyper Sports', a rather crude joystick waggling/keyboard destroying game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shot Peter a withering look, it seemed to say, \"Even in video games, you're still the same Jock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words passed her lips, as they pressed together into a firm, thin line. She was resigned to going along with the consensus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immersive?\" Eugene asked, hoping for an easy agreement. There was no objection, and only limited enthusiasm, but he took that as agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe system surpised them again, seeming to have voice recognition as well as a touch screen. The 'Immersive' option was already selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe option selected at the bottom of the screen, 'Start', was flashing lazily between green and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Eugene asked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start.\" He said it clearly, as he faced the screen. Just double checking that it did do voice control. With a hint of doubt, he could pretend he was talking to his friends, if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round 1 - Swimming...\" The words appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that barely caught anyone's attention before they were all pulled towards and then through the screen. Their bodies stretching before squeezing through the too small screen as one merged entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene came back to himself, the scent of chlorine thick in the air. Looking to either side, he spotted two women in swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay... Judy?\" he asked their faces and bodies unfamiliar. Eugene faltered, that wasn't his voice. It wasn't even a mans' voice. Looking down she found her own bust. Bending forward, she spotted another woman beyond. She looked as uncomfortable as Eugene felt. Her hands exploring her body as if unfamiliar with anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned crimson, and turned to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene?\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women stood mounted their platforms ready to dive in and start the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lane 1: Pete looked terrified.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/0c/a6/ab0ca6e4e018008c2ef6afe5ebbeaf12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/0c/a6/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lane 2: Judy tried to offer a supportive smile, while secretly delighted with his discomfort.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/61/01/466101de5ef196802df388bbc539ec51.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/61/01/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lane 3: Eugene tried to ignore the sensation of her swimsuit disappearing where it shouldn't go...<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/23/50/34235053a6a5b809d022e26048b88b83.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/23/50/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lane 4: Lindsay completed the grouping.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/71/31/c4713123c37331d7bff20116965bce5f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/71/31/...</a></span></div></div>",

Prepare for the two hundred meter freestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcement caught all four players off guard, especially Eugene and Tim. Lindsey and Judy might be stuck in some weird virtual strange body, but at least they were women's bodies, and they had some prewired references.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Pete however, were strangers in a stranger land. Eugene, at least, had played first person video games with a female character, though that was hardly proper training for being encased in a female body. Pete didn't even have that background. And Pete had another secret that was about to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things that all four players were about to discover was their new bodies had the muscle memories of excellent swimmers, among other abilities. When the starter gun fired, those muscle memories kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost all of the muscle memories kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until age thirteen, Eugene had been a competitive swimmer, and was a very good one too. If his home life hadn't fallen through, Eugene might have gone to college on a swimming scholarship. His coaches all thought Eugene could have developed into an Olympic caliber swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, not long after his thirteenth birthday, Eugene and his mother had to leave the house in the community with the Olympic pool and training staff. By age eighteen, Eugene and his mother, through a combination of an academic scholarship, grants, loans and savings, could afford to send Eugene to Northpoint University. But the dreams thirteen year old Eugene had once had, had long since vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, when the starter gun fired, the new body and old memories meshed, and Eugene in his new body almost flew through the water. It would be an exaggeration to say Eugene finished the race before the other three even started it, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond place went to Judy. Judy may have not had Eugene's swimming background, but her family spent summers on the water, whether it was floating, rafting, sailing...whatever. Judy's body didn't react the way Eugene's had, but when the starter gun went off, and she saw Eugene start swimming, she followed suit. Her comfort with the water, combined with her new body's abilities, let her come in second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was strictly a pool party and water park swimmer. She was comfortable enough in the water, but not to the extent that Judy and Eugene were. Plus, when the starter gun had gone off, she had been examining her hands. She was sure that this was all somehow some super advanced virtual reality program, and she was trying to figure out how it worked. So it took her a couple of seconds to realize that a race had started. Plus, she was geeking at how real the water and everything felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was never a threat, though. First, Pete couldn't swim. So even with his body's abilities, he splashed and walked around more than swam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the four climbed out of the pool, the pool disappeared, and was replaced by a green lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four students still had the bodies they swam with, which were still dripping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was still a little freaked out at being a woman, and Lindsey was still geeking out at how \"real\" everything felt. Judy seemed to be the one who was adjusting to this immersion experience best. She was keeping an eye on her boyfriend, though. If Eugene looked like he was freaking out, Pete looked like he was just a few steps away from going catatonic. Judy had initially found it pretty funny that Pete had gotten stuck in a woman's body, but now she was a little worried. Well, more than a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJody was about to start a conversation with Eugene, to compliment him on how he dominated the swimming event (and try to draw him and her boyfriend out of any shells that they might be trying to dive into), when</span></div></div>",

The brunette had light olive skin, which was set off nicely by the white polo shirt and knee length tennis skirt she was wearing. The brunette had long black hair, reaching to the middle of her back, which she wore in a ponytail. Her brown eyes had a hint of laughter in them, laughter which reached  the curve of her lips. She was carrying a clipboard with a whistle hanging around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl got closer, Eugene suspected he'd be having a male reaction right now, if he had male equipment. Then a light went off in his head as he recognized the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one who sold me this game,\" he said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged,\" the brunette answered with a girn. \"How are you enjoying it so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's awesome,\" Lindsey enthused. \"Everything feels so real. I mean, I'll be honest, if I had designed my own avatar, I would have probably picked one that looked like me, but I don't have any imagination when it comes to gaming. But I like this avatar,\" she gushed, doing a pirouette. \"So, this game has wifi as well as this amazing virtual reality projection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" the brunette answered. \"So, how did you like your introductory game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Introductory game?\" Judy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette nodded. \"The easiest way to teach newcomers how the game works is to throw them off the deep end to teach them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey laughed at the brunette's joke, and even Judy rolled her eyes. Pete was quiet, eerily quiet. Eugene's head was darting around, his arms stiffly by his side, as if he was scared about where his eyes or hands might end up on the woman's body he was inhabiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um,\" Eugene began, \"Will we be playing in these bodies for the entire game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I came to talk to you about. It's why I also froze your boyfriend's avatar while I'm here,\" the brunette told Judy. \"He's a little excitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's having to play a woman avatar, and from what I've seen, it's kind of too realistic for both him and Eugene,\" Judy said, nodding toward both of the \"guys.\" \"And I'll admit, it was kind of funny at first. Pete can be kind of a sexist at times. But I think with how real all this is, and Pete having a problem with water, and well, maybe you could let the guys have guy characters for the rest of this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that,\" the brunette began. \"Let me start by explaining how the game works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, there's the introductory scenario,\" the brunette continued. \"That's where you got introduced to how the game works. Next there will be five tutorial scenarios. In all of these, you'll get a chance to win bonuses as you compete against each other. Maybe even some bonuses that you can take into the real world. Who knows? There'll be some penalties, but nothing bad. More laugh worthy than anything else,\" the brunette said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the main game?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be a series of challenges with other athletes, not just among yourselves,\" the brunette explained. \"The series of challenges will culminate with one big challenge. One of you will need to win that challenge and, at the end of the big challenge, all of you still in the game will need to shout Morphmanji to officially end the game. And whoever wins that last big challenge will get a special reward that will be explained to them at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait a minute,\" Eugene interrupted. \"What do you mean, still in the game? Can we be knocked out?\" Most of the sports related video games Eugene had ever played just went from one event to another. They weren't like other video games, where your character could be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you get past the tutorial and to the main game, you'll be given five lives,\" the brunette answered. \"If you fail in a particularly spectacular way, you lose a life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if you lose all five lives?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we?\" the brunette said evasively. \"Anyway, I'm here to hand out the rewards for your first competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette placed a gold medal on a blue ribbon around Eugene's neck. As soon as it touched Eugene's neck, the medal disappeared, and Eugene transformed back into himself. Actually, it was a version of Eugene, if Eugene had never stopped swimming six years ago. Eugene now had unusually broad shoulders  and a wide back, and had the lines of a strong swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reward for coming in first is that you get to keep this body at least through all the tutorial games, as well as through the first event of the main game. After that...\" the brunette shrugged. \"Depends on how you do in the main game. But there is a chance that you can take this body back to the real world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can a video game do that?\" Eugene asked, touching his face. It took all his willpower not to look inside the swim trunks that had appeared when he got a male body. But he could feel his regular \"equipment\" was back, and he never felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this feel like a regular game to you?\" the brunette asked. Standing in front of Judy, she said, \"I'll get back to you in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette produced a bronze medallion on a blue ribbon and placed it around Lindsey's neck. Lindsey turned back into herself. Well, an enhanced version of herself. Lindsey had kept herself in good shape, but her rainbow colored hair had turned back to its original blonde. Lindsey's hair now reached to her waist. Lindsey's breast, though still firm, had increased in size. Lindsey was now wearing a red one piece swimsuit and, looking down, she now knew what it have must been like to be Pamela Anderson in her Baywatch days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll have this body for at least the next two tutorial games,\" the brunette told Lindsey,\"And if you get a new body, it won't have a male \"equipment.\" There won't be a possibility of that happening until you get to the main game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad news and bad news for you, sport,\" the brunette said, turning to Pete. \"You have to keep that body for at least the next two tutorial rounds, and you won't get a chance at a male body until the main game begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was unable to move or respond, but his eyes stared daggers at the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally,\" the brunette said, turning to Judy, \"I can let you keep your new body through the tutorial games, or you can get your regular body, just enhanced, like your friend Lindsey got. And you can keep your enhanced regular body through at least two tutorial games, and not have to worry about getting a male body until the main games start. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette pulled out a silver medal on a blue ribbon, but waited for Judy to make her decision before placing it around Judy's neck. Judy thought about if for a few minutes before deciding to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A very realistic female body, if her own experiences were anything to judge by. But she could tell the whole thing was freaking him out to the point it wasn't funny anymore, especially since he seemed frozen in place right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to get my own body,\" Judy told the brunette. None of this was real, Judy told herself, even though it sure felt real. But she was curious what her \"optimized\" body would look like, at least in the games' eyes. Judy didn't consider herself in bad shape. But she had to admit, she could afford to lose a couple of pounds and do some conditioning. Maybe having the game show her the best version of herself would be inspiration enough for Judy to get herself into shape once she got back to the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette nodded and instantly Judy changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy found herself wearing a red, Baywatch style one piece swimsuit, just like Lindsey was wearing. She also found her hair and changed to its natural auburn color and was now long enough that it hung down to her breasts. Thankfully, at least in Judy's mind, her breasts were their normal DD cup size. But she could tell they were firmer, as was all of her body. The little pooch on her stomach that Judy had been carrying around since her freshman year was gone. So was the little chinese symbol she had had tattooed on the spot between her left thumb and forefinger. In fact, Judy noticed all her tattoos and piercing were gone even both pairs in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was about to ask the brunette to reconsider letting Pete at least have a male body, when she noticed the brunette disappeared. Pete found himself able to move and speak again, but before he could, the surroundings the four found themselves in, as well as the clothing they all wore, instantly changed, and the first of the five tutorial games was getting ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What event are Judy, Lindsey, Eugene and Pete about to participate in?)</span></div></div>",

On them, in chipped, old looking white stenciled labels were the words 'Traditional' and 'Immersive'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traditional and Immersive? Eugene, what did the box say about these again? I think we should all know what we're getting into before we just make a decision that affects everyone\" Judy said, giving her boyfriend a glaring side-eye through her heavy eye-liner and hopefully trying to intimidate the normally caring jock from making any other brash, jerkish decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Peter just thought it looked kinda hot, but he played up the 'whipped boyfriend' act so that the gang would stop being mad at him. And he was a little confused as to why, exactly, he'd just batted Eugene's hands away and just selected sports as the game type. He wasn't typically a jerk like that, especially to his friend (who needed all the help he could get getting out of that nerdy little shell of his), and the feeling of just being...compelled to tap the screen left him with a weird after-taste in his mouth. It tasted like...green? But the feeling (and taste) quickly passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, guys. Guess I just have football on the brain. I've, uh, been a little worried about what's gonna happen in the fall with the, uh, Coronavirus and all. Kinda my scholarship thing\" Peter said with a shrug and a sheepish grin, and hoped that it was a sympathetic enough excuse. He was rewarded with Judy's glare softening just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, it's actually called Covid-19. Coronavirus was just the, um, term for like when it just gets discovered in a human and stuff\" Lindsey said with a knowing nod. She wanted to tag on how, like, totally not cool it was for Peter to have done that but she relented. She didn't fully believe his apology but Pete was definitely at the top of the list for jocks that had surprised her for not playing to the stereotype. But it was a pretty short list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Pete I, uh, just want us to have a good time\" Eugene said with a thumbs up and a smile that looked every letter of the word 'forced'. Eugene wasn't really a sports guy at all, with baseball being the only one he could really tolerate (mainly because he had fond memories of going to Dodger's Stadium with his mom and grandpa when he was a little kid), but Peter had been a good friend to him. A slip up here and there wasn't enough to just end their friendship like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Judy knew that Peter clearly wasn't truly sorry for making the decision for everyone, but unlike Lindsey, actually believed his excuse. Peter, in private, could actually be something of a mess when it came to his scholarship stuff. The big palooka was smart and if pressed could probably find a major to support him if they DID cancel his scholarship due to the pandemic...But despite his family being pretty well off, Peter had often gone on rants about how his dad wouldn't financially support him if he messed it up. That was, after all, part of the reason Peter had come all the way out here to Colorado rather than attending some expensive East Coast Ivy League school. Cheaper tuition and a smaller student loan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, if all that hadn't happened, Judy never would have met her darling buffoon. There was no telling what would have happened if he hadn't been there to support her and give her the confidence to actually live HER life, not that stuffy, oppressive life that had been built for her back home. The one she'd run away from. So she was a little more willing to accept Peter's apology, even if she was biased. But then the moment passed and she cleared her throat once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do to get started, Eugene? What's the difference between the modes again?\" The top-heavy and curvy goth girl asked the overweight freshman once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, I, uh...\" Eugene's eyes went wide as he fumbled for the lid of the box the strange R2D2-esque game had come in, \"It, uh...Well Traditional is just like a normal board game and Immersive is more like, uh, Dungeons and Dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, with sports it'll be more like Stratego or something\" Peter chimed in from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or yeah. That.\" Eugene nodded, not really knowing WHAT exactly Stratego outside of the version Peter owned was from the 70s and in dire need of replacment. But then the geek sputtered as Lindsey reached over and brushed her hand against his and, like a cat, swiftly swiped the box lid out of Eugene's hands as she took it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um...\" Lindsey brushed a few rainbow-colored strands of hair from her face as he brow furrowed in concentration, \"It totally comes pre-loaded with some, um, presets but we can set it up to play like, however we want. We just push the button and then we, like, get to choose our game pieces. Then we just type in the piece names into that tiny little keyboard and hit enter and the game will start. Oh, wait, that's just for Immersive. IF we go, um, traditional and stuff, we gotta choose a game length but it'll totally be conformed to what game we want. Like baseball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of football\" Peter added in, causing everyone to frown once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Or yeah. Football\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just think we need to choose something that EVERYONE will enjoy. Not just the people that know a thing or two about sports\" Judy said as she leaned over to inspect the game's lid. That was a LOT of text and it was small and faded and aftera moment she just gave up trying to read it from this distance. Instead she just naturally fell into the role of peacemaker; knowing that compromise was usually the best way forward after having spent her entire life unknowingly miserable at having everything decided for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can teach you guys how to play Stratego if traditional is like that. It's SUPER easy\" Peter offered, his voice more than just hinting that he wanted it to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Immersive is like. Like do we actually have to, um, play sports and junk?\" Lindsey said, softly biting a nail and pretending not to notice Eugene shifting in his seat. Specifically shifting his pants in his seat as his face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of Peter-dominant discussion with a dialogue back and forth about each version of the game and then Lindsey passing the game lid around so that everyone had a chance to look over the rules and differences between game modes (the rainbow-blonde noticed that everyone had a slightly different interpretation of the rules as they read them, as if the faded text was altering itself slightly of, like, something), the group took a vote and chose to play in...</span></div></div>",

Maybe the quicker than finished this, the quicker they could go back and choose a game type they actually liked. Or get pizza from Peter's 'pizza dude'. It was, after all, almost 5pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Peter pumped his fist in the air triumphantly, and reached over to push the 'Traditional' button back down into the machine, the plastic creaking dangerously from the force of his touch.

Why did it taste like...green?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I, um, think it's just to make sure we-we get the experience we, uh, want\" Eugene muttered, to which Lindsey just squiggled a finger in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say Genie?\" The rainblow blonde asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said let's pick a sport to play!\" Peter boomed with joyful enthusiasm, \"Hey Lindsey type in footb-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't mister!

She wasn't particularly thrilled about the prospect of playing an actual sport. She may have been a cheerleader but that was because it was fun and because it looked good when she had been applying for the sorority. They may have been a little less 'stereotypical' to some other organizations, but Gamma Upsilon Rho Lambda still had it's hang-ups in regards to traditional gender roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big black button finally locked into place with a click and there was a metallic buzzing sound before the game boomed \"SPORTS: IMMERSIVE MODE CHOSEN. PLAYERS CHOOSE THEIR AVATARS. PRESS START TO BEGIN\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, doesn't this thing have a volume control!?\" Eugene winced as the horribly distorted voice rolled over the group again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to come to more games, dude. You get used to loud noises\" Peter shrugged as he sat on the edge of the couch, his foot tapping in excitement. And here he thought Judy's whole 'let's get Eugene and Lindsey together!' plan was going to be boring. He wasn't sure what this weirdo machine was going to do, but it was still sports, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a bitter, burning smell began to fill the dorm's common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Did it short out?\" Judy cried as she pinched her nose shut as the stink tried to invade her nostrils. Eugene and Peter did the same thing, while Lindsey, while clearly not enjoying the smell, wasn't alarmed by the tiny smoke trail rising out of a tiny ventilation port in the side of the outrageously detailed machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah Ju-Ju, this is what a 3D printer smells like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, there's no way something this old could have one of those in it!\" Eugene said, leaning in close and taking out his phone, flipping the flashlight on as he tried to peer around at the darkened interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah huh! 3D printers existed in the 80s y'know! They were just, like, SUPER big and totes rare. And I've NEVER seen one this small! Genie, you could be sitting on something you could sell to like, the tech lab or something!\" Lindsey, said, pressing her face in close to Eugene's as well as she was and had been DYING to take the machine apart and look at all the neat custom analogue tech. That was what she loved about old machines, they were always different! Always new! Now everything was so software reliant and standardized. It made making some money on the side building rigs for people easier, but Lindsey definitely missed the days back in Seattle where she'd find old retro-tech and take it apart and build new stuff with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene simply tried not to start stuttering again as he felt the sorority girl's smooth cheek-flesh rub against his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then with a loud DING, a tray slid out from the side of the game console, and in it was a pile of highly detailed plastic figures of a variety of colors (even beyond that of Lindsey's own rainbow-filled locks), and all of them were sports-related. In the center of the mass of figurines however, was a small stand that held what was clearly a red football player, a large blue pom-pom, a strange yellow figure that was some kind of mascot, and...a green water bottle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEE! Even the game wants us to play football!\" Peter practically squealed as he reached forward to grab the red piece, only have Judy bat away his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare, mister! You've been a butthead this whole time, so as of now I am officially banishing you from making choices for us!\" Judy fumed, planting a black-tipped finger on the (admittingly hunky) chest of her boyfriend and pointing to the far end of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but Jude-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO BUTTS! and if you can't play nice, you won't get mine either\" Judy said with a indignant huff, crossing her arms across her substantial chest and sticking her nose in the air, much to the delight of Lindsey who broke out into a fit of giggles while Eugene just looked away out of politeness, choosing to instead inspect the other figurines in the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an abundance of them, all nicely arranged into individual sections that were clearly labelled. The one with the basketball and, well, the lanky figure in the jersey shared a slot with another set of pompoms, this time yellow, and a green mascot. There was one with a baseball player holding a bat, a glove, a baseball, and then finally some kind weird...cage helmet looking thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pete probably know what it is' Eugene thought with a shrug as he ignored the rather comical domestic antics that were taking place on the couch, egged on by Lindsey. There was another one for hockey, soccer, boxing, even wrestling! In fact, this tray wasn't even all there was to select from! Eugene noticed the small seam in the plastic and gave the metal tray a soft shake and felt his eyes go wide as the tray jostled softly backwards, revealing ANOTHER tray full of colored figurines, all assigned to a sport! Eugene leaned back and grabbed the box lid, the piece of compressed cardboard somehow containing all the information they needed to know how to play the game. He scanned the rules again and then found more text hiding on part of the box he thought had been scraped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morphmanji tokens are one of the most important aspects of the game. Choosing a token and inputing the information into the console will act as your game-type selection, as well as determine your avatars for the game. Choose carefully, once a game is started, new avatars CANNOT be obtained!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" The overweight geek said, drawing attention away from a rather emasculated looking Peter that was currently cartoonishly pinned beneath Judy's butt and back to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, whatcha find there, Genie?\" Lindsey cooed as she crawled from her beanbag where she'd spent thel ast couple of minutes laughing and instead plopped herself next to Eugene, making no effort at all to maintain social distancing as she LEANED into him and reduced the mostly eloquent nerd into a red, stuttering mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, uh f-found more, um, pieces if we wanna, if we wanna um, you know, play a different set of s-sports\" He gibbered, his eyes flicking this way and that as he tried to focus on anything other than Lindsey's impossibly cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ugh don't get a boner don'tgetabonerdon'tgetaboner' He thought frantically, and tried not to sigh in relief as Lindsey eventually turned away to inspect the pieces for herself as Judy and Peter untangled themselves on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SELECT AVATARS AND PRESS START\" The game unexpectedly buzzed once more, catching the young adults off guard. Eugene could have sworn it sounded...annoyed? Or maybe just impatient? But unless it was programmed like that, and the voice was certainly synthetic enough that it sounded like it came from an old Speak'n'Spell, there was no way it could be, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh, seriously do NOT like how loud this thing is\" Lindsey grumbled, \"So, like, what do we wanna play? Basketball, Baseball? Hockey? Oh what about this game with these cute horsies!\" The skinny yet spunky sorority member reached into the second tray and pulled out game pieces that were clearly associated with Polo and showed them to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh, horses stink. They smell like ass and they spit\" Peter groaned as he continued to eye the football figurines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a riveting discussion which was momentarily paused so the group could get a handful of drinks and some light snacks to hold off the late afternoon hunger pangs, the students finally decided to play as...</span></div></div>",

In the distance he saw a ranch house, but otherwise the prairie was empty.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stagecoach were two other people. One was a sleeping older man, who looked to be a merchant of some sort. The other was a man wearing the very stiff collar of a frontier preacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene had a law book sitting on his lap, and he knew that on top of the stagecoach, he had bags full of other books as well as clothes. Eugene knew he was wearing a suit that was the latest fashion in New York City, but would get him labeled a \"dude\" in the frontier town of Bone Creek, where Eugene was heading at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene knew his body was made lean and strong from growing up on a farm in upstate New York, but that he had none of the practical skills needed on the western frontier. But he was heading for Bone Creek because the town was booming, and needed a good attorney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the porch of the ranch house in the distance was Pete. Pete knew he was the oldest son and the right hand man of the biggest rancher in the territory. Pete knew he couldn't read beyond a second grade level, but he excelled in all those practical skills of a frontier rancher, including gunslinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nearby town of Bone Creek, Judy (whose busty body had trimmed up a little, as well as lost all its tattoos, piercings and nail color) was the local dressmaker, and her father owned the adjoining mercantile store. Across town, Lindsey, whose hair was now simply blonde, was the new young school marm. Lindsey and brown haired Judy wore their hairs in tight buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstilled in all four of the players' brains was that the first thing they needed to do is find the other players, and incidentally, not get killed in the process. They knew that they were currently in tutorial mode, and so lost lives wouldn't count against them, whatever that meant. And they knew more rules and their ultimate goal would be explained to them when they are able to get together, and at that point the \"real\" game would begin. Beyond that, they had no idea what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Which player will we follow to watch the story unfold?)</i></span></div></div>",

It\u2019s, like, real-life stuff!

Even made some based off of you guys.\u201d She wiped a mock tear from her mascaraed eye. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Peter the First drowned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I <i>saw</i> you delete the pool ladder.\u201d whined Peter, poking his girlfriend\u2019s side with a thick finger. \u201cI call foul play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove <b>anything</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and Lindsey watched the couple mock-fight with smiles, shaky and merry respectively. The slightly-paunched nerd gave a quick cough to draw everyone\u2019s focus back to the entertainment thing-a-majig, \u201cFunnily enough, there <i>is</i> an Education category.

Lindsay already looked on the verge of dropping it, and throwing the game. Peter looked like he'd have preferred a more sports based game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to start the game before any objections were raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing the 'Start Game', a chip-tune emerged from the games system, and it started a countdown. Eugene frowned, not expecting it needed to load any levels, or even be capable of such complexity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as he looked around, he suddenly spotted his hands instead of gripping the controller were turning to dust. The various particles only loosely held in place. The murmur of panic told him, that his friends had noticed too. The next moment, the dust started to race towards the screen. Drawing more of his arm into the dusty flurry, before reaching his body. His scream was cut out, as his chest was overrun by the ... the whatever... His thoughts still jumbled and terrified. Eugene was trying to lean back, further and further to avoid this. But as it reached his face, Eugene's vision went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBodiless, he felt himself thrown wildly about. Ricochetting around invisible corners, or drawn down some twisting wire. The sensations stopped before he could analyse it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was back in the real world... Or, if it was the game one, it was very impressive. No longer where he was, his eyes darted wildly around. Ignoring the other people, he took only a few moments to realise he was in an office... Well, the tea room. The kettle clicked off, and he spotted the four mugs sitting ready for the boiling water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about this moment, as Eugene wanted as much normality as possible. He reached out to pour a mug for everyone he spotted the feminine hand reaching for the kettle. His own hand. Twisting his wrist this way and that, Eugene confirmed it was a woman's hand... and following his gaze up that arm. He found a slender shoulder, and the unmistakable bulge of his bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather disconcerting from this angle. She felt her heart race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring the water, the air filled with the unmistakable aroma of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eugene...\" he said, his voice now trilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/11/42/cc1142e74031a934cf33500894fe8c03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/11/42/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Jeanie...\" Another girl quipped.

Maybe if we screw up 5 times we get a game over and who knows what happens then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter gulped as his eyes widened in terror.

Judy and Peter didn't share the same love of homework as the two nerdier members of their group, but didn't want to rain on their parade.  Now that the 4 had settled down and into this world a little bit more, a clock went off implying the tea break was over.  The four players went to their starting stations behind their desks which were conveniently all beside each other and right outside of the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Peter could even sit down he heard the mad tapping of computer keys from Eugene and Lindsay's stations.  Judy was already answering a phone call and Peter was just staring at a blank screen not sure what to do first.  He already felt like he was in last place, something his competitive nature was not a fan of, but he had no idea how to get the promotion first to win and turn everything back.</span></div></div>",

He saw how quickly Jeanie was typing, his years of coding giving him a speed that Petra couldn't challenge. Looking over to the impressive Judy, he recalled her from before. She already knew how to use her 'charms' to get what she wanted. Though she put it rather differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/21/f3/eb21f3769db250b6a3881b5623a4ba3e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/21/f3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was escalating with those bare shoulders, and her bust more on display. An unsettling inferiority gripped Petra as she looked Lindsay over. If she wanted to win, she'd need to play dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a sway into her hips, she sashayed over to the boss' door. A firm rap with her knuckles received a shouted 'Come In...', from Leo Carruthers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure how much feminine allure to put into her appeal for the promotion. She just strode over, and asked for it. Giving her experience (whatever it was), as the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's gaze rose to meet Petra's face, pausing only briefly on her neckline and the cleavage presented there. Petra suddenly realised, what Judy had meant. Her sex and sexuality wasn't something she'd brought to the negotiation... It was the other person... a police officer, with a threat of a ticket... and a casual invitation for a date being offered. Just not explicitly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, Petra watched in horror, as Leo raised a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you girls, could make the same argument... You have similar amounts of experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSingling each of them out, with a stab of the pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean is my fastest typist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy one of the best for closing sales...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to struggle with Lindsay, his face silently confessing she was there as eye-candy. In her lurid top, and too tight skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you... Petra, you have your own skill sets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftening his approach, \"I know it's difficult, you'll all have the answer at the end of the day. There won't be this cloud of uncertainty hanging over all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to escalate, and end this Petra decided to play her appeal card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do to sway your decision?\" she asked innocently. Her question deliberately neutral, she kept any sexual suggestion from her tone, and any explicit promise clear from the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she did rest her hands on his desk, as she bent from the waist. Giving him a view deep into her cleavage, as the girls themselves strained to fall from Petra's lacy bra cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealing one last lingering look (If it could be called stealing, when it was being so clearly offered). Leo sighed with regret, before sinking back into the deep padding of his swivel chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" he answered with clear restraint, \"You'll just have to wait until the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny, crystal clear chime sounded in the air. Leo didn't react as if it had sounded. But Petra was absolutely sure she'd heard it. Looking around, she saw her three friends looking through the office glass to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissed and defeated, she left his office. A glance to her ID badge showed 4 lives inscribed there. Worse, Petra felt another change too. A punishment to go with her lost life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/f5/62/e9f562e6fd5517fe35e4bf47544d5cbf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/f5/62/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt felt more tightly packed.

Perhaps a juicy ass was a reasonable price after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra's musing were missed by Judy who was strutting proudly towards Leo's office. Sure the promotion was literally in her hands.

In the last ten minutes she'd barely completed three pages due to her slower and inefficient typing habits, her fingers naturally conforming to the WASD positioning used for gaming rather than the 'Home Row' method they'd taught in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanie risked a glance up at Lindsey, and the natural woman was yawning, a look of boredom on her face as she seemed to type without needing to look at the keyboard every few seconds. She leaned back and took her hands off the keys, stretching her arms and pushing her breasts put prominently, and Jeanie felt her own hands flop over the keys in distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeanie, is it hot in here?\" Lindsey asked innocently, looking around before wiping her brow dramatically, \"Maybe it's just all these computers...I just really wish I had a way to cool down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey then casually undid several buttons on her blouse, the light green fabric splitting apart to dangle a canyon of cleavage in front of Jeanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's MUCH better!\" Lindsey giggled as she wiggled in her chair, sending her assets jiggling, \"Well, back to, like work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teasing girl went back to work with a smirk, her rapid fire typing filling the air between them once again, Jeanie couldn't help but feel as though she'd blundered into a trap. She tore her gaze from the dangling bust and took a deep breath. She could do this! She just had to focus! </span></div></div>",

All the inventory reports are done!\" Lindsey beamed as she practically skipped into Leo's office, her ass wiggling nicely in her shiny, tight black skirt and her breasts bounced in her loose shirt. Jeanie frowned heavily, part turned on and part outraged. How...How could Lindsey trap her like this!? Now she was going to lose a life and be one step closer to...whatever happened in the game once they lost all their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was conveniently skipping over the fact that the reason she was about to lose a life was also partly her own fault, given she made the bet in the first place and then made the stupid assumption that just because she had been a guy with a lifetime of playing video games that somehow she'd be better than the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure how to feel about that thought now, feeling a bit miffed that sexism, however much she had tried to avoid it, still crept into her brain. And what would the old her even think if he could see her now? Would the geek see that she was an attractive young woman working hard with the specific skill-set she had or...Would the boy simply get a hard-on at the way she wiggled and think of her as nothing more than an over-sexed and stupid piece of eye candy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, the way Jeanie had fallen into Lindsey's trap...She honestly couldn't have blamed her old self if he had thought that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she saw Lindsey at the office door, a confused look on her face as she slowly shut it. Three heads popped up towards the window as the secretary pool began whispering among themselves. Jeanie suddenly felt as though she'd been spared, and turned back to her computer screen to continue typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey, you can't possibly expect me to accept this\" Leo said, his voice low and steady, but clearly disappointed and upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I finished all of them! And even before the deadline!\" Lindsey squeaked in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'd rather let the Board read a incomprehensible report full of rather basic typing errors instead of taking your time, as a professional should, and making sure that you're spelling things like 'the' right instead of 'teh' and 'ivantary' instead of 'inventory'? I really expected more of you, Ms. Michaels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but!\" She whined as the chime sounded and she looked down at her employee ID as a bar was subtracted, leaving her with four lives left. \"N-no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second half of the punishment began as Lindsey felt her rear press swell dramatically, pressing against the already tight fitting skirt. She felt the material threatening to split apart from just standing there. She desperately wanted to feel how large it was now, but she was frozen in fear...If she felt herself up in front of her current boss...She might lose (and gain) even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to your desk, Ms. Michaels. I expect a completed and professional looking copy of this on my desk by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey summoned her courage and whimpered a less than confident \"Yes sir\" before turning and carefully wiggling herself to the door, her skirt squeaking and groaning as the material struggled to hold in her swollen new rear. She opened the office door and quietly tip-toed out, looking down into her cleavage to avoid the smirk stares from Petra and Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...It should have worked!\" She muttered to herself, seeing Jeanie burying herself in her work, fingers chattering away on the keyboard. She carefully lowered herself into the now smaller chair and winced at how her hips now bumped against the hard plastic armrests, forcing Lindsey to push herself down in order to fit back at her desk, and gave a huff that bordered on a sob as she went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...She was better than this! She hacked TWO different college servers! She could write basic data entry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Lindsey could feel worse about herself, Leo's voice called out from his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Petra, I need you in the office for a moment. Something has come...up\" Their boss said ominously, and the secretaries stared at Petra in sympathy and worry as the former athlete tried desperately to not freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means now, please\" Leo called out again, and there was a steely undercurrent to his voice. Ptra scrambled to her feet, did her best not to fall over, and minced into the manager's office, shutting the door behind her.</span></div></div>",

She took a heaving breath and turned to face the...video game character? REally person?

Then a devious thought crossed Peter's mind.  The paperwork seemed to have some space to write and add a few things.  Perhaps he could give himself a glowing review and maybe bring the other 3 down a peg or two.  '<i>It'd only be fair.  The others already had skills that gave them a head start, why shouldn't I get my own bonus boost?</i>'.

The clouds outside were dark, blocking out much of the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra had never felt more alone, isolated and vulnerable. As Leo walked back to the desk, she felt rooted to the desk. Afraid to flee, and disobey her immediate superior.

Leo's other hand returned to her thigh. This time rising, she whimpered and mewled afraid to make a noise, or protest. Even as she became aware, he was sliding his hands to explore her crotch. Pulse racing, eyes darting wildly for any escape. Leo took that as excitement, as evidence of her horny need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to show how committed you are to the company... to <i>pleasing</i> your bosses...\" As Leo's calm steady words reached her ears, they felt to Petra like screaming demands.... <i>Please me or be fired....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go along to get along...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncreasing the weight of his hand on her shoulder, he slowly bent Petra's head lower.

But as she pulled the purse out and lifted it's familiar weight over her shoulder, she frowned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Jones really her last name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and waved a curt goodbye to the other women, sashaying towards the main door and opening it, before she felt a hand on her shoulder. Petra turned and blinked in surprise at Judy's concerned face pressed close to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petra...\" Judy whispered \"What is happening? Where...Where are you going? You didn't get fired did you!?\" Judy was terrified at the prospect of losing her boyfriend (currently a girlfriend) because of her mean-spirited pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Don't tell Jeanie or Lindsey but...\" Petra glanced back at the other two players who were trying their best to look busy...while also trying to eavesdrop, \"If I do this, I get all the little marks on my badge back! I wish I could tell you more but...You've been, like, mean to me here so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy felt her cheeks burn at the deserved accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get down to HR, I'll see you in a few hours\" Petra said and moved through the door, but she stopped and leaned in, her breasts hanging heavily off her torso as she bit her lip in confusion, \"Judy, was my last name always...Jones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Judy wasn't expecting that question, and she dumbly looked at Petra's ID badge, \"I...I think so? I mean, if this is a game, why would it change our names? Mine is still Ross, after all\" Judy lifted her badge up and pointed at her name: Judaesha Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...But it doesn't...Doesn't feel right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll figure it out when you get back. I'm sorry I was teasing you so much. I'll make it up to you...after I win. Good luck!\" Judy said with a quick peck on Petra's cheek, and the two parted ways as the pin-striped beauty returned to her desk while Petra wandered out into the halls of the austere office building. Luckily HR wasn't too hard to find, a series of helpful arrows led her down a couple of corridors and a few closed doors, the sounds of typical office work coming from within them. And then she was there, the large door that was labeled \"Human Resources\". Without missing a beat, Petra opened the door and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another large office, a row of low cubicles full of of similarly stunningly pretty women working intently on computers, chattering quietly into phones or typing at lightning speed on keyboards. Some of them cast her a curious look, but quickly resumed working. There was a very perky (and busty) blonde at the front desk, who gave Petra a toothy smile that had no warmth to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. You must be the girl going to fix our warehouse problem?\" The blonde said in a perky, clipped tone. Petra forced her eyes to crawl out of the massive chest the woman had and focused on her cold blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yes, Petra...Petra Jones\" She held out her ID for the woman to read. After a moment and a sharp look of suspicion, the woman sighed and placed a clipboard on the counter. On it were a small stack of papers full of tiny print that Petra wasn't going to sign, all of them labeled 'Corporate Vehicle Authorization Form'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign and date these, please\" The icy blonde said, clicking a pen and practically thrusting it in Petra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay...\" Petra scribbled her name and the date onto five different colored sheets of paper as quickly as she could before returning the clipboard to the blonde, who snatched it away and handed her a single key fob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Please note that failure to return the vehicle on time will result in penalties up to and including termination. Damages will result in penalties and a written reprimand on your personnel file. But you don't have to worry about gas. Corporate will take car of that. Oh, and we've already had the directions to the warehouse plugged into the GPS. Just follow the directions to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Got it. Thanks\" Petra tried her best not to roll her eyes as she plucked the keys out of the blonde's hands and turned for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ha, GPS. What am I, a woman or something? I've never gotten lost before' The boy turned woman chuckled to herself as she opened the heavy door and moved through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, you'l-\" The blonde called out, but Petra pulled the door shut behind her before the other secretary could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Petra wasn't sure if the blonde had said something else, her voice seemed to carry...But the door back into the HR office refused to budge as she tried to open it again. It didn't even shake in the door handle, it was as still as though the door had simply become part of the wall, preventing her from accessing the office on the other side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...\" She muttered, but everything about this place was weird, especially the fact that it otherwise was NOT weird. The brunette made her way to the elevator, waited in the otherwise silent, white and black hallway until the elevator car arrived and walked in, seeing her reflection on the three walls do the same. Petra pressed the button that would take her to the garage level, and turned to face her nearest reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm DAMN hot!\" Petra grinned, and she began posing to herself, unaware of the camera in the corner of the car. After all, if this game did end, when would the next chance she'd have to look THIS good again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as have some fun with it! Damn girl, you're SO fine...\" She purred to no one but herself as she posed for the entire elevator trip downwards. But when the car reached it's terminus, Petra was all professional (or the nearest she could get to it) and walked out into the brightly lit garage that was filled with generic white vehicles. Vans, trucks, and way too many sedans fill the parking spaces, and the former athlete pondered the possibility of if she and the other secretaries had personal vehicles in here...But she shrugged the thought off and pressed the key fob, a glossy sedan chirping to life a few spaces from the elevator doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice, this is way better than my old truck!\" Petra giggled, strutting over and sliding in (which was more difficult than it seemed at first, given her acquired 'assets'), starting the engine, and following the bright arrows on the pavement until she was rising up and out of the garage and onto a city street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's see...Warehouse...\" The secretary looked at the GPS and decided to...</span></div></div>",

On the one hand, she considered it a personal challenge to always be able to find her way to her destination without the use of maps or GPS. Certainly with directions, but it was a point of pride with her. But then again...She hadn't gotten any directions, and given what was at stake she decided to err on the side of caution and just this once, use the GPS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a game anyway, not like it counts\" She muttered to herself as she hit her blinker and very slowly and carefully merged into the lazy down-town traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the warehouse wasn't much of an issue, save for a few red lights and a missed turn because some Karen in a minivan wouldn't let her merge. Well, she COULD have made the merge but she wasn't willing to potentially damage the company car. Instead she simply took a short detour and got back on track, weaving through late-morning city streets with relative ease. And she was glad to have made the smart decision to follow the GPS; this city looked like nothing Petra recognized. In another life, Petra had been learned how to drive on East Coast traffic, the urban gridlock of rough roads that seemed perpetually under construction and the experiences had left her as somewhat of a master at navigating through city traffic. But this city...It sort of reminded her of that silly movie 'Transformers' she watched as a little girl, pretty indistinct and lacking any real landmarks, just...office buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she tried not to focus on it too much as she moved away from what was clearly the commercial and financial district and out into what was clearly more industrial. As Petra rolled up to a rather large brick building with a fleet of trucks waiting in loading bays, the GPS chimed out that she had 'reached her destination'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Doris\" She said sarcastically, and navigated through a very tightly packed parking lot, finding precisely one open space near the entrance doors. She pulled in, put the vehicle in park, pulled the key s out of the ignition and stepped out into the suddenly chilly air. Petra let loose a gasp as goosebumps appeared on her smooth flesh, and she let loose another one as her nipples grew firm beneath her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hell!\" She breathed, and she fought the urge to just...do something with them as she spotted someone walking up to the other side of the warehouse's office doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we go!\" Petra took a deep breath, held herself as professionally as possible and moved towards the door with a smile on her face. She reached out with a long-nailed hand and opened the door to find a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Petra made her way into the warehouse's front lobby, she jumped in surprise as a blood-curdling scream filled her ears. There, being dragged out by her heels, was a knockout blonde in a red blazer and skirt that looked like she belonged in porn...or at least a strip club, her assets almost dwarfing Petra's own. Two burly, grim-faced security guards had a tiny arm in each hand, grunting with effort as the woman was doing her best to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! LET ME GO! I-I CAN FINISH IT! LET ME GO I CAN'T-\" The blonde was screaming, and Petra quickly moved out of the way, pressing herself against the beige (and stained) colored walls as the security guards moved for the doors. \"I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS!\" The blonde wailed, and then she spotted Petra. With a primal, furious scream, the blonde wrenched herself out of the grip of the two guards and raced towards Petra, grabbing hold of her arm and digging her nails into Petra's dark skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! YOU HAVE TO GO BACK! I CAN'T STAY IF YOU'RE HERE! I HAVE TO GET PR-\" The blonde's wild-eyed rambling was cut short as there was a electric sound, her body going tense, then limp as her eyes rolled into the back of her head as she released Petra's arm. She convulsed on her feet for just a moment before collapsing to the floor, two wires sticking out of her back and leading towards one of the security guards, who was holding a taser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry 'bout that miss. Mondays, right?\" The other guard grunted unapologetically, moving to drag the blonde away in a rather indelicate manner as the other guard removed the taser from the (other) big titted woman, a small black scorch mark in the middle of her blazer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer expected. Take the hallway on the left, firt door. Manager'll set you up. And, uh, don't mention any o'this, alrighty? Wouldn't have to file a complaint with corporate or nothin'\" The guard hefted the blonde over his broad shoulder and fixing Petra with a rather ominous stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Sure? Yes. Sure. Have a good day, uh, fellas?\" Petra said with the best grin she could manage. The guards looked at each other and then tipped the brim of their caps in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, miss\" The two uniformed men then turned and without another word, carrying the unconscious blonde through the entrance doors and disappearing around the corner, leaving Petra alone in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, trying to calm her frazzled nerves and took in her new workplace for the rest of the day. The front lobby was small, plain, and was definitely in need of a deep clean or a refurbish. There were stains on the wall and the tile floor looked as it it hadn't been waxed or buffed in years. In front of the doors was the company logo, a simple circle with some kind of weird figure 8 looping out of the top and bottom of it. But what had been with the girl? The way she was talking it sounded like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No. Nu-uh. You're here to do a job, Petra. Whatever else happens you don't got to worry about' She scolded herself, shaking the concerned thought from her head as she focused on what the security guard had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...Hallway to the left....First door...\" She whispered as she clicked through the otherwise empty seeming building, making a left at the logo and seeing a door that had 'OFFICE' stenciled upon it. \"Well, that was easy enough\" She said with a shrug, her confidence returning. She paused in front of the door, took a breath and tried to find the 'professional' feeling she was trying VERY hard to cultivate, now that she was being given this chance to get rid of all the marks in her file. Petra nodded to herself, gripped the handle of the door and pulled...And then pushed as she realized it was one of THOSE kinds of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office on the other side was a mess. There were papers stacked high in trays and, dozens of binders scattered across the floor, and a desk that had a computer and monitor that were clearly in the wrong decade stacked on a tiny desk. One wall was dominated by over-flowing file cabinets, while another had what looked like two-sided mail slots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, in the center of the mess, was a short, weasel faced fat man whose hair was so greasy and oily looking that Petra had a amusing mental picture of a oil derrick sitting upon the man's head, spewing black gold into the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bitch just had to hit me\" The man groaned as he picked himself up, leaning over to collect a large pair of heavy rimmed glasses from the floor before her turned to face Petra, his face red and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be the replacement for Stacy. I'm Gary, I'm the Super here, welcome aboard\" He said, offering a flabby, sweaty hand out to Petra, whose eyes were burning from the AWFUL smell that rolled out of his triple-chinned mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Petra! Petra Jones!\" She said, fighting her gag reflex, taking Gary's hand and trying not to shiver from the slippery sweat that engulfed her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure. Now, lot of shit to do here. As you can see, we make due with what we have. This ain't a fancy white collar down-town office\" Gary said, releasing her hand after a moment and turning away, Petra sucking in a breath of...well, FRESHER air, \"Job's pretty simple. Just process the reports on Ol'Numbers here\" Gary pointed to the computer, \"And whenever mail comes in, sort it and put it in the right slot for one of the dumbfucks out on the floor to grab on the way out. Break room is next door, bathroom down the hall. It's just one stall though so we all have to share. Reggie will be in and out. He's the shift manager, make sure he gets the updated inventory sheets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra's eyes widened at that. A unisex...single stall bathroom? That...That couldn't be legal, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and my office is out there so I can keep an eye on the boys. Faxes come in here, anything with my name on it you bring out to me, same with calls. Just use this door, but please DON'T bother me with stupid simple shit. If you got a question or need to look up something, it's all in the resource binders and the file cabinets\" Gary pointed to the rather ancient looking wooden door at the end of the office,. \"Hope you're a better mutli-tasker than Stacy was, toots. Impress me and I'll let your boss know you did a good job\" Gary said with a chuckle as he exited the small office that now belonged to Petra, a letting out a low, slow fart that filled the room with the smell of methane, sulphur and rotten eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra gagged and then coughed, waving her hand through the air to diffuse the invisible cloud of toxic gas as she started to think that maybe coming out here may have been a mistake. A big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she didn't get much of a chance to regret her decision, as the moment the rear door closed, the phone on the desk began to ring.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first hour of working as the warehouse 'office associate' had been rough, to put it mildly. Petra had scrambled to answer back to back phone calls while three different faxes had come in, requiring a rapid return fax with Gary's signature but it was next to impossible to even get away from the creaky, uncomfortable chair as the phone just continued to ring almost non-stop. She was currently trying to type up one of six different reports that had to be done on the practically ancient and VERY slow computer, and was desperately trying to figure out how to make the number-filled spreadsheet track itself with each completed order and delivery. To say nothing of the emails that were bombarding her inbox, many of which required in-depth responses concerning the delivery schedules of different routes, routing numbers, delivery confirmations and one that was still sitting there because Petra was too terrified by the over-flowing filing system that she knew she'd have to go digging through in order to answer. And all of that was to say NOTHING of the twin towers of paper that sat in the IN/OUT trays on the side of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary had been extremely little help, grunting acknowledgements and staring at Petra's rack while he scribbled his signature on various forms before shoving them back in her face. She knew that, while she played Frogger with the small army of brutish, uncultured warehouse workers and their forklifts, that he was watching her ass shake back and forth as she retreated back to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone had taken a bet on if Petra was minutes away from a nervous breakdown, they would have probably made a nice chunk of cash as the reluctant secretary sat at the small desk with her head in her hands, too overwhelmed to do anything stare at the new bevy of emails that had to be printed out and stuck in the mailbox wall. It wasn't even a simple mail slot system but something that looked like had been hacked together from a bunch of old bank teller drawers. Petra had to physically open the slot's lid, place the mail inside and then slide it over to the break room side where, supposedly, one of the warehouse workers would get the mail and slide it back to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that many of the mail drawers had stacks of paper sitting in them, some of them dating back years, it was clear that most of the warehouse workers had largely ignored the over-worked secretaries...of which there had been several just in the past six months. There were papers from Stacy, a Cindy, a Tiffany and at the very bottom of one of the stacks, a Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra as sure that her name would be entombed within those mail slots for the rest of time as well, and was really, really praying that this hadn't been some sort of trap by Leo to get his least effective girl out of his office, banishing her to this distant HELL for however long the game would run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra let loose a sniffle at the terrifying thought of this just being her life now. She wanted to go back to the office! She wanted to go home! She...This wasn't what she was supposed to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before any further existential terror could grip the thumping heart beneath her inflated breasts, a almost cartoonish whistle blew somewhere in the warehouse, and a collective cheer went up from the workers; it was noon. Lunchtime. Petra looked out the frosted glass of her office's warehouse exit door and watched as the workers scattered; some heading out the warehouse bay doors, but a far larger amount of them swarming into the break-room in a thankfully somewhat muted wave of raucous laughter and crude jokes...Largely at the expense of women much like Petra, and at least one that was built entirely around the previous secretary, Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra did, however, feel a slight pang of satisfaction as several mail slots noisily slid back to her side of the wall and were miraculously empty. Maybe...Maybe she was doing okay after all? The thought gave her hope that maybe she'd be able to last the remaining three hours. The phone mercifully went silent and Petra was unsure of what to do...She hadn't brought a lunch. She wasn't even sure if she HAD to eat. But then the rear door opened, and Gary's swarthy, smelly bulk heaved itself in, a frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I was told you were gonna fix Stacy's mess and help me look good for corporate, but you ain't done shit! Look at all those files that still need to cleared? I don't fuckin' care if it's Stacy's mess, YOU'RE the Sec' now, so that means YOU gotta deal with it! Right now I'm thinkin' maybe yer boss needs a call about your lack of work ethic. You want that?\" Gary growled, bathing Petra in a ocean of foetid air from whatever had died in the fat man's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I-I'm sorry! I'm doing my...I'm doing the best I can here!\" Petra cried out as tears (both from fear and from the AWFUL smell) filled her eyes, running hot down her sculpted cheeks. Oh great, now she was fucking crying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Now wait, just listen. I, uh, appreciate you comin' out here and helpin' out. I'll make you a deal; take a working lunch, try to get that fuckin' forest of inbox papers down...And I guess I won't throw you under th'bus.\" Gary said, rolling his eyes at the mewling woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh t-thank you s-sir!\" Petra bawled, again not entirely out of fear or gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, t'make sure yer working, I'm gonna have Reggie sit in here\" Gary turned back to the door and shouted \"HEY REG\" out into the warehouse, and a few moments later the LARGEST man Petra had ever seen appeared, ducking his head low just to enter into the office. The single strip of flouresecent lights shined off his dark skin, the muscles rippling beneath his exceedingly tight blue shirt. His eyes were dark, intense, and his almost perfect face and shaved head looked as if it had been masterfully carved out of the darkest ebony wood. His legs were practically bursting from his jeans and there was...something that was lurking in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra unknowingly gave her plump lips a small lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah boss?\" Reggie said, and his voice was smooth, rich, and so very deep. It rolled over Petra and pushed the cloud of stench away, and she quietly gasped at how...Perfect the male specimen in front of her looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...Petra, was it?\" Gary looked back at the stunned secretary, who slowly nodded, entranced by the new arrival, \"This is Petra. She took over for Stacy. That broad left a mess and Toots here is having trouble catching up, so I need you to help her the rest of the shift\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw boss c'mon. I got three guys out playing hooky and you expectin' me to BABYSIT? I mean, no offense ma'am, but the last time I had to babysit, that blonde girl nearly clawed my eyes out\" Reggie said, and even his 'whiny' voice was barely an octave higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doin' us a favor, Reg. I'll manage the warehouse if you manage her. Best case scenario we actually get back on schedule. Worse, she's out of here at 4 anyway and we're at least not as bad off as before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fine. Guess I'll do it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thatta'boy. Now since it IS lunch, I believe I'm going to go get something to eat. Remember what we talked about, Toots\" Gary said with a flabby smile, and unceremoniously removed himself from the office, leaving a stunned, small and well endowed woman staring at the dark Adonis...who was staring back at her with a interest he had not shown a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Reggie said, \"'Bout time they send us a real woman. I was gettin' pretty tired of all the prissy little Barbies. Damn, you're fine. What did you say your name was? Miss...Jones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra could only swallow heavily and nod dumbly. Why was it suddenly so...hot in here? She gave Reggie a smile and tried her best not to start giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Petra\"</span></div></div>",

While Eugene was just hypnotised by the sight, still enough of a man despite the body to enjoy the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, Leo's face lit up.

She launched into a tirade of abuse, and vile filthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an invisible bell chimed overhead. The other players watched, as Lindsay's body became even more curvaceous. Leo stood outraged, ready to deny her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the friends were watching as Lindsay's butt and bust took on extra ripeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/fb/d3/e5fbd3c00310710749d64d61e3700341.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/fb/d3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell chimed again, as she rounded his desk. She stood inches away, her chest rising and falling with each deep breath. She pushed him backwards. The chair taking his legs from him, he collapsed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay planted her hands into her back, kneading the tired muscles there. Tired from the eternal strain of carrying her now empathy inducing massive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/12/4c/21124ceba32521a4b032f86d11123965.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/12/4c/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo rose again, planting his feet further apart, so Lindsay's assault wasn't repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't, as she stepped even closer. A smile on her face, as her breath and his mingled, as if though readying herself  for a passionate kiss. The head butt that followed sent Leo back down. He bounced in the chair before it shot away and he landed in a wild flail of limbs on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell chimed again, and again, as Leo raised his hands to cover his nose. Blood leaking between his fingers, Lindsay advanced once more. As Leo scuttled blindly backwards a thrashing of wildly disjointed legs, and one arm. The arm switching between warding off Lindsay and helping him escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked genuine terrified, and Lindsay looked like she was having the time of her life. Engaged in a fantasy she'd only imagined before, but now she was loving the power trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell chimed rapidly three times in quick succession. Lindsay gaining her fullest curves. Part of the sight was enjoyable, as the secretaries watched through hands hiding their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/93/ef/2993ef486707b3fda28b285674d27f6c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/93/ef/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they took in Lindsay's finishing her lives, they watched with interest to see what'd happen next. Judy spared a sideways glance for Peter and Eugene, their gazes still fixated on the jiggle and bounce of Lindsay's curves. She snorted in amusement, at how simple to please men were... even when they had their own curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned her attention back to the main event. Leo was standing up, furiously jabbing his finger towards the office door. In a loud voice threatening her with a call to security or the police. But, Lindsay looked different, as if she were a blank slate. The passion of her assault extinguished, the unique fire in her eyes gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sobbed, and fled the office. She raced out to her friends, \"He... He sacked me...\" She blubbed, as if that weren't her whole goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was impressive!\" Petra gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene nodded, but Judy looked closer and kept her mouth closed. She detected an emptiness, this wasn't Lindsay now... She'd expended all her lives. Judy was horrified to see that Lindsay was gone now. Replaced with an NPC, doomed and destined to only fulfil scripts and repeat the same limited actions again and again as prompted. No volition, no life, no choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking free, Lindsay fled to the lifts as she abandoned her work.</span></div></div>",

It sounded rather like a thick iron girder being bent and sawed at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the noise stopped after fifteen seconds, a small hatch opening on the board with a toaster-oven \u2018<i>ding</i>\u2019! A small squad of multicolored plastic pieces were contained in the small alcove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group stood up from their comfy seats, each grabbing a piece to investigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I\u2019m guessing this is \u2018model\u2019,\u201d mused Lindsey, holding up a plastic pair of blue pants. \u201cI would have, like, used something other than pants to rep it, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, my friends always said I could be an actor,\u201d said Judy, trying to imitate the plastic comedy-mask\u2019s smile. \u201cI could be a punk Kat Dennings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI d-don\u2019t think \u2018Gamer\u2019 is really something that\u2019s in the public eye,\u201d murmured Eugene, looking down his nose at the purple game controller. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an e-sports piece?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter frowned at the top-hat and wand he was left holding. \u201cJude, there\u2019s no <i>way</i> you didn\u2019t actually jinx me.

Looks like there's an option for an 'outdoors' simulation or a 'music' simulation...And it looks like if I type the number 3 it'll list off even more stuff.\" Eugene neglected to mention the little voice in side his head telling him that maybe this 'U' person was still around, despite how old the game machine looked. Maybe there was some kind of wireless card inside? The game HAD said that it could be connected to a computer, maybe even the Internet in order to download new game types...But that notecard had been crisp and clearly new. It wasn't just a relic from the 80s or whenever, some programmer speaking to another in the days where instant communication was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly had a hard time remembering if he'd caught the girl's name that had been at the shop in the mall. Had it started with a 'U'? That didn't seem right...And Eugene kicked himself for being too enamored with the woman's good looks and charming personality as she had suckered him into buying the game...But the longer they messed with the machine, the more of a not-quite-right feeling was growing inside of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" Lindsey cooed, her blue eyes lighting up at the new modes, \"Music sounds REALLY fun! Maybe it's, like, karaoke or something! I totally did that at a Japanese bar when I went on my honors trip to Japan last year in high school. It was so much, like fun! And those Japanese guys get REALLY into it! But me an' Bethany TOTALLY won with our duet! I got a little trophy and everything up in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to Japan? On an honors trip?\" Peter said, coughing a bit as the sip from Judy's iced tea caught in his throat in surprise. This was quickly followed up by a soft elbow to the side from Judy, who was giving him a look. \"I mean, uh, that just sounds really, uh, expensive! Yeah, expensive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn't seem to mind, or perhaps notice, the gaff, \"Yeah! Like Honors Club wanted to do something different than just flying to DC, right? So we convinced the teachers to, like, let us fly to Japan! 'Course we all had to get jobs on top of doing all the fundraising since yeah it was, like, SUPER pricey! But SO totally worth it! Tokyo was a blast! We should totally go before we graduate! I know, like, all the best shops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was still blown away by the revelation, Peter especially. The learned jock had tried to steer away from 'labeling' others, given he worked hard to make people see him as something other than just a dumb jock on a scholarship run, but Lindsey either was putting on a enormous 'innocent dumb blonde' act or really was like the chick from the old Legally Blonde movie and just didn't realize how much like a bimbo she often sounded. Even if she did lack the normal 'bimbo curves' on her stickish frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music COULD be cool, I uh, usedtobeinachurchchoir\" Judy mumbled, and regretted saying anything to try to cover up her boyfriend's error. She saw Lindsey and Eugene turn to stare at her while PEter looked up at the ceiling as innocently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU went to church!? But like, all the gothy stuff!\" Lindsey said, pointing at Judy's heeled boots, fishnet stockings, black and purple skirt and the one size too small t-shirt that had a heart shaped skull on it, Judy's purple hair and the heavy eyeliner and black lipstick that adorned her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, uh, parents made me do it.\" Judy said quietly as she tried to disappear into the couch next to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so gothy! You're like, the most gothy chick I know!\" In reality Judy was the ONLY gothy chick Lindsey knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was the outdoors one like, Geno?\" Peter said, clearing his throat in an attempt to steer the conversation away from Judy's past, which he knew she hated talking about. He had been dating her for almost two years and he STILL barely knew anything about it and what he did know was only because of 'boyfriend confidentiality'. But he did know that it wasn't a happy place...And that Judy was a fantastic singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well...\" Eugene looked at the machine and the game box and then just shrugged, \"I guess just something to do outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds pretty nice. The air IS getting a little stuffy in here. I change my vote to Outdoors instead of music\" Judy said, running some fingers along the back of Peter's head in appreciation for the topic change. Despite the fact he could sometimes be a bit of a whiny accidental jerk, she was glad that he had a good heart and had looked out for her. MAybe later she could show him just how much she appreciated him, after they got done playing with 'the kids'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! But...\" Lindsey pouted, burrowing into her bean-bag in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys I...I'm not sure if\" Eugene couldn't put off the creepy feeling he was getting from the dome-like machine buzzing on the table in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow, Genie!\" Lindsey suddenly chirpped, pulling herself out of the beanbag and sliding the game's keyboard away from the startled geek.

The younger girl was sometimes a little TOO impulsive, and it had put a strain on their friendship more than once. This was appearing to be one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow too slow, let's just play a game!\" Lindsey's eyes twinkled with mischievous energy as her fingers dancing across the keyboard with far less caution than Eugene's hen-pecking style had been. Typing was just natural to her, more so than it was to the other students that had grown up with computers. You kinda, like, had to be when you worked with programming code and may or may not have hacked into a college database to change a friend's grades from across country...Or into North Point's own servers to make sure that she personally wasn't forced to go back home and deal with her own drama. The less said about that jerk the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey hadn't missed Judy's sudden regret at mentioning her past, and while Lindsey really, really REALLY felt like having a fun karaoke night she decided to err on the side of caution and instead type in 'OUTDOORS' into the machine. She pressed enter and the game made a fax machine sound accompanied by grinding metal...And Lindsey was suddenly afraid that she may have broken her geeky friend's toy...But then the machine returned to it's normal soft buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUTDOORS SELECTED. PLEASE SELECT AVATARS AND CHOOSE GAME MODE\" The machine said, two black buttons that had 'Traditional' and 'SImmersive' stenciled onto them. A tray popped out from the side of the machine filled with tiny game pieces made up of all kinds of different outdoor-related objects, but four were held above the rest on small racks: A cowboy hat, a rifle, an axe, and a rather rugged looking backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lindsey?\" Judy looked at the clearly more than she seemed ditzy blonde, who gave her a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're SO right, the air is getting pretty stale in here. Besides, maybe it'll, like, put us on teams! Lindsey got up and practically jumped onto Eugene's lap, whose face immediately turned a deep shade of red as she draped her skinny arms around his neck. \"I call Eugene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ooh, u-uh\" The geek stammered as he tried to to will his penis from growing erect as he looked away. He tried to think of something, like a rock or...Well, anything other than his giggling crush that was draped across him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we wanna, like, do this Traditional thingy? Or try Immersive? I'm a real good DnD player, you know...\" Lindsey cooed, enjoying how uncomfortable she was making Eugene feel. It was a guilty pleasure of hers, she LIKED teasing boys, especially ones that didn't know how to tease back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Peter and Judy just shared a surprised look at each other. Judy had been trying to get the two together since the beginning of the semester last fall but Lindsey had seemed uninterested in being anything but friends with the fat little dork, and Peter had been trying to push Eugene to open up more and stop being such a, well, stereotype. This seemed to be jumping several steps in their 'plan' of getting the two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if no one is gonna say anything...\" Lindsey said, her voice an innocent singsong that was betrayed by the twinkle in her blue eyes. She stretched out like a cat and dug her hand into the small tray, plastic rattling as her hand dug around before she mad a fist and withdrew, sliding the try back into the game before pressing...</span></div></div>",

It was better if it was random. It was more fun when you couldn't plan out your encounters. That's why during the fateful DnD game she'd ignored the min-maxed Elf spell-caster and had closed her eyes and landed on the tiny Gnome rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was also the game that led to her being banned from the campus DnD circles simply because she'd shown up all those nerds that had been too busy trying to flirt with her, or gatekeep her or talk down to her simply because she was a rare female that was deep in what was still, even in this day and age, considered 'man territory', though really could those boys really be considered men? She'd been the closest some would ever get to a woman, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Judy and her sweet Eugene, the one little nerd that was actually TRYING to do more than just get in her pants, all snatched at the primary colored plastic and stared at them, and then her, as the blonde reached over and pressed 'ENTER'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop!\" She sang out, but then went limp in Eugene's arms as the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what...What happened?

Or maybe they were, but it definitely wasn't Gunner's Butte. And they definitely were NOT in a dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA golden plain stretched out before her, with snow-capped mountains in the near-distance. A pleasant, warm breeze washed over her, and the sound of birdsong and insects filled the world around her. Near the mountains, a wall of tall, deeply green trees rose out of the plains, and she could smell water. The sky was a brilliant blue, with only a few white clouds lazily drifted past as the sun shone down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree other voices groaned around her, and Lindsey blinked in surprise as three strangers pulled themselves out of the grass around her.

Her full, ruby-red lips were open, pearly teeth catching the sun as she slowly, cautiously gazed at her slender, toned arms and the tiny hands that topped them before slowly reaching for her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/STvuUPc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/STvuUPc.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the final stranger's was currently frantically checking herself over, long black hair flying every which way as a pair of thick glasses threatened to fly from her Asian face, and a rugged looking backpack rustled in it's position on her, well, back. Her body was tall and slim, her breasts poking through the camoflauge jacket she wore as her large lips parted as she began screaming in a language that Lindsey was, surprisingly, familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vZ824Yx.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/vZ824Yx.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm a chick! Holy shit!\" She swore as she spun around, the camera hanging off her neck swinging back and forth and whacking her painfully in the chest. But where Lindsey understood the language, the other two strangers only heard a high pitched '\u00d3, ti\u0101n n\u01ce, w\u01d2 sh\u00ec xi\u01ceo j\u012b! Ti\u0101n n\u01ce!', causing them to look over at the girl...And then at Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" The cowgirl swore, the profanity sounding alien coming out of her innocent looking mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Is that a fucking rifle!?\" The Lumberjack said, eyes bulging out of his head, a hand shooting out towards Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? The blonde said, and coughed at how...hoarse her voice sounded. She looked down to inspect herself, and instead of finding her small B-cups poking through a white and green 'Northpoint University' t-shirt, instead she was met with a flat chest that was covered in a blue overshirt, which itself was covered by a heavy coat. Gloves covered her hands that definitly no longer felt like they had nails and her lounge shorts had been replaced by a pair of jeans that had seen better days, and heavy boots. And in her larger hands sat a gun. She hadn't even noticed the weight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/uV7POch.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/uV7POch.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Lindsey screamed, the gun flopping from her hands and clattering to the grassy ground without incident as she inspected herself. She was a man! An adult man! She pulled off her gloves and started at leathery, worn looking hands that were criss-crossed with wrinkles and scar lines, and she reached up to feel her face. A mannish chin, a larger, blunter nose that felt slightly crooked and...Was that stubble!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHMUHGAWD!\" She screamed again into the open air as the Lumberjack, cowgirl and Asian scientist all looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUYS!?\" They all said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rather long moment of confusion, they had finally established each other's identities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was the rancher girl, the last thing he felt before passing out being Lindsey in his arms. Judy was the lumberjack, and just as freaked out about being a guy as Lindsey was (if not a little more so). And that just left Peter, who was stranded in the body of a scientist, probably a biologist, and left being fluent in Chinese, and clearly only knew English as a second language. And that left Lindsey as the man with the rifle, the vegan was now most likely a hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm old enough to be my grandpa!\" Lindsey whispered as she continued to stare at her leathery hands. Next to her, in his barely any older body, Eugene was trying to logic his way towards a reasonable scientific answer for why they'd all been transported away from the college and so radically transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you say the...game did this thing?\" Peter said slowly, stumbling over his heavily accented English. It was clear that the newly minted girl could speak English, but clearly as a second language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was the last thing we all remember, right? Lindsey tossed the avatars to us at random and hit the start button, right?\" Eugene said, splaying his soft-looking hands wide. The geek was struggling to not be constantly distracted by the huge mammaries hanging from his torso, or the twangy, soprano voice he now possessed. But it was important for them to get a handle on the situation. A moment passed before Judy, still pacing about and feeling up her body with a uncomfortable look on her face, let out a cry that was somewhere between a scream of rage and a frightened sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking bitch! This is your fault!\" Judy hissed, and after a moment where her new muscles flexed and bulged in this minimal confines...just sat down on the grass and curled up into a ball with a whimper. Peter moved over to comfort his girlfriend, despite being half her new size. After several failed attempts to wrap his new, smaller arms around Judy's bulk, he grunted in annoyance and settled for giving the sullen goth a reverse hug, leaning on Ludy's back and draping his skinny arms around her that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be guy!\" Judy pouted, reaching up and grabbing hold of one of Peter's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Hey. M\u00e9igu\u0101nx\u00ec. W\u01d2 m\u00edngb\u00e1i n\u01d0 de y\u00ecsile b\u01ceob\u00e8i\" Peter said, accidentally lapsing into what was apparently his new native language. The gender-bent boyfriend and girlfriend shared a look of confusion before both of them glared at Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I...You were all getting bummed out about the music so I thought if we just, if we just DID something, it would make things better! How was I supposed to know that Eugene's game did any of this!\" Lindsey rasped, her voice was deeper now, but not as deep as the lumberjack's, and definitely tinted with age, \"I'm an old dude! Do you think I wanted any of this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, guys! I mean girls! Listen we all remember passing out, right? So unless this is some new remote learning thing the college is doing, which I doubt, then the most logical answer is that we're playing as our avatars. All we....All we have to do is beat the game to change back, right? We find wherever the 'end' of the game is and shout Morphmanji, and then we go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gust of wind and the sound of clapping behind them, and the group turned to face the sound, letting out a collective gasp of surprise as they saw an attractive young woman with flowing brown hair and piercing eyes, complete with a tan blouse, cowboy hat and curve-hugging pants standing next to four horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ckOC4PP.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/ckOC4PP.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very good Eugene! I was afraid I was going to have to explain everything myself!\" The woman said with a grin, patting the horse closest to her, \"But very good, you missed the finer details but that shouldn't take too long to cover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey, wait, you're...You're the girl from the store!\" Eugene gasped, his chest heaving in surprise. There was a rumble of anger among the group, most noticeably from Judy and Peter, but the girl took on a serious look and waved her hand before the couple could do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to do this again, okay? Listen, I'm here to help, really! But I can't just whisk you out of the game. You started it, so you have to finish it. Unless you want to be stuck looking like you are now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What do you mean?\" Lindsey looked down at her gnarled, hairy hands and then over at Eugene, whose eyes flicked between his attractive female form and Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't pull the 'dumb blonde' act on me, girly. You know exactly what I mean. Quitting the game without finishing means you get stuck in your current bodies for the rest of your lives, which will also change. You won't be Perky Girl Friday anymore, you'll be a rugged old man living in a cabin in the woods. Same goes for Blondie, Paul Bunyan and Mulan. And pretty sure no one wants to end up in China right now\" The woman said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group shared another worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. It starts off easy. Get on these horses, they will take you to your starting locations. You'll be given tasks to complete. think of it as a tutorial. After that, you'll be given a broader goal fitting for your avatars, and you'll be able to go wherever you want. Finish all the goals, yell Morphmanji, and boom you're all back in your dorm. Pretty simple. And no, don't ask me about refusing. I just told you want would happen. Play the game or pay the price\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...Who are you!?\" Eugene askd quietly, and the woman just gave him a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now...Just call me the 'Spirit of the West', sweetheart. But can you guys make a decision? Otherwise the game might just...Get antsy and start doing stuff to make you start playing. Or it might just kick you out as is. Either way, timetable, yadda yadda\" The girl made a 'get a move on' motion with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked each other again, and after a moment of quiet discussion (given Judy and Peter were still frozen), Eugene and Lindsey decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A-alright, I think we should try the...Wait\" Eugene was about to make his selection with the machine buzzed softly and more choices began scrolling across the primitive screen in a very 'But wait, there's more!' feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Geno?\" Peter asked from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, giving us more options to choose from. Looks like there's an option for an 'outdoors' simulation or a 'music' simulation...And it looks like if I type the number 3 it'll list off even more stuff.\" Eugene neglected to mention the little voice in side his head telling him that maybe this 'U' person was still around, despite how old the game machine looked. Maybe there was some kind of wireless card inside? The game HAD said that it could be connected to a computer, maybe even the Internet in order to download new game types...But that notecard had been crisp and clearly new. It wasn't just a relic from the 80s or whenever, some programmer speaking to another in the days where instant communication was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly had a hard time remembering if he'd caught the girl's name that had been at the shop in the mall. Had it started with a 'U'? That didn't seem right...But the longer they messed with the machine, the more of a not-quite-right feeling was growing inside of Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" Lindsey cooed, her blue eyes lighting up at the new modes, \"Music sounds REALLY fun! Maybe it's, like, karaoke or something! I totally did that at a Japanese bar when I went on my honors trip to Japan last year in high school. It was so much, like fun! And those Japanese guys get REALLY into it! But me an' Bethany TOTALLY won with our duet! I got a little trophy and everything up in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to Japan? On an honors trip?\" Peter said, coughing a bit as the sip from Judy's iced tea caught in his throat in surprise. This was quickly followed up by a soft elbow to the side from Judy, who was giving him a look. \"I mean, uh, that just sounds really, uh, expensive! Yeah, expensive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn't seem to mind, or perhaps notice, the gaff, \"Yeah! Like Honors Club wanted to do something different than just flying to DC, right? So we convinced the teachers to, like, let us fly to Japan! 'Course we all had to get jobs on top of doing all the fundraising since yeah it was, like, SUPER pricey! But SO totally worth it! Tokyo was a blast! We should totally go before we graduate! I know, like, all the best shops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was still blown away by the revelation, Peter especially. The learned jock had tried to steer away from 'labeling' others, given he worked hard to make people see him as something other than just a dumb jock on a scholarship run, but Lindsey either was putting on a enormous 'innocent dumb blonde' act or really was like the chick from the old Legally Blonde movie and just didn't realize how much like a bimbo she often sounded. Even if she did lack the normal 'bimbo curves' on her stickish frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music COULD be cool, I used to sing back chur-uh, back in high school\" Judy offered, partially regretting the potential questioning into her past and the bad memories it would dredge up...But on the other hand, a karaoke night just between the four of them could be a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oh, yeah! I would LOVE to hear you sing, Judy!\" Lindsey squealed in delight, \"Oh, maybe WE could do a duet! Like OMG, this is gonna be SO much fun!\" The chipper and seemingly always perky blonde jumped to her feet and was practically bouncing around the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Judy DOES have great, uh, pipes. She's ALL the time singing those high notes after playing my...organ\" Peter chuckled, and received a soft ribbing in reply from his top-heavy girlfriend for the innuendo. In truth Judy really was a fantastic singer, though he knew that she actually used to be in a church choir instead of singing in high school. Judy never spoke of her childhood much, but being the boyfriend, Peter was somewhat more privvy to her backstory than the two Freshmen students were. She didn't like talking about it, and every time she, Judy usually ended up a tear-stained anxiety ridden mess and he'd spend the rest of the evening comforting her or she'd just storm off back to her room...Or ask him to leave to go back to his. But she seemed in good spirits about this, so in true supporting boyfriend form, he was backing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three against one Genie!\" Lindsey said making an energetic half-circle around Eugene's chair and ruffling his short brown locks, causing him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Uh, yeah. Music s-sounds cool. Just, uh, d-don't make fun of me okay? I'm not really that good of a singer\" He mumbled as he tried not to be overwhelmed by the perky blonde who was now setting her entire grinning head on his knee. He was also desperately trying to ignore the growing stiffness in his pants. That's ruin the mood entirely if a boner flopped up and poked Lindsey in the eye. He was lucky enough the rainbow haired girl was talking to him at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! And don't worry Genie, I've, like, heard way worse. Like Billie Eillish? Ugh, PUKE!\" The girl made a gagging motion with her mouth as she pushed away from the geek's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, karaoke night it is! Get us started Geno!\" Peter leaned farther back on the couch and felt Judy snuggle in closer next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight freshman nodded and typed in the information onto the keyboard and pressed enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUSIC SIMULATION SELECTED. PLEASE INPUT GAME MODE\" The game called out, and two large black buttons with the words 'Traditional' and 'Immersive' on them popped out of the top of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I wonder what that does!\" Lindsey crowded in on the device, her blue eyes wide with curiosity as she stared at the chipped white stenciling on the 'Immersive' button. She really wanted to push it...But all four of them were playing together, it would be, like, rude of her to just pick what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of discussion, the four friends decided on playing the game in...</span></div></div>",

I'm really not in the mood for having to learn something new right now\" Judy said, cuddling in close to Peter and getting cozy under his large, muscled arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who even knows what it would be like anyway. How would you get 'Immersive' with like, a karaoke machine anyway?\" Lindsey nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two males were either too busy getting cozy with/ogling their crushes to really do anything by mutter in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okies!\" Lindsey bent over in front of Eugene and pressed the large black button that had 'Traditional' stenciled on it, pushing it back down into the machine which began whirring and clacking. Lindsey leaned back and without warning began lowering herself down towards Eugene's chair, and the overweight nerd as forced to sit up straighter and scooted back as the skinny blonde's small booty plopping down between his legs. Then the blonde LEANED back and rested up against Eugene's flab, and the geek was reduced to a reddening mess that was desperately trying not to pop a boner into Lindsey's back. The rainbow-blonde pushed herself further onto Eugene as she stared innocently at the machine as it processed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if we'll need, like, microphones or something though? I've, umm, got a couple of headset up in my room...\" She wondered out loud, scooting back just a hair more and trying not to break character as she felt her toy tense up even more from the slightest touch. But then the machine chittered to itself for a moment before there was a loud SPROING and four small cylinders rose slowly from the game's plastic surface, each with a small, grid lined globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this thing had microphones built into it!\" Peter exclaimed in amazement, \"Geno, this thing is so cool. I wonder what else it can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, but right now...\" Lindsey popped up from her seat and Eugene visibly, if silently, relaxed as she collected the four audio input devices. She turned and handed one to Eugene, giving his tomato-red face a playful wink before bouncing around the coffee table and handing two more to Peter and Judy...Who fixed her friend with a knowing look, and receiving a quick stuck out tongue in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I think we're ready? I wonder what do we do now?\" Peter said, and in return the game buzzed once more, a tiny screen near the middle of the machine blinking 'TV INPUT REQUIRED'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...\" Lindsey looked at the currently off TV that hung on the dorm wall. The students hadn't turned it on in the weeks since the Pandemic hit, mainly because all it played were the local news station, the college news station, and CNN. With a shrug, shepicked up the machine, letting out a quiet 'oof' at the deceptively heavy chunk of plastic and moved it over to the inactive television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do Eugene, do you, um, have any adapter cables? I think we need to run some AV cable through a co-ax and then use my HDMI adapter to fit it into the back here\" Lindsey said, setting the game machine down on the shelf that sat under the TV and was filled with such educational VHS titles as 'The Economic Process of the Soviet Union circa 1974' and a well used DVD of 'Shrek 2' that clearly hadn't been moved for at least four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I mean...\" Eugene blinked dumbly at Lindsey's question. What was a co-ax cable? And then even MADE adapters for the old red/yellow/white cables? But he didn't want to look stupid and was about to answer when the TV flickered on by itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!\" Lindsey cried, taking a step back from the machine in caution while similar noises came from her three friends. After a moment of flickering, a pixelated logo appeared on the flatscreen, a twisting map of pathways the curved in and around each other before terminating into a empty circle in the middle, within which were the words 'Morphmanji Entertainment System'. The TV speakers spat out a short, very chip-tune-esque fanfare before two more buttons popped up on the machine's surface, and Lindsey could have sworn she hadn't seen any openings or any grooves in the plastic that may have appeared to be an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn them were the word \"Head to Head\" and \"Team Game\". The blonde relayed this information to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of wanted a team game...\" Judy said, curling a finger around Peter's ripped abs, staring up at him dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, maybe since you and Eugene can't, like, sing, maybe we should do, like, Head to Head so me and Judy get to play against each other?\" Lindsey said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Petey, but I've heard you sing in the shower, you're no Whitney Houston\" Lindsey stuck her tongue out again, and Peter just shared a look with Judy and Eugene. Judy scrunched her face into a dramatic scowl for a moment, before giving Peter a nod and a shrug, breaking out into a smirk. Eugene simply looked away, not wanting to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'M a good singer\" Peter pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE GAME TYPE\" A accented female voice said from the TV speakers, and after a moment, the group chose...</span></div></div>",

Sound fair?\" Judy offered, getting a disappointed sad puppy look from Lindsey before she went perky again with a nod. Peter and Eugene, the jock knowing that it was decided the men had long since been locked out of the decision making process, just nodded, giving Eugene a look that quietly meant 'Just shut up and nod, dork'. The flabby brown haired boy blinked for a moment before catching on, nodding vigorously as Lindsey looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okies, team game it is!\" Lindsey bent over and tapped the large black button, causing the TV screen to flicker as the game's female voice spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEAM GAME SELECTED. SELECT TEAM ON MIC. TWO TEAMS OF TWO REQUIRED FOR PLAY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet looked at their microphones and saw a tiny horizontal toggle near the base of the microphone's head, and a tiny button on the underside of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These buttons must be what we confirm with?\" Lindsey said, eyeing the firm dark plastic, trying to figure out how it all worked. There was NO way that this was a mass produced game, this had to be someone's personal invention or something, the technology of the 80s (which was when the game had collectively assumed the contraption had been built) wasn't refined enough to fit into such small spaces. And then the mysterious power source it had...And how it somehow interfaced with a modern television without any form of input. All of this had to be custom made...And that just made her engineer senses tingle even more. If the machine ever broke...Lindsey had to make Eugene promise her that she got first dibs on taking it apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just be Team 2\" Judy said, flicking the toggle on her mic and Peter's over to the miniature number 2 that was on the far side of the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that means we're number one, Genie!\" Lindsey said, turning off her intellectual musings again and bounced back over to the lounge chair her friend had taken up residence in, and the two geeks enjoyed a moment of playful bonding by counting down from 3 and flipping the switches on the mics in unison, Eugene quietly thankful the peppy, flirty blonde had chosen to set on the floor instead of practically in his lap again. He wasn't sure if he could have held off another boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEAMS SELECTED. LOADING TEAM NAMES. SELECT TEAM NAME BY PRESSING INPUT BUTTON ON MIC. PRESS TWICE TO CONFIRM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this is a LOT of sitting around and talking for a game that is supposed to be relieving boredom\" Peter said dryly, getting a look from his girlfriend, \"What? I'm just saying we could have already gotten a pizza or something in the time it's taken us to play\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush\" Judy said with a poke to her jock's stomach, who feigned being stabbed. After a few more moments, a list of team names flashed on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Eugene said, peering at list, \"A lot of these seem, uh, region themed? I wonder if they determine the kinds of songs we sing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, the game can't be THAT advanced, Eugene\" Judy said, sitting up from her nook in Peter's arms, \"I bet it's just so we don't have to type in our own to keep score\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Eugene shrugged after a moment of thought. He looked at Lindsey, and for a moment he thought he saw something else behind those normally bright blue eyes, something that momentarily betrayed her typical flightiness...But then it was gone, and her eyes glittered with the playful mischief that he'd been stuck by the moment the nerd had first met her. She gave the button on her mic a click and the selection bar moved down to the first two team names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you guys want to be? Looks like we, um, gotta pick together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short discussion and scrolling through the list of names, the friends settled on...</span></div></div>",

It's, um, kinda K-Pop sounding\" Lindsey said, tilting her head in thought as she stared at the name, \"Um, kinda looks a bit like L337-speak...Hmm\" She pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is L337-speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's like gamer-speak. No one really uses it anymore except to be obnoxious. Was sort of a 'early Internet' thing. Hackers used it a lot before it went mainstream and then people just used it to seem like they were smarter than they really were. You just take numbers that look like letters and stick 'em into words. You can have a lot of fun trolling people who don't know it\" Lindsey said absent-mindedly. And then realized she was being stared at for her burst of knowledge and let loose a giggle, \"But, ummm, I only know about 'cuz some of my older gamer friends talk about it on Discord. What's it say Eugene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Uh, right...Well, looks to me like someone was trying to spell...\" Eugene furrowed his brow in concentration as he tried to remember his L337, \"I think it's supposed to say 'Jewels'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, what kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene just gave Lindsey a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. At least the BEST team got the COOLEST name!\" Peter said enthusiatically. He really did like the name, it was just the right level of ridiculous and heavily reminded him of one of one of the first movies he'd ever seen: This is Spinal Tap. He kind of felt like he should make a t-shirt the next chance he got into town, over at the 'hippy' shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, however, was less than impressed with the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megatorch\" She sad flatly, crossing her arms under her large breasts and giving Peter a 'really?' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no babe, you gotta get into it. MEGATORCH!\" Peter yelled, and distortion crackled through the TV speakers as the group grabbed their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, ow?\" Lindsey said, giving Peter a look of her own, to which he simply grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! So I wonder what kind of songs we're going to get? This thing is from the 80s right? So...Are we looking at Classic Rock or bad pop music or something?\" The muscled athlete scratched his chin with the back end of the microphone as he started at the retro-styled screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't let it be 'classic' Country music. The only half-way acceptable stuff is the 90s Garth Brooks stuff\" Judy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we won't know until we start playing so...\" Eugene gave Lindsey a soft nudge with the end of his microphone, and his perky team-mate pretended to explode (with a giggle) before clicking the button on the bottom of her mic twice. The two band names turned opposing colors; J3/3LZ in blue and MEGATORCH in a fitting red as the machine beeped...and blue light began glowing from the inside of Eugene and Lindsey's microphones as a red light burned to life inside of Peter and Judy's. The four students looked at their microphones and then back at the TV as the game began to speak and text began to scroll by on the TV screen itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<div align=\"left\">TEAM NAMES CHOSEN. WELCOME TO MORPHMANJI MUSIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GAIN 190,084 POINTS ACROSS FIVE ROUNDS OF SONGS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nROUNDS CONSIST OF THREE SONGS FOR EACH TEAM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAT THE END OF EACH ROUND BOTH TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN A BATTLE OF THE BANDS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOINTS ARE AWARDED FOR EACH SONG COMPLETED.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPOINTS ARE SUBTRACTED FROM EACH TEAM APPEARANCE FOR MISTAKES. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERFORMANCE COUNTS TOWARDS POINT TOTALS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTEAMS THAT WIN EACH ROUND CAN CHANGE THEIR NAMES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTEAMS THAT LOSE MUST STAY REMAIN WITH THE SAME NAME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAT THE END OF THE GAME.THE BAND WITH THE MOST POINTS AND BATTLE OF THE BANDS VICTORIES WILL BE DECLARED THE VICTOR AND GIVEN A COPY OF THEIR PERFORMANCE VIA LASER DISC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLOSING BANDS WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE GARAGE TO TRY AGAIN. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK TWICE TO CONTINUE\"</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game spoke the words as they appeared on the screen in a very 'active typing' sort of way, as if someone was communicating to them in real time rather than a programmed message, but the four friends didn't seem to notice the slight delay between each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems simple enough. Actually seems a lot like that old game...Guitar Hero? Or Rock Band? But I wonder what it meant by 'Losers have points subtracted from appearance?\" Eugene had only played those old games once or twice on a friend's old PS2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or umm, Dance Dance Revolution? Ooh, I wonder if the game has that? That one is SUPER fun with the right partner\" Lindsey said, curling an arm around Eugene's leg and the geek tried not to gulp too loudly with nervousness, his own question forgotten as she leaned against his ambulatory limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'e never played either of those. But what does it mean 'Losers get sent back to the garage'?\" Judy wondered, staring at the words on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just there for flavor, Jude. You know, 'all bands start out in their garage', probably just means the band that loses the game\" Peter said with an unconcerned yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shrugged. The logic made sense, she'd seen plenty of cover bands in basements and in garages in the past couple of years, so it clearly just had to be whoever programmed the game being clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys?\" Eugene asked as he read over the directions one more time, \"What do you think it means by \"Losing team gets points subtracted from their appearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey had already clicked her button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME STARTED. SELECTING STARTING TEAM\" The game announced, and a white box began flashing between the two team names on the TV, moving in random order as the game began to count down from five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Lindsey giggled in excitement as the timer clicked down to zero, the box stopping on...</span></div></div>",

It'll be totally fun! I promise!\" Lindsey said with a mock pout before snapping back into her unusually peppy smile, \"Ooh, I wonder what song we're gonna be singing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the team selection screen blinked away and brought up a lrather huge list of songs, most of which Eugene OR Lindsey recognized. In fact, Eugene couldn't even read half the names, though Lindsey blinked as her brain kicked a handful of neurons she hand't used in about a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SELECT SONG BY PRESSING INPUT BUTTON ON MICROPHONE. PRESS TWICE TO SELECT\" The game's voice buzzed monotonously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, these are all K-Pop songs!\" She said in awe. The rainblonde had expected the game to be pre-loaded with a bunch of songs from the 70s and 80s, but like everything else concerning the strange R2-D2-esque little cylinder, it clearly was not limited by it's outward appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shit\" Eugene groaned, \"So much for an early lead\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Pop?\" Judy asked from her seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Korean Pop? You know, like uh...\" Lindsey furrowed her brow as she struggled to come up with an example the the surprisingly sheltered goth and the typically clueless jock would know, \"...Did you guys ever listen to Gangnam Style?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one that had the dance that Obama did, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I totally forgot about that! Yeah! That's the one! IT has BILLIONS of views on YouTube! It's actually really silly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all the participants in the common room had been little more than children and pre-teens when the song had originally released, but with as Internet culture savvy as Eugene and Lindsey were, they had latched onto it almost ten years later, such was the power of the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so are we just NOT going to acknowledge the fact that Lindsey can READ Korean?\" Peter said incredulously next to Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I, like, learned it for my Japan trip! It's actually not that all dis-similar from Japanese and Chinese, really. Lots of weird Ps and Ys though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Lindsey gave the jock a wink and a giggle before turning away. Most K-Pop songs would be little more than catchy gibberish. She'd be able to muddle through but poor Eugene... In fact she made a point to scroll until the sorority girl had spotted a couple that Eugene MIGHT have known. One especially, given he was a gamer like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is POP/STARS on here? In fact, didn't K-Pop come out in like, the late 90s? What is it even doing on here?\" Eugene said, the feeling of unease returning. There was something definitely wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Gene, I don't really care. I just wanna play! So It's either PSY or K/DA. I kinda think we should pick K/DA because it has some English for you\" Lindsey said with a nod towards the screen. After a moment of intense thought, Eugene just sighed and nodded, Lindsey giving him a cute little 'yay!' in return, causing him to blush. Lindsey selected the song and double-clicked to select. There was a loud CLICK from the machine and the screen flickered again, this time to another countdown screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SONG SELECTED. TEAM PLAYERS CHOOSE SINGING ORDER NOW BY PRESSING ONCE AND TWICE ON MICROPHONES\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Genie, you take Evelynn's parts, I'll just do the rest. Hopefully\" Lindsey said as she readied herself. She should have done some warm-up bars first but...Meh, really. She double pressed her mic, making her singer two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best, Lindz\" Was all Eugene could say as he pressed the microphones button once as desperately tried to not think about how much of a fool he was about to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer clicked down to zero and the screen flashed to the official music video, with the music blaring from...the TV? It was crystal clear however, and the text began appearing on the screen rapidly. Eugene's mic began blinking as the song began in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8q...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who it is, coming 'round again<br>\r\nYou want a dose of this right now<br>\r\nIt's KDA, uh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's voice was horribly off-key, and Lindsey tried not to wince, unlike Peter, and she could see a pained look on Judy's face as well. But then the lyrics switched and the girl stepped up as her mic began blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a goddess with a blade<br>\r\n\uc18c\ub9ac\uccd0\ubd10 \ub0b4 \uc774\ub984 \uc78a\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c loud, loud, loud, loud<br>\r\nI could take it to the top \uc808\ub300 \uba48\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574<br>\r\n\ub0b4\uac00 \ub05d\ub0b4\uc8fc\ub294 bad gal, gal, gal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's voice was high and melodious, almost too high for the almost grungy nature of her portion of the song, but she only mangled the pronunciation of one of the Korean words once. Otherwise she was surprisingly good, so much so that Judy gave Peter a wide-eyed stare. She had been expecting good...But not THAT good. Why was Lindsey even bothering with all the technical nerd fields?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the song went on, with Eugene doing his best to stay on key while Lindsey almost effortlessly breezed through the intense Akali rap section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter just blinked, dumbfounded. 'Who is this girl!?' He thought to himself as the anything BUT stereotypical blonde even began to mimic the dance moves with some skill, while Eugene just clomped around like a turtle beside her. Near the end, Lindsey went off the RAILS mimicking the background singer's voice, not reaching the same high notes but getting damn close. The song came to a close, and Judy, Peter and Eugene all turned and clapped for their friend, who was more than what she appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! That was awesome Lindsey!\" Peter said as he picked his jaw up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Go girl!\" Judy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was, uh, really epi, Lindsey. Sorry I, uh, sucked\" Eugene said, the blush on his face having only gotten deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it was nothing! You were really good Eugene, you kept on the beat even if you couldn't really do the dance at the end. Woo! This is fun though! I haven't sang like that in a while!\" Lindsey was close to bouncing off the walls with excitement. That had been GREAT. But she had to play it cool. \"Oh look, it's giving us out score!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flurry of randomized numbers and a letter score rolled across the skin, coming up with...</span></div></div>",

Quickly, she pulled the cute dork into a side-hug, bright smile on her face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout it, Genie, it\u2019s one of those Morton\u2019s Fork thingies! Either you mess it up a \u2018lil, cuz you\u2019re, like, a <b>guy</b> n\u2019 all, or you do it perfectly, but give up that <i>super</i>-nice baritone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainbowette let out a cheerful titter and circled a finger on the back of the nerd\u2019s neck as the nerd himself hunched his shoulders and blushed even <i>harder</i>, a shaky smile on his face. Judy and Peter elbowed each other conspiratorially, small smiles on their face. These were good team-choices \u2014 mostly for their real-life shipping desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scores meanwhile, had <i>bloop</i>-ed itself upon the screen, Player One\u2019s score lined with a pleasing repetition of the alphabet\u2019s first vowel, the only exception a B+ for Appearance \u2014 \u201cGuess you can\u2019t fake the K-Pop look!\u201d Lindsey giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer Two had a much less impressive record. D-\u2019s abounded for the guilty geek, with Appearance a dismal F. Eugene sagged remorsefully, and Lindsey attempted to comfort him with another side-hug \u2014 teasing the cutie-pie with a full-on fronthug seemed a bit rude right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final score: a C displayed itself proudly on the screen, and Eugene\u2019s face loss a degree of guilt. \u201cThat\u2019s, uh, not as bad as I thought it would be\u2026\u201d he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d cheered Lindsey, slapping the geek playfully. \u201cWe can, like, pick a BTZ song or whatever next \u2014 something guy-y to let you really <i>shine</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shifted in her chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t see many boy-groups there,\u201d Peter cast an aspersive eyebrow at his girlfriend. \u201cYou know Alison \u2014 she\u2019s 'stans Kpop\u2019 or whatever they call it. It's all she talks about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pouted. \u201cOh. That sucks.\u201d Brightly, she skipped towards the dorm\u2019s halls, towards the communal kitchen. \u201cNeed some water!\u201d was the explanation shot behind her as her rainbow mane disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence hung in the room as the words \u2018TALLYING MISTAKES\u2019 blipped across the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter coughed. \u201cYou know, Gene, you don\u2019t hafta be all torn up about this \u2014 it\u2019s Karaoke, it\u2019s supposed to be <i>fun</i>, so you should reall\u2014 <b>OOF</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Mr. Insensitiv-o was <i>trying</i> to say, Eugie,\u201d started Judy with a smile, removing her elbow from her boyfriend\u2019s gut, \u201cis that you don\u2019t need to worry about \u2018being an anchor\u2019 or whatever. It\u2019s your game, Lindsey\u2019s having fun, and, more importantly, she\u2019s having fun with <i>you</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><i><b>MEGATORCH</b></i></span>,\u201d Peter cut in, accentuating his \u2018band\u2019s\u2019 title with a metal-esque growl, \u201c,is gonna kick your guys\u2019 ass, so don\u2019t stress about futzing it all up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene gave the mismatched couple a smile. It was a good thing that he hadn\u2019t judged this duo of books by their respective covers \u2014 and maybe he did have a shot with Li\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny musings of emotional honesty were interrupted by a red glare on the screen, the intimidating words \u2018PENALTY CALCULATED\u2019 underscored by \u2018SELECT PLAYER TO RECIEVE APPEARANCE PENALTY\u2019. The horizontal buttons on Gene\u2019s held and Lindsey\u2019s discarded microphones pulsed gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter scratched his coiffed head. \u201cYeah, what <i>is</i> an appearance penalty, anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a permanent score debuff\u2014\u201d hazarded Eugene, before catching the blank look of uncomprehension on the couple\u2019s face. \u201cUh, a penalty subtracted from your appearance-score-weight every round.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Judy said, mischievous grin on her face. \u201cYou could give it to Lindz \u2014 she\u2019d never know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDick move, JuJu,\u201d Peter scolded. \u201cGene might as well take it on the chin; don\u2019t think he can really get more, uh, K-pop-y.

All the way from F to A+.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three chuckled\u2026 before something <i>changed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like some veil over reality was quickly pulled off and exchanged for another, an odd diaphanous <i>ripple</i> throughout all space and time, a cessation and return of sense of the eyes, ears, and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should go without saying that it was <i>very</i> disorienting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene blinked himself back to normalcy with the rest of the group from a prone position on the couch\u2026 which he was fairly sure he wasn\u2019t lying on before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuyzu?\u201d he tried, and winced at his mangled pronunciation. Did he have a stroke or something? His shoulders felt chilly, was that a symptom?  \u201cAre you arrightu?\u201d He scrunched up his face in frustration: all of his l\u2019s came out of his mouth soft and uncertain, like his tongue had forgotten the shape of them. \u201cArright-u. AHL \u2014 RAI \u2014TUH,\u201d he successfully finished after more effort than <i>should</i> be necessary, but he took pause still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas his voice\u2026 different? Sure, he knew that bone-conduction did something weird to your timbre, pitch, whatever, but\u2026 shouldn\u2019t it sound <i>lower</i>? Not this weird, airy, melodic <i>coo</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spared a look at the goth-jock combo meal. They were evidently returning the favor, but with a gaze so aghast and focused that Eugene was pretty sure he had something <i>legendarily</i> embarassing on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsa therre sumthing wrong?\u201d he murmured in his new pitchy voice. Did he get drugged?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to his feet, which was a bit of a trial with how tight his pants felt, and something weird going on with his shoes. Eugene had donned a variety of practically-fossilized clothes in his closet before going to college to see what he should bring, and the three-year old sweatpants he had reluctantly put on produced a similar sensation to what he was feeling right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in a way, this was... <i>different</i>. Now it felt like various parts of his lower body\u2019s anatomy was being supported, and, uh, <i>lifted</i> by his clothes. And though things did feel tight, his dick\u2026 wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WAIT.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene roamed his hands over his body, only just restraining the wild soprano scream threatening to rip out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLIndsey hummed a snippet of the recently-sung song as she walked back to the commons. Besides the water, she had filled a bowl with purloined chips procured from a cordoned off section of the cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like its owner was at school anymore, so whatever! They were only a little bit stale, so, bonus points!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mental endorsement of the chips segued neatly into her friend-group\u2019s hot topic; the Battle of the Bands whatever they had going on. It was <i>super</i> lucky that her and Genie had picked Kpop. Well, uh, lucky for her, not so much for the ungainly-but-still-kinda-cute dork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had watched a lot of the asian chart-music dance videos, partially for knowledge on how to wow her sisters at Gamma Upsilon, and, uh, primarily for, um\u2026 research material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the red dusting her cheeks, Lindsey bopped her way back into the commons with a \u201cHeeeeyyyy~!\u201d... and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatterbox\u2019s silence was precipitated not because of the clearly horrified looks on Judy and Peter\u2019s faces, but instead by the absolute <i>angel</i> standing next to Genie\u2019s spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey hastily set down the bowl of chips and shock-spilled glass of water out of harm\u2019s way and quickly made it to a angle where she could see the girl\u2019s face and not her <i>killer</i> butt and oh <i>god</i> she was <b>adorable</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/K3PXLBS.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/K3PXLBS.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight, dark hair primped itself around a cute, round face, with trembling full lips and large almond-shaped eyes that sparkled with some kind of fear that made Lindsey just want to protect the lil\u2019 cutie! And she certainly was \u2018lil\u2019\u2019, with the top of her head just barely able to scrape Lindsey\u2019s chin, and the pale spaghetti-strapped shoulders peeking out from her glitter-top perfect for casually stretching an arm around during a movie and <b>okay Lindsey you\u2019re jumping a few steps ahead</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the girl was, like, <i>eminently</i> huggable. Small breasts lightly tented the front of her sparkly shirt, nothing that could smother you but still there, and with a definite pinch to her waist, that blossomed into a pair of wide hips and, as Lindsey had noted before, an absolutely <i>banging</i> butt. The mesmerizing body feature was hugged tightly by a pair of white hotpants that cut off right above a spellbinding example of gluteal sulcus and two legs that stretched their worn thigh-highs taut with compacted fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainblonde, upon not receiving an introduction from the shellshocked room, decided to forge her own path with the absolute <i>babe</i>. Her path forging consisted of babbling a storm at the unfamiliar figure, while getting close enough to pull her into an introductory hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Wow</i>, ohmygod hiiii, what\u2019s your name I\u2019m Lindsey and <i>wow</i> are you Alison gawd our skin is so clear what kind of product do you use unless you don\u2019t use any that\u2019d be <i>soo</i> lucky I gotta spend like forty minutes in the mirror post-shower every day hey are you a Dance major, I\u2019m asking \u2018cuz your butt\u2014 <b>IMEANLEGS</b> are soo nice and do you do squats my friend told me I should because I\u2019m kinda a stick but oh god I\u2019m not saying that you are you\u2019re all <i>nice</i> and <i>smooth</i> and uh that\u2019s kinda creepy so I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, by this point, had reached the petite girl and encircled her in a hug that necessitated a small crouch from the CompSci major, the embrace drawing a small squeak from the tiny Asian. Lindsey\u2019s face was burning with embarassment \u2014 had she, like, <i>forgotten</i> how to talk to cute girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA realization hit Lindsey, and she looked circumspect at the room, her coloured hair <i>whapping</i> the poor girl\u2019s face, not that she seemed to care, her visage still petrified with fear, like a deer in headlights look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, uh, where\u2019s Genie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, with a shaking black-nailed finger, pointed at Lindsey \u2014 no, the <i>girl</i> she was <b>hugging</b>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey slowly tilted her head downwards, her face meeting the girl\u2019s, both a matching shade of flushed red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnye\u2014\u201d started the girl before screwing her face up with frustration and trying once more. \u201cHell-o.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey just kept staring. This was <i><b>weird.<br>\r\n</b></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before anyone could make any sort of a comment on the extreme surprising turn of events happening inside the dorm, the game buzzed loudly, drawing attention back to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEAM 2 TURN. BEGIN ROUND OR FORFEIT FOR PENALTY\" The female announce voice boomed, sounding almost...annoyed? A countdown timer appeared on the TV screen, giving Peter and Judy precisely sixty-seconds to lose their shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what WHAT!?\" Peter shouted in alarm, staring back and forth at Eugene's new body and the game. If this was what happened, he didn't want to play anymore! He didn't want to be a chick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod!\" Judy gasped as she fumbled for her own microphone, having dropped it on the couch when the game had...changed Eugene. If it could turn a guy into a girl for being bad...Would it turn her into a guy? She didn't want that at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene just shuddered in Lindsey's arms, trying not to burst into a hysterical fit at the sudden change in gender or from the fact that his crush was now HOLDING HIM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck this, I'm turning it off!\" Peter roared and launched himself towards the game in a powerful and long stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ANI! Museun il-i il-eonal ji nuga al gess-eo!? nan ... nan yeojalo gadhigo sipji anh-a!\" Eugene cried out in terrified Korean, his apparent new native language, stretching a tiny, pale hand towards Peter, who stumbled to a stop and looked at his changed friend in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh...He said No! Like, don't do it Pete! Who knows what might happen!\" Lindsey stumbled over herself, suddenly forced into the role of translator. She could feel Eugene's body quaking against her own and she felt an overwhelming urge to just...protect her. Him. Protect him. As much as she may have been turned on by the nerd's new body...It would have been awful for her to just sit there and let him just be stuck like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT growing a pair of tits!\" Peter argued once more pointing at Eugene as if he was some kind of infectious body-snatcher, \"If I turn it off maybe...Maybe it all gets fixed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, we...honey, we don't KNOW that! We don't know anything about this thing! I...I don't want to risk that happening to me either but we can't just leave Eugene like that! You're his best friend!\" Judy said, taking a step forward only to recoil from Peter's growl. but then the angry, scared look on his face crumbled away as his inner 'good guy' won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Goddamnit FINE! But this better turn us all back at the end of the game or there will be HELL to pay. Especially when we return this fucking thing tomorrow!\" The jock rubbed his temple and moved away from the buzzing game machine, taking his place at Judy's side after a few moments of trying to decide if he should try to be a hero...Or just grab Judy and run for the doors. Again in the end the desire to help Eugene escape from what Peter saw as a fate 'almost' worst than death made him pick the 'fight' option of his 'fight or flight' process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, you ready? Wanna go first? Peter asked as the timer ticked over to <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">00:10</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, s-sure\" Judy gulped, what little confidence she had shriveling away as she clicked the button on the bottom of her microphone once. The countdown timer paused and Peter gave Judy, Lindsey and the next-to-tears Eugene a apprehensive look as he clicked his own remote twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides there's a better chance of me getting messed with than you\" Judy gave Pete a faltering smile that she totally did not feel on the inside. If the game was going by genres...'Megatorch' was a fairly heavy metal/hair metal sounding name.and there was a distinctly smaller pool of female artists in that particular genre, and even fewer mixed bands. Judy just had the distinct feeling that by the end of the song, which the game had decided to choose at random seemingly as punishment for taking too long to continue as it spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROUND START. DELAY PENALTY: SONG SELECTION RANDOMIZED\" The game intoned as the screen flashed, now showing a rapidly spinning list of song titles that was moving much like a prize-wheel, moving too fast for anything more than a few large letters to be picked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck me! COME ON!\" Peter groaned. So much for trying to stack the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's pale skin turned a shade whiter as the spinning list slowed and the selection box landed on...</span></div></div>",

Who are 'The Birthday Massacre'?\" Peter said as he scratched his head, unsure if he should be relieved or utterly terrified. He gave the changed Eugene a long side-look as the now Asian geek's dark, wide eyes stared at the screen as he...she huddled within the protective confines of Lindsey's arms (who didn't seem nearly as distraught as she should have been, given the fact that the girl in her arms had been a dude like two minutes ago) and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That ain't happening to me!' Peter thought as he turned back to the screen, where the song's countdown timer began ticking down. He felt Judy squeeze his hand tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of them\" Lindsey said as she slowly squeezed Eugene a little tighter. He, or rather a she at this point just felt so soft! And warm! 'Mmm...' She thought serenely as she basked in the growing warmth. She was still definitely concerned about Eugene's plight and the plight of Peter and Judy...but this wasn't so bad. After all, it wasn't every day she could openly drape herself around a cute chick without being stared in judgement or wonder or be called a slut. So long as the little geek changed back, this wasn't wrong, was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mong-yubyeong? geugeosgwa geudaji geumsog-eulo deulliji anhneun baendeu ileum-eulo...\" Eugene squeaked in Korean, a chittering of strange words that did very, very little to provide Peter or Judy with any sort of assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Eugene says ditto\" Lindsey offered at their dual stares and then stared down at Eugene and tried to keep her swooning in check as the geek's gorgeous face twisted into OMG just the CUTEST pout. She lingered a bit too long staring into his brown eyes before giving him a small nervous smile, a giggle, and an apologetic shrug as the countdown timer ticked down to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Judy muttered as she tried to keep her anxiety under control, but she could feel her body shaking. If no one knew what the song was it was going to be a certified fail! She didn't want to be a guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music blared from the TV, once again the speakers changing to studio sound quality as an electric guitar riff began grinding out. Peter smiled grimly, at least it was rock music, sounded like it leaned a little alternative or heavy metal. He would have preferred classic rock but rock music meant a male band, so he was safe, right? The light on the microphone in his hand began blinking and he quickly cleared his throat as the words began scrolling across the screen, a music video playing in the background. It was't the same as the weird K-Pop song had been, this was definitely a much lower budget production and looked like it was filmed in either a small bar or someone's basement. Or garage. It was a good thing none of the group were epileptic either, the amount of flashing lights was INSANE. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEU_jnf4uis\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEU_jnf4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT DEAR\" he crooned, but he paused, nearly choking on his own tongue when he saw the lead singer, \"NO! NOOOOOOOO!\" The jock roared in absolute terror as he beheld the tiny, long haired girl in HEAVY goth makeup and huge tits swinging across the stage, her curvy form barely contained by the small, purposefully disheveled school girl outfit as fishnets spider-webbed down her legs to a pair of almost stiletto-heeled boots. She looked VERY similar to Judy in aesthetic, but unlike his girlfriend this girl was thin, and almost model-pretty despite the sleeve tattoos on her arms and the dramatic looking makeup and facial piercings she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite Peter's shock and horror and the high pitched gasp from Judy, the song continued on, the lyrics speeding past and turning red as the petrified football star failed to sing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>The time is getting late here<br>\r\nI'm all washed up in grace<br>\r\nWith faint applause<br>\r\nDressed in a cheap fa\u00e7ade<br>\r\nI'm looking for a place I'll never see again</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piteo, nolae sijaghae! dangsin-ihaji anh-eumyeon eotteohge doelji nuga algessseubnikka!\" Eugene cried out, her own eyes wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, sing before it does something to you!\" Lindsey shouted back the rough translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST SINGUH, BABO!\" Eugene shouted back in her best attempt at English, still lapsing back into Korean despite her best attempt not to. Peter let loose some strange squawking noise as he brought the microphone back to his lips and struggled to keep up with the next wall of lyrics that were streaming upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe...Maybe if I knock this out of the park I won't turn into a Judy-clone!' His panicked mind flailed as the music swelled, the girl on the stage flicked an arm through her hair dramatically and began to shimmer, her huge hips straining against the plaid skirt they were encased in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a n-night turns t-to a day<br>\r\nA street I've n-never walked on<br>\r\nI was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a f-faint reflection<br>\r\nThe day turns to a month<br>\r\nA s-second of affection<br>\r\nI-I was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a faint reflection\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his best attempt however, Peter's wavering voice was far too off-key, and his body, his glorious temple of masculinity was ramrod straight, his bulging muscles tensed and locked into position instead of mimicking the on-stage performance. And then his section was over, but he let loose a pre-mature exhale, peaking the speakers with static as the lyrics dropped away to a heavy guitar section as the entire band began head-banging on screen, the goth girl's dark hair whipping back and forth in a dark, violent waterfall of motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Petey, you're so screwed, lol' Lindsey thought as she winced the jock's trainwreck performance. It was a good thing she wasn't into the whole 'muscled dude' scene or she would have been dreading what was sure to be the upcoming change. Instead she was more curious than anything. She didn't particularly like Peter all that much but another cute girl? She wasn't exactly going to turn down a chance to make the scenery better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's microphone began blinking as it became her turn. To her credit, the goth with the mysterious past only fumbled the first line as she pushed through her shock and quickly found her footing, taking little solace in the fact that at least this was a girl song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-faking<br>\r\nThere's n-nothing here worth taking<br>\r\nJust my reflection fading<br>\r\nOn the wall<br>\r\nNot the fairest one of all<br>\r\nI'm looking for a place I'll never see again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music swelled once more as it moved into the chorus as the goth hit her stride. She stomped across the common room stage, mimicking the music video before sliding into a hip-shaking bob, stretching a arm high in the air, her breasts pressing tightly against the heart-shaped skull on her t-shirt. She flung her hair dramatically and pulled the mic in close as she prepared for the second half of her turn. Judy herself felt rather silly, her conservative upbringing still lodged in a deep part of her mind and telling her to stop looking so shameful, but she ignored it, like she had been for two years. She HAD to nail this, for Peter's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh wow, that's hot' A part of Peter's mind tossed out before panic set in once more. And if Lindsey had been capable of reading minds, she probably would have concurred even if she didn't think about Judy that way. As it was, Lindsey was just really impressed, outside of that first stumble Judy was doing a REALLY good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The night turns to a day<br>\r\nA street I've never walked on<br>\r\nI was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a faint reflection<br>\r\nThe day turns to a month <br>\r\nA second of affection<br>\r\nI was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a faint reflection\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy huffed away from the microphone as the vocals faded out to a admittingly epic guitar section while the lead singer let herself go limp and then began...jerking around like she was a zombie? And then she did a extremely violent head-bang in-sync with the drums before she began leaning over low, a sultry look on her face and her breasts hanging forward, revealing no small amount of cleavage. Judy did her best to mimic the singer but she the only thing she seemed to get close on was the boob-shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then BOTH Judy and Peter's microphones lit up as the final set of lyrics began rolling across the screen. Beneath it the song's track bar was nearing the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Peter! Step it up!\" Judy hissed at her wide-eyed, slack-jawed boyfriend, giving him a elbow to the ribs to jerk the jock out of his fear (and possibly hormone) induced paralysis. He gasped for air and looked down at his blinking microphone and gave Judy a rather pitiful look before he was forced to once more sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The night turns to a day<br>\r\nA street I've never walked on<br>\r\nI was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a faint reflection<br>\r\nThe day turns to a month<br>\r\nA second of affection<br>\r\nI was never here<br>\r\nI'm just a faint reflection\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple actually managed to pull off a decent rendition, Peter somehow having the clarity of mind to mimic both the stomping the lead singer was doing AND singing without the same flaws as before, choosing before to back up Judy's soaring vocals instead of attempting to be the lead. And then the lyrics were gone, the band onstage clearly winding down, the lead girl that Peter desperately, desperately hoped he wasn't going to become begin bouncing up and down, her breasts heaving as she pointed out into the crowd and flashing pearly white teeth as she interacted with the audience. And then the video ended, fading away as the score tally screen appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT TO BE A CHICK!\" Peter wailed in a rather unmanly way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A geuligo naega han geoscheoleom!?\" Eugene muttered darkly as the group watched as Peter and Judy's fate was tabulated. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ice-blue TV screen flickered with numbers, with bold-texted ratings categories headed by the titles Player One and Player 2; bold-fonted of \u2018PERFORMANCE,\u2019 \u2018APPEARANCE,\u2019 and \u2018MUSICALITY,'. Peter sucked in a dramatic breath and held it in apprehension while Judy began to wringe her hands and bounce back and forth on her heels, casting wide-eyed glances between the TV, Peter and the still-huddled pair of Lindsey and Eugene as the goth and jock waited for their score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an ominous sounding jingle as new text appeared on the screen, and Peter wailed as a large red 'F' appeared under 'Player One'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not me! Uh uh! Sorry Geno but FUCK THIS!\" Peter wailed as he flung the microphone at the TV and RAN for the common room's door with the FULL intention of jumping in his truck in the parking lot and getting as far away from the nightmare machine as he could. But he didn't get far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud BANG from the machine, and instead of the gentle, somewhat 'magical girl' anime transformation that had changed Eugene from a overweight nerd into a Korean beauty, Peter's body changed immediately as he was hit by something hard and invisible, his back arcing as he screamed in pain. His body changed instantly, his former towering, rippling physique vanishing in a flash of what looked like smoke as his new body took it's place. His scream of pain lost it's bass-boost and went higher and higher as his lips plumped out and gained a layer of deep red lipstick white HEAVY mascara and eye shadow applied themselves to his new larger, rounder blue eyes. His nose, jawline and chin shrank into cute, attractive proportions as metallic studs appeared on his brow, his nose, and his shrinking ears that were rapidly being hidden by his expanding hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brown buzzcut turned pitch black and flowed down across his much smaller and rounder shoulders and curved back that was connected to a pair of hips and a rounded ass that challenged Eugene's own. Breasts that were slightly large than Judy's exploded from Peter's chest as the sports t-shirt and his rugged jeans rippled into a black sleeveless shirt that did little to contain the new bulging orbs of flesh. A skirt wrapped itself around the jock's swollen hips as torn leggings slid down from under the skirt's hemline and across the two slender, short legs that had replaced Peter's powerful limbs. There was a slightly damp void that suddenly appeared between his His flailing arms shrank, looking impossibly small to the muscled bulk that they'd just been as everything Peter had worked for vanished in an instant as dark flowers and skulls faded into existence on paling skin. Black tipped nails topped tiny hands, and there was a noisy clack as the stiletto heels pushed their way out of the sneakers Peter had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Peter squeaked as she stumbled over her new feet, colliding with the common room's door frame. And there she went quiet as she stared down in absolute speechless terror at her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Peter?\" Judy called out, dropping her own mic on the couch behind her and ignoring her own tabulating score as she hustled over to her girlified beau...And stopped several inches away as she realized how small Peter was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the stiletto boots, Peter's new body was barely eye-level with the 5'4 natural goth. And those...things that hung off his chest were large than Judy's had ever been by at least a cup size. And her-his face was darkly stunning as the piercings hung of angular features that Judy had once had, back before she'd stopped living the life her parents had wanted and looking how they'd desired her to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Lindsey whispered from across the room, earning a confused look from Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwolago haess-eo?\" She whispered back, but Lindsey didn't seem to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm a...\" Peter gasped in her new voice, a tiny hand shooting up to her throat, grasping it and then shooting away as smooth skin rubbed across smooth skin, searching for an Adam's Apple that was no longer there. And then the hand rotated slowly in the air in front of Peter's face as he stared at it with his changed eyes that began to grow watery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANT TO BE A CHICK!\" She screamed as hot tears began to roll down her face and leaving dark trails of ruined make-up that, somehow, only made Peter look even MORE like the goth chick he, now she, was. She felt her tiny knees begin to shake, her legs begin to buckle and she began to slide down the door frame as dark tears dripped from her face and left dark splotches on the huge mammary glands that were already causing her back to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, babe!\" Judy cried, getting over her shock and rushing in with her arms open wide, scooping up Peter as best as she could and feeling the utterly weird feeling as two pairs of huge beasts squished against each other. But some part of her took a little delight in the fact that Judy could not rest her head on top of Peter's glossy black locks, something she'd never been able to do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back! Please!\" Peter wailed into Judy's shoulder, but the only response was a beep from the game as Judy's A- and Peter's F were wiped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'PROCEED TO BATTLE OF THE BANDS' The screen read, 'ALL PLAYERS CONFIRM READY TO PROCEED', followed by 'SAVE AND CONTINUE' and 'SAVE AND QUIT'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, wonder what that means? Do we, like, keep playing or what?\" Lindsey said, finally letting go of Eugene from the full body hug she'd been holding him-her in, letting her left hand drift down the slender arms and hook itself in Eugene's tiny right hand as they group turned to stare at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linji, museun mal-inji ihaehal su eobs-eoyo!\" Eugene whined, suddenly very afraid of the fact that he could only make out about three of the words on the TV screen. What was happening to him!? Like, other than what had already happened!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lindsey looked at Eugene and once again felt the urge to swoon, she was SO pretty! \"Oh, uh...\" Lindsey paused for a moment as Judy carefully guided a extremely distraught looking Peter back to the couch, \"Naneun dangsin-eul ihaehal su issseubnida! geuligo dangsin-ui mogsoliga neomu joh-a! mwoga munje ya?\" The rainblonde replied after a moment of rapid thought. Reading Korean on a screen was one thing but trying to speak it on command was another thing entirely. She hoped she hadn't muddled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwo? Linji, naneun deo isang yeong-eoleul ilg-geona ihaehal su eobsdago saeng-gaghabnida! na-ege museun il-i il-eonago issseubnida!\" Eugene's face scrunched in concentration as she tried, almost desperately, to remember the way that English felt on her tongue. \"Pur...Pwah...Purweese?\" Was the best she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geulaedo gwaenchanh-ayo, jega dul da mal-eulhagi ttaemun-e jeonjeog-eulo dangsin-eul doul su iss-eoyo! naega jab-ass-eo!\" Lindsey said back with a rather large and unsbutle wink as she slid a arm around Eugene's waist, whose pale face turned bright red as the former American began sputtering in Korean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, if we'd like to get back to the matter at hand here...\" Judy said with a cough as she patted the top of Peter's head, who had her own new face buried in Judy's t-shirt, the tiny but VERy top heavy body shuddered with quiet sobs. \"Can we figure out how to get my boyfriend back, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, uh...\" Lindsey said with a giggle, looking away from Eugene, who was now hiding her her face with a free hand as she tried to regain composure, \"Well, like, we can go into the Battle of the Bands since, like, that's how we move to the next, um, level, right? And I guess we just repeat until one of us wins and then we all change back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I figured that much out. EW PETER!\" Judy squealed as the new goth suddenly snorted, a glob of sticky liquid bursting across Judy's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeww, grody!\" Lindsey said as Judy pushed herself up from the couch with a huff and walked over the small kitchen, grabbing the roll of paper towels off their dispenser and doing her best to remove the mucus from her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY!\" Peter wailed before burying her head in her own arms and doing her best to lean over, her massive bust preventing her from doing anything more than an awkward hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this is like my favorite shirt...\" The natural goth muttered as she made her way back to the couch, continuing to wipe at the stain. The moment that she'd returned her rear to the cushion though, Peter's sniffling face fell across her lap, her features hidden by the mane of dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think either of them are in the mood for continuing. They're both broke. What's that about saving?\" Judy pointed a nail towards the screen and Lindsey followed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, I guess if something breaks of something we can come back to this point with all our points saved? And the other one means we'll just quit to the title screen and maybe we can turn the game off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that!\" Peter squeaked as she shot up from Judy's lap, \"I don't wanna play anymore! Turn it off so I can change back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeoleobun, linji, museun malsseum iseyo? museun il-iya? geim-e daehae iyagihago issseubnikka?\" Eugene asked as she regained her own composure. She was definitely concerned about not being able to comprehend her former native language any longer, but she had to admit that Lindsey's touch felt really, really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye, gyesog peullei hal geos-inji animyeon jinhaeng sanghwang-eul jeojanghal geos-inji paaghalyeogohabnida\" Lindsey replied back. Luckily her conversational Korean seemed to be returning as when Eugene spoke next, the girl's words didn't sound nearly as foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's a good idea, if Peter and I can be...changed like this, who knows what it'll do!? We should keep playing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, maybe we should take a break?\" Lindsey said back as Judy and Peter looked on at the all American blonde speaking perfectly fluent Korean with the Asianified Eugene.

That fuckin' hurt Peter!\" Lindsey hissed as she unintentionally motor-boated the jock-turned-goth's massive breasts as they pressed against her ace. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, they were warm, firm, but not hard and if it hadn't been for the rest of Pete's thicc and stacked body weight pressing against her and cutting off her oxygen supply, the rain-blonde wouldn't have been so quick to shove her...him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it!?\" Peter screeched before his darker eyes set upon his remote. He scrambled over on all fours, his newly enlarged posterior sticking up in the air and straining against the skirt he now wore before he swiped up the remote in his tiny hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\uc820\uc7a5, \ub204\uad70\uac00 \uadf8\ub97c \ub9c9\uc544!\" Eugene called out, but it was too late as, with a deranged giggle, Peter pressed the microphone's input button and a highlighted bar appeared on the TV screen. Before Eugene could intervene, Peter pressed the button until the bar settled on the ominous looking 'Save &amp; Quit' option, and with a foreign cry of dismay from Eugene, the desperate jock pressed and held the button down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chime as the bar flashed and the screen went black, the games stylized logo appearing in the center of the screen; a large italic <i>M</i> encased within an infinity symbol. It pulsed as the four college students froze in their tracks, their limbs falling limply to their sides and their expression going neutral as all four pairs of eyes turned completely black as the logo reflected in them. The TV screen began fading to disrupted snow and distortion that seemed to engulf the entire dorm before, with a loud POP, the aging flatscreen turned off as a small trail of smoke drifted out of the game machine's R2D2-like dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness faded from the eyes of the students, and with a collective shake of their feminine heads, they looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Peter and Eugene ask what happened, only to be shocked as Lindsey and Judy have no idea what they're talking about. Eugene finds himself dragged off to his new shared room with Lindsey, who is eager to have a 'study session' with 'Euna'. Meanwhile Peter finds himself the girlfriend with his old fratbro Jeremy, with Judy thanking 'Petra' for trying to help her find a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Lindsey and Judy asked what happened, only to be shocked when 'Euna' and 'Petra' have no idea what they're talking about. Euna drags Lindsey back to their shared room to 'Practice English' while Petra calls up her boyfriend Jeremy from the nearby frathouse, and tries to get a horrified Judy a date with one of the other frat boys.</span></div></div>",

After a few more seconds of despondent moaning, Peter staggered to his heeled feet, arms delicately laced across his stomach, as if he was about to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 <i>broken</i>!\u201d he wailed, his high voice ragged with despair. \u201cI can\u2019t see my goddamn <i>feet</i> past these and I\u2019m a <i>pipsqueak</i> and it\u2019s <b>broken</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering under the weight of his anguish \u2014 and also on the stiletto heels \u2014 Peter kneeled down and buried his face into his soft arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gnawed at her lip as her feminized friend quavered at the edge of tears. Sure, it was kinda definitely his fault, but\u2026 she\u2019d be pretty upset if she was a <i>guy</i>, bleugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could try to awkwardly comfort him \u2014 uh or should it be her now? \u2014 her lap\u2019s occupant surged to her feet, face cherry-red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\ubcd1\uc2e0!\u201d she screamed, black hair swirling around her head. \u201c\ubcd1\uc2e0!\u201d she repeated, one hand snagging a pillow and whipping it at the prone Peter, who only let out a forlorn squeak in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey quickly got up and held Eugene\u2019s hand back from slapping, whispering \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d into her ear as the enfemmed geek\u2019s angry cries slowly dissolved into a sobbing wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad and sadder members of the room turned towards Judy, who was backlit by the white gleam of the TV, the words TAKE FIVE: 1:58:41,\u2019 slowly ticking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled sheepishly. \u201cI just pressed the POWER button, guess it was rebooting or someth\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by the bone-quaking jolt of Peter\u2019s flying hug and the accompanying hailstorm of jawbone-kisses \u2014 Peter <i>was</i> a pipsqueak, after all \u2014 and \u2018iloveyou\u2019s. The goth shakily smiled through her potentially bruised ribs and lightly patted her boy-cum-girl-friend\u2019s slight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey combed her mind to find the Korean term for \u2018everything\u2019s alright now,\u2019 or a similar mollifying statement, but the wide smile she was met with assured her that the screen\u2019s message had gotten across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl hugged new-girl in the commons and vice versa, relief suffusing throughout their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Lindsey spoke up again. \u201cSo, uh, what <i>happened</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was met with three pairs of inquisitive eyes, a sum that did not decrease as she translated the question for Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, that was some <i>totally </i>spooky stuff, right? So <i>something</i> must\u2019ve happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a <i>chick</i> now, Lindz, if you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d harumphed Peter, flopping back onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey rolled her eyes. \u201cLike, I\u2019m talking about <i>after</i> you cried your eyes out, Petey-girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter bristled at this and took a bluster-ready stance, but a gentle smile and pat on the shoulder from Judy stopped any aggressive overtures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsey once again gave Eugene the Korean rundown on the conversation, Judy silently congratulated herself. All things considered, she was taking this pretty gosh-darn well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere probably wasn\u2019t a WikiHow article for \u2018What to do When Your Boyfriend Loses A Foot-and-Change of Height and Gets a Cup Size or Two on You,\u2019 but she could probably write it after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 1: Let her know you\u2019re there for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 2: Try to stop her from exacerbating and/or perpetuating her new Napoleon Complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep 3: Try to avoid any kisses without breaking her heart, because boy <i>howdy</i> do they make you feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, Step 3 probably needed some work. Sure, he was a lot shorter now,  heaps softer and <i>definitely</i>\u2026 lumpier, but physical attraction isn\u2019t the most important part of romance, right? A lack of <i>Eros</i> wasn\u2019t enough to put a hole in her <i>Pragma</i>-ship, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy\u2019s pride turned into self-doubt, one of her fidgety peep-toed feet bumped into an unfamiliarly textured object: some kind of bumpy vinyl? Putting the adjacent-seated stewing runt out of her mind, she picked it up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey afforded Judy a brief glance before turning back to her foreign-language conversation, but Peter gave the goth her full attention. In her girlfriend\u2019s hand was a black, rippled-vinyl purse, the front upon which a rhinestone skull proudly sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy forced a smile onto her face. \u201cI think this is yours, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredulity, fear, and indignation crossed Peter\u2019s face all at once. \u201cNo,\u201d she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy\u2019s patience wore a little thinner. \u201cThis isn\u2019t <i>mine</i>, Petey, Lindsey doesn\u2019t wear black, and Eugene\u2019s whole\u2026 aesthetic isn\u2019t really sk\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo <i>way</i>!\u201d Peter screeched, before scooting awashe could. Pinprick pupils flicked from side to side before the stressed shorty grabbed a pillow and started screaming bloody murder into the polyurethane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\ubb34\uc2a8 \uc77c\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4?\u201d Eugene\u2019s attention was piqued, first by her name, then by the series of wineglass-shattering cries. <br>\r\n\u201cShe sai\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got the gist,\u201d Judy faintly smiled, with a vague sense of concern around the pronoun-change. \u201cI f\u2014 <i>WE</i> found Peter\u2019s purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not <b><i>MINE</i></b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy ignored her. \u201cGeno probably has one too. I\u2019d guess\u2026\u201d She scanned the bewildered beauty\u2019s ensemble. \u201c... sequins. Or sparkles.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLindsey went to work translating as Judy rooted through the purse. A mix of amusement and creeping dread seeped into the goth\u2019s smile as she felt through the bag. The little round disc <i>had</i> to be a compact and the little phone she felt definitely had more rhinestones on its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter inched closer as her girlfriend investigated, staring towards (though never quite at) the object, as if direct eye contact would blind her. In response, Judy fished out a bulky black wallet shot through with a rosebush pattern and tossed it to her beau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Lindsey and Eugene found the purse that was, indeed, covered with sequins. A passport for \u2018Euna\u2019 was located in sharp succession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fuckin\u2019 name is <i>Petra</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy met Peter\u2019s outrage with a gentle smile. \u201cAt least it\u2019s close to Peter \u2014\u201d The sight of \u2018Petra\u2019s\u2019 license gave her ample room for pause. Seeing a smile on her boyfriend\u2019s new face just felt\u2026 wrong. The girl in the picture had less piercings, but she was still clearly mugging for the camera; her smile was pouted out a bit, and her eyes were half lidded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shuddered: this was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey snorted from across the room. \u201cI bet your height\u2019s, like, 4\u20192\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck <i>off</i> Lindz,\u201d Peter shot back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you grope your new girl-toy some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy would have tried to play peacemaker, but she was busy stuffing the purse-sourced condom she had found into the recesses of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey let out an outraged scoff. \u201c<i>Wow</i>, <b>Petra</b>. I thought the game turned you into a <i>goth</i>, not a total <i>bitch</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame to you, Micheals! We both know you\u2019re gonna throw the next round, just to keep Geno nice and huggable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorority girl snapped to her feet, gently pulling the confused Eugene up with her. \u201cActually, I was planning on totally kicking your fat <i>ass</i>, Tziermos!\u201d She raised a finger to her pursed lips in mock realization. \u201cOh wait, did your last name change too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Peter. She shot to her feet \u2014 only stumbling a bit on the stilettos \u2014 and yanked Judy up behind her, the definite effort she had to expend only exacerbating her anger. \u201cFUCK <b>YOU</b>!\u201d she howled, body tilted forward like the force of her scream would knock Lindsey over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorority girl remained standing, however, and flicked up a middle finger at the volcanic goth. \u201cYou too, shortstuff.\u201d she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two feuding girls stormed out of the room to their respective dorms with passengers in tow; one whispering a slew of rapid Korean and the other stunned into silence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mind was a million miles away. The surreality of the situation wasn\u2019t just catching up to her, it had left her in the <i>dust</i>.

She laid a dainty hand on Judy\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a fever or anything, but we can skip the Battle of the Bands if you need it\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lump rose in the goth\u2019s throat and she pulled her shrunken boyfriend into a tight hug, driving the breath out of Peter\u2019s lungs with an inelegant squeak. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna lose you,\u201d she whispered hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, babe,\u201d Peter croaked, one hand lightly patting Judy\u2019s back. \u201cBut, uh, this is <i>real <b>tight</b></i>...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Judy released her prisoner. Peter gratefully gulped down lungfuls of air, one dainty hand gently massaging her thin throat. Judy chuckled nervously. \u201cSorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smiled weakly. \u201cS\u2019 alright. Just, uh, something to get used to. And, hey, speaking of getting used to\u2026\u201d She scrunched her face into a mask of concentration, and with a deep breath, pulled herself into an impromptu pirouette.

She bent over and traced the shapely length of one leg with a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just another kind \u2018a exercise; there\u2019s posture, core-engagement, the works!\u201d A tuneless hum left her painted lips as she started off down the hallway again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy followed her; an easy task considering Peter\u2019s short stride. A silly thought crossed her mind, and she let out a short titter. \u201cMaybe you should talk to the guys about working it into your training routine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned to her with a politely confused smile. \u201cHm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was forced to confront the awful, painful reality of a failed joke. \u201cI meant, uh, when you\u2019re <i>normal</i>\u2014 <i>imeanaguy</i> again, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">you should, um, talk to</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> the team about exercising with them\u2026</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter blinked twice before offering a laugh that Judy was fairly certain was forced. \u201cOh.

Where before the entrance was relatively austere, the door now was more reminiscent of something Judy had seen at Lindz\u2019s sorority. A whiteboard now sat proudly below the peephole, its rim slathered in purple glitter. \u2018Judy R.\u2019 sat on the left in bulky black letters, almost comically contrasted by Petra\u2019s own signature, an ersatz purple mix between cursive and Webdings, with the enclosed bowls in \u2018P\u2019 \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 decorated with a cutesy miniature skull. Hell, if Judy didn\u2019t <i>know</i> she was looking for a \u2018Petra\u2019, she\u2019d be deciphering these hieroglyphics for ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStickers flanked the right side of the whiteboard, running the gamut from caricatured <i>calavera</i> to an elaborate serpentine rosebush that must have been <i>hell</i> to get off the vinyl. A faux warning sign sits askew above the whiteboard, reading \u2018BAD GIRLZ AHEAD,\u2019 though its ragged edges speak of numerous attempts at removal. Its attacker seems to have given up after ripping their third corner, however, and settled for scribbling out the \u2018Z\u2019. Poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wasn\u2019t sure how long she spent staring at the door, but an insistent rapping on her shoulder jolted her out of it. Peter peered sheepishly up at her. \u201cUh, do you have the key?\u201d She twirled the hem of her skirt demonstratively. \u201cNo pockets here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only ten seconds to produce the key from the purse \u2014 decorated with another skull, much to Judy\u2019s chagrin \u2014 but the buzz of movement from the bedazzled phone gave her pause. \u2018Petra\u2019s\u2019 phone was tempting, but the device was <i>definitely</i> some kinda Pandora\u2019s box\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy fished it out anyways as Peter fumbled with the lock, and stowed it in her skirt pocket. In for a penny, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this, <i>weird</i> for you at all, Pete?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete stopped with a moment to aim a major side-eye at her. \u201cNot at <i>all</i>, Ju. It\u2019s a funny coincidence, really; I was gonna ask you to saw off my legs at the knee, so I could be <i>extra</i> tiny. And later I was gonna staple a pair of milkjugs to my chest. Everything worked out; really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wrinkled her nose at the term, but couldn\u2019t help but laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, never say that again,\u201d she half-whispered, half-snorted, looking around like walls had ears, and maybe also Victorian sensibilities. Brushing a hand past her grin, she forced it into a stern line. \u201cNo, I mean, aren\u2019t you taking this <i>really</i> well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Peter smelled blood in the water. \u201cTaking what well? These biggy-wiggy jubbly-bubblies?\u201d She hefted her prodigious chest to clarify, lips curled into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, with her fairly sheltered upbringing, had not developed the immunity to \u2018naughty words\u2019 required for everyday life in the collegiate world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter Tzerimos, that is <i>disgusting</i>!\u201d she scolded, though the way scandalized giggling punctuated nearly every syllable didn\u2019t do much for her authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter\u2019s bottom lip wobbled dramatically, twisting her delicate features into a Disney-worthy pout. When she spoke, her voice was high, quavering, and laced through with sorrow. \u201cThat\u2019s messed up, Ju-Ju. Just \u2018cuz I got a big ol\u2019 pair of honker-bonker bongo-wongos doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ohmigod <b>stop</b></i>\u201dJudy gasped, her body bent double with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mirth was infectious: Peter\u2019s faux-offense soon crumbled into a high, buoyant titter, a stark contrast to the booming guffaw he had a few hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir laughter graduated to a fit; Judy leaning on her beau\u2019s slight, inkspattered shoulders for support, Peter clinging to Judy\u2019s biceps for the same reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long minute before their giggling came to a stop, though smiles still split either girl\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach hurts.\u201d coughed Peter, one hand moving to curl around her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d murmured Judy, gazing into Peter\u2019s ice-blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter coughed politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy squeezed her shoulder affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence hung in the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Judy suddenly, impulsively, pulled Peter into a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had kissed two people in her life. The first was the boy she had taken to her school\u2019s Spring Formal, Hank Paloma. Judy had really, truly, liked him, but the boy had only allowed the briefest lip-to-lip contact once, expressing concern that her lip might get stuck in his braces, the devils of temptation, etc. etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, he had written a long message to her on Facebook, explaining that he was, in fact, gay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agreed to stay friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second person she had kissed was Peter, and those kisses were <i>much</i> better. The way he held her made her feel <i>safe</i>; how he never complained that her breath smelled, even though he made sure that his always smelled like peppermint; how at the beginning he always asked to make sure she was comfortable and\u2026 and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kiss was only <i>marginally</i> better than Hank\u2019s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoobs were an issue: Judy had to stand on her tiptoes and crane her neck  to avoid collision, and even then she had to arch her back a little bit to make sure that she didn\u2019t frame Peter\u2019s chin with her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, his lips were <i>way</i> too soft now; it felt like she was pressed up against a pair of microwaved gummy worms that, for some reason, were liquorice-flavored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter didn\u2019t seem to know where to put her hands too, flailing them about in surprise as it first began, before carefully traveling to her hips, settling on them for a second before abruptly recoiling, either one hovering awkwardly around Judy\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the eyes that were the worst, though, Judy thought. When the goth had pulled her sweetheart into the kiss, she had kept hers open for a second, just to see Peter\u2019s pupils contract into pinpricks, spinning about in their sockets like a panicked animal. Judy had closed hers after that, but could still practically <i>feel</i> her gaze drilling into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it might have sucked, but she <i>needed</i> to do this. Peter was still Peter, no matter how small and soft. Judy Ross would <i>make</i> herself like girls with sheer force of will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been twenty seconds: she\u2019d up the ante. It was time to go for tongue. She summoned all of her gumption...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Peter pulled away, and Judy could feel her heart break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-ju, I\u2019m sorry. I just needed to breathe, it\u2019s not you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy hoped that her smile looked genuine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Pete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t <i>ready</i>, sorry,\u201d Peter tucked a strand of hair behind an ear. \u201cWe can, uh,\u201d A flash of discomfort flit across her face. \u201c... try again later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry, Jay, I\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Judy took Peter\u2019s hand in her own and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over Peter\u2019s face. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d She coughed into her hand, probably to dispel the awkward air, and turned the doorknob with a flourish. \u201cLet\u2019s check out the digs, girlfriend~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy slouched in after her, noting that the term of endearment sounded distressingly platonic.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judy walked in the room with far more dread than her companion, who seemed <i>way</i> too enthused with this identity-alienating situation. Part of the room was familiar; the same grey-sheeted bed, the desk with the assorted mythological treatises on its surface, and the partially full wardrobe, that contained mostly black-and-greys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was new, however, was the line of black-and-yellow caution tape in the centre, a stickynote placed at its end helpfully denoting it as \u2018THE DMZ\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was even <i>newer</i> was entire other side of the room, the bed a vibrant (and eye-shattering) combo of neon yellow and bright pink, the wall adorned with posters \u2014 most containing women dressed similarly to Peter, band names beneath them in jagged metal letters. The few with guys on them all had their male subjects shirtless, and covered in some kind of oil and/or water, to Judy\u2019s chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy cast a look at the desk. Framed pictures of \u2018Petra,\u2019 and\u2026 her. One of her and her enfemmed beau at some kind of concert, the former uncomfortably smiling whilst wrapped in a large overcoat, the latter in a scandalous fishnet bodystocking, the purple-and-black underwear underneath the only things keeping her decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one at a bar: Petra hoisting a pink cocktail glass and the photographing camera, aiming a prodigious pout at the lens. Judy had a glass of clear spirit to her lips and paid no heed to the camera. The photographed girl frowned. She <i>hated</i> candids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's stomach squirmed. This was fuckin\u2019 <i>weird</i>. Sure, she had girded herself for the loads of Petra-paraphernalia, but the fact that they had <i>her</i> in it was a whole other can of dysphoric worms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, meanwhile, had bopped over to \u2018her\u2019 closet, more specifically, the full-length mirror on the door. beginning an impromptu investigation of her new face, poking and prodding her features with a black nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJee-<i>zus</i>, Jay, you shoulda <i>told</i> me about the mascara!\u201d she whined. \u201cDo you have any makeup wipes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably do.\u201d Judy mumbled, numbly sliding into her chair. Did Peter even <i>know</i> what makeup wipes were before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilfered phone buzzed in her pocket, and Judy, hoping for a distraction but fairly certain that there was no way she\u2019d find it on <i>Petra\u2019s <b>phone</b></i>, pulled it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an Instagram notification. \u2018deezybroncos\u2019 has liked your post!\u2019 Morbid curiosity thrummed throughout Judy. She shouldn\u2019t look; there was no <i>way</i> it was gonna make her feel any better; there were, like, fifty \u2018like notifications\u2019 from similarly weird usernames and <i>she was already opening it</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy typed the code 0229 in with a rueful smile. Petey\u2019s birthdate, and also Petra\u2019s apparently, evidenced by the now-open phone. The big goof never really put much thought into his passwords and it looks like the little shortsta<i>OH JESUS</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mortified goth let out a squeak. How <i>couldn\u2019t</i> she?! Judy spared a look at Peter, and heaved a sigh of relief. She hadn\u2019t heard her, embroiled in the act of daubing the streaks of mascara as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up as not-<i>actually</i>-the-preacher\u2019s-daughter-but-pretty-close-to-that had left Judy with a tiny little bit of reservation towards\u2026 \u2018lewd things\u2019. Sure, she was all for body positivity, owning your own sexuality \u2014 heck, her own outfit featured a bit of cleavage \u2014 but other people doing it usually brought a blush to her cheeks. It wasn\u2019t secondhand embarrassment or disapproval or <i>attraction</i> or stuff like that; it was just\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, it was secondhand embarrassment, whatever. She couldn\u2019t <i>imagine</i> doing stuff like\u2026 <b>this</b>. Anyways, she could feel the heat in her face: it was probably <i>crimson</i> now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra\u2019s account was dubbed \u2018ghoulgurl\u2019, the profile bubble featuring the girl snarling in black makeup, her hands raised on either side of her head, curled into claws. The bio read as such: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2727\uff65\uff9f: *\u2727\uff65\uff9f:* <span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">music major and part-time BTGGF at North Point</span> *:\uff65\uff9f\u2727*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">ppl who call me short get \ud83d\udd2aed<br>\r\n :P<br>\r\n</span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVowing to look up what the hell BTGGF meant later, Judy scrolled through the profile, horror mounting. The posts were positively <i>scandalous</i>! One had Petra against a large granite pillar, wearing a tanktop that was more like a pushup bra with a hem, the bits below her exposed midriff wrapped in a way-to-goddamn-short pair of jorts and strategically ripped fishnets. There was more in the set: next featured Petra leaning towards the camera, slyly smiling as she tucked a lock of hair behind one ear, back bent to thrust out\u2026 ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy flicked through a the similarly risque gallery before she noticed the description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">like if u wish u were the pillar ;)<br>\r\ncredits:<br>\r\ncamera: pilfered from the photo lab<br>\r\n(unwilling)photographer: @jdross <br>\r\n<br>\r\ni have 2 get her coffee 4 a week now :(</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA manic laugh escaped from her lips. Great. Fan-fucking-tastic. She was complicit in her boy-turned-girlfriend\u2019s thirst trap, which netted\u2026 2,357 LIKES?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, like, a third of the people at North Point! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shook off her shock and continued her dread investigation. Though they were <i>very</i> hard to look at, the posts did reveal quite a bit. Petra was in the Music Theory program, and was planning on minoring in Fashion Design, explaining the dizzying array of outfits she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wasn\u2019t fashioned out of thrift store finds was apparently supplied courtesy of \u2018Daddy\u2019s credit card,\u2019 which was thankfully <i>not</i> a euphemism for male-admirer\u2019s-money. It was almost funny: many a time Peter had griped about how his dad never even gave him <i>birthday</i> money; apparently, Petra\u2019s dad had looser pursestrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy hoped to <i>God</i> that Petra\u2019s dad didn\u2019t have access to this account, though. If he were anything like hers \u2014 a damming comparison for any parent \u2014 he\u2019d have yanked the girl out of school the moment his follow request went through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most recent one was a prime example: Four days ago, Petra had apparently decided to get a tattoo at \u2018Lovecraft Parlor,\u2019 one of the few such establishments that was still open. The picture had Petra donning a skull-emblazoned facemask and lying down on a table swaddled with towels, her arm propped up on the same surface to display the new ink; a rosebush with skulls in the stead of blooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be all well and good if Petra wasn\u2019t <i>topless</i>, and her festooned arm wasn\u2019t the <i>only thing</i> preventing covering her Terms-of-Service-violating chest. Judy\u2019s alternate-universe-counterpart seemed to share similar\u2026 reservations, as per the posts comment chain:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><b>jdross</b>: PETRA WHAT THE FUCK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ghoulgurl</b>: :p whats the prob roomie? u jelyl? its the human body nuthin to be shaamde about<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ghoulgurl</b> *ashamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>jdross</b> First off, you\u2019re DEFINITELY drunk. Second off, pictures don\u2019t just disappear off the Internet. There\u2019s probably around a hundred people that posted this somewhere else the moment they sa\u2026 <span class=\"cblue\"><u>more</u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ghoulgurl</b>: tl;dr. xd <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\u201cHey, whaddya looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Judy could process the implications of the post, the phone was delicately plucked out of her hands by its now-makeupless owner, who had apparently seen fit to strip to her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched Peter flick through the phone, guilt burgeoning in her breast. \u201cPetey, I \u2014\u201d But what could she say? \u2018Oh, yeah babe, I was investigating your newly manufactured past: did you know that you\u2019re a gothy ditz? Pret-ty weird.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Peter did not frown. Nor cry. Nor express any kind of animosity towards the soulcrushing, girlfriend-alienating existential rewriting. Instead, she lightly smirked, said \u201cHuh, looks like you didn\u2019t change at all,\u201d with a giggle, and tossed the phone on her bed as she minced over to the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's mouth hung open. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter peeked at the flabbergasted goth from over her shoulder. \u201cI mean, c\u2019mon, J. That little spiel in the comments is, like, <i>classic</i> you.\u201d Lightly tittering at her diss, she pulled a mess of straps and cups out of her closet. \u201cHey, we\u2019ll get extra points for dressing up, right?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, she waved the fabric monstrosity at the flabbergasted Judy. \u201cDo you think this\u2019d fit you? <font class=\"size15\" style=\"\">Second thought, it might be a little big...</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Literally, with a heavy stomp, and idiomatically, with a loud, \u201cARE YOU <i>FUCKING <b>KIDDING </b></i>ME?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter jerked back at the shout, bumping her head against the closet door. \u201cOwwww,\u201d she whined, rubbing a hand against the growing bump on her skull. \u201cWhat\u2019s your fuckin\u2019 damage, Jay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-my <i>damage</i>?

God, did Pete even know that she planted her hands on her hips, or did that stupid board game\u2026 ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her boyfriend\u2019s defiant blue eyes. Eyes that were normally a different color, and that she had to look <i>up</i> at, and were a lot <i>smarter</i> \u2014 whatever. This required a delicate touch, precision in word choice and an easy manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid the fuckin\u2019 karaoke machine make you <i>stupid</i> or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t it. Another try, maybe\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Cuz you\u2019re, like, one-hundred-percent bimbo right now, <i>seriously</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegret surged in Judy, but Peter\u2019s feminine scoff of outrage quelled it a tetch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, <i>I\u2019m</i> the bimbo, when <i>you\u2019re</i> the one saying \u2018like,\u2019 y\u2019 ditz.\u201d Peter waved her hand dismissively in a manner that was so feminine that Judy was half-sure it was on purpose. \u201cGawd, you\u2019re acting like Lindsey right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy raised her hands in supplication. \u201cIt\u2019s <i>this</i> shit! When the hell did you start hating Lindsey?! <i>Three days</i> ago you said she was <i>cool</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter crossed her arms, pushing her impressive prow up and out. \u201cSometimes, perspectives change, Jay. Like I said earlier, the moment Eugene got, uh, girled \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about <i>you</i>, Pete?\u201d Judy cut in, tears starting to pool in her eyes. \u201cDo you think that <i>maybe</i> when you got zapped into Daria with F-cups, the Parcheesi board planted some kinda preppy-hatred in your brain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that <b>I\u2019d</b> be the first one to know, Ju.\u201d Peter sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy set her face into a line. \u201cFine. Close your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy shoul\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCLOSE YOUR GODDAMN EYES, TZERIMOS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jesus.\u201d Peter did so. There was a quizzical bent to her frown as she strained her ears, listening for clues to Judy\u2019s ploy. Rustling fabric was the loudest noise: was she doing something with the bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, who the <i>hell</i> did Judy think she was? She just got like this sometimes, all concern-y and hysteric-y; it was a bit much sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker or anything: Peter wasn\u2019t going to find a better <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">BFF</span> GF anywhere, but it was just so <i>frustrating</i> sometimes. Sure, she cried a bit at the start: losing a foot and, like, a ba<i>jillion</i> muscly pounds was pretty tough for a girl to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she adjusted pretty well, after the \u2018Save and Quit\u2019 nonsense. It could be way worse after all. She could have Eugene\u2019s language problem, or \u2014 Peter\u2019s frown twisted itself into a smug smirk \u2014 she could be a flatty like Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(God, she\u2019d rather jump out the second-floor window.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Juddyyyyyyy</i>, can I <i>look</i> yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Can you <i>hear</i> yourself? I swear <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">two hours ago, you\u2019d be kicking yourself</font>...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter rolled her eyes, though it didn\u2019t really work through her eyelids. Was it pick-on-Peter hour or something? If she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d say that Geno was dissing her in Korean! She\u2019d get back at Little-Miss-No-Tits, though, by kicking her flat <i>ass</i> in karaoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should try to get back at Jay: though nothing big, the girl had been through a lot. Plus, her boyfriend was wearing the whole goth shtick <i>way</i> better \u2014 wait, was Judy <i>jealous</i>? A sly smile lit up Peter\u2019s face: she could work with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Alright, I\u2019m ready</font>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet Ju out of the room, get one of the outfits in the closet \u2014 there was some <i>spicy</i> stuff in there \u2014 and get some pics; nothing studio-quality, but it\u2019d be enough. There had to be some guys in Gunners Butte still on dating apps, right? It\u2019d be easy-goddamn-peasy to\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPETER, OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter opened her eyes with a dramatic roll, leveling her gaze on Judy to give her the business\u2026 but instead, she had to bite back a snort. Judy Ross stood in front of her, stripped down to her skivvies; a totally embarrassing granny bra, embroidered with pink fabric flowers and a pair of nude-colored panties that made her look like a Hot-Topic Barbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaddya think, Petey?\u201d Judy asked, twirling her hips to showcase the fashion disaster. \u201cGimme your first impression: don\u2019t hold back on my account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou -<i>snrk</i>- look like a Victoria\u2019s Secret retiree, Ju!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!

The goth put her hands on the pipsqueak\u2019s pale shoulders and locked her gaze on hers. \u201cWhen, in our going-on-two-years of dating have you <i>ever</i> cared about how fashion-forward my <i>underwear</i> was?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as Eugene went to type in 'More' on the game's small keyboard, the machine bleeped and immediately produced more options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I wonder what 'Pets' are?\" Lindsey held back a dirty thought and a giggle of her in latex and a whip and some KILLER heels while Judy and Eugene crawled around on the floor. Or at least Eugene's face on Peter's body, because while she liked Eugene the geek needed to lose some SERIOUS weight before he could fully be part of any idle fantasies. Especially if she was going in THAT particular direction. The mental image of Judy, however, was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's like a pet store? Oh, maybe it's like that Nintendogs game! I played that when I was little, it was pretty fun!\" Judy said with sudden glee, the happy memory flooding back in a wave of nostalgia. It had been in Sunday School and during a particularly boring day, in between the 'Praise Jebus!' and the other highly conservative rhetoric that implied she would burst into flames for even the slightest offense, a friend had let her play the cute little game. She had liked it so much that she had, somehow, talked her mom and dad into getting it for her. It had been the ONE video game she had ever owned, and one of the few she'd ever played before she'd escaped to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the other one say? ...What the hell is 'Moderation'?\" Peter squinted at the tiny red screen and scratched his head, \"What, like 'drinking in moderation' or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...is a pretty weird suggestion\" Lindsey agreed, biting a already short nail as she tried to think of what it might have meant. It could have been what Peter had said...Or forum moderation? Twitch stream? She was suddenly reminded of that silly eGirl stream moderation game that had gotten canned recently. It could have been that, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can always see if it has anything else if no one feels like trying out these?\" Eugene offered, hands poised over the keyboard. To be honest he wasn't really interested in the 'Pets' one or trying to figure out what 'Moderation' meant. He really just wanted to go back to the Sci-Fi and Fantasy choices, but he couldn't play the game alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way</span></div></div>",

Okay, here we go...\" Eugene gave Peter a conciliatory look and began typing in the command on the game machine's keyboard, pressing 'Enter', and then leaning back in surprise as two large black buttons popped out of the top of the machine's plastic casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE GAME MODE\" The machine's synthetic voice blared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" Lindsey said, leaning in to look at the intriguingly unique device and the two new buttons that read 'Traditional' and 'Immersive' on the tops in chipped white stenciling, \"I, um, guess these like determine what mode we play in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously. Oof!\" Peter said with a scoff, earning him a elbow to the ribs from the big breasted girl sitting next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything telling us what each one is like, Gene?\" Judy asked, giving Peter a 'you earned that' stare before putting on her (drilled into her since birth) pleasant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby dork looked across the machine and then at the game's box, \"No, just the rules from before. Traditional sounds like a normal board game and Immersive sounds like a tabletop game or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do think that would be easier for me and Pete...But I also really, really wanna see some cute puppies!\" Judy's green eyes were sparkling in anticipation. She LOVED dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's vote again?

Why not do something nice for their friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Eugene reached over and depressed the large black button, feeling resistance from the spring underneath as he pushed it back down into the compartment it had popped out of. There was a loud CLICK as the button locked in place, and then the machine began making a loud 'honey the dryer is off-balance' clattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. You break it, Geno?\" Peter said, only slightly concerned. If it didn't work out, well, Madden was calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know\" Eugene said as he looked around the device in confusion, \"Nothing...looks broke? Maybe it's just old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, you guys smell that?\" Judy's nose scrunched up as a burning smell filled the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Peter pinched his nose shut while Eugene covered his own with the disposable face mask he'd worn in the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...That smells like, um, printer resin\" Lindsey said, taking a deep sniff and seeming rather unaffected by the sharp scent, \"Oooh, I wonder if this thing is a 3D printer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, those didn't show up until a few years ago, right? This ting looks like it's from the 1980s, at the latest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah Petes, 3D printers have been around for, like, aaaages! But they were also SUPER big! I bet this thing is TOTALLY printing out our game pieces! Or, like, something\" Lindsey informed the confused looking jock. In fact she, herself, had one but it was currently boxed up in the Sorority storage room. There really wasn't any room for it in her new tiny dorm room (which the CompSci major thought was cozy, but she definitely missed the GURL house's less utilitarian aesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the clattering stopped and a tray full of small, primary colored plastic figures popped out of the side of the game machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE AVATAR\" The game intoned, and the four students leaned in to see...</span></div></div>",

PRESS ENTER TO BEGIN GAME\" The game ordered, the tiny screen and red bulbs blinking in an almost impatient manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all good?\" Eugene asked, receiving three nods in agreement, \"Okay, just a second...\" Eugene's fingers poked carefully across the tiny keyboard as he entered in the information, and with a mighty flourish, pressed enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely had time to yell as color drained from his vision and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was the first thing that indicated that Eugene was conscious again, a barrage of...everything assaulting his nose, as he flailed around wildly as he suddenly became HYPER-aware of his body and the immediate surroundings. His eyes snapped open and he let out a low groan at the brightness, flicking his tail in annoyance as-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. What tail!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene let out a yowl as he turned to see a long black tail rising out of his horizontally aligned back, swishing this way and that, twitching and wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no' He chittered to himself, looking at the rest of his elongated body and suddenly aware he was standing on all fours. There was a movement nearby and he whipped his head towards it...And there, in a pane of holed plastic was the dull reflection of the face of a black cat, pointy ears, wide green eyes and whiskers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'M A CAT!' He wailed, and his tiny fanged mouth opened as a long, deep growl escaped from his throat. Then something BIG passed by the plastic, and Eugene scrambled backwards, flopping over himself in terror as the massive face of an older woman looked in on him, concern in her eyes. Her overly-lipsticked mouth was saying something...But it was all garbled to Eugene. He got the distinct impression that the woman was talking to him...But maybe since he was now an animal, he couldn't understand? That was a common misconception that many pet owners often did, assuming their pets could understand them when in reality it was nothing but gibberish. At best most pets could put together a handful of words associated with actions and positive reinforcement, but there was no real possible way to overcome the language barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, how...How do I know that? I've never owned a pet!' Eugene said, looking around the small cage in confusion. But before he could get any sort of answer, the cage door was opening and a huge hand was curling in, fingers the size of logs grabbing hold of him and beginning to pull him out. As he struggled, he caught a glance at five...wait, NINE horizontal stripes on his left front leg, radiating up from his...paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait WAIT WAIT!' Eugene cried out in a pitiful meow, and he flexed his claws as he struggled to find purchase on anything...But out he came into a MUCH louder, brighter world. The giant woman man-handled his furry body and tucked him securely in her arms, stroking and cooing strange words at him as Eugene was transported from the small, noisy holding area in what was either the back room of a pet store, or possibly a animal shelter...And just as quickly deposited him into a larger room that was filled with seven other cats and a hoard of toys, cat trees, litter boxes and food and water bowls. Beyond a huge glass wall were dozens other humans, some with children, some young students like himself, a couple of old folks. And all of them were staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cat, an attractive orange and white tabby sidled up next to him and sat on all fours, whisking a tail around his shaking legs as it leaned it's head in for a nuzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eugene\" A familiar, but decidedly FEMALE voice said softly, and Eugene turned his head towards the other cats, ears laying back against his streamlined head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! You're...You're the girl from the store! How-why-what...who\" Eugene babbled, and he was distinctly aware that the people on the other side of the wall were pointing at the two of them and talking excitedly among each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me! Before you flip out, let me explain what is happening. You're indeed inside the video game! Pretty cool, huh? And you're a cat so that's, like, extra cool!\" The girl-cat playfully batted at Eugene, who leaned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so dramatic. It's easy! Like SUPER easy, easier than the other games you could have chosen! Right now you're in...\" The tabby paused her chattering for a moment and looked around at the ceiling in thought, \"Let's just call this the tutorial, okay? All you gotta do right now is get adopted to get out into the main take world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No! Change me-\" Eugene began yowling, but then a thought crossed his mind, \"W-wait, where are my friends!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'm giving them the same spiel right now. Lindsey is on the other side of the store in the bird section, Judy is in the dog section, and Peter is in one of the fish tanks. You get bonus points if you can all get adopted together but...\" The orange tabby gave the cat equivalent of a smirk and turned away, brushing her long, floofy tail across Eugene's face, sending his new extra sensors in his whiskers sparking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...How do we out? How do we change back!?\" Eugene attempted to press the very strange and probably magical (or possibly technological) entity for more information, but she let out a chuckle that sounded like a very loud purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they say about curiosity and cats, sweetheart. I don't do spoilers, but here's tip: Try not to be the last one here by closing time. And when or if you get out of here, you'll know the game objectives when you hear them. Complete those and you rejoin the human race.\" And with that the human qualities of the cat disappeared, and the orange tabby scampered off, darting towards one of the many bowls of food on the other side of the cat filled area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey WAIT' Eugene called out, but there was something in him that said whoever the girl was...Or WHATEVER she was, was gone and nothing but a cat remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked up at the wall of humans, which had turned their gazes towards other, more active and 'cute' cats roaming the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck\"</span></div></div>",

Judy REALLY wanted to see if the game was like Nintendogs...But honestly at this point the amount of technical mumbo-jumbo and ALL of the different options the game was providing was starting to get a little too much, even for the normally patient goth. She stifled a companion yawn to Peter's own, if this didn't start going anywhere soon, well, there were other things that the couple could be doing. It was fun trying to ship Lindsey and Eugene but at this point she felt like they could possibly just leave and let the two be nerds over the analog monstrosity that was sitting on the common room's table. But she didn't want to give up just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene, did the rules say anything about this 'Hybrid Mode'?\" Judy offered, trying to be helpful before her patience ran out, pointing a purple tipped fingernail towards the equally huge box the game had come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight general studies focused nerd followed Judy's finger and gaze over to the box, and after a moment of just staring at it, suddenly realized what his top-heavy friend was trying to get him to do. \"Uh, let me check\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box itself was largely empty and blank, the only part that seemed to have any print was the underside of the box lid where the rules for the Traditional and Immersive modes were printed...But near the bottom, past the scratched and faded part was a tiny section that Eugene wasn't entirely sure had been there when he had first opened the box. But nevertheless he flipped the box over into the light, squinted his eyes and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hybrid Mode: Some game types come with a Hybrid Mode option. Hybrid Mode combines aspects of both Traditional and Immersive modes together. Hybrid Mode requires a minimum of two players, to a maximum of four. Players will be placed on different teams and must work together in order to advance through the game.\" Eugene squinted as the next part was damaged by fading and a small strip of torn cardboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that while the machine itself looked more or less pristine, the box had sustained so much wear and tear. Especially, if the woman at the store was to be believed (Eugene had summarized most of the encounter), that the game had simply been 'waiting many years for someone like him to come along'. And mice didn't cause this kind of damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment he pieced together as much as he could from the damaged text before speaking again, \"Uh, it says something along the lines of 'all players will be immersed but still require dice rolls to move through the scenario and by completing actions and challenges. Everything else in that section is missing...But I guess each Hybrid Mode will also have it's own special rules pertaining to the scenario? I just have to type in 'Hybrid Mode Start' instead of pressing one of those buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we not just play? Seriously? What is with all these rules and modes? Whatever happened to just 'roll the dice and get to the end first'?\" Peter said as pulled himself to his feet, \"Geno, I really was interested in this, but I don't think game night is supposed to take thirty minutes of reading the rules. I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned to walk away and Judy gave Eugene a sympathetic look as she too rose from the couch and followed her boyfriend, \"Sorry Eugene but...This sounded like a lot more fun than just listening to you read off a bunch of technical rule stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait, guys c'mon don't go! Let's just, uh...\" Eugene's worries shifted from the game's suspicious damage and obfuscation of the rules to keeping the couple from bailing. He jumped out of his chair and chased after the muscled athlete and the big breasted goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lindsey simply watched the exchange and, in an effort to stave off her own boredom, cure her own curiosity about the machine AND help Eugene from suffering from a social embarassment, slid quietly into Eugene's former spot and quickly typed in 'Hybrid Mode 4 Player Start' on the game's tiny keypad and pressed Enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine let loose a loud metallic CLANG and began buzzing, and Lindsey felt her head start to become woozy as the world began to spin. NEar the common room doors Judy, Peter and Eugene began to sway on their feet, Judy leaning into Peter, who slid up against the wall, and Eugene who was trying to prop himself up in the door way and failing. As darkness and buzzing over-took Lindsey, she watched as the other three students slowly collapsed to the floor. And then there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy snapped open her eyes in alarm and pulled herself off of Peter, who was shaking his head and groaning groggily. Judy's own head was swimming, feeling not unlike the pressure of a migraine, but was Eugene heaved his significant bulk back onto his feet, the top heavy goth suddenly realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the common room, they were in a seemingly empty black room. The walls, lights, doors, the furniture, all of it was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod!\" She whispered, whipping her head in every direction and fighting off the urge to be sick. But the wave of discomfort was already fading in her head, and she spied Lindsey splayed out spread eagle on the floor behind them. Judy hustled over, suddenly VERY afraid of just dropping off into nothing like the scene in Indiana Jones &amp; The Last Crusade with the optical illusion bridge near the end of the film, but she made it to the rainbow haired girl's location and let loose a sigh of relief as she was still breathing, half-lidded eyes staring up into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a bad idea\" Lindsey muttered as Judy's fierce-but-in-a-cute-way face filled her vision. Her friend's brown eyes scrunched in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was a bad idea? Lindz, where are we!?\" Judy said, helping the stickly girl up into a sitting position and receiving a guilty, sheepish grin in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, kinda started the game. Don't be mad! I just, like, really wanted us to have a game night as you guys were like, totally bailing!\" As her senses returned so did Lindsey's valley girl accent and over-use of the word 'like'. She hoped she hadn't lapsed out of it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's just typical, leave it to Legally Blonde to get us all in trouble!\" Peter fumed as he stomped over, Eugene in tow, \"Where the FUCK are we? Where's the dorm!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey had nothing to offer but a shrug, but before the athlete's reddening face could explode in further anger, there was a synthetic chime as several larger doorways appeared...Along with a curvy woman of Mediterranean descent walking out of the darkness between each white void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're...You're the girl from the shop!\" Eugene cried out in realization. And it really was, only she looked MUCH prettier than in the soft-blue work polo and khakis he'd seen her in before. She had rocked those but now she was wearing a deep green dress that shimmered and shined from some unknown light, looking like someone had managed to turn a jade jewel into a knockout piece of curve hugging fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vteiocY.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/vteiocY.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Eugene. And thank you, Lindsey, I was afraid that nothing was actually going to happen! You go girl!\" The woman gave Lindsey a thumbs up and a wink, which the rainblonde couldn't help but return with a small, nervous smile as the woman strutted forward until she stood in the middle of the small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make this quick and simple, okay? You're all IN the game, which is magical. You chose the Hybrid Mode, but...this particular game doesn't let you pick your avatars or tokens. See those white doors?\" The woman turned and pointed a green-tipped nail towards the gaping white voids, \"When I leave, you're going to have to walk through one of them. Whichever one you chose is the game you get, and you'll be assigned random roles. Two of you will roll for progression and get actions and challenge cards at random, the other two will have to complete objectives to advance, but you're all on the same team. At least to start with, things can happen, who knows where it will go? Finish the game and you get to go back to your dorm. Or you can stay here if you like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so if we don't play...We're trapped here forever\" Judy's eyes went wide in fear as she realized the predicament they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said, honey\" The woman gave Judy a shrug before turning back and focusing on Eugene, \"And when, or if you get out, come see me at the shop. All of you. And bring the game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then wink another wink at Lindsey, the woman disappeared in a flash of green sparkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\" Peter said, breaking the stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks...looks like we've got to play\" Eugene said after moment of collecting his thoughts, waddling past the group to inspect the small forest of what the woman had called 'doors'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But which one do we choose?\" He whispered.</span></div></div>",

I'm NOT walking towards ANY light!\" Peter roared, angry that not only had his night been ruined by all of this...Whatever the HELL this was, but he was now trapped in an endless void, taking very little comfort that he was with his girlfriend and the two nerds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way out! You, like, heard the lady! This is all magic!\" Lindsey said, rising to her feet, only to let out a small 'eep!' when Peter charged on her, shoving a finger into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare say a word, Lindsey! This is YOUR FAULT!\" Peter's face grew even redder as Judy attempted to pull her boyfriend away from the wide-eyed blonde, even if she was feeling particularly angry towards the other girl at the moment. Peter was entirely right...But getting angry wouldn't solve anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, babe just, let's go over here for a minute, okay\" She said, sliding her hand into Peter's and pulling the athlete, who was still staring daggers at Lindsey, away from the geeks of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Lindsey whimpered. She was feeling awful, if she knew this was what was going to happen, she would have never started the game! And now Peter hated her (which was...okay since Peter was a bit of a jerk to her anyway) and Judy was pissed (which was what she regretted most, as Lindsey considered Judy to be a really good and supportive friend, even if she was a bit...weirdly sheltered for her goth getup). She turned towards Eugene, expecting something similar to whack her in the face...Only to find the other freshman studiously inspecting the white portals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene?\" She said, taking a cautious step closer to the her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're right...But at the same time, this is really cool\" The chubby young adult said with a slight smile. Sure, this was crazy and scary and weird...But he was far more thrilled with the aspect of being IN a video game, even if it was magic. He was GOOD at video games, and so was Lindsey. Outside of carrying Peter and Judy, and more Judy because while Peter really only played sports game the athlete wasn't...too terrible at shooters like the older (and superior) Halo games whenever the two boys would hang out in Eugene's room...This might not be as scary as it had first appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad?\" Lindsey's eyes glittered with what she, well, hoped was not false hope that at least someone here in this fascinating, terrifying place wasn't going to make her feel like shit for her attempt at saving Game Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think this was the BEST thing to do...But you had no way of knowing, right? None of us did. And, uh, it's sort of partially my fault for buying the game in the first place right? So me and you, I guess that, uh, make us <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">partners in crime</font>\" Eugene realized the awkward implication of what he was saying as he said it, his voice dropping off to nearly nothing a moment too late as Lindsey's face split into a more familiar wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GENIE!\" Lindsey cheered, wrapping her arms around her fellow fat freshman and pulling him into a surprisingly tight hug, completely abandoning the teasing she had been doing earlier because she liked making boys uncomfortable, \"Thank you! This makes me feel, like, SO much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhsureanythingyou'rewelcome\" Eugene mumbled, looking away as he both enjoyed and desperately wanted the moment to end before he ruined it with an awkward boner or something. After a few more seconds the blonde released him, and gave him a soft tap on the shoulder, smiling all the while. Judy and Peter, both of them looking no less annoyed or angry, finally returned to join the two in front of the various 'doors', as the strange woman had called them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that crazy bitch said the only way out is by beating the game, right?\" Peter gave Lindsey one final glare before turning his gaze to the white portals, \"So let's just pick one and get this over with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but which one do we choose? They don't have names...\" Eugene said, scratching his head. This seemed like some kind of level selection...Though with everything blank there was no telling if these were all connected levels or if each one was it's own separate scenario to play through. And what about difficulty? Did the game even have that? Would they end up in some kind of animal themed version of, like Dark Souls or would it be more like Animal Crossing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we'll just have to pick one. Since impulsive bad decisions seem to be today's theme\" Judy said, with a pointed look at Lindsey, who looked away from the passive-aggressive girl, \"I'm just picking this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before anyone could stop her, Judy took a deep breath and marched into the nearest portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUDY, WAIT!\" Peter yelled, darting after her and vanishing, like his girlfriend, into the white nothingness. Eugene and Lindsey looked at each other in surprise, and then then looked away as the other doors all vanished in a blink of light, leaving only one entrance into the game world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I was right\" Eugene muttered, and to Lindsey's questioning look, quickly explained his theory on the doors being some kind of scenario selection screen. The other gamer nodded in understanding and, after steeling herself, held out a hand towards Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared...But it's the only way we get out of here. Let's do this Eugene!\" The rainblonde said, as she mustered up the rest of her courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, despite the fact that he too was nervous and scared (though not by the potentiality of death but of holding Lindsey's hand) took the outstretched limb with his own, felt Lindsey give it a squeeze, and together they walked into the light. They vanished from the strange black void and rematerialized within a empty, very new looking house that was filled with cardboard boxes, no furniture, and that there was a moving truck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the four friends spotted each other once more, and Eugene realized that...</span></div></div>",

Instead he was standing in the foyer of clearly new house. It was small, but comfortably so. There was a flight of stairs that headed upwards to a small landing with three doors, while openings on either side led to two empty rooms, one of which connected to what looked like the kitchen. There was a partially open door at the end of the foyer, a bathroom, and there appeared to be a door on the stairs as well, though it was closed and either led to a closet or a basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the house were bright white, unadorned by any paint or pictures, and indeed the entire house was empty save for a forest of cardboard boxes of varying size that had 'Kitchen', 'Living Room', 'Bathroom', etc written on them with heavy black marker. There was a small couch that looked slightly threadbare sitting in what he could only assume was supposed to be the living room, looking more like it had simply been tossed in there instead of carefully placed. Out of one of the windows he could see that wherever this house was, it was in a suburb or possibly a gated community, and there was a large moving truck parked in front of what looked like a two car garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty decent house, much better than his cramped dorm room or the tiny apartment that Eugene and his mom had shared for years before he'd gone off to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as his visual inspection of the local area had ended, Eugene was aware of two furry creatures in front of him. One was a almost glowingly gold-furred retriever, dark brown eyes wide, ears raised and it's dark nose wet as it's head twisted and turned in every direction as the dog took in the new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the dog was a large, almost fat black and white catthat was in an equal state of observation and distress, it's smaller ears pressed flat and back agaisnt it's skull, tiny fanged mouth agape and it's deep green eyes wider than Eugene had thought possibly as a cable-like tail twitched and wiggled as the cat was clearly attempting to not be overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth animals had an equal chance of being either Peter, Judy or Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady did say things would be randomized...\" Eugene said, but then his own eyes went wide and a hand flew to his mouth as he discovered that he was...</span></div></div>",

He slowly pulled his hand away from his mouth and stared, still wide-eyed, at how small and thin his hand was, the longer, pink-tipped nails topping his tanned fingers...One of which had a god ring wrapped around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze traveled up his slender arm... And the he noticed the long brown hair draping into his vision, something he hadn't noticed at first because his original hair had been getting long since all the barbers had closed down because of the lockdown. He pulled at the hair with his new hands, noticing that it was long, silky, and fell past his shoulders. Someting pulled at his earlobes and he released his hair, reaching up to feel a large hoop earring hanging from his ear. The feeling was, on top of everything else, extremely weird. He'd never had his ears pierced, for one he had no interest...And also because his mom had never let him. Eugene followed the waterfall of hair downwards and spotted, for the first time, the small canyon of cleavage that stuck out from his chest, covered in a light blue shirt, some kind of blouse. He gave his breasts a exploratory poke and was somewhat surprised they didn't, well, jiggle like he thought they would. Over-all he probably would have guessed that his new breasts were decidedly average, and something about that made him a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis exploration traveled further south, past wide hips  that were wrapped in white, but comfortable pants, the...void between his legs, and down to the sneakers her wore over feet that had to be at LEAST half the size, if not smaller, than his original feet had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding!\" Another feminine voice said from behind him, and Eugene spun on his heels, his hair flying crazily behind him, to spot a stunning woman with large full lips, wide brown eyes, and flowing blonde hair that was a similar length to Eugene's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was slightly taller, had a deeper tan, and her gray dress was more revealing, her larger breasts far more on display than her own conservative outfit was. Her hips were not as wide as Eugene's felt, but her legs were bare as they stuck out the bottom of the dress and Eugene could help but stare at how perfectly sculpted they were. At the end of those perfect ambulatory limbs were a tiny pair of feet in open-faced sandals that matched her dress perfectly. But as the blonde checked Eugene out...the former male couldn't help but notice a similar gold band on the other woman's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4scXP68.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/4scXP68.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere...Were they married!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm Eugene!\" He sputtered through lips that were definitely plumper than they'd ever felt before, \"Who...Who are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes went wide in surprise before she said...</span></div></div>",

The two women turned their gazes downward towards the agitated dog and distressed cat. \"OMG! That means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?...Judy?\" Eugene called out cautiously, and the two animals ears perked up, the dog barking and the cat letting out a long, pitiful yowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the transformed group could do anything else, there was a loud rapping on the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Eugene swore in his soft new voice, feeling...compelled to turn and open the door, trying to ignore the weird feeling at how much larger the door knob felt, even though his hands were marginally smaller than they had been originally. The door opened with only the slightest of creaks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And in barged a gorgeous looking woman in a flowy, flower-printed sundress, holding a large glass dish, her stylish heels clip-clopping loudly on the hardwood floors as she barged into the home that Eugene apparently now shared with Lindsey and their...pets? Eugene didn't want to think of Peter and Judy like that but at the same time something in his brain was already thinking of his two friends as property rather than individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello! Welcome to the neighborhood! Congratulations on the engagement, by the by, you girls are just going to make the CUTEST little family! I just wanted to be the first to say hi and I brought you guys a cassarole! Oh you have just the CUTEST little animals!\" The woman was a flurry of energy and activity, practically shoving the glass dish into Lindsey's hands and giving Eugene a HUGE huge before crouching to her knees and cooing over the suddenly enraptured Judy and Peter (whichever animal was which).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Was all Eugene could think to say as Lindsey looked around awkwardly, the dish full of food hanging heavily in her hands. Eugene pointed towards the kitchen and the former sorority girl took an uneasy step into the rest of the house, holding the cassarole dish in her hands as if it would break at the slightest provocation, her own heels clipping through the empty rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is going to be SO much fun!\" The woman said as she finished rubbing her hands all over PEter and Judy before returning to just above Eugene's new eye level and looking him straight in the face. That was when realization kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...YOU'RE THE GIRL THAT SOLD ME THE GAME!\" He cried out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Came Lindsey's voice from the kitchen as there was a suddenly heavy clonk and FURIOUS clipping of heels as she sprinted back to the home's small foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever boy, or, well, girl I suppose\" The woman's green eyes sparkled with mischief, holding up a finger that suddenly silenced the cries that were about to come out of both Lindsey's and Eugene's lipstick encrusted mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, we don't want to drag things on more than we need. I'm just here to explain what Hybrid Mode is now that things have...solidified\" The woman swished her sundress and giggled, \"And I have to say this is the BEST outfit I've worn so far, it feels so...free and cute! But maybe it's just because you girls look so cute together, it's infectious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a worried look as Lindsey palmed her slender neck, silently mouthing words. Eugene just looked at his crush and then at the rings on their fingers. He had yet to see what he looked like but if Lindsey was any indication in terms of looks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, so yes. Hybrid Mode is a lot like Immersion Mode...Which I know you guys haven't played. You inhabit the world and body of your characters...And complete challenges as you're prompted. But instead of fully being tied to prompts, which will be pretty obvious, you'll also have to make dice rolls for some choices to decide things like 'how many do you get' or something similar. Different responses might create new situations. Otherwise you shouldn't find things too different from your old lives. You won't have to worry about COVID, though, so that's a plus, right?\" The woman pointed to the matching necklaces that were hanging from Lindsey's and Eugene's necks; gold chains that were connected to tiny, ruby colored six sided dice. \"And for our furry friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman crouched again and scratched behind the dog's ear with her long nails, causing...whoever the dog was to thump a leg against the floor in pleasure. The woman did the same with the cat, only under their chin, the cat starting to purr loudly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our furry friends will be playing their own game in full Immersion mode. No rolling the dice, they can only respond to the prompts that only they can see. And no, I'm not going to tell you who is who, half the fun is figuring it out on your own. Since they're animals, THEY get the five lives that you'd usually get in Immersion Mode, while you two cuties only get the one, much like normal life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Eugene's eyes widened in surprise, and the dog and cat ceased their pleasure responses as stared at the strange woman, mouths open, the dog's tongue lolling out while the cat's tail twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rose again and gave Eugene and Lindsey, who were still 'muted' another winning smile. \"Well that's really all I was here to do, welcome you to the neighborhood and explain things a bit. Sorry about the lack of information on the game box, things are kept vague for bait purposes to get people to play. After all, wouldn't be much fun if we just SAID 'hey you're gonna get transformed if you play' and then no one actually played, right? Anyway You all get prompts, you and Lindsey get to roll for certain ones to determine severity, intensity, etc\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman minced to the open door and struck a pose, \"Oh, and when I close this door, I leave the game so DON'T try looking around for me. Oh, and just for added ease...Eugene, you're gonna be 'Jean' or 'Jeanie' as Lindsey is so fond of calling you, until you guys win\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked at himself and then at Lindsey, who gave a quick shrug, the best she could do while 'muted'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and win conditions change as you play along. Other than that, ta-ta! Good luck, and welcome to the neighborhood! Enjoy the cassarole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman pulled the door closed with a slam and Jean felt her voice return, and heard Lindsey's as the blonde began shrieking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHMYGAWDOHMYGAWDOHMYGAWD!\" Lindsey's voice was high and shrill with panic, and Jean felt anxiety welling up inside her endowed chest as she suddenly realized she could NOT refer to herself as 'Eugene anymore. Meanwhile the dog and the cat began howling and yowling on the floor. the noise was too much for Jean's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BE QUIET!\" She screamed, stamping a tiny foot on the floor. The dog's tail tucked itself between two bowed legs while the cat's ears went flat, and Lindsey looked at her with glistening eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jeanie, what, what are we gonna do!? I...We...Peter and Judy...\" Lindsey began blubbering. Part of her was, well, THRILLED at the prospect of FINALLY being in a relationship with another pretty girl...But that girl was Je...Jeani...Ugh, Jeanie! A guy in a girl's body! And her friends were their pets! And, like, who even was she in the game now!? And how did they change back!? It sounded like...like...They had to live thier entire lives like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before any answers or explanations could be given, there was another knock on the door. Lindsey's eyes went wide, maybe the strange woman had come back! Maybe she'd take pity and let them go back to normal! But as the door opened, her eyes fell as instead of the pretty woman there was instead a fat, balding man flanked by two dull eyed looking guys, with blue shirts that read 'Speedy Movers' emblazoned upon them in red. Beyond was a moving truck, where two more guys were standing, their arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning miss. Is this 3112 Elm Avenue?\" The fat man said, wiping a sweaty sheen from his bald pate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Lindsey stammered before spying the numbers on the mailbox at the end of the small path, \"Y-yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Slight problem though, your furniture was a little bit larger than we expected so...Gonna take us a couple trips to get it here. Unfortunately means we're gonna have to charge you a bit more, unless you'd like to move it yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man froze as he finished speaking, and in fact it seemed as if this whole new, crazy world had indeed frozen. Lindsey turned and started wide-eyed at Jean, who gave her a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is a prompt?\" She offered to Lindsey. It was really the only thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what...What do I like, say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell them what we want? I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I'm kinda on the verge of having a freak out here. I'm a chick! Just...I really don't want to try hauling around furniture like this!\" Jean splayed her arms out and there wasn't a trace of any sort of muscle development. And Lindsey couldn't really blame Jean for feeling like that. But if this was...If this was life now and they were new homeowners with who knows what other debt saddled over their pretty gay heads, maybe they needed to be frugal for now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if this was, like, some sort of speech check in an RPG? Ugh this was TOTALLY hard! How could they play a game without knowing all the mechanics!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the frozen...characters? NPCs? Whatever the movers were and, after taking a deep breath and trying not to be weirded out by how heavy her chest felt now, with the huge rack hanging off it, summoned the most authorative voice she could and said...</span></div></div>",

Honestly I thought we'd be playing by now, not doing all this...talking and geeking out over some hunk of plastic\" Peter said as he stretched, \"I think I'm just gonna go back to my room for a little bit\". With a yawn the towering mass of sentient muscle turned and made his way towards the common room's exit, heading for the stairwell that would take him up to the fifth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have taken the elevator, but while he was capable of using one, Peter had once been stuck in an elevator when he was eight years old and it had left in him a distinct desire to avoid getting in one whenever possible. Plus stairs were better exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww!\" Lindsey whined, putting on a fake pout. Honestly she didn't really fully mind if Peter left, he was okay for a jock but he was still a jock and was thus ultimately self-serving and prone to being driven by less than intellectually stimulating actions. Besides, the game didn't specify that it need all FOUR players to play...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter Tzimeros, you get back here right this instant!\" Judy yelled, pulling herself off the couch and racing after her boyfriend, her face twisting in anger. This was NOT the plan! They were trying to get Eugene out of his shell and get him and Lindsey to hook up! But once again the big lummox that she was unfortunately pretty fond of was messing things up with his short attention span.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately, he was also pretty tall and thus, unintentionally about three times as fast as her short frame. He could already hear his feet slapping against the stairs before she'd even cleared the common room's doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PETER!\" She yelled again, her voice echoing up the stairwell followd by a cessation of steps and a low groan of annoyance. \"You stay right there, buster!\" She commanded as the short but stacked goth began ascending the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eugene and Lindsey shared a look as they were left alone in the common room. Which suited Lindsey just fine, as fun as it was to have an audience, sometimes it was more fun to...play alone. She got up from her bean bag and stretched her arms with cat-like grace, stretching her arms upwards to the ceiling, bending her back just enough that her (sadly) smaller breasts stuck out and her butt pressed against the curvature of her yoga pants. She forced out a yawn and, through a mostly closed eye, glanced at Eugene as the fat geek's widening eyes locked on her and his face turning a shade of red. She let the stretch linger a moment longer before letting her arms fall back to her sides with a sigh, opening her eyes fully as Eugene was a second too late in averting his gaze and trying to look interested in the machine once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simulated a shiver, rubbing her slender bare arms and make a cute 'brrr!' noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must, like, be under the air vent or something. Can I come sit by you, Genie?\" The rainbow haired blonde said, giving Eugene a puppy dog face and then trying not to smile as he tried burying his head deeper into the game's keyboard and mumbling what sounded like a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Lindsey giggled, and she pulled her bean bag over next to her current toy's legs and slowly, deliberately lowered herself into it, her ass coming within an inch of Eugene's face, who was desperately, DESPERATELY trying to not let the stiffy in his pants show through as he squeezed his legs a little tighter together. But then his attempt failed entirely as the sorority girl LEANED against him, her head rest against his thigh as a skinny arm curled itself around one of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried not to gulp cartoonishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, how many games do you think this thing has?\" Lindsey said, turning her attention away from the boy she had been torturing and back to the strange, retro-looking dome of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I, uh don't know it, uhhhh, I mean\" Eugene sputtered as he tried to re-focus him mind on something other than the fact that his crush (who just so happened to be pretty hot) was physically touching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder when it was built? Or how many were made? You said it didn't have, like, a label?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! It just has the name M-Morphmanji!\" Eugene fumbled as he pulled the game's box back up into view. The box wasn't even all that stylized, no obnoxiously large labels or graphics, just a plain brown-tanned box that had '-Morphmanji-' stenciled on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So weird!\" Lindsey reached up and grabbed the notecard from the table and scanned it's contents again, \"I wonder who 'U' is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene's composure was returning as the topic turned back towards the game and the mystery that surrounded it. \"Yeah, I have no idea! I wonder if that was the programmer's name? And if this is from the 80s or something, maybe they were just trying to talk to their partner or something? Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey had already reached that conclusion, and, assuming they actually DID ever get around to playing a game on it, afterwards she totally wanted to see if she could take it apart. There was no telling what kind of custom built gizmos were inside, and old analog retro-tech was SO cool to poke around in, unlike modern technology which was all just big motherboards and all the interesting stuff was how the coding was laid out. And most of time all of THAT was pretty standardized at this point, which is why it was so easy for her to hack. But analog tech? You never knew WHAT you'd get when you popped open the casing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally. Umm...The rules say that the game can be played 'for up to four players', right? So, like, maybe you and I should just play...a game\" Lindsey said, giving Eugene's leg the tiniest of squeezes and trying not to giggle as she felt him tense up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh but we s-should wait f-for P-peter and Judy!\" Eugene stammered again as hormones tried to override his intellect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Genieeeee~\" Lindsey whined playfully. In reality she didn't really care if they waited or not, \"I wanna see what it doooooeees!\" She pressed herself harder against Eugene's legs and slowly began tracing a path with a single finger on the far side of Eugene's left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eugene, meanwhile, was trying not to simply explode (in more ways than one). But after a few moments the hot chick released him from her prison and leaned forwards with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let's look for more games on here, 'kay? I was only gonna vote for pets 'cuz Judy wanted to\" The rainblonde quickly began typing, moving past the 'PETS' option (even though she was still curious if that was, like, actual animals or the...other meaning of the word, and 'MODERATION' which she still hadn't figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was left of Eugene that was NOT silently gasping in relief was utterly amazed at how quickly Lindsey was typing. Even HE couldn't type that fast! But then amazement turned to curiosity as the game console beeped loudly as two new options pulled up on the game's tiny screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! 'CASINO' mode! Now THAT sounds like fun! I LOVE Vegas!\" Lindsey exclaimed, her eyes glittering with excitement, \"Me an' my friend Bethany stayed there on our vacation last summer! We couldn't like, actually go in the casino parts of the hotels though but all the shows were, like, super fun! And the lights! Like it was SO much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, of course, could only mumble that he'd never been. In fact this was currently the farthest he'd ever been from home, he and his mom never really having the money to go on big trips. That's why he'd gotten into video games, they were really the only 'vacations' that he could take to new and exciting places. Especially when his mom had been sick. Hell, he was only here at the university BECAUSE he'd managed to snag a scholarship run. Otherwise he doubt he would have had the cash to attend one of the colleges around LA. Not without being saddled with crippling debt he'd never pay off, anyway. It wasn't really something he liked to talk about though, and quickly pointed out the other option that appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And 'CLUB', that could be fun\" He suggested, even though he wasn't really into the local club scene. He was still in the process of acclimating to being away from home, the course work and trying to make friends when the Pandemic had forced everything to a dead stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but, like, 'club' can mean anything! Like is it like a dance club, or a book club?\" Lindsey eyed the glowing red word with confusion, \"How would you even make a game out of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Eugene started, but was interrupted as Judy minced back through the common room's doorway, followed by a sullen looking Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're back! And I hope you guys like pizzaa!\" Judy said with a smile while Peter rolled his eyes behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Dinner's on me. It's the 'least I can do' for you buying this game for us, Geno\" Peter's voice was full of false sincerity as he shoved himself back onto the couch, Judy joining him, but at a respectful distance instead of curling into his arm's like she had previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we doing the Pet game?\" The goth asked earnestly, and Eugene and Lindsey shared a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we, uh, looked for some other games on here\" Eugene explained and tried not to feel bad as Judy looked crestfallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we, like, found some good ones! There's a 'CASINO' mode and a 'CLUB' mode! Those sound like a ton of fun!\" Lindsey chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casino? Fuckin' A! Let's do that!\" Peter said, his interested renewed. Surely it'd be like, a card game, right? He was actually pretty good at poker, so much so that most of the football teams he had played on both here and back home had stopped playing with him if there was any money involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 'CLUB' mode? But...That can mean a ton of different things!\" Judy said, her voice full of skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S WHAT I SAID!\" Lindsey gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still more we can look at...\" Eugene offered, hoping to find something he was more familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of discussion the group voted on: </span></div></div>",

This was mainly because Lindsey and Peter had been VERY insistent about it, and because Judy was more interested in keeping her boyfriend engaged and less likely to wander off again). Eugene was less than thrilled, he wasn't very good at card games but maybe in a friendly setting he'd be able to pick up a few tricks from Peter? Plus it wasn't ALL that bad, Lindsey was still curled around his legs and he was actually starting to get a little comfortable with the soft pressure of her body. He'd actually let her take over typing on the tiny keyboard, she was faster anyway and didn't seem as terrified of breaking it as he was. Plus it would save him from having to constantly lean over (which given his...bulk, wasn't the most comfortable).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE GAME MODE\" The game buzzed as Lindsey typed in the group's choice. Two large, black buttons with 'IMMERSIVE' and 'TRADITIONAL' popped upwards near the game console's top with a metallic noise and the four students leaned in as they individually inspected the new buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAME MODE SELECTION WILL BEGIN PLAY IMMEDIATELY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, kidding me? MORE talking?\" Peter groaned as he flopped backwards, giving Judy a dark look, \"I swear if we're not playing by the time the pizza gets here, I'm quitting for real\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe repeated mention of pizza caused the group's stomachs to rumble almost simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised they're still even delivering. Arn't they, like, supposed to be shut down?\" The group's designated typist said as she leaned back once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the whole 'essential business' thing is letting them stay open. But I, uh, know one of the guys that works there. Don't tell anyone but he's sort of, uh, doing a little business on the side. He's buying the pizzas himself and then he's delivering them on his own time for a, uh, tip\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds super illegal, dude\" Eugene said as he wondered the legal ramifications this pizza delivery guy could be facing. Plus the potential exposure risk THEY faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but either we start playing this game or I go and get the pizza and then I WILL go back to my room\" Peter said with an authoritative finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was silent for a moment as Judy gave Peter a disappointed look. After a moment the goth turned back towards Lindsey and Eugene and put on a winning smile that betrayed her otherwise sullen looking outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can we pick a mode, guys?\" She urged, making a little wave towards the machine with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wonder what each mode is like?\" Eugene pondered out loud while Lindsey continued to peer at the machine, her eyes almost cat-like and glittering with curiosity. The fat nerd reached down for the game box for answers before Peter's large hand waved from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geno, stop. It's just gonna be card games, right? I can teach you that shit. I be this 'Traditional' mode is probably just a bunch of pre-loaded games that we pick through, and 'Immersive' is probably gonna be like, uh, Madden right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's no big either way, here, let's just pick...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group of students eyed the machine as Peter gave his rather blunt explanation of what he assumed the game modes were going to be. To the athlete, he figured that both modes would simply ask them to get a deck of cards or MAYBE dispense the cards itself along with some poker chips. The game looked like it had some storage capacity on the inside...But given how old it looked, Peter figured he'd probably have to get his own deck of cards and his little collection of poker chips he'd picked up last year before he'd been banished from the campus's competitive card circuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter listened to Eugene continue to waffle on and waste time. Peter did like the little dude, but sometimes he was SUCH a bore. So instead he just decided to pick for the group. Immersive could be fun, and it was probably like career mode in Madden anyway only for poker. And it had to be poker right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's no big, let's just play Immersive\" The jock reached over despite the complaining noise that Judy made and pushed the large button that had chipped and faded stenciling...And suddenly he felt REALLY dizzy. The world seemed to spin around him as he pulled his hand back, staring at it as it became more and more blurry and...fuzzy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huhaaay guh-guyz-uh\" He slurred, not realizing his friends were currently suffering the same thing he was, \"Did I jus' get schocked 'er somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could get an answer, Peter collapsed backwards onto the couch as the world went black. The last thing he heard was the distorted sounds of slot machines and the game blaring out \"STARTING SIMULATION: CASINO ROYALE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group let out a collective groan as they grabbed their heads, a strange but familiar world coming into focus around them. Lindsey was the first to recover, blinking away the blurriness and the throbbing head pain as the interior of a van finished materializing around them. At first she was VERY concerned that something had gone wrong, that she, they, had been the unfortunate victims of a human trafficking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" She screamed, causing the other three to groan louder as they rubbed their heads, eyes and temples, \"GUYS LOOK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be quiet!?\" Peter hissed. Had he been electrocuted or something, his fingers were tingling...But it felt a lot more like a really intense hangover, like the kinds he used to get when he was part of his old frat before he'd had enough sense to leave that toxic environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're, we're in, like, Vegas!\" Lindsey squealed back. This...This was impossible, right? Unless it was some kind of VR program but no way, the game was WAY too old to do something like THIS. The blonde pressed herself against the window of the vehicle as she peered out at the towering building in front of her, trying to take it all in despite the dull throbbing of her skull. Judy, Peter and Eugene followed the same, though in various states of, well, post-heavy inebriation. Peter wasn't too bad, having grown familiar with the sensation of having WAY too much to drink and regretting it the day after. Judy's eyes were sunken and red amidst her smeared makeup, her typically immaculately smooth and long silky purple hair now tied up in a loose bun and impossibly frizzy with more than a few party favors sticking out of the rat's nest.Eugene looked the worst, his face whiter than Judy's make-up and a queasy look on his face as though he was moment away from blowing chunks. Lindsey gave the fat kid a sympathetic look (she knew he'd never drank before) before she pressed her face against the interior window of the van and peered back out at the strange, familiar world they were somehow in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building looked like a combination of various famous Las Vegas buildings. The giant pyramid casino, Caeser's Palace, some tropical looking outdoor area, a giant fairy-tale castle and three towering buildings that looked like they were covered in gold; the countless windows shining painfully bright in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what the fu-\" Judy began, but then the the side door of the van was sliding open and exposing the entire group to the warm desert air. The group, save for Lindsey, groaned in pain from the light as a VERY chipper young woman with long brown hair and sporting a black and green valet suit that did very little to hide her bulging assets gave them a huge smile, her perfect white teeth practically glowing between her full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! I hope last night wasn't too rough on you, you guys sure do like to party!\" The woman said as she reached out a hand. Lindsey was still getting used to the concept of social distancing, so took the woman's out-stretched hand and allowed herself to be gently pulled from the vehicle. She stumbled across the pavement for a moment and felt the warm sun on her shoulders, the dull roar of morning traffic filling her ears as she just stood in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIF this really was some kind of VR experience...She was definitely cracking open the game the first chance she got. This was AMAZING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Lindsey looked down at herself and saw that she was no longer in her pink shirt and yoga pants, but instead was in a wrinkled pink spaghetti strap and jean shorts. And...were her breasts larger? She pulled at her hair, noticing that the rainbow dye was missing. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her the woman was offering sympathetic noises as she hauled Judy and Eugene out of the van, letting out a slight 'oof!' as Eugene practically fell on her as he struggled to find his balance. Peter simply grunted as he hauled himself out of the van and slammed the door shut behind him with a little more force was necessary as the group assembled in what was clearly the drop-off lane for the...casino? Hotel? Resort? that was sprawled out in front of them. The woman let out a little sigh and clipped her way in front of the group, aligning herself perfectly with the large gold-lined doors of the casino and held her arms out wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Morphmanji casino and resort! But then again, I don't have to tell you guys that, given the fun you had here last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group blinked as one. What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, getting ahead of myself! You see, this is the game. As in, you're IN the game. That's Immersive mode! You get to actually experience the, well, experience as real life! And to make it feel authentic, you've all been smacked with hangovers and given randomized events to coincide with your 'first night in Vegas'! Oh, and you've all, except for Peter, been given a little boost to your ages. Can't let minors into the casino, after all!\" The woman was beaming at the group, as if this all made perfect sense when it absolutely did NOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That must be why my boobs are bigger!' Lindsey thought as she stared down at the tiny peaks and the shallow canyon between them. It actually felt pretty cool! She'd heard more than a few mean girl comments about her being a stick in high school and even at the sorority but she'd learned how to brush them off. You didn't need to have curves if you spent time in front of a computer. Or rather, you learned HOW to avoid getting curves from sitting in front of a computer. But yeah, this was actually pretty bitchin'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...I know you!\" Eugene called out from the other side of the small line, \"You sold me the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Judy and Peter said in unison, bleary eyes going even wider as they shot back and forth from Eugene to the woman, who just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty! But before any of you panic, let me explain. And no, Peter, trying to strong-arm me only ends badly every time you try it, so...Don't? this is supposed to be a fun place!\" The mysterious valet pointed a finger at Peter, who was already in mid-stride towards her, his hangover pain shrugging off the last of his rather finite patience. The jock frowned and continued his march towards the woman, who simply sighed in disappointment and pointed a green-tipped finger towards him, causing Peter to freeze in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time, Petey. You'd think that SOME version of you would have learned by now... Anyway, here's the way you play. Think of this as a 'working vacation', during your party last night you all partied very hearty, as such you've incurred some rather significant debts that you're going to have to pay off. That's your objective, and if you look at your arms...\" The woman pointed at the underside of her own forearm and then at the group, who all, save for Peter who was still frozen, looked at their own and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five black bars on their skin, each with different number amounts that were WELL into the thousands of dollars. At the bottom was a collected total of each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's was nearly $22 thousand dollars! That was almost as much as her tuition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are your 'lives'. You get five in-game days to pay off that money with anything you earn, however you decide to earn it gambling or odd-jobs...And hopefully make some on the side! You can trying playing as a team or you can try to work it all off on your own! And as a bonus, whatever you make after you pay off, you'll get to keep when you go home! That sounds pretty cool, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's enthusiasm failed to carry over to the hungover students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but if you don't...Or fail any of the encounters you come across, well, the 'house always wins'....\" The woman said ominously.\" The woman moved dramatically to the side as the doors of the casino swung open, the sounds of gambling flowing out into the street. It was very...cinematic, in Lindsey's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you'll excuse me, gotta go pick up the next group at the airport! The game starts now!\" The woman chirped, and hustled back into the van, speeding off before the group could ask any questions. Peter gasped as he unfroze, stumbling forward, looking down at his arm and then back up at his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the FUCK is happening!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief collective freak-out at the door, the group reached the same conclusion: This was 'real' and that the only way out was to play the game. They then...</span></div></div>",

She threw a panicked look at the intimidating sum total of '$16,000\" that was tattooed on her forearm, along with the black bars that, according to the strange woman, were how many days that she had to earn said $16 grand before something, most likely bad, happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention the game was already CHEATING! Judy fought the dizziness that she felt as she looked up at her friends; Lindsey in her wrinkled,, somewhat ill-fitting shorts and pink spaghetti straps, Peter in a deep blue one size too small t-shirt that had 'I <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Las Vegas' on it, and Eugene in rather unflattering black shirt that had a...stain of some sort on the front of it, and shorts that looked painfully small on his flabby bulk and a...fanny pack? hanging off his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, urgh, has to be some kind of super good VR or something\" Eugene groaned as he shielded his eyes from the bright morning light, \"There's no way we're actually IN Las Vegas\". He looked down at his own forearm and ominous looking $7000 that was etched into his pale skin. His nose burned as he inhaled his own body odor, the rank stench of a LOT of sweat (some of which he still felt dampening his new shirt) and something slightly more foul that most likely matched and was the source of the large stain on his chest. He wiggled his toes in the ill-fitting flip-flops he now wore and silently stared at the extremely dated looking fanny pack that was straddling his waist. And was he even fatter now, on top of being older?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's just great. Totally what I needed' He thought darkly to himself before Lindsey's WAY too chipper voice cut through his train of thought like a missile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we totally are! Like, there's NO VR system on the planet that can simulate the feeling of wind on skin! And, like, smell! Maaaaaybe give you headache from being strapped on your face too long but I\u2019m really, really sure we\u2019re here!\u201d Lindsey said before she reached over and gave Eugene a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOW! What the hell!?\u201d Eugene shouted, but the former rainblonde, now just blonde pointed to the red mark on Eugene\u2019s bulging arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSEE!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I just should have kept playing Madden\u201d Peter groaned quietly, staring in disbelief at the $55,000 price tag that was emblazoned on his arm. That\u2026That was an impossible amount of money! At best he\u2019d only ever won a couple grand in the card circles on campus, mainly the frats in his freshman year before he\u2019d been banned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the group could continue to inspect themselves there was the sound of an engine revving as a red, VERY expensive looking car turned of the street and began it's way up the short drive towards the door as a dark standard looking car pulled in close behind it. The group was forced to move from the pavement and towards the casino doors as it revved it's engines once more as it slowed to a stop, and Peter couldn't help, even with the pounding headache, stare at the car's shiny curves. And then at the equally shiny curves that stepped OUT of those curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tanned and tall, impossibly leggy with a rear that looked like it could kill just by aiming at a guy, a platinum blonde whose styled hair hung down around her barren shoulders as two HUGE breasts, larger than Judy's DDs by at least a cup, probably two, pressed against a silver dress that glistened in the morning sun as if the woman was clothed in nothing but diamonds. Jewelry hung off her neck, dangling against her breasts, off her ears, and her tiny hands were decked with gold rings. The look of clear wealth was rounded out by a pair of heavy gold bracelets that seemed a size too small, gripping her wrists tight as she stood there in the morning light fidgeting with them. Her eyes were bright blue and her lips were plump and red and there was a look off...bewilderment about them as she stared at the casino's surroundings. Almost as if she was looking for some kind of exit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Peter and Lindsey breathed as they tried to keep their eyes from popping out of their skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then another figure rose from the driver seat. He was tall, his skin was tanned, an expensive pair of sunglasses sat on his large nose and his black hair was greased and slicked back. He wore a suit that looked almost as expensive as the car. He strutted around the front of the car and seized the blonde by the forearm, and her face forced a pearly-toothed smile her eyes did not return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon doll\" The man muttered, his voice VERY stereotypically Italian-American sounding as he moved towards the casino doors, \"Hey watchout we're walkin' here!\" He snarled at the group, and the group of slightly older students scattered to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' tourists...\" The man muttered angrily as he proceeded past the group, the woman's panicked looking eyes locking on Peter and Lindsey as she silently mouthed something with her ruby-red lips. And then she and the man were inside, vanishing into the crowd of people that were moving through the casino's lobby. There was a slam of a car door behind them, and the displaced students looked as a HUGELY muscled man rose out of the featureless black car and with more speed than anyone that large should have, quickly slid into the sports car and the two vehicles sped off towards the parking garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was weird...\" Eugene grunted as the group rejoined at the entrance of the casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Lindsey said, her eyes locked on the gold-encrusted doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude did you SEE that chi-\" Peter said excitedly to Eugene, but a VERY loud cough from a VERY annoyed looking Judy kept the athlete from fumbling even further into trouble territory, and he blushed and groaned at the rush of blood making the throbbing in his head pound harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we...need to play to get out, right? Do we all have the same number?\" Judy said after a moment of glaring at her boyfriend, holding out her forearm and showing the $12,000 that was stenciled onto her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chorus of 'no' as the three others held out there arms; Eugene and his $7000, Lindsey and her $22,000, and Peter with his colossal $55,000. They glanced around and then EVERYONE stared, open mouthed, at the huge number on Peter's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, this all...This all adds up to a hundred grand\" Eugene said, doing a quick calculating moment with his fingers as he quickly tabulated the combined totals, \"So we need to collect THAT much to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they different? Why do I have the highest one!?\" Peter pushed the tattooed flesh, hoping against hope that maybe it was just like a press on, but with no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's, like, a difficulty system\" Lindsey nodded, \"We all have super different numbers, but Genie has the smallest! So I bet it's based on our individual skills at gambling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great so even though I have the smallest number, I'm actually completely screwed\" Eugene chuckled darkly, earning him a sympathetic noise and pat on the head from the slightly more bouncy blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I mean I know how to play cards but gambling? I, uh, I've never really felt comfortable with trying it out\" Judy said with a blush and looking down at her sandal'd feet. Gambling was, after all, sinful and thus she'd never been exposed to it before escaping to college. Her own crestfallen embarassment earned her a head pat of her own from Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey herself was trying not to be too worried. She could play cards and was actually how she and Peter had originally met, a card game during Rush Week. The sororities had already scooped her up but she'd decided to just explore the rest of the campus and had been drawn into one of the 'freebie' games that the frats were putting on, and Peter had been there, looking bored, and had proceeded to crush her rather effortlessly when she'd thought he'd be an easy target. And he hadn't even been PART of the frat! They'd just invited him there to trick pledges into signing up. But now? With such an amount of money on the line and...whatever might happen to them if they didn't earn it all by the end of the five days...The blonde was definitely worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What do we do now?\" Eugene asked, and silence, save for the distant sounds of gambling and the city ambiance, fell over the group as they mulled their options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple\" Peter finally said, taking a step towards the gilded entrance, \"We're in this together. You and Judy both suck, sorry babe, so we stand a better chance trying to earn this cash as a group. If we go alone we're just going to flounder, but staying together as a team, maybe we can make this work and get out of this crazy place\" His voice was deep and strong, authoritative and inspiring as the jock summoned his 'team player' personality and hoped like hell it worked on nerds just as well as it did on the football team. He cast a quick look behind him to see if it worked. Judy was staring at him with a mixture of awe, admiration, lust and anger, having been a little turned on by his hero moment despite the off-hand insult. Lindsey and Eugene seemed similarly impressed, their heads nodding and small, determined smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Still got it' The jock through with a grin. He turned fully back to his friends and waved one of his large hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's get this show on the road. Quicker we get the cash, quicker we go home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the athlete led the group forward into the casino...And the were immediately accousted by a group of angry looking men being led by a spindly, balding old man that looked VERY displeased with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good, you've returned\" The man said after a moment of silent glares, \"The management would like to inform you that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group entered the large, faux-gold plated doors and for a very brie moment, Eugene was thrown off by the fact that no one was wearing a face mask or immediately sanitizing the door handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess there's no covid in the game?' The now-older teen thought as he trundled behind his group of friends, trying to not feel too guilty about trapping them here. He just really questioned why he had gained even MORE weight though, did the game base their (hopefully) simulated appearances on stereotypes or projected appearances three years into the future? He didn't particularly enjoy being close to what he guessed was 300 pounds...But Lindsey's new body, particularly her ass, was about to damn near give him a heart attack or a boner. Possibly both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, look at this lobby guys!\" Judy gasped ahead of him, and Eugene tore his gaze from the shifting glutes of his crush to the world around him and also felt his breath catch in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was so...expensive looking! Crystal chandeliers hung from ornately molded ceilings, the floor was black marble inlaid with gold and there were two large fountains that were gurgling and gushing upwards in artistically engineered arches of liquid. There were alcoves on either side of the lobby that were occupied with a row of four door each, several of them opening with a ding as individuals poured in and out of the elevators. In front of them, flanked by two flights of stairs that curved upwards and two passages that were labeled 'CASINO' in carved wood, was the welcome desk, the hotel logo (which was, somewhat predictably, a huge gold 'M' with the infinity symbol curling out of it) was attached to a wall of dark marble as water flowed almost seamlessly around it in an endless waterfall. The beautiful woman in the dress they had seen just a few minutes earlier was ascending the staircase on the right, her slender arm locked tightly within the arm of the rude man, and they were both flanked by tall, black suited men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite possibly the fanciest place Eugene had ever been. It honestly reminded Eugene of the fancier parts of the 'First Class' section in that old movie his mom loved, Titanic, but obviously more modern and with a decidedly American take on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the aesthetics of the casino, Eugene and the groups attention shifted towards the spindly, balding old man in a tuxedo that was approaching him, and the four burly men in black business suits that were following close behind. The two groups came to a stop between the two fountains and after a moment of awkward silence, the older man coughed and stepped forward. From here, Eugene could see the title 'Concierge' on the small badge he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good, you've returned\" The Concierge said, his nasally voice carrying more than a little distaste as he looked each member of the group over, wincing at Eugene's apparently foul appearance before continuing, \"The management would like to inform you that, due to your...entertainment in the presidential suite last night, you've all be assigned to new rooms while we repair the damage\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tuxedo wearing official snapped his fingers and one of the hulking brutes behind him stepped forward, reaching into his coat for something and suddenly Eugene was picturing that gnarled hand pulling out a blackjack stick or worse, a gun and threatening them, but was relieved to see four small envelopes instead be handed to the smaller man, who in turn handed them to the group. Eugene wasted no time in tearing his open and tipped the contents into his chubby hand; two hotel keycards, a letter and a hundred dollars in casino chips. And what was more amazing was that the moment the chips hit his flesh, the $7000 tattooed on his left forearm ticked down to $6900.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" The overweight geek gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. The management values the four of you as customers, despite your...exuberance last night. The rooms are now standard, and you will be among the normal guests as opposed to our more elite clientele. These rooms are compliments of Management and will not reflect on your bill...Unless you damage them, of course. And at no extra charge, we've gathered your belongings and deposited into your assigned rooms. The chips are, due to the hotel and casino being separate corporate entities, there to encourage you to visit our gambling floors over those of other...less reputable casinos.\" The Concierge made a disgusted face once more, as if the thought of the group using the other casinos in Las Vegas was repulsive to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the moment passed as the small man recovered and continued on,\"The paper contains the binding legal agreement you have made with Management.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with, like, the other casinos?\" Lindsey asked from the other side of Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I don't partake in unprofessional gossip about our competitors\" The man said curtly without acknowledging the hypocrisy of his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have questions, feel free to make your own inquiries elsewhere. Now, since my services here are concluded, you may feel free to make use of our facilities however you desire. Please note that, as per your agreement with management, that if you have not accumulated enough money to pay off your debt by the end of your scheduled stay with us, you will be held accountable and expected to pay said debt off before you will be allowed to check out. Any further damages to the hotel or casino will be added to your fee totals, and while the Management is willing to look the other way for certain behaviors, if you continue to cause issues, you may face a ban from our establishment. If you have any further questions about your arrangement with Management, feel free to ask at the front desk, or to call using the special number on your documentation.Thank you for your time and patronage of the Morphmanji hotel and resort\" The man finished what was obviously a more thorough run-down of the simulation's rules and gave the group a curt nod, snapping hi fingers in the air as his own group turned and began walking away. But then he paused and turned back, his eyes locking with Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and might I suggest that, before you go about your business, you visit your new rooms and put on some more...fitting clothing? And possibly a shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the man was gone, and the group was left staring at Eugene, who was simply turning red with embarassment (and a little bit of anger at being singled out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, SUPER rude!\" Lindsey said, sticking her tongue out at the backs of the retreating official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But he's got a point we don't look exactly, uh, fresh. Especially Geno. Sorry dude\" Peter shrugged, and Eugene felt his mood grow a little darker at his best friend's off-hand insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter!\" Judy gave her boyfriend a harder-than-normal punch to the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I mean As much as I want to start earning our way out of this insanity, we all smell like beer, sweat and, uh, 'tossed salad'. Especially Geno. It might not be a bad idea to go freshen up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Maybe it's like, walking over a medkit in a game or something! Maybe we have like a debuff or something, and once we go to our rooms, we'll totally feel better and stuff! And like, have our stats restored! That way we'll be able to gamble better! OH OH! And I bet all of our stuff is, like, special inventory as well! I wonder what we all have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindz, I didn't understand a word of what you just said, sweetheart\" Judy shook her head in confusion. They sounded like video game terms but that was a field the almost-preacher's-daughter girl was completely unfamiliar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Yeah, sounds like a good idea, uh, Lindsey\" Eugene said, grinning despite his embarassment, and the messy-haired blonde gave him a grinning thumbs up, \"But remember we ARE on a time limit\". Eugene held up his arm to show the top bar, which clearly indicated the current day, was already noticeably smaller than the other four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. I forgot about that\" Peter grumbled as he, and the rest of the group, inspected their own arm bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments the group decided to...</span></div></div>",

Now babe, I love you, but time is money, and we need money to survive\" Peter gently placed a hand on his stunned and betrayed girlfriend and firmly pushed past her as he walked towards the casino entrance, opening one of the large gold doors and vanishing inside, his towering bulk quickly getting lost among the rest of the casino crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Eugene both gave her a apologetic look as they pushed past the betrayed goth and vanished into the casino as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' stupid\" Judy swore before she too entered the casino.</span></div></div>",

I'm not really all that good with card games\" Judy said after a few minutes of discussion (and holding Peter's arm hostage because that way he couldn't just get impatient again and storm off). It was a bit of a lie, given that she'd spent far, far too many Sundays playing Bridge (which was seen as 'morally clean' in the eyes of God) at church with the old ladies or with her parents and grandparents. And uncles. And aunts. And the pastor. And pretty much anyone that went to their church and was allowed in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy shuddered at the memories, all that wasted time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she also knew that Eugene wasn't really a card player. She'd tried to teach him Bridge a couple of times but the freshman had failed to really 'get it'. She didn't really want watch Eugene get embarassed, especially in front of Lindsey, because she knew that Peter was pretty vicious when it came to playing cards. There was a reason why he'd been kicked off out of every competitive card circle on campus, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, like, TOTALLY handle a night at the club!\" Lindsey said, doing a half dance with her torso, arms raised in the air and her bracelets jangling as she waved them around, \"I've been getting, um, cabin fever! And stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...It's just a game! I don't see how it'll do anything other than just play some crappy disco music or something!\" Peter whined, \"If we do casino we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, it's a vote\" Judy said matter-of-factly, \"Plus this means we won't get the cards all greasy from the pizza\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And, like, you would ALWAYS be able to tell what cards are which. 'Cuz of the grease marks an' stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Like it better than playing cards all night\" Eugene said quietly, hoping that no one heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!\" Peter cried out, but was silenced as Judy placed a long, dark-tipped nail against his lips and stared deeply into his brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majority rules, babe\" She said, sticking her tongue out before giving Peter a quick peck on the cheek. She turned to Lindsey, who was poised like the Chesire Cat over the game machine's keyboard, a huge, toothy grin that would challenge the fictional feline's own. Judy gave the rainbow haired blonde a quick nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love democracy\" Lindsey croaked, making her voice as deep as she could as she quickly typed in the game choice. Eugene chuckled at the reference (and a little bit at the clueless expressions on Judy and Peter's faces as the movie meme reference sailed over their heads).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that Lindsey finished typing in the command, there was a loud buzz and two large, black buttons popped out of the top of the console, the words 'Immersive' and 'Traditional' stenciled on them in faded, chipped white text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHOOSE GAME MODE\" The game's voice squawked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Guys, c'mon-\" Peter began, but Judy gave his arm a (slightly painful) squeeze and he rolled his eyes, shutting up before he ended up truly in the dog house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that means?\" Judy said innocently as she poked her nails into the more tender flesh on the underside of Peter's deliciously muscled arms. Sometimes her man just needed a little more...physical reinforcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like, how do you, um, do a 'traditional' club? Like Immersive I totally get 'cuz it'll prolly be like what Petey said but traditional?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'll be like a board game version of going clubbing?\" Eugene offered the only thing he could think of, having otherwise drawn a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, watch this game actually be magic and if we choose Immersive we actually get transported to a night club and have to complete objectives to get back, and traditional is more like that old Dance Dance Revolution game they have at the Student Center\" Peter chuckled mockingly. Of course it was probably going to be EXACTLY like he said, this thing was probably nothing more than some 80s karaoke machine, at best it would maybe do a little light show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, be serious you meanie!\" Lindsey stuck her tongue out at the jock before tilting her head back and looking at Eugene's wide-eyed, and upside down stare as she put what little cleavage she had on display for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what do you think we should play, Genie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Um, let's, uh, take a vote?\" The awkward geek stammered as he tried to do the right thing and not stare down at his crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Democracy always works!\" Judy said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group went around in their rough half-circle and voted on what they wanted, not really paying much mind to the previously mentioned possibility that the word 'Club' could have drastically different meanings beyond just being a nightclub, with the winning mode being...</span></div></div>",

The top-heavy goth leaned over and, with the push of a long-nailed finger, selected the Traditional button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud buzzing noise from the machine and the sound of something that, at least to Lindsey, sounded like an old floppy disc activating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INPUT GAME LENGTH\" The machine commanded mechanically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess it's gonna print out a game board or something?\" Judy wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's, like, do it then! Genie, how many spaces do we want?\" Lindsey asked, casting a look over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think...\" The heavyset geek sputtered before hastily grabbing the game board and scouring the text, \"It, uh, looks like, uh, 36 squares for each is the default length? But you can make it longer if you want to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, really?\" Lindsey purred, reaching back and stroking a finger across the top of Eugene's knee, and the flabbergasted geek as suddenly VERY glad for the compressed cardboard shield hiding his face as he realized what he had said. Across the common room he heard a deep chuckle followed by a soft 'oof!' as something, or rather someone, poked his athletic friend in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think 36 is a good number to start with. If we like it, we can just play again with a longer map, right Eugene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three students just heard a wordless mumble and saw the top of the embarassed boy's head nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okis!\" Lindsey chirped, tapping in the number and pressing enter. There was another click, a buzz, and then a loud screech that sounded like the old dial-up Internet tones. And then there was an AWFUL grinding noise followed by a burning smell as a thin trail of smoke drifted from a vent in the back of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, it's on fire!\" Peter yelled, but as soon as the smell and smoke began...It was over. There was a loud DING and a tray full of brightly colored plastic figurines slid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRADITIONAL MODE SELECTED: CHOOSE AVATARS TO BEGIN GAME\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group leaned in, Eugene discarding his box as he finally felt most of the red leaving his face, and the group saw four primary colored dice, blue, red, yellow and green, sitting in little holding brackets beneath four similar colored figurines that were posed above the many, many others that filled the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a Blue DJ, a Red Dance, a Yellow Bartender and a Green Bouncer, but below in the pile were tons and TONS of other figurines that seemed to suggest that the game was interpreting the word 'club' to mean many other things. There were several...books? And then strange pieces that looked like they didn't belong with this particular game type, like a dragon, wizard, some kind of elf and something that looked like an orc?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" Peter grunted in confusion, \"Did it...make those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's TOTALLY a 3D printer, Petey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But arn't those, like...new? This thing is so old! They couldn't possibly have had them in the 80s!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually did, but I've never seen one THIS small...\" Lindsey's eyes peered beyond the figurines and into the dark interior of the machine, trying to discern some kind of understanding of it's mechanics. IT actually kind of reminded her of this old old old OLD movie she had watched called <b>*batteries not included</b> that had these super cute little flying robot aliens that had a bunch of gizmos and gadgets and could, well, do anything. This couldn't be like that, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SELECT AVATARS TO BEGIN GAME\" The game buzzed once more, almost impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we need to pick something...\" Eugene muttered, and after a quick round of discussion the group grabbed the...</span></div></div>",

The residents of the commons were scattered like bowling pins made of meat, scattered around the metal epicenter of the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene, who had the fortune to land sideways on the couch, made to practice the little bit of first aid he could remember from Health class, but a sudden, pulsing heat filled him, like his heart and stomach and liver \u2014 and, well, all of his organs \u2014 were being microwaved. In tinfoil. The white stucco ceiling dissolved into a dark fuzz as he\u2026 swelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, behind the capsized bulk of the easy chair, felt her clothes slither over her like snakes, as her not-so-sizable chest flattened even further, her denim capris smoothing out and stretching across her lengthening legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, trapped underneath the small tunnel between the chair\u2019s, was treated to the lovely sound of her joints and bones cracking and snapping, though no flash of pain emerged from her limbs.

Lips that were slowly starting to feel\u2026 larger. He tried to reach for the phone five inches from his face, but his arms felt like tissue paper wrapped around iron girders.

The ceiling, the only thing he could really manage to look at with how damn <i>sore</i> he was, was ruined, only two or three light-tubes still intact, casting a ghostly yellow-white pallor across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus,\u201d he mumbled. In a voice that <i>wasn\u2019t <b>his</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of desperate panic gripped Eugene, and he mustered up all the strength he could to flop his right arm onto his chest. But instead of the stomach flab and half-moobs he\u2019d been trying to prevent \u2014 to no avail \u2014 his hand found hard, striated mass, a mass that <i>rippled</i> as he moved his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand \u2014 which was goddamn <i>huge</i>, by the peripheral-vision-glimpse he got of it \u2014 roamed across a shirt filled with pecs, abs, and even a little bit of bi-and-tricep, on his other arm. A perverse, dark sense of confidence filled him. This was <i>him</i>. He was \u2014 unless he had some kinda nightmare for a face \u2014 <i>hot</i>. Maybe hot enough to get Lindsey to \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rustling sounded next to him, and Eugene managed to crane his neck to the left, where the devastated lounge lay. Spots still danced around his eyes, but he could make out a\u2026 kinda rounded object? Blackish, semi-shiny \u2014 aw shit was that the LA-Z-BOY?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene twitched the side of his mouth he could into a frown. He <i>liked</i> that chair. It was in the corner, which was nice for avoiding conversation during the non-pandemic-days, and it was <i>juuussst</i> worn enough to be ultra-comfy without being <i>whywashethinkingaboutchairs</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends were (maybe) <i>hurt</i>, and he was thinking about his own<b>comfort</b>. With a mighty, paralysis-defying grunt, Eugene placed a hand on the ruined armrest and <i>pushed</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaand it fell onto the floor. With a weird, electronic boop? And, uh, that was <i>wayy</i> softer than the chair was, and kinda warm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of dread comprehension dawning, Eugene slowly rose to his feet and squinted down at the collapsed object, his eye\u2019s rods finally adjusting to the low light:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright yellow bulb, striped through the middle with dark plastic, sat atop a pale swanlike neck. Below that, the mysterious figure\u2019s body was entirely encased in dark leather, from splayed-out arms to slim, stilettoed ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, most worryingly to Eugene was the round, hip-level hemispheres, the left one upon which a large sweaty handprint rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene paled and found an utter lack of saliva in his mouth. He just goosed, groped, whatever\u2026 who was it? He peered closer and saw a smattering of styrofoam pellets around her wide hips, the innards of Lindsey\u2019s favored perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff nerd ran a moistureless tongue around his parched lips. Hopefully, his crush would forgive the inadvertent pawing. That is, if she wasn\u2019t in a coma. He should move her \u2014 that kind of posture had to be <i>murder</i> on the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly slipping his hands underneath the most appropriate areas \u2014 the hard fabric that composed her corset and her shoulder \u2014 Eugene delicately flipped the cyberpunk bartender like a delicate pancake, then immediately blushed at the light wobbling of her chest, which was <i>definitely</i> larger than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis game \u2014 because it <i>had</i> to be the game that did this \u2014 was a pervert, concluded Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting his eyes to the ceiling, Eugene bent down levered his thick arms underneath Lindsey\u2019s shoulder blades and the back of her knees, lifting her with surprisingly little effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking upwards, Eugene turned around perfectly, lightly kicking the couch\u2019s base to confirm it was still there\u2026 before a familiar electronic <i>bloop</i> sounded from his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, and gawped at Linds\u2019 helmet, the black glass of the visor lit up like a red LiteBrite, the pointillistic dots forming a large \u2018?\u2019. Slowly, her head turned from side to side, presumably taking in the devastated commons, before lazily facing towards Eugene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Eugene murmured, his shaky lips spreading into a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of things happened at once:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question mark quickly slithered into a vibrant red exclamation point, and all of his cargo\u2019s leather-clad limbs started thrashing at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you ca\u2014!\u201d was all Eugene managed before a booted toe caught him in the chin, sending him reeling for a moment. He maintained his grasp on her for a few seconds, but was unable to enjoy the feeling of her chest squishing against his own through the pain, inadvertently releasing his grip on her .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks danced in Eugene\u2019s eyes as a <i>whump</i> and a <i>boop</i> sounded from a few feet aways from him, two projectiles thumping against his thigh before his vision focused. In front of him sat Lindsey, chest heaving, legs askew, a \u2018(\uff1b\uff9f \u0414\uff9f)\u2019, flashing on her visor. Eugene spared a glance at his feet; two heeled boots rested a bit behind him, presumably thrown by the frightened sorority girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images2.imagebam.com/95/37/20/a314511356380923.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://images2.imagebam.com/95/37/20/a3...</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene raised his hands and tried to look as non-threatening as he could. \u201cHey, relax! It\u2019s just, uh, me.\u201d The visor flashed to (\u25dco\u2313o\u25dd) as Eugene bit back a swear. \u201cI-i mean, it\u2019s Eugene.

Both hands were quickly ripped away from her hips as if burnt, and slowly, shakingly raised to her visor, which displayed \u2018...\u2019 in red lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene took a step towards her. \u201cY-you alright?\u201d he rumbled, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice as she traced the outline of her body, from wide hips to slim waist, before grasping and gently pulling down her front-facing zipper\u2019s pull tab\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>alrightithinkthatsenough,</i>\u201d Eugene rumbled in his new baritone, taking a few steps towards her, only stopping when Lindsey tried to flatten herself against the couch once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d he blurted. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just not used to\u2026 being so big.\u201d He chuckled sheepishly and Lindsey\u2019s visor changed to \u2018&gt;:@\u2019 as she flipped him the bird. \u201cI, uh, probably deserve that. Do you, um, need a hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene proffered a thick mitt to his newly buxom crush, but Lindsey chose to struggle to her feet by herself. But when the helmeted hottie put her weight on her right ankle, her leg crumpled like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 pillar, a harsh electronic screech emanating from her helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, are you alright?\u201d murmured Gene in an effort to make his voice less bone-shaking. Lindsey just rubbed her ankle in response, \u2018(x)_(x)\u2019 displayed on her visor. Eugene frowned. One-way-communication was difficult. \u201cDo you uh, think you could take that off?\u201d The geek waved a hand at her helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey\u2019s hands abruptly moved away from her bum leg and snapped to her helmet, quickly feeling around the edges of the helmet for some sort of seam, an spirited investigation that slowly but steadily <i>tic-tac</i>ed down her zipper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene once again inclined his gaze to the ceiling, heat flushing his cheeks. \u201cNo dice, huh?\u201d was shot at the stucco. \u201c<i>Alsouhyourzipper.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pause, then a mortified synth-arpeggio, followed by a quick <i>zwip</i>. Determining it was safe to look down again, Eugene did so, and was greeted with an indignant \u2018&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:((((\u2018 visor and thin arms crossed across a well-zippered chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t going well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your, uh, ankle isn\u2019t broken, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emoticon\u2019d visor was swiveled left to right in the negative, and the attached hand firmly grasped Eugene\u2019s own. Once again the nerd quietly marveled at his own strength. Before, he would have to sling her arm across his shoulder to offer any support, but now, mere bicep-power was enough to support the entirety of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey also seemed to be astounded by the peculiarities of her new body, but in a way that Eugene politely pretended not to notice: one hand lightly poked her left boob as a \u2018D:\u2019 flickered on her visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through their trip, a chair groaned. Like, a human groan. The duo\u2019s shock was exacerbated by the chunky sandals poking out from the armrest, or, more specifically, that the sandals seemed to be attached to legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stooped down as best he could while keeping his forearm level for the enleathered Lindsey and, with a single piston of his biceps, overturned the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath, with her eyes closed delicately, was a figure clearly recognizable as Judy, just\u2026 longer. Like someone pulled out her legs and arms with a Play-Doh machine, and maybe added a bit to her spine. And, uh, also skimpified her clothes: her now-fairly-proportional chest was swaddled in a halter top and skirt transmogrified into a pair of capris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could formulate a way to wake her up without freaking her the hell out, Lindsey writhed her way out of Eugene\u2019s grip, leather creaking as she limp-crawled towards Judy. Eugene wisely made himself scarce as the girl shook the unconscious goth\u2019s shoulder with unmatched fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018:D\u2019 displayed itself proudly as Judy\u2019s eyelids flickered once, then twice, then stayed up, blearily focusing on the ceiling. \u201cWhuzzat?\u201d she weakly mumbled, craning her neck up, her gaze falling upon the beaming Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like her eyes tried to escape her skull with the way they goggled, an mess of syllables escaping her mouth as she shoved her helper backwards onto her ample tuchus, the only coherent parts that Geno could make out being \u201cSEXYDAFTPUNK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there, Jude!\u201d said Eugene, trying to non-intimidatingly bound towards the two, because <i>boy</i> that chair leg that Judy was wielding could <i>definitely</i> do some damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thankfully (in a way), Judy tossed her makeshift weapon at Eugene with a terrified yawp, enabling the  geek to explain the situation from a safe, nonthreatening distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gesticulated wildly at the taller goth, but was mostly ignored after Eugene explained her mutism.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh\u2026\u201d Judy breathed, taking in her new\u2026 everything. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not the only one that got an upgrade, Lindz.\u201d She shot a cheeky smile at her friend, who curled her hands into fists at the comment, red \u2018DX\u2019 glimmering on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kinda wonder what Peter looks like n\u2014OW!\u201d Eugene\u2019s musing was cut off by a sharp <i>THWACK</i> to the leg, courtesy of Lindz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrouble in paradise, Gene?\u201d Judy jabbed. The goth was appreciating the five inches of height with a celebratory strut around the devastation. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be \u2014 BABE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene blushed. \u201cW-what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw, not you \u2014 Pete\u2019s here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey clawed at Eugene\u2019s leg as he bounded by, but was left on the floor, electronic vibrato trilling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed Judy\u2019s black-nailed point to a pile of askew couch cushions, out from which a squarish arm peeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Not as big as mine,</i> Eugene noted with silent glee. Apparently the board game had no need for buff DJs. Judy wrenched aside the pillows with little effort, and unveiled\u2026 Peter?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Judy, the jock was <i>way</i> different. His brown-buzzcut was now a short blonde coiff, rounding out a face that looked more \u2018pretty-boy\u2019 than \u2018jock\u2019. He was pretty skinny now too, and the white shirt and suspenders deal he had didn\u2019t really do much to enhance his physique. The little frou-frou bowtie didn\u2019t really do much to enhance the DJ look. All in all, made him look more like a barten\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <b>no</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene stared at the yellow-helmeted Peter behind him,  who had finally risen to her - his?- feet, stumble-stomping towards them both with fists balled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d was all he could say, as Lindsey, the <i>real</i> Lindsey woke up behind him with a yell that was half-soprano, half-guttural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddammit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not <i>all</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course the obvious choice were the four offered figurines on the central little stand, but there were a ton of smaller sections all divided out like a pie chart that had their own handful of figurines, each clearly designed for a specific type of 'club'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIBS ON THE BOUNCER!\" Peter yelled out, reaching forward with his long footballer fingers towards the machine, but then groaned as a sharp smack knocked his hand out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooww!\" He groaned, rubbing the appendage as Judy gave an indignant little huff and leaned forward in his stead, not fully paying aware of the fact that the motion had accidentally given Eugene a face full of her substantial cleavage; the geeky, lovable little fatso nearly twisting his head off as he looked away...Directly into Lindsey's chest where the sorority girl had silently crept in closer with Eugene realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why monsieur!\" She giggled as Eugene merely sputtered in embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cute little interaction was lost to Judy who was focused on the pieces in the tray. Specifically one set of pieces. While she HAD taken a liking to night clubs, seeing the book figurines had suddenly hit her in a spot that the sheltered goth had thought was scabbed over and made her feel homesick. She had LOVED the book club her mom had put on every month, and she was very much aware of the rose-tinted goggles clouding her vision, as when she'd become older and realized certain...truths about things and her family and their friends. They had ended up being little more than gossip sessions about who in town was being 'sinful' and who should be excluded from certain functions because they weren't 'devout' enough, but for Little Judy, it had been like one big tea party! Only the adults were playing with her! And she got to eat those delicious cookies and drink fruit punch like them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she had later come to realize that she was the only one actually drinking fruit punch while the rest of them were drinking wine, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo because of this pang of nostalgic homesickness and a rare memory that she could look back on and not feel, well, awful about, Judy plucked the tokens from the 'Book Club' section and pushed the tray back into the machine with a loud DING, followed by a metallic clicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what gives Ju-Ju? I thought we were, like, gonna get all dance party in here?\" Lindsey whined as she pushed Eugene's fire-engine red face out of her tiny cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what the hell babe!?\" Peter pouted as he continued to rub his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mood for going clubbing\" Was all Judy said, putting on a haughty air, hr nose stuck in the air like she'd seen far too many times from her mom. And her old friends, before they'd show their true colors. She was about to continue her explanation when the Morphmanji machine bellowed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MODE RESET.

You don't even want to vote?\" Peter whined as he snatched the token out of the air. He hated when she got like this, one of her rare moods where she put HER needs over that of anyone else. It didn't happen often, but when it did it usually resulted in his wallet getting lighter and a LONG day at the mall while she shopped for clothes or makeup or some other girly stuff and would later break down in a guilty feeling, sobby mess because of the way she acted which then turned into a cry-filled rant about how she WASN'T like the rest of her family but she missed them. A LOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I want to play this one\" Judy said, leaning forward as the rest of the group (plus Eugene, who was retrieving his piece from the floor after it had bounced off his still-red face and shook him out of his stupor), looked at their pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before any of them could get a good look, Judy had typed in 'START' and pressed enter on the game's keyboard, and the group felt a collective giddy rush fill their bodies as they began laughing. And laughing. And laughing even more as two voices took on a higher pitch as tears filled their eyes and the world became a blurry mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the laughter subsided and the group cleared the tears from their eyes they realized that they were NOT in the dorm's common room any longer, but instead a rather...frilly looking living room that was covered in throw pillows, doilies on a large coffee table, and the strong smell of incense as some kind of soft music played in the background. And THEY had most definitely changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a overweight male geek, a skinny rainbow haired sorority girl, a big breasted goth and a hulking jock, there now were four women sitting in a loose circle, each of them resembling their token piece.</span></div></div>",

His look, however, just earned him a poke in the ribs as the prim and proper goth gave Lindsey a polite smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wasn't really comfortable with those anyway\" She said cheerily. In truth she herself was getting a bit tired of the constant back and forth but she was certain that they'd some options that appealed to everyone. Or at least, to Lindsey and Eugene, who she was really sticking it out for. They were so CUTE together! And in her, admittingly limited experience, game nights were ALWAYS a good way to break the ice and get Eugene more comfortable with talking around his crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm not really a card player so that works for me\" Eugene said, leaning over the keyboard and typing in the command to load more Simulation options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine made an electronic click as new game modes loaded in, and the group (minus Peter) leaned in to see what the new options were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Household?

But how are we supposed to have a party with just four people? We need, like, a bunch of people! Like that party before Christmas Break!

There was a sound of mechanical whirling before the game shouted out \"CHOOSE GAME MODE\" and two large black buttons popped up from the surface of the game console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" Peter groaned, looking up long enough to see the buttons labeled as 'Traditional' and 'Immersive'. He felt like he'd been stuck in a discussion loop for months at this point. \"Guys, I honestly do not care, just pick something\" The athlete closed his eyes and just hoped the pizza would get here soon. That'd be a good chance to sneak back to his room or get the group to do something else other than just sit here fawning over a hunk of outdated plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, SO dramatic!\" Judy said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, what are these modes again Genie?\" Lindsey said as she leaned back against Eugene's legs and mentally grinned as the little nerd's body tightened up once more. This was WAY too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, they, uh\" Eugene stuttered as his words failed him. He finally just grabbed the game box and handed it to Lindsey, pointing a sausage-like finger at the game type descriptions. His crush took the box and nestled further against his legs as she poured over the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, Traditional mode prints out a gameboard based on the choice and we just roll dice and get to the middle and stuff. We gotta do like actions and challenges when we land on different spaces. Immersive mode just sounds like Dungeons and Dragons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never played that\" Judy said apprehensively. She knew it was wrong, but after spending her entire life around highly conservative individuals whose idea of a 'proper' game was basically Sorry! she couldn't help but hear her grandma's voice calling DnD 'satan's game'. \"I, um, don't know if we should...\" She began, but was cut off by Lindsey's chipper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry JR! Like, Eugene and I have played it so we'll help you out! Hey Petey, have you played before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but don't care\" Was all the rainblonde got from the beached athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we'll help you too! Right Genie?\" Lindsey reached up and gave Eugene's knee a squeeze, and there was just a mumble as the geek buried his head and double chin in his shirt as his face continued to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm okay with whatever you guys want to do. Just be patient with me if we do the Immersive one okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like f'sure! No probs Jude!

There's another button!\" The teen heaved his bulk forward to inspect the worn looking button, \"...What is Hybrid Mode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, new stuff!\" Lindsey cooed, eyeing the button and then turning back to the box in her hands, \"So, um, Hybrid Mode is like a combination of Traditional AND Immersive modes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, it's like the word hybrid doesn't imply a combination of the two\" Peter snarked from his location on the couch, but the group ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, it looks like we'll be playing in a Immersive mode...But we also role dice to move forward? There's, like, not really alot here...\" Lindsey squinted as the text faded away into blank cardboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's just something for everyone?\" Judy said with a hopeful shrug.

Or maybe a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preferably before the pizza gets here\" Peter added in from across the common room, and everyone's stomach growled in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, OMG!\" Lindsey giggled at the gutteral gurgles and then nodded in agreement, her pigtails bobbed in a cascade of different colored hair, \"Uh huh, you paid the money so you pick Genie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Eugene a moment to regain his composure, taking a breath to steady his...nerves before he leaned forward and pressed the large button that had 'Immersive' stenciled in chipped white text on the top. The button creaked downwards back into the game's yellowed plastic case until there was a loud CLICK and the button locked in place and a loud metallic grinding noise began, along with a harsh, bitter smell that began pouring out of the game's interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh, what stinks?\" Peter looked up from his space on the couch, his face wrinkled in disgust as Judy leaned back against her boyfriend, her nostrils pinched shut with two purple topped fingers, and Eugene waved a heavy hand in front of his concerned looking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, however, was relatively unaffected. \"Oh, it's just, like, hot resin! I wonder if this is a 3D printer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arn't those things new or something? Like didn't they just get invented like ten years ago?\" Judy mumbled from behind the small protection her shirt offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, JR, they were actually invented in like 1985! But I've never seen one so small and this one is totes small!\" Lindsey's eyes, despite watering, were large and curious as a cat's, the device in front of her having tripped her electrical engineering trigger. Old machines from the 80s and junk were the BEST, they were almost always different on the inside! Even though the rainblonde had only lived through the digital touchscreen era, there was something sad about how analogue technology had largely gone the way of the dinosaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning smell eventually receded, and with a loud DING, a large tray slid out from the lower section of the game, and the group, minus Peter (who had gotten bored once more and went back to doing his best impression of a motionless log on the couch) leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DISTRIBUTE AVATARS AND PRESS ENTER\" The game buzzed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" Lindsey cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the tray, was a surprisingly deep pile of primary colored plastic figurines, with four sitting in a tiny holder above the rest. There was a tall figure in a business suit and a briefcase, another tall figure that was in a clear, 'classic homemaker' styled dress, and two smaller much smaller figures that were identical in size, but one wore a ballcap while the other clutched tightly at what looked like a stuffed bear. The style they were printed in reminded Judy of the older black and white 1950s sitcoms she'd watch on Nick at Nite with her grandma and grandpa when she was a little girl. It was about the only TV she'd been allowed to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately below those were another set of figurines, though these were vastly different. One was a refrigerator, a toaster, a vacuum cleaner and a old rotary styled telephone. There were more figurines that were associated with the 'Household' theme of the chosen game in the pile below, all jumbled together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, THESE look stereotypical\" Lindsey said with barely contained snark as she poked the four figurines on the stand. The figurines had a LOT of detail, almost better than some modern 3D printers but Lindsey noticed the faces and...Well outside of their apparel and accessories the little plastic people had no real defining details. But still, she couldn't help but feel a little miffed by the fact that once again she felt like she was going to be forced into a set gender role. The figure with the briefcase had to be the Husband, right? So the figure in the dress was the Housewife, and the two smaller figures had to be the Son and Daughter. Sure it was just a game and Lindsey wasn't THAT much of a crusader over gender roles (especially with how she herself dressed most of the time), but she was still coming to terms with her own identity and the fact that she was somewhat of a minority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would it kill this game to have had gender neutral roles?' She thought darkly. Instead she turned her disappointed gaze towards the small plastic appliances. Now THOSE looked a little more interesting, if only because they were so vague. What would a simulation with just appliances be like? Like would it be a DnD game about making a perfect breakfast or something? OH! Or maybe, like, that old movie The Brave Little Toaster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool how detailed they are! They look like those little army men toys!\" Judy said with a grin, not noticing the frown on her female friend's face. She did, however, notice Eugene eyeing what was clearly the 'man of the house'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Judy got an awful, wonderful and perfect idea. She glanced at Peter, who was looking at his phone, probably playing some kind of football game or looking at sports news (not that there was much to report, sports having been shut down for the pandemic as well). He'd never notice if she...But the moral part of Judy won out. She couldn't just do it without giving him some kind of warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you don't just have to tell him everything...' A tiny, giggling little voice said from the more shadowy part of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just hand out these things and we can play?\" She asked quietly, casting a look at Eugene and Lindsey before motioning with her eyes towards Peter, bringing a finger to her dark lips. A grin grew on Lindsey's face, but it took the heavy-set geek a moment to realize what was happening before his eyes widened in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah we just, uh...We just pick them up and I type in the player order and hit enter, that starts the game\" Eugene explained, and tried not to yelp as Lindsey poked him in his Pillsbury Dough-Boy gut and gave him a look as Peter's eyes flickered off the tiny screen of his phone, \"Oof! I mean, since it's a simulation I don't think player order means anything. Sims just, uh, you just play until the scenario ends. Or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of collective breaths being held as Peter glanced sidelong at the group, his eyes flickering towards the machine for a long moment and Judy and Lindsey sincerely hoped the bulk of the machine was blocking the figure choices...Before the athlete yawned and looked back at his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it doesn't matter then I don't care what I am. I just want to play or we all get some common sense and stop TALKING about playing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to ease Judy's conscience. Her boyfriend, much as she was attracted to him and his muscles, was being enough of a pain that he deserved having some just desserts with his sour apples. Judy and Lindsey shared a grin with a still somewhat confused Eugene as they reached out and picked their pieces, leaving the last one for Peter, since, by his own admission, didn't care what he played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't complain if he's not paying attention!' Judy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends reached forward and selected...</span></div></div>",

He didn't know what but even if Peter was being a little bit of an ass about the game taking too long to set up...The big palooka was Eugene's only actual friend he had on campus. Well, guy friend. There was always the fact that his crush was sitting right next to him (or on him, at points) and Judy...But to be honest Judy felt more like a big sister/cool aunt/group mom than a friend, which was weird given her gothy-punk appearance. But with everything Peter had done to help Eugene out the past few months and helping Eugene get out of the shell that had formed around the flabby teen during his previous years of constant active and passive bullying, he felt like Pete deserved a warning of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Lindsey curled herself around his legs, stared at him with a pair of blue, serious eyes and gave him a rather insistent poke on the top of his knee, and any thought of warning Peter vanished as Eugene began typing in the information and hit enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGINNING SIMULATION: A HOUSE MAKES A HOME\" The game blared out, cheesy, poorly mixed music that sounded like a blend of black &amp; white comedy and a late 80s/early 90s sitcom coming out of a hidden speaker and WAY too loud. But the sound wasn't the most alarming part, instead it was the prickly feeling that was accompanying the sudden HEAVY wave of disorientation that was washing over Eugene and making the world spin like a bad camera transition. The sound of TV static began to drown out all other noise as the world went black, and the last thing that Eugene heard before the world left him entirely was the game's voice saying;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FILMED BEFORE A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was a pop, like the sound of an old tube-TV turning off, and the world faded to a pinprick...Before rapidly expanding outward to reveal that the dorm's common area had been changed to resemble a well kept living room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my head\" Eugene muttered, and despite the pounding in his skull and the dizziness the geek still felt, his eyes shot open as he realized that not only was he somewhere entirely different, but HE was different as well!

It was as that moment he realized he had been dreaming the whole thing. Buying the game, turning it on, picking options with his friends...everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd obviously at some point in the dream, he had sleepwalked and ended up standing in front of the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his face, Eugene was just happy he hadn't woken up by walking into the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene suddenly froze, startled by the face looking back at him. The face both belonged to him and didn't belong to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene had only just started growing facial hair recently, and really only needed to shave every few days. He was religious about doing so, however, as his facial hair was spotty at best, only showing up in certain places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face looking back at him, though, looked as if it hadn't shaved in a couple of days, and if left unchecked, would grow a full beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eugene lifted his shirt, it felt like the scene in the first Spiderman movie with Tobey Maguire, where Peter Parker lifts his shirt the first morning after being bitten by the radioactive spider. Eugene's flabby torso and small potbelly had disappeared., replaced with a male gymnast's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene looked around and found he wasn't in his dorm room. Well, the room looked like his room, but it wasn't. Eugene's real room was meant for double occupancy, and Eugene only had it to himself because of the pandemic. This room was definitely a single.  The sink was in its own little alcove, and had been joined by a toilet and an enclosed shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Eugene's stuff was still in the room, but there were other things there as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his desk was an old style coffee can, the inside bottom of which was barely covered with a handful of coins. Next to the can was a plastic cover with holes uniformly cut into it. Next to that was an old style ledger book that looked to be a hundred years old. There was also a model spaceship on the desk, and it took Eugene a few seconds to recognize it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIIuThdtDLA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIIuThdt...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Spindrift, the spaceship from the show <b>Land of the Giants</b>, from the late sixties/early seventies. Eugene only knew the show because at the last Comicon he went to, there was a booth with a couple of guys who were trying to crowdfund a remake of the show on Youtube. Eugene had hunted down the show on the internet, watched a couple of episodes, and sent in five dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the best of his knowledge, the whole project was still in the \"pre-production\" phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also three very realistic looking action figures on the desk, all about six inches high. Two of them were characters from <b>Land of the Giants</b>: one of them the actress or celebrity or heiress or something, the other one the fat middle-aged confidence man. Eugene didn't really remember the show that well:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mainstreamspanking.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/03-valerie-fitzhugh.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://mainstreamspanking.files.wordpre...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third action figure was an Orion slave girl from <b>Star Trek</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/c/ca/Orion_slavegirl_ENT.jpg/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/450?cb=20041031181901&amp;path-prefix=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memo...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the third action figure confounded Eugene more than all the other changes to his dorm room. Eugene had action figures at his home (he was smart enough not to bring them with him to college) of different genres, but he kept them all within their own category. He didn't have any <b>Land of the Giants</b> stuff, but if he did, he would have kept it all together and seperate. He certainly wouldn't mix in any of his <b>Star Trek</b> stuff with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if Eugene did mix them all together, he would have kept things separated by era. The original <b>Star Trek</b> did broadcast about the same time as <b>Land of the Giants</b>, and the animated series came on a few years later, but the Orion Slave Girl action figure was from the <b>Enterprise</b> series, Season Four. So no way would he keep all three of those action figures together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene was about to see what else was different in this world he found himself in, when something even weirder happened. The action figures were jumping up and down, trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven weirder, when he got closer, he found he could hear their voices as if they were full sized. There was nothing tiny or tinny about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene listen in shocked wonder as he discovered the tiny action figures weren't action figures at all, but were tiny people. Very tiny specific people, in fact. They were his friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Writer's note: Though none of the four players in the immersive game know it, Pete is in the body of Alexander B, Fitzhugh, and Lindsey is in the body of Valerie Scott, both characters on the show <b>Land of the Giants</b>. The slave girl pictured was never named in the <b>Enterprise</b> episode \"Bound,\" but non-canonical sources list her name as Neras. Judy is in her body.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat, older guy was Pete, the hot young redhead was Lindsey, and the hot green woman was Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking to them, Eugene discovered that they had all \"woken up\" at about the same time as Eugene had. Well, maybe a few minutes earlier. They had had a chance to sort out who was who, and were about to go explore the insides of the spaceship (which looked full sized to them) when Eugene walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was pretty easy to figure out who you were,\" Judy laughed. \"It was like seeing a Eugene billboard. But I have to admit, you look good, stud!\" Lindsey nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy, Lindsey and Pete had also had time to deduce they were somehow in the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean we must be in the game,\" Eugene agreed. \"And most of this could be a seventies TV science fiction show. Except for Judy's character. She's a depiction of a character from a show thirty years later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the concept of the Orion Slave Girl originated earlier,\" Lindsey countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was in a show that was completely in the sixties,\" Eugene argued. \"And I thought if we picked seven, it would be shows from the seventies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete interrupted Eugene and Lindsey before they got completely syfy geeky on him.  But Pete wasn't happy to begin with. Lindsey and Judy were both happy with the bodies they appeared in. Judy especially liked being totally green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete did not enjoy being this potbellied old guy. It was even worse that not only had Eugene got to keep his own body, but it was one that twelve times the height of Pete, and was an upgraded version as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care if everything is consistent or whatever,\" Pete groused. \"I just want out of this stupid game. How are we going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene chose that moment to pick up</span></div></div>",

It was a family run business off the main thoroughfare, with the rides in good shape, if dated, and the park mascots based on cartoon characters that had been second tier when they were new. Eugene's mother was a little embarrassed at first, since Eugene's family had been going to parks like Disney World and Universal Studios only a few years earlier. Now this small amusement park was all that she could afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter to Eugene. He had the time of his life that weekend, which allowed his mother to enjoy herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what the amusement park looked like that Eugene found himself at the entrance pf. It looked like an amusement park that had started its life half a century ago. One that had never been updated or had new rides added to it, but one which its owners had lovingly tended . Through the entrance, Eugene could see a couple of rollercoasters, a classic merry-go-round, a log flume, and other rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Eugene had found himself at the entrance of such an amusement park was only one of the mysteries that the freshman was having to deal with. Eugene's appearance had also changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/uKcmCUcb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/uKcmCUcb.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene knew he wasn't in the best shape he could be. But the body he was in now was in excellent shape. He was six foot four, older than he was in real life, but not that much older. He was leanly muscled, and Eugene's sloppy straight hair had been replaced with a head full of curls. Eugene only had to shave maybe twice a week, but rubbing the face he now owned, he could tell this guy definitely had to shave once a day, and hadn't shaved since early that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene? Pete? Is that you?\" a feminine voice asked. Eugene turned to see the owner of the voice belonged to a brunette about a foot shorter than him. The brunette in question was wearing some kind of weird bikini that looked to be made of feathers or an animal print or something. She was also wearing high heels, as well as anklets made out of the same material as her bikini. The whole get up was \"crowned\" with a plume of feathers attached to the seat of her bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit may have been bizarre, but there was no denying the brunette wearing the outfit looked hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpRhTWjj2OE\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpRhTWjj...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Eugene,\" Eugene answered, tapping himself on the chest. \"Lindsey?\" Eugene asked, cocking his head to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy,\" the brunette answered, looking down at herself. The body was smaller and slimmer than the one Judy had in the real world. The breasts were two cups smaller (Judy wore a DD bra). But she had to admit the more petite body was in better shape than her own. Pete never said anything, but Judy knew her boyfriend considered her a little \"chunky.\" She wondered what Pete would think of this new body. And what was up with this feather duster superglued to her bikini bottoms? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really weird,\" another feminine voice said. \"Awesome, but weird.\" A young beautiful blonde walked up, wearing a sequined outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/8mdHMp5_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/8mdHMp5_d.webp?maxwi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey?\" Judy asked hesitantly. The blonde nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do recognize this body, don't you, Judy?\" Lindsey said, turning around for her friend to get a better look at. Pete took the opportunity to eye his transformed friend as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris Munroe, Circus of Terror,\" Judy said excitedly, then frowned. \"But I thought this was an eighties game, and that episode was filmed in 1977 or 1978.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the show didn't end until 1981, but yeah, it does seem like a semi-anachronism,\" Lindsey conceded. \"I don't recognize your character,\" Lindsey continued, pointing to Judy, \"But I recognize the actor your character is basked on,\" she told Eugene. \"You look like a younger version of the guy who was on that show Baywatch. You know, the TV show that the Rock did a movie remake about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eugene could get Lindsey to clarify her answer a little more, a semi-lisping accented voice complained, \"This shit isn't funny, Geno, It isn't funny at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bM0K7hA_d.webp?maxwidth=728&amp;fidelity=grand\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/bM0K7hA_d.webp?maxwi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe complaint came from an olive skinned man, who couldn't be more than four foot tall, wearing a white suit. Eugene asked hesitantly, \"Pete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me,\" Eugene growsed. \"How the hell is this game doing this to me, and how do we end it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends continue their discussion about their situation<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the four friends talked about how real this immersion version game felt (with Pete emphatically repeating how he wanted the game to end right now), a feminine voice shouted out, \"Eugene, how are you enjoying the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/43/18/76/43187674288a06dab9748523eb12a75c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/43/18/76/43187...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's the girl who sold me the game!\" Eugene told his friends. \"Well, she wasn't dressed like that when she sold me the game, but still, that's her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the brunette walking toward the four friends didn't dress like a harem girl in public didn't come as a shock to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEugene and the girls had a hundred questions about the game for the brunette, but they were interrupted by Pete charging right at the brunette, demanding that she end this game right here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Pete would have charged her, if the brunette didn't fold her arms, give her head a quick jerk, and blink her eyes as she turned to face Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was that Pete froze in mid-stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about your boyfriend,\" the brunette told Judy. \"But I need to explain how the game works, and I knew he was just going to keep interrupting me because he doesn't like his starting avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're an in-game moderator,\" Lindsey asked. \"And you look like this in real life?\" The question was made with a gesture toward the brunette's appearance. When the brunette nodded, Lindsey asked, \"Has anyone ever told you look like---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette interrupted Lindsey, \"She actually looks like me, but yes, they tell me that all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy thought that was a weird answer, but she was more interested in this amazingly realistic game. \"So we're in this game now,\" Judy began. \"Just how is this possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proprietary technology,\" the brunette answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wanted to press the matter, but got the feeling that was going to be the best answer she got from the brunette. \"So we're in the game now. Where's the exit option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to exit the game is for one of you to win it,\" the brunette answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do we do that?\" Eugene asked. Pete might want out of the game, and Judy was probably trying to be sympathetic toward her boyfriend, but Eugene found this virtual reality's realism mindblowing. He wanted to play this game and see where it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll want to read the rules,\" the brunette smiled. She did the cross arm blinking thing again, and a large scrolled parchment appeared. The scroll unrolled, revealing the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>Welcome to Third Wish 80s Television Edition</b></u></div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">We hope you enjoy your gaming experience! Now here are the rules!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Each of the rides represents an event that one or more of the game participants may participate in. Depending on how well you do in the event, you can earn a number of tickets. Tickets may be redeemed at any vendor's booth for in-game prizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Do well enough at an event, and you will win a golden ticket. Golden tickets are not redeemable for in-game prizes. However, if you accumulate nine golden tickets, you may present them at any vendor booth. When presenting the tickets, simply say \"Morphmanji\" and you will end the game and win a prize. The in-game moderator will explain what the prize is at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) All tickets, including golden tickets, are non-transferable among game participants. Attempting to transfer tickets will subject those involved to a penalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Theft of tickets from another game participant will result in a <b>severe</b> penalty for the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Every participant begins the game with five lives. If you do poorly enough in an event, it may result in the loss of one life. If the participant incurs a severe penalty, it may result in the loss of one or more lives. Game participants may redeem regular tickets at any vendor booths for a life, but may not exceed more than the beginning five lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Participants may enter any event repeatedly. However, the event will differ each time it is entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) All avatars will be characters from television shows in existence from 1980 to 1989. They will be eighteen years of age or older and human. They will not deviate from the appearance of the avatar as he or she appeared in the television show they appeared in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8) All avatar changes will only occur at vendor booths when tickets are presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9) Rules are available for review when participants are not in an event. Simply say \"Rules\"  and they will appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10) Additional rules will be explained as necessary</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends (even frozen Pete) reviewed the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any questions?\" the brunette asked as she made the rules disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens when we lose all five lives?\" Eugene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure that won't happen,\" the brunette answered evasively. \"Anyway, let me take you to one of the vendor booths.\" With the crossed arm blinking eye method of hers, the brunette teleported the group to the middle of the park. They found themselves in front of a booth with a popcorn machine, a hot dog and bun warmer, drink dispensers and other foot and drink machines. Stuffed animals were hanging along the outside of the booth. Inside the booth was an attendee with a blank look on his face who seemed absolutely uninterested in the arrival of the brunette and the four friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/5f/00/265f0001fdd258839f59c323bc2771af.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/5f/00/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the booth attendee was the following sign:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Food, drink and stuffed animals are absolutely free. Just ask for what you want. And don't worry, all the food and drink are zero calorie. So eat and drink as little or as much as you want. It won't alter the appearance of your avatar in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember, golden tickets may only be redeemable to win the game, and you must have nine to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegular tickets are redeemed at the following rate:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandom Avatar Change -- Ten Tickets<br>\r\nRandom Avatar Change with one Trait specified (i.e., Gender, Age, etc,) -- Twenty Tickets<br>\r\nRandom Skill for Avatar -- (i.e., climbing rocks, dancing, etc.) -- Thirty Tickets<br>\r\nSpecific Avatar Change, in-game -- Fifty Tickets<br>\r\nSpecific Skill for Avatar -- Seventy-five Tickets<br>\r\nOne Additional Life (may not exceed five lives) -- One Hundred Tickets<br>\r\nLock in Avatar and Skill Change for Out-of-Game Experience -- Two Hundred Tickets<br>\r\n(Updates are Twenty Tickets each)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvatar changes and knowledge of newly acquired skills is instantaneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver Tickets will be identified when presented. Players will be given the opportunity to redeem them or dispose of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember, you can only make changes to your Avatar, and not that of another player's. In addition, your Avatar only begins with the skills that the Player themselves possesses. Also, tickets are non-transferrable among players.</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are silver tickets?\" Eugene asked, turning around to the brunette. \"And what's this lock in for an out of game experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette didn't answer, because she had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\" Pete shouted, finally able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting Pete calmed down, the four agreed the only course of action seemed to be for one of them to finish the game. That meant that the four had to start riding rides to try to win these golden tickets they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which one of the rides should we start with? Judy asked. The four discussed it further, and decided to ride</span></div></div>",

The more people who participate in an event, the more chances we have to get some of those golden tickets, and the quicker we can end this game and get us back to the real world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy didn't tell her boyfriend that she was enjoying the game. She was getting tired of her \"goth phase,\" as she was calling it, and the game body gave her a break from it. Plus, the game body was in better shape than her real one, even if it was older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy also wanted a little break from Pete. Not counting the short time that dark haired harem girl had frozen Pete, he had been bitching nonstop since arriving in the game. Yeah, okay, the avatar he got stuck with sucked, but couldn't he let the rest of them have fun? And anyway, if he won some tickets, he could get a new avatar. And it was just a game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only problem is how to get rid of this rooster tail without ripping out the seat of my bikini bottoms,\" Judy said, pointing at the plumage on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the game had heard her, the feathers disappeared on her bikini bottom. The collar around her neck, and the feather anklets also  disappeared, and her high heels transformed themselves into sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone heard your complaint,\" Lindsey added. Her sequined outfit had turned itself into a 1950s style bikini, with her high heels being replaced by sandals, and the collar around her neck disappearing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car had appeared just outside the tunnel. The car was narrow, with three seats in a row. Lindsey took the lead seat, Judy the middle one, and Eugene climbed into the rear seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be out in no time, Pete,\" Lindsey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting,\" Pete replied. \"As if I got a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car started off with a clank, and the doors to the tunnel opened. As soon as the car entered the tunnel and the doors closed behind it, the neon sign in front of the ride morphed into the shape of three people, two women and a man. One woman was lying down on her back, her legs spread. The second woman was kneeling on her hands and knees and had her head buried between the first woman's legs. The man in the picture appeared to be taking the second woman from behind. The name of the tunnel changed itself from the Tunnel of Knowledge to the Tunnel of Humping. Over the park's speaker system was a voice that sounded like Eugene's saying, \"Damn, Pete, but Judy has got one nice, tight pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Pete flew into a rage would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(At this point, whose adventures should the Reader follow?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">After another boring day of lock-down due to the global pandemic in the town of Gunner's Butte, Colorado, four college friends find themselves out of work, their classes cancelled and one of the lucky handful of students that are too poor or simply unable to go home that get to stay in their campus dorms. With nothing to do and their former party school now anything but, the quartet of geeky Eugene, peppy Lindsey, jockish Peter and gothy Judy spend their days being bored out of their minds until one of them returns from the nearby mall with something interesting and new in his hands...A board game? Or at least, something that looks like a really old computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anything else to do, the group settles down to spend the evening playing this strange game called Morphmanji, and all of them in for a unexpectedly exciting (and potentially dangerous) ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>-Rules of the Game-<br>\r\n</b></u></div><br>\r\nMorphamanji is a unique game in that it can be programmed to suit almost any form of setting. From fantasy to sci fi and EVERYTHING in between, the game has nearly limitless customization options to give players a unique experience and different scenarios every time the game is played. It also has two modes of play: Traditional and 'Immersive', each with their own rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><u><b>-Traditional Gameplay Rules-</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">-Each player chooses their avatar and must play as that avatar for the duration of the game or are given the option (or command) to change via an Action Square or a Special Card.<br>\r\n-Players move via dice rolls performed by a single six-sided dice roll. Singles and double rolls get a second turn.<br>\r\n-Players can roll one at a time or simultaneously.<br>\r\n-Players that roll a 6 must always pull a Challenge Card even if they land on an Action Square.<br>\r\n-All players must pull a Challenge Card every three turns.<br>\r\n-Action Squares: Action Squares will generate randomized encounter or challenge for the player that lands on them. The player is not allowed to roll again until they have completed the action or challenge. Action Squares can involve one or all participants.<br>\r\n-Challenge Cards: Challenge Cards act in the same manner as Action Squares. Challenge cards are also randomly generated and are not marked on the game map and can occur at any time. Challenge Cards can be far more specific in action or encounter and can affect one or all players.<br>\r\n-All players much reach the end of the game before the game may end. Players who reach the end of the game map are immune and exempt from all dice, Action Square or Challenge Card effects.<br>\r\n-Any attempts to alter the natural flow of play will result in the offending player being issued a Penalty Card and sent back six spaces. Offending players must follow the instructions or consequences of the Penalty Card before they may roll again.<br>\r\n-All morphs that occur during the game are permanent until the game ends. If any player quits the game voluntarily, they will not be able to revert or otherwise change themselves back (unless they initiate a new game).<br>\r\n-The longer the game, the more complete the change. The longer games last, the more likely that 'personality bleeding' from the chosen avatar on to the player's psyche will occur.<br>\r\n-When all players have reached the end, they must shout 'Morphmanji!', eliminating any and all transformative effects on them.<br>\r\n-The player that reached the end first is the winner and is granted one wish.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><u><b>-Immersive Mode-<br>\r\n</b></u></div><br>\r\nIn Immersive Mode, all players will be transported the the game world, taking the form and role of their avatar. Players must follow the prompts and clues in order to progress the scenario's story and be able to exit the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">-Players are given five lives to be used during the adventure.<br>\r\n-Players can gain additional lives through completing bonus objectives.<br>\r\n-Players that lose lives will adopt more traits of their avatars as punishment.<br>\r\n-Players that lose all lives will become part of the game world and no longer treated as players.<br>\r\n-Players can be transformed through various means, items, events and opposing characters.<br>\r\n-Players can find and equip items to improve their avatar abilities.<br>\r\n-Successfully navigating scenario events can award players with unique items and abilities.<br>\r\n-To end the game, the players must navigate the entire scenario from start to finish and declare 'Morphmanji' upon completion of the scenario. <br>\r\n-Upon completion, all players that have not used up their lives will be returned to their original world. Players that use up all their lives will remain in the game world permanently.<br>\r\n-the player to declare 'Morphmanji' will be given one wish.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>-Interactive Rules-</b></u></div><br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Read before posting</div></b><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Failure to adhere to these rules will result in content being deleted.</b><br>\r\n<b>As owner of this Interactive, I reserve the right to make edits to content or remove any content deemed unsuitable for this Interactive without any prior notice.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.
