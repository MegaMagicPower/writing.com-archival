Today, you begin your new life as a Mythimon Trainer! For as long as you could remember, you wanted to be the Grand Mythimon Champion, and today, you take your first step to making that dream a reality! Bidding your parents goodbye, and promising to call them every so often, you stand on the threshold of your home's front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you take the literal first step of your journey, stepping into the front porch before proceeding down the walkway and to the sidewalk before going straight to the lab of local Mythimon Expert, Professor Fycus. Along the way, you have a run in with your long time enemy, Brad. He sneers in your direction as you pass him sitting on the front porch of his house. The two of you have never really liked each other, and he would always take any chance he got to humiliate and insult you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore him as he shouts some insult as you walk past. You are not going to let him ruin today for you. Finally, you reach Fycus's lab. You knock on the door, and the professor answers. \"Ah, yes! I've been expecting you!\" He says as he ushers you inside. He hands you a small handheld device, like a smartphone. \"This is a Mythidex.\" He explains \"It contains all the information on every Mythimon that we know of. Just point it at any Mythimon you meet, and it'll tell you all about it. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he pulls out three Mythispheres, releasing the Mythimon inside. Before you stands a foxlike creative with an almost firey tinge to it's fur, a short humanoid figure that seemed to be made from liquid, and what looked to be a small infant with tiny leaves poking out from spots on it's green skin, as well as a flower sprouting from the top of it's head. You pull out the mythidex and point it at each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firey Kitsune. This Mythimon can summon flames to cover it's entire body in an attempt to scare away enemies. If that fails, it will charge at them, trying to light them ablaze.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Sprite. Commonly seen around lakes and ponds. Prefers fresh, clean water. If it's home becomes polluted, it will evaporate into the air as water vapor, and search for new cleaner body of water.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mandrake. Can communicate with and command other forms of plantlife, such as attacking it's enemies or creating camouflage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, which will it be?\" Fycus asks.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the world of Mythimon! Here, humans coexist alongside creatures known as Mythimon. Many people keep Mythimon as pets, as well as battle with them. There's even a whole Mythimon Battle League, dedicated to the art of training and battling with these creatures to be the greatest of them all! Before you begin your journey, you must first know, what exactly is a Mythimon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Mythimon is any kind of creature that is considered able to be captured and trained to obey the commands of it's master, via devices known as Mythispheres. Mythimon come in all kinds of forms and types, with some of them even able to speak human speech. The list of known Mythimon basic types are as follows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyro<br>\r\nAqua <br>\r\nPlant<br>\r\nEarth<br>\r\nThunder<br>\r\nSpirit<br>\r\nInsect<br>\r\nMagic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to capture a wild Mythimon, you must first weaken it through battle, then throw a Mythisphere at it. In order to enter the the Mythimon Battle League, and qualify to enter Battle League Grand Tournament, you must first train your Mythimon to defeat the nine Masters of each Dojo scattered across the continent. Do so, and they will reward you with an official League Medal. Collect all nine, and you qualify to enter the Grand Tournament! After that, only even greater challenges await you, because to become the Grand Champion you must face the four strongest trainers in the land, known as the Final Four, before you earn the right to challenge the Grand Champion for their title. If you manage to do so, you will have proven yourself as the greatest Mythimon trainer who ever lived! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, first thing's first. You have to get yourself your first Mythimon! Head on over to Professor Fycus's lab and see what he has for you! Good luck on your journey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is actually a repost of an old story I had on a previous account. Feel free to add your own types of Mythimon not on the list, as well as any kind of mythical beasts you can think of. Enjoy the story!)<br>\r\n</td>",
