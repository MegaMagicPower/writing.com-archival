Your life is filled with fantasy because you have little else to go on. The other kids at school think you are either odd or some kind of strange nub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou amuse yourself by daydreaming that the lamp contains a real genie. To be funny you rub the lamp, and your jaw drops as you see smoke actually come out of the lamp! Sure enough, there is a pretty woman standing in front of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you and says, \"Yes, I am real, but no, don't think you will be allowed to have sex with me, I don't have to do that.\" You start to ask questions, but she cuts you off, \"Don't be rude! I am not done yet! Now, you do get three wishes, but it is not like you think. You tell me what you want, and I make the wish for you. No exceptions! Other than killing someone, there are few limits. If you hit one, I will tell you. So what do you want for your first wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are drooling as you look at her! \"Really! Oh wow! Um, a girl. I want a girl like Kari Tsukumo from YU-Gi-Oh, only with red hair and green eyes. I want to be able to touch her anywhere I want, any time I want, and she will make me popular in school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie smiled, \"Hmmm. There is a lot to that wish, but popular, well that I can understand. The kids at school probably think you are a nub.\" That stung you. She goes on, \"But you don't want to be. *Sigh* But you want to be able to touch this girls body any place you want any time you want? Hmmm.\" She paused, \"Okay. I got it. Your first wish, coming right up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did something you could not see, then the world began to spin around you. You had a hard time standing, but when it stopped, and you could see normally again, things were odd. First, as you looked around your room, it was very different. In fact, it was a girl's room! You could see a vanity with makeup, a pink bed and pink curtains on the window, and much more. You looked at the genie and start to ask, \"Hey, what is goin..g\u2026 what is with my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see that you now have breasts! Long red hair flows around your shoulders! You reach between your legs and confirm, \"I am a girl! You made me a girl! That is not what I wanted! Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"Yes, it is what you wanted. In this body you will easily be popular, and the only way you can touch a girl anywhere you want anytime you want, is if you are in her body, so that fulfills your wish.\" She looks you over, \"You are very pretty, but even if you want to, you can't undo a wish for twenty-four hours. You can make a new one though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the mirror and see a young, sexy girl staring back at you. You ask the genie, \"How can I be a girl? What about Joey? What about my family? Nobody will know me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"You think my magic is that weak? Reality has changed. You were born a girl and named Kari, no Joey. So you have the same parents, but to them, you are and always have been Kari Le.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your breasts, but what about my friends? What about Sam? How can he be my friend now?</span></div></div>",

Why would I use a line like that?\u201d Joey, now Kari, asked, before gasping in realization. \u201cD-did you make Sam into my boyfriend?! Gross!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is your boyfriend, and he\u2019s much more handsome than before, so you both are better off now. Breaking up with such a nice boy like him would be a mistake. He could be \u2018the one\u2019 after all.\u201d The genie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-the one?! B-but we\u2019re both guys!\u201d Kari exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, even you know the differences between the male and female anatomy. Do you even remotely look like a guy now?\u201d The genie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, no, but I still have the mind of a guy!\u201d Kari insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least take a look at your new bf, you might like what you see.\u201d The genie pointed at a picture frame sitting on the nightstand next to her bed. A picture frame that definately wasn\u2019t there before her wish. Kari was about to protest, but glimpsed at the photo in the picture frame anyway.</span></div></div>",

She knew that they were far more powerful than wizards, even one of the most powerful ones,like Merlin of years past. Hours past while she read.  She even found a small two paragraphs on self -wishes genies.  Hermione thought that was interesting since many 'masters' do not always make wise decisions even with genies prompting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that if she had a genie, a self wishing genie would be best.  The next best would be one who would counsel her first before granting a  wish.  The library was about to close before she left to go back to the common room in her Gryffindor House.  Hermione gathered her belonging and headed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, Hermione noticed an open door in the Ancient Runes Studies room.  She was drawn inside by a voice.  Hermione said curiously  Hello, is someone calling my name?  There were no response.  Hermione started to leave when she saw a lamp in a box near the closet.  Hermione deduced correctly that it was a genie lamp.  She walked back there to examine it some more.   After a minute of pondering, Hermione said ' hope that I am making the right decision.' and opened the cork to the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione stood back  behind some desks while an orange smoke appeared that transformed into the self wishing genie..  the genie that appeared looked like </span></div></div>",

Nobody can see me unless I feel that it is best that he/she will see me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nervously said  ' Hi. I'm glad that I freed you but I'm rather uneasy about making any wishes.  I read enough on genies to know things can backfire.\" She paused 'Say, I need to call you something else beside genie. We already have a student named Ginni but she is not a genie. It was a name her parents gave her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe genie said  'Well, call me Minnie instead.....As for wishes, I am a different genie.  I am a self wishing genie.  I make the wishes on you.'

She frowned. She knew that part of the problem was Snape's cutting remarks and the taunts from the Slytherins.

He'd begged them to ground his for a year, or take away aall his videogames. Anything but no beuno nacho but they'd stayed firm in his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up the paper and stared at it. A Large red D staring back at him. It honestly wasn't his fault this time. Well okay it was a littl bit his fault. He should have known from last time that queestioning Barkin only resulted in more homework and man did he do some questioning yesterday. His bag was full to bursting as he'd been given more worksheets than there were pages in the oxford dictionary. Seriously I really mean that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd stayed up all night last night at his parents insistance and actually managed to get it done. It wasn't the best work considering doing that much homework in  less than a day you couldn't really aford to go into incredible depth. Unfortunatly that was not how Barkin saw it. It was like for every sentence that Ron wrote Barkin expected a dictionary's worth of words. Even though others handed in their homework had the same or slighty more written down than Ron himself. It just proved that Barkin was out to get him. So after walking Kim home as she talked about how easy the assignment was (for everyone else) he was trudging home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents wouldn't understand of course. Well his father could since the Stoppable men had always had unplesent experiences with the Barkin's for over a hundred years. His mom though always seemed ready to tear into him for any mistake he made. Completly ignoring oR downplaying his success's. To her he was like a mistake she seemed eager to remove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed deeply and continued to march towards his fate. Little did he know that in the next few seconds that something would happen that would change his life for better, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than likely worse though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay so how does Ron come across the genie</span></div></div>",

He was about to walk away when he stopped and looked at the garbage. If he didn't pick it up he knew the old man how lived here blaming him even though he wouldn't know if he'd done it or not. He'd just been blaming Ron ever since he was born and had a kid in the neighbourhood to yell at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grudginly picked up the garbage. Fortunatly nothing fell out the cans but the lid's had fell of letting the stink reach out and strangle his nose. He was about to put the lid on the last one when he noticed something catch his eye. He reached in and pulld out an old oil lamp like you'd see a genie pop out of. Covering the last of the can's he looke at the lamp strangly as he continued to his house next door. He unlocked the door and headed up to his room the lamp in one hand and his wet paper in the other. He put the paper over the radiator in hopes it would dry and looked at the lamp before smiling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ron stared weirded out by what he saw. He hardly expected an actual genie to pop out of the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this was his idea of a genie. He'd expected a girl in a belly dancers outfit or a big blue guy with no feet. Not this guy who looked like he lived in a videogame store. He was wearing an Everlot T-shirt had slicked back gelled hair and playing an old gameboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me.\" He sad nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie looked up at him briefly. A loud noise was heard from the gameboy before he looked down and turned off the old hand held with an annoyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude. You my new master?\" He asked in a surfer voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U h yeah. You really a genie? I was expecting someone a little more girly or another colour mabye.\" He said. The genie rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man don't get me started. I tried the whole 'big ghost' genie thing when I started around 2,000 B.C. I went with a good shade of red for my skin. But after a while when the master's started to get less and less till we were lucky to get one a century we got together and decided we didn't need to put in the effort anymore and just do the buisness without any of the flash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call a mini thunderstorm Not flashy?\" Ron said incredously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It came with the lamp. I can't turn it off. Names Bob by the way\" The genie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob the genie?\" He said with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie just looked at him annoyed. \"Hey you want your lifetime of wish's to get started or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay I'm.\" He stopped as he mentally went over what Bob said. \"Lifetime of wish's. What happened to three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay here's the thing. As soon as the wish's stop I get sucked into the lamp and sent somewhere until someone else worthy find's me. Which is why I was in the trash by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why a solid gold lamp was in the trash.\" Ron butted in. Bob nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So anyway I like the outside world a lot. Last time I was out I got myself a gameboy. Of course I've been playing only 'Tetris' for the past ninteen years. That's why last time I was out I mad sure to get this baby on the lamp.\" He pointed to an amulet shaped object that was clear;y not part or the lamp's deisign. \"As long as this baby is there I can grant unlimited wish's so no getting sucked back into the lamp for me.\" He said with a goofy and happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's head was spinning. Thos was eactly what he needed. Just a few word's and all his problem's woud disipear. Starting with that bogus D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When what are we waiting for let's get those power's warmed up. I wish...\" He was stopped as Bob made warding gesture's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, whoah what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon stratched his head. \"Um? Making a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob shoke his head with a small smile like he'd just been told a joke. \"You dude do not make the wish's. I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Was the intelligent response. Bob sighed and went back to explanation mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when master's made the wish's it alway's fell into a pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Something small like food to prove were real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Big changes that alway's ended up blowing up in there faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. when wish to goes wrong they wish they'd never met us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got a little sick of this routine and tired of always having to clean up like nothing ever happened in the first place so we made up this new rule about the genie's making as well as granting the wish's. That way we don't have to waste our time resetting reality 'every time' we get out. The only restriction I have is that all the wish's I make have to have something to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. What do I wish for first then?\" Said a slightly confused Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob said \"Your paper's dry.\" He said as the soaking paper suddenly became bone dry. Ron grabbed for the paper with a small smile. Until he noticed the big fat D still in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what give's?\" Said the young Stoppable in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude I can't use magic to change your grade. That'd be cheating.\" Bob said in complete honesty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man don't tell me this is gonna be like that show with the Fairy God parent's?\" Her said in a mopy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but dark forces way stronger than anything I could ever whip up already control the eduacational system. I touch that letter and I can kiss my rear goodbye.\" Bob explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon hung his head. Mabye a genie wasn't going to be such a good thing after all.</span></div></div>",

When his dad saw it he looked at his son and plainly said \"Barkin?\" When Ron nodded his father smiled as he understood. His mother however took this oppertubity to dig into his self asteem while Hana sat in her lap. Saying he was just to lazy, the teacher had good reason not to like him, ecetera, ectetera. So now thanks to her he was grounded for a week and had to spend all that time studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You my friend look to be in a serious funk.\" Came the california surfer voice of his new self wishing genie. The gamer genie in question was leaning up against the lockers while deply concentrating on his new 'duel screen' handheld which he'd discovered recently and was now completly addicted to 'new super mario bros'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrrghh.\" Ron growled. Bob ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah remember boss only you can interact with me. Wouldn't want anyone to think your going crazy now would we.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon just kept growling for another second or so then stopped. He'd found out the hard way that only he could see or even touch the genie when his dad came home from work and walked right through Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Ron? you seem a little tweaked.\" His best friend since childhood said from the side of him opposite the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon lifted his head from his locker and looked at Kim. This morning when they met up to go to school had another unpleasant experiance to add to his recent collection of bad experiances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely Bob had the hot's for Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept giving her cheesy pick up lines and comments all the way here even though he knew she couldn't see or hear him. It only served to annoy Ron further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Kp. Just a little tired after the grilling Mom gave me last night. Dad understood. Why does my Mom alway's have to alway's make me feel worse than I already so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause she's a bitch.\" Said Bob. Ron had to concentrate not to yell at him and keep facing Kim. Whose face softened and turned into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's alway's have high expectations of their kid's it only natural that she'd be annoyed that you almost failed..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then why does she ingore me when I do something right?' Ron thinks \" Thank's KP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled befor heading off down the hall to her next class. Leaving Ron alone with his genie in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice girl.\" Bob said as he completed level 3-4 in his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon spun on his heel and stared at the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mad dude?\" He said without looking up from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm let's see. You almost let me convince my parent's that I'm crazy, anything I want to wish for you can't grant, You make cat call's and chessy pickup lines towards my beast friend and you bag on my Mom so yes I'm a little tweaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my defense she is hot.\" Said Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's heated glare could be felt even though he wasn't looking up. \"Ok youre angry. How about I take care of that for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What youre going to magically take it all away?\" Said Ron. Not entirelly objecting to that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie snorted. \"Were's the fun in that. Your stress reliever should be walking through in the next three, two, one, over there.\" He said and tilted his head in one direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked over nd was surprised to see Amelia. His not too secret crush and currently the hottest girl in school if the list in the guy's bathroom was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia? She's my stress reliever? C'mon what's she gonna go the only time's she even notice's I'm alive is when I got rid of my Ronness withthat haircut and when I was rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you have something even better than money and fashion sense.\" He paused briefly and looked up from his game. \"Magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to Amelia as she was walking down the hall. \"Hey Amelia. Get over here.\" He called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl went from walking right down the hall to walking over to the boy's and standing right in front of Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gulped. He glanced out of the corner of his eye as he saw the genie smirk right before he heard the word's \"Kiss him.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde eye's widened to the size of plate's as the most popular girl in school pressed him up against his locker with her body and procedded to make out with him right in the empty unmonitered school hallway. He tried to push her off for a few seconds before giving up when her grip on him seemed to be like the grip of superman. Completly unbreakable. Next to him the genie was giving instruction's  to her while continuing to play the DS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going, keep going, harder, keep going and stop.\" He said right before the girl unattached her lips from his.<br>\r\n\"Now wink.\" She winked at him. \"And walk away.\" She resumed her walk as if nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon went from seriously stressed to seriously frazzled. \" Better?\" Asked the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon nodded dumbly befor gathering his wit's. \"What the hek was that? I thought genie's couldn't make anyone fall in love.\" The respone from Bob for a short burst of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you get that idea? A movie? Listen my friend despite what Holywood tell's you about genie's there actually is 'NO' restriction on our powers only what we don't mind and what we mind doing. Beside's I didn't make her love you I just wiped her mind for a little bit and took control. She'll get to class and won't remember anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked after the direction the girl had taken f in. \"So you didn't make her my girlfriend or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to make her your girlfriend?\" The genie said. Ron made wild warding gesture's. \"Good now I do believe that thank's to my helping you you are now late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron looked at his watch and yelped before taking down the hallway at near warp speed. Bob just stayed were he was. \"This guy's gonna be a lot more fun than that Gates kid 40 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a face as he lost a life in the game. \"Damn this is more addictive than Tetris.\"</span></div></div>",
