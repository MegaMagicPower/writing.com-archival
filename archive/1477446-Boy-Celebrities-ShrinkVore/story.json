Slamming your bedroom door shut, you throw the package onto the bed and quickly dive after it, salivating in anticipation.  Ripping through the airholes in the top, you quickly empty its contents onto the soft quilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny teenaged popstar bounces on his butt several times before coming to a stop.  He rubs his eyes with small plump fists, attempting to adjust to the light, blinking fearfully as he regains focus.  You smile evilly, waiting for his eventual understanding to set in.  Several seconds later the young man's eyes go wide in fear as he realizes how big you are, and how small he is.  His 'flight' reflexes kick in and he jumps to his feet, running quickly in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going cutie?\" You ask smugly.  Using only your pointer finger and thumb, you lift the young star up by the collar of his shirt, exposing his tanned stomach and rising boxers under baggy black jeans.  Licking your lips, thinking about all the fun you are going to have, you drop him into the palm of your hand.  His hands lay behind him, holding him up for support and one of his two feet hang off the end of your hand, dangling listlessly.  He shakes uncontrollably and you love the feel of the small vibrations.  Not taking his wide eyes off of you, you notice all the details of his body.  His firm, plump butt rests on the lines of your palm.  His chest rises and falls quickly with his frightened erratic breaths.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving your hand closer to your face you take a few moments to study him.  His small, perfectly symmetrical body is covered in a pale green t-shirl, baggy black jeans with a plain black belt, and a pair of large orange and brown sneakers.  His smooth arms are riddled with slight muscle and his adorable hands are perfectly manicured with several rings.  Two necklaces drape his slumped shoulders and slender neck.  There isn't a trace of hair on his face, nor a single blemish.  His elegent white teeth are hidden behind his pale lips.  Chubby squirrel cheeks sit on either side of his perfectly shaped nose.  His arched eyebrows are as beutifully blond as his elegant locks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold him up by your mouth and begin to...  </span></div></div>",

Your large, wet, sticky tongue passes between your lips and slather the hot young pop star's face with warm, gooey saliva. He cries out at your slimy, smelly tongue covering him but he's completely helpless. Using your fingers, to slip and rip his clothing off of him, leaving his succulent young body exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since I've had someone as tasty as you,\" you tease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...please don't eat me,\" Jesse stammers helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh horribly. \"But you're young, hot boy-body is too delectable to pass up. Let's get something clear here: I'm going to eat you, and you can't prevent it from happening!\" Jesse's shoulders sag as he realizes there is no hope. You resume licking the boy up. Since you haven't drank in a while, your saliva is gluey and white and it sticks to every inch of his appetizing body. He groans as the wetness encases him. Once he's all good and sticky, you throw him into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse screams out as he finds himself in wet, hot darkness. Your smelly breath is all he can breathe in as he sits on your tongue, your copious saliva still encasing him. You decide to tease him a little bit by rolling him around on your tongue but ultimately you decide it's time to go down the hatch. Your tongue gives way and Jesse slips helplessly down your throat. You feel him squirming delightfully on your way down and you hear his muffled screams as he struggles to escape your stomach acid. Finally, the struggling dies down and then it stops altogether. Now to find your next meal toy...</span></div></div>",

It contains the familiar salty sweet scent of boy feet... delicious.  The laces start rattling up one nostril, and you settle the shoe on your bed.  It will be a nice memento of your meal when you are through with it.  Slowly and carefully Jesse's sock is slid off of his foot.  You only have a moment to gaze at his pale, succulent toes before being compelled into lunging forward, and sniffing.  The aroma is a stronger version of the sweaty shoe, as it is obviously the source.  The plump foot shakes invluntarily, as the strong sniffing must tickle the young star.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't contorl it anymore, and your tongue flicks out, causing Jesses toes to curl up beneath his sole.  But your tongue is too, powerful, sucking, slurping, and licking every inch... but tell me... what does it taste like?   </span></div></div>",

He whines and protests as you continue to suck and probe his plump juicy foot. You consider tasting the other foot, but decide it is best to enjoy it later.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today's your birthday and you are super excited.  You come from a planet called Gigantica, where almost everything is the same as Earth.  There are only two differences, one being your technological advancements.  The second is the size of the inhabitants.  As you are average height here, you would roughly be considered a small giant on Earth.  Be that as it may, your planet's entertainment business is the only lacking industry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis problem was easily solved when your scientists discovered a way of connecting your satelites to those of Earth.  That's how you first saw them; those adorable little Earth boys.  You had to have them!  So you compiled a list of all the great teen boy celebrities and gave it to your parents as a birthday wish list.  Last night they journeyed to Earth and abducted your new captives, captives which were at that very moment in the cage in front of you.  They all looked dazed, frightened, and utterly confused.  Some are tied with bows, some have them on their head, some have already taken them off.  Maybe by next year you can abduct some regular, non-celebrity boys.  Maybe you can even make the government supply you with a sacrifice a day for fear of your planet destroying theirs.  But one thing at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't my new little pets look cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark-skinned lad with large tattooed biceps and a white tanktop stands up from where he has been cowering with the others, stepping forwad.  You recognize him as Lil Bow Wow.  He pushes Chris Brown, Chingy, and Lil Romeo out of the way as he walks to the bars, a determined look on his face.  You can't help but smile, knowing he isn't feeling nearly as confident as he appears to be.  \"Hey, we're not your pets!  We're not toys!  We're human beings!\"  As your smile deepens, he flinches a little.  His voice cracks as he changes tone ever so slightly.  \"Wh-what ummm...  What are you gonna do with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting question my adorable little friend.  Your Lil Bow Wow right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I'm not Lil, I'm just Bow Wow now!  I hate it when people say that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me,\" you giggle, \"but you look little to me.  Anyway, I was gonna just play with you guys till I get bored...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorbin Bleu now steps up toward the bars from the back where he had been huddled, crying, with Zac Efron.  The fact that they were holding each other, consoling one another, aroused you a little bit.  \"But when your done, we can go home, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.  Your mine now.\"  A chorus of fresh screams rang out, ranging from adolescent to manly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBow Wow pushed Corbin away, speaking to you directly again.  \"You can't do that!  Why can't we leave when your done us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering what to do with you boys when I get bored.  I can squish you, tear you up, use you as sex toys, put you up my butt.  Anything.\"  The screams turned to crying, and you could see that all the boys ecept Bow Wow were clutching each other, shaking in fear.  \"But since I first saw you guys in person, another idea hit me.  Your all so cute... I was thinking you may even be cute enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"  Bow Wow screamed.  But it was too late, you had already reached your hand in from the top of the cage and pulled him out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been wondering how delicious you would all taste.  There's so many recipes I'd like to try; kid-ka-boy, Peanut Butter and Jimmy, Boys and Berry Pie, Cutie Pie, Meatboys, etc.  Since you've got such a big mouth, why don't I start by tasting you.  If your as flavorful as I thought, you are all going on a one way trip into my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the sobbing and screaming, focusing on the little teen singer in your hand.  You noticed that his skin is a different color than the majority of the other morsals.  Maybe you'll take all the darker ones out and stuff them with marshmellows, caramel, nuts, nouget, cherries, and jelly to make them into chocolates.  But first thing's first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd like him to perform for you later, but right now let's just have a lick... or suck... or mouthful.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s a scrumptious little thing and you can\u2019t help but lick your lips as your wide gigantic eyes violate his sense of propriety over his own body. His smell is intoxicating. Now just musky manliness, as you expected, but also something sweet, almost fruity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sniffing has gotten rougher.  You notice that your nose is pressing deeply into his chest causing him to writhe like mad, only exacerbating the fear of his fellow toys below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t waste time sampling each part of him as his intoxicating odor has you positively crosseyed and drooling.  So you roughly plop off his comically large basketball shoes and slide off his nearly knee high socks.  He reaches for his feet, trying to stop you, but your other hand is already pinning his lower half down so you can rip his shirt off of his meaty shoulders.  When he is distracted by his naval and abs suddenly exposed you grip his shorts from below and pull both them and his underwear off in a single motion.  He now screams profanities to try hiding his immasculation as he stands on the palm of your hand, a relative child to him but large enough to dominate him, completely nude and at your mercy.</span></div></div>",

You immediately notice the Disney logo and a large stylized JB on the container.  With a sigh you set the toy box down on the table and inspect if briefly still upset that they forgot to include dessert.  With a startled jump you notice the box shifting back in forth as if there were a mouse inside.  A little grossed out you carefully open the container and cautiously peer inside.  To your surprise three marsh mellow sized young men dressed quite uniquely from head to toe. stare up at you while cowering instinctively and shielding their eyes from the sudden influx of light.  They are speaking to each other, but their tiny voices are too low for you to hear.  Your eye also catches that one of the young men is sitting on a honey container and another is resting his tiny boot clad foot on a catchup packet.  Your initial surprise subsides as your hunger returns.  One of the tiny little men, with the support of the others, shouts up to you in a squeaking voice:  \"Hey is this some sort of simulation!

With a dull plunk the giant managed to pluck free the right shoe. Siva's foot reacted by curling slightly causing his toes to crack. The giant lifted the newly dislodged cloth shoe towards his giant nostrils. \"Ummm devine!\" He dropped the displaced footwear in front of the remaining band members momentarily stopping them in their tracks. \"Damn man we haven't made much ground!

Siva whimpered as the giant drew his socked ankles together releasing his shirt and inverting him. With a stoke and a tug Siva was pulled free from his shirt. He looked around helplessly, the giant's face, the sight of his bandmates trapped at the headboard of the bed. \"Please! Let me go! I will do anything, pay anything!\" The giant drew his tiny prey back a bit as if to consider his offer. \"Sorry my dear little man, nothing feels as good as yummy boy toy tastes!\" he punctuated his words by drawing the tiny man up for a long sniff. </span></div></div>",

With a single motion Siva was buried to his ankles.  Two lean brown soles twirled helplessly and then he was gone. Siva continued to struggle as powerful muscles pulled and pushed him to the acidic stomach below. With a plunk he landed into the larger chamber of the stomach. Somehow a dim light made it possible for the tiny pop star to see his surroundings. A soft pink slimy chamber with no clear floor was all around him. The young man whimpered as he attempted to stand.

Greg Garrity  managed to find a corner where he huddles helplessly clung to Adam Juwig .  The world shook for what seemed like an eternity; then with a final upheaval it stopped. The 4 men wait in pitch black silence.  As they begin to feel around they realize the furniture is gone.  The floor and walls seem to be made of some sort of particle board.  Mike pounds his fists against the wall in desperation calling for help. As he does this a scrapping sound originates from above them.  They all track the noise with their ears just to have their eyes flooded with light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou rush to the door with delight.

Which one of you little fellas shall I have fun with?\" You moved your hand slowly across the table watching with humor as the little men stumble over each other in a vain attempt to escape. Finally you get ahold of a sock covered ankel and tug gently. Zayn Malik struggled to cling to his band mates, but out of instinct they push him away. You gently placed the little man onto your palm and eyed him hungerly...His reddish styled boots quivvered slightly as he huddled in your hand. So many possiblities.... </span></div></div>",

Drew found a shoe and its movement in the dark stale environment prompted him to let out a startled yelp. \"Yo! What the fuck man?\" the shoe and the foot inside belonged to Keaton who, like the other young men found himself searching around this dark mysterious room. Drew laughed at the startling of his friend. \"Whatever happened we must have had a good time.\" They all laughed with a hint of concern in their voices. The ground rumbled beneath them and they could hear strange noises coming from all around. \"Whoa! I think we are in an earthquake!\" Drew hung on to Keaton as they both slid back and forth on the strange flooring. The rumbling came to an abrupt halt. After what seemed like an eternity in stale darkness and silence a sound returned, this time from above and the room began to fill with bright light. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three little men looked up towards the blinding light. Drew and Keaton were next to each other in the middle of the room, Wesley had made his way to a corner. As the world around them came into view Wesley saw his cap laying nearby and grabbed it. The men explored their environment: the room was featureless and brown. It seemed to be particle board, but the texture was like nothing they had seen before. They Wesley glanced upward toward the light, all he could see was infinite bright whiteness. \"Yo! Like what is this?!\" his brother and friend shrugged... and then the world began to move again. The room began to rotate slowly forcing the three hot young men to slide to the wall and then up the wall. \"Whoa! Bros what is this shit!?\" Drew cried out as he tripped over the edge of the wall tumbling out into the unknown. Wesley and Keaton followed shortly behind. They saw Drew staring at something and they matched his gaze. A massive face was smiling at them across a massive wooden plain. \"My God, like is this real? Who is that dude?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello boys! I hope you had a good trip.\" The giant's voice boomed across the table knocking Keaton on his butt. \"I took the liberty of shrinking your skate boards on the way out of your dressing room. You dudes should have negotiated for better security in your contracts. Oh, by the by, which one of you hot little dudes would taste the best? I am guessing it is Drew.\" The giant's words hung in the air, Drew instinctively looked down at his abs which were still covered in a shirt, the other two men just stared frozen with fear. The young men glanced behind them, the room, a massive cardboard shoe box in reality, blocked their path for escape. Finally, Drew gathered the courage to speak. \"Uh dude, like, we don't know what's going on here, but we really need to get back so we don't miss our show. If you could like, put us back to normal that would be totally, like uh cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley Stromberg, Keaton Stromberg, and their best friend Drew Chadwick</span></div></div>",

You either play for the chance to survive, or I get a tasty three boy meal by default. Decide quickly before I get bored with the idea.\" The young men feverishly reconvene and Keaton comes back this time with the response. \"Alright dude, but this is totally crazy. What's this game about anyway?\" The giant beams with the bite-sized man's response. \"Well 'dude' I would like you three boys to play a game of strip skate boarding, I know you are familiar with it.\" The young men gesture in acknowledgement. \"It is simple then, you keep all your cute little clothes on those tight little bodies for 3 hours... and you are free to go. When you go nude, you are mine dude.\" The giant emphasized his final word with a lick of the lips and a barely perceivable glance towards Drew.

Drew let off a yelp as two massive fingers tripped him onto the surface of the table and grasped him by his right ankle. \"Let me go! Let me go!\" he shouted and struggled as the giant proceeded to unlace his boots pulling them off one by one stopping to savor the smell of each. He re positioned the little man so that Drew's lats sat firmly between the giant's thumb and forefinger. Gingerly, the giant popped off Drew's belt and tugged away his white jeans. \"I promise I will play, just don't eat me!\" Drew clenched his athletic feet trying to keep his protective clothing from leaving his body. His stomach churned as once again he was inverted his shirt now hanging down showing his hot abs. Keaton and Wesley looked on in horror as their buddy dangled high above them completely naked. The Giant held drew like a bunch of grapes above his massive form. He started to lower the struggling little man when he paused and said \"nice abs Drew, well, good bye now.\" Drew screamed as he plummeted from the grip of the giant and went unceremoniously silent as he slipped between the giant's lips. The two remaining men saw the quivering soles of Drew's feet sticking out from between the giant's gaping smile... and with a loud gulp, he was gone. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The giant patted his stomach and looked downward. \"One naughty, but very tasty, little boy band member gone, two good little men to go!\" His wink caused Keaton to shiver. </span></div></div>",

Just let us go and we can forget this whole sorted affair ever happened.\" George smiled with a nervous fearful grin while the giant lips before him pursed in contemplation. \"Ummmm no. Enjoy the trip to the bottom of my stomach little bugger, after all this ride only goes one direction!\" George's thoughts were too jumbled to pick up on the pun. He looked downward as Harry's free left hand reached towards George's right sneaker. \"Leave that alone!\" George protested in vein.

The well crafted wooden box has holes for breathing, but guards that disallow the precious contents to see out. You have ordered from Edible Toys before and recognize their logo on the box. Beyond that, there  are a number of postal stamps written in Portuguese along with the mark \"Brazil\". Gently you slide the lid from one side of the box careful not to expose yourself to the contents right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, four rather tasty looking men, each no taller than 7 cm step out into the light. They look disoriented, no wonder considering they were likely shrunken in their dressing room before a concert and shipped directly. Jonathan Couto, Igor Von Adamovich, Michael Band, Guilherme dos Santos scan their new environment. Jonathan is clothed in a pair of black canvas shoes, and patterned grey shirt and shorts. Michael wears a blue jean shirt and red shoes with shorts. Igor wears a patterned t shirt, plaid shorts and a pair of brown camouflage Vans. and Gui is decked out in jeans and a t-shirt with a sweat  shirt around his waist and a wool cap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onde estamos?\" Gui kicks the side of the box with his shoe as if to test it. <br>\r\n\"Eu n\u00e3o sei, mas tudo parece enorme. Gostaria de saber se esta \u00e9 uma fase ou algo assim?\" Michael nears the edge of the counter and peers down at the canyon like kitchen floor below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eu espero que voc\u00ea esteja certo, caso contr\u00e1rio, temos sido reduzido em peda\u00e7os!\" Whatever it is tiny Michael has has said, his eyes have gone wide and he gestures with his hand to indicate something very small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't speak Portuguese, but you can tell the bite sized little men have not yet discovered you. You enjoy the spectacle of the 4 condemned little boy band toys when you hear a startled yell from Gui! His eyes are wide and he is looking at you. Soon his band mates are huddled around him matching his frightened gaze. </span></div></div>",

You can't understand him, but he has made a grave mistake by drawing your attention. The four little men give a shout and scatter as you go in for your first tiny snack. The little morsels are wise enough to avoid going back into their box and seek refuge behind items on your counter top. Gui lets off a terrified protest as you gently tug at his Van covered right foot that sticks out from behind your fruit bowl. \"N\u00e3o! Por Favor! Deixe-me ir! Deixe-me ir!\" You gently tug the little hottie out of his hiding place and hold him upside down by his right ankle. His tiny wool cap starts to fall from his handsome little head but he manages to grasp it in time. He struggles desperately as you raise him up for closer inspection. With thumb and forefinger you pluck away the black sweat shirt wrapped around his waist. The act allows his t-shirt to fall down around his upper torso allowing you a full view of his little abs. </span></div></div>",

Your entourage decided you were too much of a liability. When you took a nip out of your flask in the dressing room you were shrunken, packaged and delivered to me.

Let me go!!\" the morsel of a guy finally gets it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across your kitchen to the materials you have already prepared.

You switch off a second pan that is filled with hot simmering tomato sauce flavored with oregano. \"Pasta is ready, sauce is ready... now for the meat!\" You spin as you say this aloud bringing your comparatively massive eyes in on your little captive. Justin rocks back on his feet as you approach the jar. Delight consumes you as you slowly tilt the jar watching its contents try in vein to cling to the sides. With an unceremonious plop the handsome little crooner lands in the palm of your left hand. He tries to roll, but you quickly pluck him up once again by the waist of his tight leather trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thumb and forefinger you get to work! You pull on his stylish engineering boots, first the right then the left savoring the smell of each as you set them asside. His plump little feet continue to kick out as you rest hold of his socks plucking each of them slowly off as you marvel at how pink and juicy his feet and toes look. The scent of his leather bound feet is overwhelming! \"Dude,,, I am as serious as shit, you need to put me back to normal!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpers and protests as you proceed to unbuckle his tiny belt with a flick of your index finger! You invert your little meatball by the cuff of his right pant leg and with a crisp tug manage to pull his little leather pants free. He falls a short distance with a yelp into the palm of your hand. His meaty abs writhe between your fingers as you proceed to finish the disrobing. \"Dude stoppp!!!\" Bieber is not used to things not going his way.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return the now naked Bieber to his jar and prepare a big mound of pasta covered in a generous helping of delicious sauce.  Once again you slowly upend the glass prison watching your Bieber ball struggle to avoid the inevitable. \"Whoa whooooahhhhhhhh!\" with a 'plop' your meaty little boy toy lands on top of your mountain of pasta. He immediately tries to climb off the pasta but to to no avail. Laughingly you reach beneath the hot little man's shoulders and lift him gently twisting him around as the sauce covered pasta becomes entwined with his well toned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower the little meatball into your mouth slowly sucking the noodles from between his lean legs. The flavor is beyond description! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Goddd! Let me the fuck go let me the fu.......\" The temptation is too great, you manage to lower the little man between your lips completely savoring the musky goodness as he wiggles and squirms inside your mouth.

Inside that box is noneother than Enrique Iglesisas himself shrunken to a mere 3 inches in height. At the moment he is unaware of what has happened. Enlightening him is part of the fun! Your eyes look over towards your glass of momentos. Chad Michael Murray's little outfit just as the day you ate him. Tim Tebo's cleats and jersey, absolutely delicous and fun to play with. <i>Well, time to play and eat!</i> you think to yourself as you shut down the lights in the room leaving only a bright spot light on your newest toy. You slowly lift the box and watch with delight as a bitesized Enrique stumbles around shielding his eyes from the light. He wears all black, probably what he had on for the photo shoot where they captured him. He has on a tight fitting shirt that reveals his chisled chest. He has on a shiny pair of pointy-toed shoes that clatter a bit as he stumbles around on the clear plastic surface. It is obvious that he is confused, but there is no evidence he is aware of the shrinking process! The bright light leaves him unable to see you in the shadows. <br>\r\n\"Hello! What is this?

His muscular little arms launch out to stop the inevitable. He tries to lift himself away from the gaping hole of your mouth by bending upward at the abs but he doesn't have the stamena to maintain it for long. His musky smell is overpowering! You begin to taste his salty upper body as he finally lands against your tongue. You suck a bit to draw more out of him. Soon you feel his belt buckle against your lips. With a flick of your tongue the buckle is gone and you start to bring his designer trousers off. <br>\r\n     Muttled groans are still eminating from your mouth when you tug on the remaining left shoe and trouser cuffs simutaneously. With a delightful suction sound the shoe pulls free from his struggling foot, his little toes are knotted up in protest. You push on the soles of his kicking feet like errant spaghetti noodles noting how smooth they both are. A waif of oder is the last smell you get from this little Spanish sensory pleaser as his two little brown tootsies disappear between your closing lips. Inside your mouth the play continues as he fights to right himself and escape. You delight at the feeling of his fingers and and toes struggling to find a grip between your teeth. <br>\r\n     As with any food his flavor fades and it is time to satisfy your stomach. With a lift of the tongue Enrique's grasp on your dentures fails and he finds himself propelled feet first into your esophagus. Ah if only there was another like him!</span></div></div>",

He had received the offer the day before. He skipped over the details, something about scanning for a toy company. He decided not to discuss it with his manager, it would be his own decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician led Shawn down a corridor. Shawn noticed the likenesses of other pop singers under glass bells on shelves. They were very life like. \"Will my doll be as real looking as these?\" The man in the white coat smiled and gave him a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my dear Mr. Mendes, this won't hurt a bit. Just step into the chamber and we will begin the procedure.\" Shawn nodded and stepped onto the stage of what looked like a circular booth. As soon as he reached the center of the booth a clear door slid around and Shawn heard what sounded like a lock. \"Uh did that door just lock?\" Shawn felt a bit nervous for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Shawn, it is all part of the procedure. Just stand still while we begin the process!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn complied. He stood in what he thought would be a good action stance as the technician went to a control panel and began pushing buttons. The room went dark and a bright light from above the chamber was all that illuminated the pop singer. Within a few moments the machine began to hum and the light changed to red. Shawn expected some sort of scanner to go around him, but he did not see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Shawn felt normal, but soon a tingling sensation spread throughout his body. \"Hey! Something doesn't feel right, I think we need to stop.\" He looked with a panic a the technician who appeared to be ignoring him. Shawn lifted his right foot to make for the door of the chamber. His boot seemed to be looser than before. Shawn kicked off the awkward boot and tried to continue but he soon realized his t-shirt was also looser than before. \"Hey! What is this? Stop this right now!\" Shawn stumbled out of his clothes. By this point the young man had realized his clothes were not going through the change, it was him. Now just around two feet tall the pop singer pried on the edge of the clear door crying out for the technician to stop the procedure. </span></div></div>",

He was wearing a hip-hop style hat flipped backwards, baggy jeans and loose laced Timberland boots. He made sure his cheesy smile looked just right, then touched the shutter icon....The camera phone clattered as it fell to the path, its owner vanished into thin air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the world turned black. He remembered standing, but now he was laying down. <i>Where am I?</i> he thought to himself as his mind slowly came back on-line. The ground beneath him felt like particle board. The Earth seemed to be shaking as if he were in an earthquake, but aside from a few dim spots in the ceiling there was no light to get a bearing. He sat up cautiously and reached for his cell phone to get some light... <i>missing</i>... Maybe he was in a plane or a truck or something, the movement was rather steady and it did  not end as you might expect even from the longest of earth quakes. The air was stale and stuffy. The steady movement of the room would occasionally increase in what felt a bit like an elevator ride... \"Where the hell am I! Hello?!\" Jake Miller shouted into the darkness. There was no reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity he heard what he could swear was a delivery person asking for a signature. More movement, another sense of sinking, and then a loud thud. From above the ceiling made a loud scraping noise, as if the roof of the building were being torn away by a giant. The ceiling disappeared instantly with fresh air and light pouring into the cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's stomach fluttered with butterflies, but he managed to stand shielding his eyes against light he had not seen at least for hours. His irises began to adjust, he could make out what appeared to be a light fixture high above the room. His brain registered that the light was large, but he couldn't process it. The room around him was brown and featureless. There were no windows or doors; it looked like the inside of a giant box. \"Yo! What's going on?! Is somebody out there who can here me!\" The bright light from above dimmed slightly... Jake's mouth dropped in shock and he fell backwards at what he saw. The dimly lit silhouette of a man, a massive man's face, blocked out the lamp and peered downward at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive face had a pleased toothless smile and just hovered there blinking. After what felt like an eternity Jake returned to his feet and gathered the courage to speak again. \"Hey! What is this?! Who the hell are you?! Is this some sort of a prank?\"</span></div></div>",

The giant man's face seemed unmoved by Jake's protests and for a moment the beefy hip hop artist considered that it might be some sort of a projection. The moment was brief as he felt the wind of the man's breathing as he inhaled slightly to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk my narcissistic little man, I am afraid this is no prank! You were the one who advertised how beefy your muscles where, taking a snap shot of your lean abs or plump biceps and sending them out for the world to see. You were advertising to be played with and eaten yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked concerned for an instant and then cracked a big grin as if he understood what was really happening. \"Nah dude this is syck!  Yo Joey!  Edgar! the joke IS up my brothers. Open this box and get me outta here!\" He looked up defiantly at the massive face and flexed mockingly. His overconfidence turned to terror as a massive hand made its way over the wall of his cardboard cell and moved for him. \"Hey! What the fuck! Noooooo!\" Jake tried to dart away from the encroaching hand only to find himself trapped in the corner of the box. He instinctively balled up in protest as the massive fingers pushed him around violently finally getting a firm grip on the back waist of his jeans. He lurched up to run and found himself kicking at the air. As impossible as it was at this point the butterflies in his belly intensified as he found himself swiftly moving upward past the protective boundaries of his cardboard cell. He cried out in protest kicking and clawing at the air, but the fingers which held tight to his jeans were well beyond his control. A second massive hand approached and managed to get a firm hold on the back of his t-shirt. He pondered slipping out of it for an instant, but the fall was too great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hold him up for inspection and he tries to avoid your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou love to hear the little man's vane protests so you pause to let him build up courage. Sure enough the hot little dude doesn't disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta get me back to normal! This isn't funny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose not to respond, you are in control now. Slowly you reach up with your free hand and grip onto one of his pristine little Timberland boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, keep away from my boot! What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently you tug, savoring the sense of his athletic little foot clenching as you remove his left boot. You pause and admire the sock covered foot kicking wildly with its still-boot-covered right twin. You bring the liberated footwear to your nostrils and breathe in the wonderful mixture of new tanned leather and sweaty jock foot. After drawing in the enticing scent you gently set the boot down for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bite sized captive continues to curse and protest as you proceed to pinch at his toes plucking away the sock. His little eyes trail with you as you proceed to sniff the sock, then lay it on your tongue. He lets off a gasp as you close your mouth and the sock disappears between your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is sick! Eating a sock is just wrong.\" Jake whimpers a bit in disgust of your actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear little man, that is what is called an appetizer. Two guesses at the main dish!\" you punctuate your retort with an evil grin and a smack of the lips gently poking at the athletic little man's exposed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's cocky demeanor has all but melted away. He whimpers slightly as you walk over to the kitchen counter and deposit him unceremoniously into a waiting bowl with greased sides. You delight in watching your little man claw helplessly at the bowl's sides. \"Help! Let me go! Please let me outta here. I will pay you... how much do you want?\"  </span></div></div>",

This time you manage to take hold of his bare ankle lifting him slowly to savor the torment. You watch with delight as he manages to catch his hat before it falls from his reach. You pluck it from his tightly clenched fist and he lets out a shout.  He cries and struggles as you hold him up to your face. His shirt hangs down revealing those delicious abs. \"Little guy, that shirt has gotta go.\" He, of course protests, as you proceed to slip the loose fitting garment downward forcefully pulling his now weakening little arms down past his inverted little head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses are overwhelmed by it all! His muscular arms hang helplessly below his broad shoulders and lean perfect pecks and torso! He tries to strike you as you bring him in for a sniff. The musky odor delights and you soon find your tongue lashing out to discover if the taste is as great. His short cut hair feels bristly against your taste buds but the flavor is second to none. He lets off a scream that cuts off to a duller sound as his handsome little head finds itself suddenly thrust downward into your waiting mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tingle with delight as Jake finds himself inserted down to his waist in your mouth! His left foot clenches tightly as he struggles in vain to dislodge himself from your oral cavity. You extract him slowly your lips passing every surface of his upper body. Finally his head emerges. You hold him back for a brief inspection. He is now shirtless and missing one boot and sock. His upper body glistens with sweat and your saliva his hair now pulled into a little fauxhawk from the immersion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God that was horrible!\" Jake gains his composure and lets off one more volley of protests in such shock he seems oblivious to his audience's obvious lack of empathy. \"I don't wanna  ever go though that again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than entertain the little man's delusions you just smile and give him a kiss on the abs. You grasp him beneath his arms firmly and pull free the remaining boot placing it with its match on the table below next to the liberated black t-shirt. You pluck off the remaining sock and go to sniff the remaining foot. He kicks at your approaching face giving you the perfect opportunity to have another taste! He tries to dislodge his right foot using his left and finds both sucked firmly between your lips. The flavor diminishes and you decide it is time for his jeans, underwear, and of course, the finale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set him down on the counter for a moment, and of course he tries to make a dash for it. You trip him and with a firm tug upward pull his hip hop style jeans free. He crawls forward as you grab the elastic of his little briefs and tug them over this firm buttocks, past his thighs and over his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire the little man's tenacity as he continues to via for an escape. He sprints across the counter surface his feet slapping as they go. Just as he is about to reach the edge of the counter you swoop in; the game of cat and mouse is at and end. You lift him upward by his right ankle holding him once again over your head like a bunch of grapes. His final pleas are responded to with a final lick of the lips and a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" his cry is silenced as he passes between your lips. You have one more taste of his upper body before your tongue finds and explores his lower parts. You glance in a mirror to see the spectacle of his plump athletic feet kicking from between your lips. You tilt your head back, open wide. A wriggling lump passes down your throat and into your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicious!  </span></div></div>",

Soon, Chris Salvatore steps out cautiously, obviously confused about his situation. You watch his beautiful blue eyes go wide a the strange sight of your kitchen, massive from his 3 inch height. Finally his eyes reach you and he steps back. \"Uhhhh what is going on here?\" his voice is soft and you can tell he doesn't quite believe what he is experiencing is real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Chris, what do you remember?\" It is always fun to see how your newest snack took a wrong turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, like I just pulled up to the Pinkberry. I saw this drone hovering over my car... and then it went dark.. the doors opened.... like did I pass out or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a big smile and draw your face down to him. \"I am afraid not Chris. You see, there is this company that shrinks down celebrities and sells them to high end customers. That's where you are now.\" You let the information process in his head relishing every moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very strange.\" you note a bit of skepticism in the tiny heartthrob's voice. \"Uh, yeah, like I would really like to go home now... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hot and beefy, I am afraid the process only goes the one way. Relax little dude, we are going to have fun... then of course I am going to eat you.\" </span></div></div>",

You watch with delight as the hot guy reaches the end of the surface and dashes back and forth looking for a place to find refuge. You slowly walk towards him. \"Keep the fuck away!\" His soft voice is now squeaking with fear. He is far enough above the ground he doesn't dare risk jumping so he instinctively curls up as you reach for his lean muscular body. He kicks out in protest and you take the opportunity to liberate him of his black designer combat style boots. \"Fuck man! Let go!\" his protests go on as you pluck his right boot free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you smell as wonderful as you look!\" you carry on oblivious to the tiny man's protests drawing in the pleasant odor of his dislodged boot. With a gentle tug the left boot comes off and you place it neatly next to its mate. He withdraws his kicking feet and tries to squirm out of your grasp at the same time. Effortlessly you twirl the bearded hottie between your fingers holding him firmly by his lats. His sock covered feet stick out awkwardly and with one smooth motion your fingers draw them both together plucking the both socks off toe first. His newly exposed toes wiggle a bit then curl up at his sense of increasing vulnerability. </span></div></div>",

A giant man's face blocked  the blinding white light casting a partial shadow over Charlie. At first Charlie considered it might be some projection but the warmth and acrid smell of the breath emanating from him gave Charlie the uneasy feeling it was not. The giant looked rather serene or maybe even pleased as he gazed down at Charlie. After what felt like an eternity of silence Charlie gathered the courage to speak again. \"Wha... what is this? Where am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaze of the giant did not change right away but after another minute his smile widened and he licked his lips as his face slipped back out of  Charlie's vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit... what the fuck... whoa!\" Charlie cried out instinctively as the floor beneath him began to form an incline. The incline soon became to steep and Charlie slid towards the side of the box from which he had seen the giant appear. Within another instant Charlie found himself sitting on the wall of the room. Within another moment he once again  slid forward this time heading for what was once the top of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shiiiiiiiiiit!\" *plunk*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie fell a short distance and face planted into some sort of soft ground. He quickly righted himself and gained his bearings. \"Oh my God! Man what is this shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's boots kicked the strange woven surface that had broken his fall and formed a wide plain all around him. It was white and Charlie could make out some sort of fibrous material beneath.

For some reason you cannot pull your eyes away from the shirtless hunk in your hand.  His tan muscley chest and arms, and that smooth toned stomach are calling to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help yourself and slowly caress his torso, making him obviously uncomfortable as he tries struggling against your strong grasp to no avail.

You can no longer see his whole body he is so close now; your heavy breathing pushing his hair away with every exhale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes have become wild, opened completely in fear as his nostrils flare.  Unable to help yourself your tongue darts out for a taste, lapping at his upper torso as if it were a salt lick or a lolli-pop.  Your tongue slowly works its way from the broad meaty shoulder to the supple chest, tasting sweat and a soft sweetness.  He is completely smooth and hairless except for a small patch on his happy trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all of your energy you slowly pll him away from your mouth, longing to taste and suckle some more.  He is shaking slightly, obviously scared shitless.  \"Well, that was unpleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,\" you moan.  However, there is work to be done.  You will have all the time you want to sample him later, after he is good and drunk.  For now you take out a tall pilsner glass and fill it to the brim with beer, the foam fizzing at the top.

After a moment watching him trying to grab onto the sides, too high up for his reach, you begin growing bored.  The condensation on the glass makes it hard to see his pumping legs struggling to hold him afloat so you can just see him up to his chest in amber foam.  His yelling as died down as he struggles on surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start stirring the liquid around quickly with your finger, creating a whirlpool, but he still manages to keep his head above the suds.  So you knock his head under, and then do it again quickly when he resurfaces for air instantly.  He won't take a hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you don't want to have a drink with me peacefully?  I thought we were friends.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has no time to reply as you quickly place your hand over the top and begin shaking it up.  Its like a Zac snow globe!  Through the side of the glass you can just make out the figure of the struggling teen.  He swims over to the side facing you and screams, forgetting that he is still 'underwater'.  Thus a few mouthfuls of beer are swallowed, but not enough to satisfy you.  He is bounced off of the sides with each shake of your arms... talk about beer-battered food! (Or in this case, beer-battered-boy.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter allowing him to come up for a quick breath you turn the glass over.  He swims toward the air pocket on the other side, but beofre he can get there, you flip it again.  You continue teasing him in this fashion until you see his swimming has slowed down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he resurfaces you hear him spluttering, gasping for breath.  Even after he begins to relax again his breaths are erratic and heavy.  After several minutes you notice that his eyelids have drooped and his swimming skills have diminished considerably.  He constantly falls beneath the still liquid, coating his amber locks with the delicious beer.  His breathing has slowed to long shallow breaths... He's finally smashed, wasted, toasted, crunk; drunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's time for you to take a drink. </span></div></div>",

There is no response from inside and the footsteps have died out entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than risk a meal of Zac Efron that doesn\u2019t end with him alive and kicking as he slowly dissolved in your gut, you open wide the door.  A wisp of cold Smokey air blinds you momentarily but then you see zac.  He is practically frozen over but clearly still very much alive as you can see by the smoke coming from his nostrils and the very slow rise and fall of his chest. Additionally he is shivering like a madman, his teeth chattering loud enough to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but chuckle.  \u201cYou look like a Greek sculpture.  The body of young.athlete imprisones in marble.  But so realistic... like a Gorgon got to you hahaha.  Your laughter could be making him mad but the icy bear has created such a hard case around his meaty tanned body you can\u2019t really see his facial expression.  Only his eyes are able to move around, following your hand as you reach into the freezer and grasp him.  He is frozen solid from the outside.  True the ice has splintered around him, enabling him to shiver, but even his strong muscles can no longer bend enough to free him.  Even his delectable soft feet, smaller than you would have thought but still delectable little hobbit feet, are stuck to the base of the freezer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!  You\u2019ll certainly cool my beer down!  I\u2019m not a fan of warm beer, although I do love the UK!  The problem is that if I forget to put one in the fridge, adding ice just waters it down.  When you melt though, you\u2019ll only enhance the flavor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac fries to say something or scream, but all you can hear is the crackling of ice and the chattering of his pearly whites. Grasping him firmly you slowly try lifting him.  He whines in pain.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I twist or tug I\u2019ll snap your feet or legs right off and they\u2019ll be stuck in my fridge like chicken thighs!  That\u2019s not the recipe I had in mind for such a scrumptious Morsel as you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you spot the spatula next to your stove.

Wedding it a little bit deeper you manage to get the rest of his toes up.  Zac seems pained but they are still attached to him so nothing to worry about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the process with his other foot.  Soon you can fit the whole front under both feet and slowly fiddle it around before prying him up.  No skin lost!  Zac is free... well from the freezer at least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant warm hand envelops his frozen body.  He\u2019s cold and motionless like a strip of frozen meat, but you know the squirms will start anew once he thaws. He is like a perfect little action figure now.  Not that he was ever capable of fighting back, but now he can\u2019t wven move.  The thought of this huge deal pop star, in pique physical shape, with people drooling all over him and his muscles, is incapable or even moving let along overpowering a single finger of yours.  The thought not only what\u2019s your appetite but makes you a bit turned on as well.  You kind of want to suck on him like a beer pop, but also want to use him for his intended purpose as a beer chiller.

His legs, his butt, his groin ...and the meaty taste of his torso is only enhanced by the rest of him. Suddenly he curls himself into a tight little ball. Big mistake on his part.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zac Efron wakes with a start, sweat pouring from his forehead in turrents of saltiness that press his amber locks against his scalp in flat, wet cowlicks.  He had the strangest dream that he was in a box with countless other celebrities and a Giant was torturing them physically, mentally, and sexually all for his own amusement.  The worst part was that when he had had his fill with each boy he prepared and ate them gruesomely!  Evidently he thought they were the tastiest things in the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Zac finally starts noticing his surroundings.  He is in a strange bed in a room he\u2019s never seen before... hold that thought.  His eyes go wide.  He has been here before... only he was one/twenty-fifth of his current size!  This is the exact bedroom from his nightmare.  The giant had shoved some boys up his butt, used others to massage his cock, and a few others had to fuck in a group orgy, all while he salivated and picked who to bring back to the kitchen with him.  Zac had seen it all from the box the giant carried with him everywhere he went!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was he normal sized again?  And where was the giant?  Was he in a doll house replica of the giant\u2019s bedroom, about to be ripped out of it and eaten: a warm wet spongey tongue lapping at his smooth tanned skin, pillowy lips sucking him into the moist cavern, and then after he is sucked of all his flavor and creamed filling, a pearly white incisor decending from the heavens to rip him apart and mash him to pulp?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified Zac, jumps from the large bed and runs to the door, only to fall backward onto the bed a moment later, pulled from his neck.  It\u2019s then he realizes that a leather collar hugs his neck snuggly, attached to a chain, the other end stuck to the bedpost.  That\u2019s also the only thing he\u2019s wearing as his muscular body is completely visible for the world to see.  Before he can breathe in to let out a scream for help, the knob on the door turns and in you walk holding a shoebox.  It\u2019s smaller than the one you kept those squirming boy toys in, but filled with a similar stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re up Zac,\u201d you beam greedily as you eye the muscular young man.  Not only is Zac awake, but he is also rock hard, the feeling of a leather choker seems to have gotten him off a bit, despite his terror.  He stammers for a second before charging at you full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wink he is down to thee inches tall, his choker coming undone in the process.  You raise your giant foot over his head and slam it down a half an inch from him.  He falls onto his muscular ass.  Another wink and he is back to full height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think We need the collar anymore.  Do you Zac?  After all you know what happens if you try hurting me or escaping.\u201d  You beam.  The light bounces off your teeth in such a menacing way that with a gulp, Zac shakes his head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.  Now before you ask any mind numbingly dull questions, or plead for your meaningless life or something of the sort, have a look in this box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitatingly, Zac leans in a bit to see what horrors await him.  In the box is a butt plug, a dildo, a fleshjack, some other sexual things he is even less familiar with and... he blinks a few times.  They weren\u2019t all in the box with the other celebrities before!  Staring up at him with terror in their adorable little faces is the entire basketball team from High School Musical.  Corbin Bleu, the only actor from the current box that had joined Zac in the larger box previously, pushes Matt Prokop out of the way so he can scream up at Zac for help, but a sudden jostling from you knocks all of the twenty some odd actors back into their asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see Zac, I\u2019ve been busy while you were sleeping.\u201d  In truth you had quite a difficult time tracking down every one of the Wildcats, shrinking them down, and then bringing them home.  Luckily you didn\u2019t have to demonstrate what was in store for them, as Corbin had already witnessed what you\u2019ve done to some of the other celebririties from your bigger box.  So when you transferred him in here with the others, he scared the ever living shit out of the new recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac is speechless.  \u201cYou\u2019re full sized again because, and please don\u2019t let this go to your head, you are the sexiest young man I\u2019ve ever had in my power, and I\u2019d love to fool around with you a bit.  These little boy toys are here to help us.  You\u2019ll use them to pleasure me, and you yourself will pleasure me, or you, and all of those little friends of yours, will wind up as soup in my roiling gut.  Now then let\u2019s get started.\u201d  Your mind is racing with what\u2019s in store.  You get to kiss, lick, suck, and fuck Zac Efron!  And to top it off, he has to pleasure you!  Do you strap his friends to your cock before you fuck him?  Do you suck them off his cock?  Do you dip them in chocolate as aphrodisiacs and have him feed them to you?  Maybe he\u2019ll even get into the whole macro thing and want to join you!  Should you shove them into Zac\u2019s virgin hole before you fuck him?  The world is your oyster!</span></div></div>",

You scoop Zac\u2019s hunky body up and toss him roughly into the box where a few wildcats are hit to the ground.  Putting the lid back on without another word you shake the box a bit for fun, listeing to the nude lithe bodies of the meaty actors intertwine in uncomfortable positions- although as a group of straight young men, anything involving each other\u2019s nude forms is uncomfortable let along being tangled up with each other\u2019s limbs and mashed against each other\u2019s genitals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the box down on the counter in the kitchen and begin making the preparations.  The plan is to return Zac to his normal size, albeit chained to your kitchen table so that he can\u2019t move an inch.  You can lift his legs with a chain if need be, for some extra fun, however.  Then, using him as a Nantaimori, you\u2019ll begin placing sushi all over his nude form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sushi is the difficult part.

Max Ehrich, Corbin Bleu, Matt Prokop, Ryne Sanborn, and Chris Warren are pressed firmly against each other as you grasp their struggling nude forms tightly.  Your other hand knocks Zac back onto the bed, where he stares up at the ceiling, a single tear sliding down his smooth cheek as he waits for the inevitable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou separate matt from the others and notice as he clings to the tangled limbs of his friends, that they are all coated in a thick sheen of sweat.  Perhaps it is from being squeezed in together, but a good portion of it is no doubt from fear.  You deposit him on the tiny fluff of hair of zacs rigid dick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet him started\u201d, you demand of Matt who looks up at you dumbfounded.  \u201cNow!\u201d You growl and then chomp your teeth together for emphasis.  Matt immediately gets to work, kneading his little hands into the soft flesh of his giant friend\u2019s cock.  Soon he is rubbing his whole body against the shaft, arms outstretched.  The friction makes his own dick a bit hard which embarrasses him to no end, but he\u2019s more concerned with staying alive and in once piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he goes to work, and Zac can\u2019t help but writhe a bit in pleasure, each hip buckling causing matt to fall and get a face full of precome, you go to work with the other three.  You start with Corbin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of the tiny stud quaking in your hands is indescribable.  That coupled with your fingers inadvertently massaging his toned muscles makes you grow even harder than you ever thought possible.  You maneuver the little toy, bending him like a doll, until he is in the perfect position.  With a bit of string and a few knots he is all set.  Staring up at you in terror, Corbin is straddling the head of your cock.  His tiny asshole is the exact same size as your piss slit, and the two are touching.  Corbin\u2019s soft pillowy cheeks spread wide, your piss slit is uncomfortably grinding his tiny pulsing hole, the former ready to fill the latter in a moment\u2019s notice.  His legs tied around the top of your shaft, he is unable to move from the sitting position, and can\u2019t even twitch his lower half.  That fuzzy hair of his will no doubt tickle zac\u2019s prostate with every thrust you make.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last three boys you position around the lower part of your shaft.  Chris and Ryne are standing on your pubic hair with their heads pressed firmly against your shaft while max, in Between the two, is upside down, staring past his feet up at the top of your cock and the dark skinned young man strapped to it.  You tie them all into position and immediately their struggles around your shaft feel like tiny vibrations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, three struggling boys tied equidistantly around your cock, one more attached so his tiny hole is hungry to be filled with the come from your slit and his curly hair ready to pleasure his giant friend\u2019s prostate, you approach the bed and see the precome dribbling onto an exhausted matt prokop.  You don\u2019t say a word but instead bend down and suck Zac\u2019s entire meaty cock into your mouth.  This also leaves Matt\u2019s small body mashed against your tongue.  The taste of the sweet precome, the musty cut cock, and the full flavor of Matt\u2019s body is nearly indescribable, but you have more pressing matters than tasting that rare treat for too long.  With an audible plop you lift your head, zacs cock craning up for more.  Your closed lips have taken matt along for the ride however, and you can taste his delectable toned body, his smooth flesh battered against your tongue.  With a bit of maneuvering he is turned around so that his own hard little prick pushes into your soft moist tongue, his meaty bubble butt poking into the roof of your palette as you raise your tongue again and again, forcing him to hump it for all he is worth, and his head pushed out between your lips like a cigarette.  He groans in arousal, whimpers in fear, and takes deep breaths from his ordeal all at once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over and kiss Zac, his own tongue fondling yours and that of his tiny friend who sputters as you pull back a bit before forcing the latter to continue fucking your tongue.  With a vibrating cock and a mouthful of zac\u2019s saliva and matt Prokop deliciousness you get ready to shove your cock (complete with its three screaming passengers) deep into the tight virgin asshole of Zac Efron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was in the dream making business, and that gun he was holding didn't shoot bullets, but rays that make people's fantasies come alive.  So, I was naturally skeptical.  He asked if I had ever fantasized about being shrunken, or had any fantasies about having sex with a giant girl or boy.

I agreed, still not fully convinced, but here I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young teen started laughing, obviously satisfied with his choice of trusting the black market salesman.  You quickly join in the laughter, licking your lips.  When you both slow to a small chuckle your hand darts out and picks Cody and his discarded clothes up in a single motion, bringing him closer to your face.

Your an actual giant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile broadens as much as his has dwindeled, \"No,my tasty little treat.  You said it yourself.  You shrunk.  And here's the kicker.

Now if I decide to play dress-up with you later, I can start with dress-down... or just cover you in dressing, I'm still not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you anticipated, the boy falls to the floor and starts to shake with mixed feelings of helplessness and fear, falling hard onto his butt.

Cole seems to think this means he's being let off, so he sits down and watches, relieved that it's not him that's about to become your next snack. The look on his face soon disappears, however, when you deposit the now naked Dylan back in the box and pick up Cole, repeating the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to eat us both, aren't you?\" asks Cole, his little body shaking with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I just thought you played the smarter twin on TV.

Judging from his scent, you decide that strawberry liquorice string would go best with these two. You fish a packet out of the fridge and withdraw a couple of strings. Putting the twins back to back, you start by winding the liquorice around their legs. You then take another string and tie it around their bellies, pinning their arms to their sides. It's now impossible for them to reach their restraints, they certainly can't bend down enough to bite through them. They're helpless and fully aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, too many sweets will rot your teeth,\" says Cole in a very 'matter-of-fact' way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say that about sweet, succulent boys as well, but you know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asks Dylan, the twin currently facing away from you as you raise the two of them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\"</span></div></div>",

Next your tongue caresses their upper bodies. You can even feel the difference between them, especially when it comes to Dylan's tantalisingly tubby tummy. Soon their heads are inside as well, and you close your mouth, reducing their screams to mere muffled yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggle against their restraints, jostling themselves around on your tongue, mingling their flavours together. This is what you had hoped would happen. The two may be twins, but they each have a slightly different flavour. They'd have been delicious seperately, of course, but together they compliment each other perfectly. With a little careful chewing, you manage to undo the restraints and seperate the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your mouth, Cole is the first to be swallowed. He reaches out for his brothers hand as he begins to feel himself slipping down, but Dylan's too busy struggling for his own life. Cole's slender bare body quickly slips down your throat and into your stomach, taking a few chewed strands of liquorice with him. You keep Dylan in your mouth a little longer, but finally swallow him as well. You feel sorry for Cole, seeing as his considerably plumper brother is about to land on him, but considering that he's now in your stomach, you reckon that that's the least of his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back and relax in order to digest your snack better. Eating twins was something very special indeed. You wonder now if you should just grab a single boy as your next snack, or search the box in hope of finding another set of tasty twins.</span></div></div>",

There are a few holes poked in the cardboard and a single phrase written on the side, \"Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip open the box and flip it over, letting a small figure fall out onto your bed. The young boy on your bed lies motionless, but alive. You recognize him as Jake T. Austin, who plays Max Russo on your favorite TV show, Wizards of Waverly Place. Now seeing the little morsel so...bite-sized makes you drool. You see a remote in the box and after reading the instructions, you become aware of how to change his shape, size and some other cool features. You hear a small groan and you look to see he's slowly arising. You grin while he stands up and looks around, not sure where he is. His eyes set on you and you see his expression change from confusion to panic. You stand and walk to the bed while he stammers and backs away until he's on the edge of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya doing little guy??\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses, but the replies, \"Umm....I've been better. What's going on here? Who's...I mean is this some kind of prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Not a prank little guy,\" you say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! What kind of movie magic is this? Your giant image is probably projected on a screen to make me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt him by reaching forward and grabbing his ankle, lifting his tiny frame to your face, upside-down. He yelps and screams, \"OH GOD OKAY WHAT'S GOING ON!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply laugh and start looking over him. Being upside-down, his shirt has started to slide off leaving his toned abdomen and half of his smooth boy chest showing. You, without thinking, start tugging on the shirt, ignoring Jake's protests, until it slip off. You pinch his upper body between your forefinger and thumb, and start rubbing his chest. He squeals in protest, but you keep going, thinking of what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you...?</span></div></div>",

As he grows bigger you start wrapping a rope around his growing frame, to make sure he doesn't get any ideas about escape. When he reaches 3 feet, you tied his arms above his head and lay him down on your bed. You love this size: he's just big enough to fool around with but still small enough that he's under your command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speaks up, \"What are you gonna do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just gonna have a little fun,\" you say giving him a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your shirt and began to straddle his hips. You lower your head to his chest and lick all around. He tastes surprisingly good, but you know there'll be time for that later. You look up to see his eyes closed, trying not to think about what's happening, so you move towards his face and catch his lips with yours. He pulls away, but you grab his chin and he must endure involuntarily making out wih you. After 10 minutes of that you let him breathe. You leave his face and move your hand slowly onto his abs and start to grind up on him, making him squirm, as you are sitting on his junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wink at him and start rubbing his growing member through his jeans, while you remove both his and your jeans, leaving you both in your tighty whities. You think to yourself, \"He's still my slave! Why am I doing all the work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you walk up to his face, leaving his inches away from your bulge and untie his hands. <br>\r\nYou force him to kneel in front of you and you say \"Alright slave, time for you to suck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes to wide and he struggles but you have a right hold on him. You force his face onto your clothed bulge and he gets a face full. You start to pull off your underwear and you place your foot on his package. You then get close to his ear and whisper, \"If you bite me...you'll be sorry,\" as you press down on your foot making him gasp and wince in pain. \"Get the picture?\" He nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab his head and pinch his nose leaving him no choice but to open wide. When he does, you violently throw your cock to the back of his throat and gags momentarily. You pump in and out of his mouth and soon you feel his tongue and lips start taking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I knew you were a cocksucker at heart! Oh god that feels good. You must really like me, huh runt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues this for 20 minutes before you finally shoot your load down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide fun is fun and you return him to his previous 3 inch size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the show Bromance and Brody Jenner, the hot young privileged reality star is with a group of potential bros.   They are chilling around a big table and for some reason there is a giant Wonka bar in the middle.  The dialog is the usual garbage; Brody is cockily telling some poor young man that he won\u2019t be his buddy while the kid sobs feeling insecure and abandoned.   What a jerk, you think to yourself, I\u2019d love to vore that arrogant ass Jenner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something quite strange and wonderful happens.  Brody lets out a yell as he drifts up out of his seat at the table and floats weightlessly above it.  His arms and legs flail wildly, so much so that one of his blue Ked sneakers flies off revealing a sock covered foot.  At this point you notice the LIVE icon in the corner of the screen indicating that you are seeing this whole strange event in real time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically the young man just rejected by Brody is the closest to him.  Brody extends out a hand for help and the guy just smirks and steps away from the table.  Brody continues to flip around head over heals while his lost shoe flips around as if held within a force field, but suspended in anti gravity.  Chaos erupts around the MTV set as people usually behind the scenes are rushing around trying to figure out what has gone wrong.  The commotion reaches a crescendo when Brody pauses in an upright position and then just vanishes in a bright flash.  His liberated blue Ked drops in the same instant bouncing to a rest on the giant candy bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about a minute you still see people rushing around the table in commotion yelling and scratching their heads, but then the screen goes black and a figure begins to take shape.  It is Brody standing on what appears to be a flat black platform surrounded by the darkness looking much disorientated.  Without the background clutter you notice even more what a handsome specimen he is.  He is wearing a tight white t-shirt, and a pair of stylish jeans.  As before, he is missing a shoe and hobbles a bit as he turns around trying to figure out his surroundings.  He looks to be about 2 or 3 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks towards the screen and stops.  He walks towards the screen and you realize he is looking at you.  \u201cHey cousin can you give me a hand here?\u201d he doesn\u2019t seem to realize you are much larger than he is at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this a marketing scheme? You think to yourself as you look down at the channel changer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s the show Bromance and Brody Jenner, the hot young privileged reality star is with a group of potential bros. They are chilling around a big table and for some reason there is a giant Wonka bar in the middle. The dialog is the usual garbage; Brody is cockily telling some poor young man that he won\u2019t be his buddy while the kid sobs feeling insecure and abandoned. What a jerk, you think to yourself, I\u2019d love to vore that arrogant ass Jenner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something quite strange and wonderful happens. Brody lets out a yell as he drifts up out of his seat at the table and floats weightlessly above it. His arms and legs flail wildly, so much so that one of his blue Ked sneakers flies off revealing a sock covered foot.  From below the giant chocolate bar also begins to drift upward and matches Brody's spin. At this point you notice the LIVE icon in the corner of the screen indicating that you are seeing this whole strange event in real time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically the young man just rejected by Brody is the closest to him. Brody extends out a hand for help and the guy just smirks and steps away from the table. Brody continues to flip around head over heals while his lost shoe flips around as if held within a force field, but suspended in anti gravity. Chaos erupts around the MTV set as people usually behind the scenes are rushing around trying to figure out what has gone wrong. The commotion reaches a crescendo when Brody pauses in an upright position and then just vanishes in a bright flash. His liberated blue Ked drops in the same instant bouncing to a rest on the empty table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about a minute you still see people rushing around the table in commotion yelling and scratching their heads, but then the screen goes black and a figure begins to take shape. It looks like a candy bar lying prone on an invisible black surface.  As the object comes into focus you begin to see something very odd.  The chocolate bar shaped object has Brody Jenner's head.  From at least one side of the bar is a sock clad foot.  His clothing has appearently merged with the wrapping on the chocolate bar and seems rather distored.  His tiny little appendages move about as the once pampered playboy comes to realize something in his dream world has gone terribly wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to</span></div></div>",

Breaking all rules for your little game you quickly snatch up Kenny and hold him by the back of his shirt, probably showing his wonderful little abs in the process. \"Let me go! This wasn't part of the deal!\" his thick Jersey accent carries through in his tiny little voice. You smile and bring him up close for inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful face, well sculpted with bright blue eyes now opened wide his shirt rides up revealing the lightly browned tummy below. His jeans are tight revealing those muscular legs and strong calves leading down to his feet which now kick frantically as if to find a ledge or something to grasp for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take advantage of the kicking feet managing to pull one into your mouth as he struggles. You suck at the tender appendage as your tongue is overwhelmed with the flavors of salt and bittersweet chocolate.  You lick and suck until the foot is clean and then proceed to the next forcing it with a finger into your mouth, enjoying it every much as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright eyes continues to struggle and protest in his thick Jersey accent. So cute, such a pitty there is only one of him to enjoy.  You drop him to the table surface for an instant. He tries to run but is quickly subdued as you pluck from below and remove his shirt revealing a perfectly sculpted upper torso. His squeaks and struggles continue as you lift him skyward by his right jeans leg cuff. With a flick of your fingernail you loosen his belt and he begins to slip out of his jeans. From such a height he is automatically compelled to hold on both with his arms from below and his toes curl outward from above. He moves his head frantically to avoid the inevitable. You lower his struggling torso gently into your mouth as he feels your warm breath against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips lock around him and your tongue begins to work him in further. Soon he is up to his waist and lets go of his jeans to try and push from the inside. Whoops! He falls in deep as you pluck away the jeans from two struggling lower legs. Looking in a nearby reflection you get to see the plump stocky soles of his feet as you continue to work him up to the ankles. With a tilt of your head you feel the muscular little lump work its way towards your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fine meal! You gather his tiny shoes from the chocolate and wash them and set the rest of his clothes in a mold for addition to your collection.  Now what to do?</span></div></div>",

The man showed some visible irritation and the handsome young man's dismissive tone but seemed to remember something and quickly brushed off the slight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Santucci! Now, we will need to get in some photos with different clothes and then a detailed full body scan. The dressing room is right over there and we will meet over there by the set when you are ready.\" Without a word the hot young guy proceeded to the dressing room and returned in his first set of clothes, jeans, with a shirt and boat shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe studio director, who was also the photographer, went to work quickly snapping shots in front of the props when Kenny interjected. \"These props are fucking weird man, why am I posing next to a giant cheese grater and silverware twice my length?\" The director smiled warmly and rolled his eyes slightly at the young man's protests. \"Rest assured Kenny, your agent has found a very lucrative deal. You like giving health advice yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man, hey no offense, but you should take a look at my Crossfit website, might help you loose a few pounds. I would suggest eating more lean meat and exercise.\" Kenny returned to the dressing room and returned in a tailored suit with a blue tie that matched his eyes perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Kenny returned in a white shirt, blue slacks with dress loafers for his final shoot. \"Is this almost finished, I need to get on to my next appointment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director smiled warmly. \"Of course Mr. Santucci! We just need to finish the full body scan. Must catch every beautiful detail for your adoring fans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to strip down? So no details are missed?\" Kenny seemed quite eager to show off his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, the scanner will be able to adjust for clothes. Please step up on the reconstruction platform.\" Kenny showed some hesitation at what had been said, but shrugged and opened the Lucite door and stepped onto the glowing white platform. \"Kenny dear young man, you might feel a bit disoriented during the process. Just breathe deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny's attention tracked to the door of the chamber which locked with an abrupt snap. \"Hey, how many of these dolls do they plan on selling anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the door locked and the machine ready to do its magic the director turned to the hot man in the glass with a grin that looked a bit more sinister than any he had worn before. \"Oh, we shall fetch a rather handsome price on just this one.\" Kenny's brow furrowed as the device hummed to life. Kenny took a deep breath as he found himself actually feeling a bit dizzy. Kenny Noticed the height marks on the side of the chamber, a strange sort of vertigo overtook him as he noticed his 6'1\" self looking squarely at the mark for 5'6\" \"Dude! What the fuck is this! Let me outta here man!\" Kenny's eyes grew wide as his mind processed what was happening. He kicked and pounded at the thick plastic chamber, but to no avail. He watched as the marks on the side of the chamber appeared to move up past him... 5 feet, 4 feet, 3 feet... He would have thought it just a trick but the weird man and the studio seemed to move up too. At the 2 inch mark the machine's persistent hum finally stopped. The chamber floor was now a vast plane but it was of no matter, Kenny had managed to stay near the door. </span></div></div>",

He tries to right himself, but you hold him with your thumb and run your finger up under his shirt to fell his tight little abs. Next, you pull up evenly on either side of his little shirt and plunk him in nothing but his boxers onto the surface of your kitchen table. You marvel as the 2 1/2 inch tall morsel tries to make a run for it.

You watch in a mirror to savor the experience as he slips in up to his boxers, his feet kicking wildly in the air. With your hands free you tug on his little boxers pulling them off adding them to the collection in the box. His two errant feet now flop around like spaghetti noodles. With your finger tips you push on the soles of his plump little feet finally devouring him whole.</span></div></div>",

The box will find its way back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                       The Keeper  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at the note and do not take it seriously.  A friend or two knows you would like to shrink down the male cast members of 90210 and you figure one of them has pulled this off.  You are still curious of the box's contents and with luck a look inside may reveal who is playing a joke on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you lift the somewhat heavy wooden lid and place it on the table.  Below you are shocked to see 13 tiny very handsome young men all decked out in very fashionable clothing.  Some are huddled on the bottom of the box while others seem to be orientating themselves.  Slowly you recognize the actors: Tristan Wilds, Josh Henderson, Dustin Milligan, Michael Trevino, Kellen Lautz, Brandon Michael Vayda, Adam Gregory, Tristan Wilds, Trevor Donovan<br>\r\nRyan Eggold, matt lanter,  and  Michael Steger</span></div></div>",

Vertigo overwhelms him as he looks down to see his feet leaving the earth. Suspended in the beam of green light he kicks desprately as his extra molecules are evaporated away. A figure steps out of the darkness surrounding the beam. A strange face glances at the now 2 inch figure of a man, smiles and plucks him from the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing poor Michael remembers is the sense of being trapped in relative darkness and stale air. He is disoriented during periods when the ground seems to be moving. Above him a few sky lights offer him only flashes of shadow. Finally, after at least a day the world above him explodes with blinding light. He is knocked off his feet as the room rocks gently hurling him to the wall and then head over heals towards the celing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on a soft surface... almost like a cloud. He struggled to his feet and gained his bearings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing on a vast plain of what seemed like fabric.

You grab it, run to your room and stare at the package for a little before ripping it open. There, lying passed out in the box, are Austin Mahone and Alex Constancio. You drool with lust just thinking about what you're going to do to them. You seize your chance and gently scoop them out of the box without waking them. You carefully remove their shirts, getting a glimpse of their hot young bodies. You place Alex in the box and start rubbing Austin's chest. He starts to wake up and you smile, waiting for him to realize what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ughhh...*yawn*...hey alex get off of me..im.....i....OH MY GOD WHAT THE HELL!! WHO ARE YOU?? AND HOW DID YOU GET SO BIG???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important little one...the only thing that matters is we're gonna have some fun,\" you say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by th...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's muffled as you engulf his entire body in your palm. You walk to the bathroom and start to strip him, ignoring his squeaks of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to take a shower. Mind coming with me little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes go wide with terror. You grab him, turn on the water and place him on the soap dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAUSTIN'S POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe what was happening. One moment I was relaxing with Alex and home and now I'm showering with a 60 foot teenage boy. My thoughts were interrupted and I feel his long fingers wrap around my waist. He says, \"You're gonna be my little washcloths, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even picking up the soap, he slapped me against his smooth chest and moved me towards his right nipple. Using his fingers, he pinch my nose forcing me to open my mouth. He immediately slams my mouth onto his nipple, almost gagging me. I hear his moans of pleasure and with one rapid movement, I'm lowered slowly past his abdomen and towards his enormous dick. He placing me on the monster and slaps me against the head, forcing precum into my mouth. He uses me as a toy to jack off with and I start screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIANT'S POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feels amazing. Austin's tiny body and cock are currently humping your cock and it's turning you on to no end. In no time you've shot your load all over the poor boy's limp body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got dirty little guy. Let's see where you can get cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you toss tiny Austin into your mouth and start sucking on him like a lollipop. You love the combined taste of Austin musky sweat and your seed. You pull him out and begin to lick his front up and down, paying special attention to his little soldier, standing at full attention. You part your lips and place him on your tongue. After a minute of sucking you can taste his ejaculation on your tongue. You tilt your head back and just like that, Austin Mahone is no more.</span></div></div>",

He tries everything to get out of it but nothing he says will convince you - you're adamant that he is the perfect final ingredient for your sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on the pan and tip a delicious jar of pasta sauce in. Finn is sweating as you wait a few minutes for it to boil. All this time, he is still trying to convince you not to do it, basically throwing a tantrum. But this only convinces you that he needs to go in even more. After a while, you're satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's ready for you now,' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO! Please! YOU CAN'T DO THIS! NO-!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pleas are replaced by screaming as you drop him in the pan and he is submerged by the boiling sauce, completely covering him. He tries to clamber out but you are waiting with a fork to painfully prod him back in. His screams keep going muffled as he plunges into the thick sauce. Then finally, he stops thrashing and you know he's been sucked into the contents. You have a quick taste and you're very happy indeed - Finn has added a lot of flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mix the Finn sauce with the Jack spaghetti and then check on the meatballs - perfect! And you can still hear Tom and Luke's muffled screams from inside. They must be very hot indeed. You have a perfect meal in front of you now and delight as you tuck in. First, you go for the Luke meatball and you dispose of him quite quickly. You hear him grunt as you ram the fork straight through the centre of the meatball and them mop up the sauce before chomping on it, dissecting the boxer into tiny little bits before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a lot crueller with Tom though, chopping the meatball (and his legs) in half, so a screaming Tom's upper half is left sitting in the pasta sauce. After you munch on the first part of the meatball, you decide you won't give the diver a quick exit and the small remainder of the meatball is easily swallowed whole. Still in agony, Tom faces the horrors of your digestive system down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was very satisfying overall, but it's whetted your appetite now.

'So maybe I'll go.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I think I'll just deal with you first,' you reply, before picking him up, ignoring his cries and squirms. You slam him uncomfortably down into the gloopy marshmallow mixture and then start rolling him into a ball, although his now sticky and gloopy head sticks out. You roll him for quite some time and he moans all the time. Then comes the exciting bit - as you very much like your marshmallows toasted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?!' Adam squeals. 'You don't want to do that! You'll ruin my taste!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know he's lying so take him straight over to the cooker where a flame is already waiting. Everything but his head is safely tucked inside the marshmallow so at first it's not too bad for him, although he does start to sweat a little bit.

His hair is singed off and he screams at you to stop whilst the Francos look on in absolute horror as the flames engulf the marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let him go!' Dave screams and you soon oblige, taking the burning marshmallow and depositing it in the ice cream, with Adam's head going in first. You think it was very charitable of you to shove his head in the cold cream after his incident with the flame, although you're not even sure if he's alive to appreciate it. He should still taste OK but you think you need to be more careful with the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how will you deal with the brothers?

Dave wretches as his sticky face is now right next to James' stinky feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you've rolled them up into a marshmallow ball and the men scream as they know what's coming next - it's time to roast the marshmallow! They now realise why they're different ways up - so whilst one is getting their feet roasted, the other is getting their head done and vice versa. There's no escape for either of them and they are screaming uncontrollably by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who gets their head done first and who will be getting toasty feet?

James cries. 'Nobody even knows who you-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you've heard enough. James' arrogance has cost him dearly and you spin the marshmallow round, making them both dizzy, to put James' head near the flame end. The marshmallow starts toasting and Dave yelps as his feet are burning. It's nothing compared to James though who lets out agonising wails before going silent. Dave can smell the smoke coming off his brother and gags from the smell, whilst also realising that he's no more. You lick your lips - smoked James Franco sounds tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spare Dave the same fate as his demise will be a much colder affair. You carry the marshmallow over to the ice cream and push it deep down into the freezing cold cream until it is more than halfway down the glass. Dave's muffled screams can be heard as he is engulfed by ice cream. It surrounds him and soon he's drowning in the stuff, wriggling and writhing like mad. You wander back to the box to pick out your next victim, knowing that Dave definitely won't be moving by the time you eat the dessert.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s funny, on TV they always make it sound like the five stages of grief/coping occur in order, each stage needing to be passed before moving onto the next. But I\u2019ve found, based on my years of causing grief to young men everywhere, that it\u2019s completely cyclical.  One stage may lead to another, but the order is never the same. It changes depending on the meat- lad- in question.  And there is always some residual emotion from past stages, which come back in waves, reigniting the whole process.  I could always be more scientific, removing the variables, only having one little treat at a time so that they can\u2019t feed off of each other\u2019s emotions.  I could plot their reactions and chart the stages.  But really, this is about my pleasure\u2026 not the betterment of mankind.  I do it because boys are absolutely delicious, and torturing them before they flail, dissolving alive slowly in my roiling gut, turns me on to no end.  Really, their feelings are irrelevant, as only my pleasure is pertinent.  If my pleasure is directly proportional to their pain\u2026 then so be it.  <br>\r\nTake my current stock for example; easily procured (you can call it kidnapped, but I loathe the term when \u201cprocured\u201d or \u201charvested\u201d or \u201cculled\u201d are so much more accurate, as they are merely foodstuffs), easily shrunken to the sizes of small mice, easily stuffed into the cages in the kitchen they are currently moping in.  They all had a relatively similar progression.  True, the older ones were quicker to return to anger and stir up the veal.  But basically it followed a standard trend.  <br>\r\nIt began with questions: \u201cWho are you?!\u201d  \u201cWhat have you done to us?!\u201d  \u201cWhy?!\u201d  \u201cWhat do you want from us?!\u201d  \u201cDo you really think you can get away with this?!\u201d  When answered, these quickly dissolved into denial: \u201cYeah right!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy, guy!\u201d  After I showed them my recipe book, and a huge case filled with \u2018mementoes\u2019 (shrunken skater clothes, cellphones, book bags, etc.) half of them went to anger, cursing and threatening, and screaming: \u201cHelp us!\u201d  \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d  \u201cWho do you think you are?!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re sick, man!\u201d \u201cFucking psychopath!\u201d While the other half immediately started pleading and begging, \u201cPlease dude\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do anything!\u201d  \u201cOh God!\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m too young for this!\u201d  \u201cThink of our families!\u201d  \u201cThink of all we have to live for!\u201d  As if I could ever feel bad for creatures as useless at their current size as insects are to a child with a magnifying glass.  Again, I told them how worthless they were to me, making clear all the pleasure I derived from their torment and tastes.  Like clockwork that sent them all over the board.  Some went back to denial, some increased their bargaining, some screamed, some cried, some cursed, some did a combination.  They fed off of one another like they knew I was about to do to them.  So I casually turned on the \u2018training video\u2019 and began reading my handwritten cookbook, complete with pictures.  Every once in awhile I\u2019d glance up and see one of them staring at me with wide eyes, looking at me casually planning their fates, and I\u2019d lick my lips at their appearance, making them scamper to the other side of the cage to watch more of the film.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had created the video over the course of a few months, after realizing my explanations were getting tiresome for me.  As I say in the opening narration, it isn\u2019t fair to me to have to explain to my food why it is going to be eaten.  Nobody consoles their steak!  The video does a good job of showing every single fate that may await the terrified youths.  I took great pains to record me torturing with fire, knives, feet, push pins, etc.  I chopped, I diced, I slowly grated, I mashed, I squeezed, I pressed, I ripped, I bit, I pierced, I punctured, I tore into, I dismembered, I disemboweled, I forced them to screw each other, I forced them to have fuck my titanic cock, I forced them to hump with my wriggling tongue and moist humid mouth, I forced them to have sex in my gaping puckered monstrous ass.  I explained their slow digestion process should they be swallowed alive, (which in truth, outside of the video, I always did).  The writhing is so much fun, tickling my insides, when swallowed alive.  Plus, the taste of blood overpowers the tender flesh and supple, salty skin. So I always prefer to keep them alive and kicking.  They saw tortures I never would have been able to commit had they been at regular size.  They saw psychological tortures which were more effective having been seen than they would be if I had committed them on these young men instead.  They saw forced gay sex which, to their delicate heterosexual minds- and they all were straight in this batch- were the worst of all.  And they saw me eating.  They saw my teeth gnash, or my lips slurp, or my tongue lick, followed by swallow after swallow after swallow.  Countless bulges drifted down my throat and I captured every sound, every struggling scream, every audible gulp, every plop into my waiting stomach, every moan of pleasure.  They saw me gobble up soccer teams, and suck weightlifters into my open maw like they were spaghetti.  They saw their own weakness, their desperation, their powerlessness.  They transitioned from male human beings into mere toys for my pleasure, and food for my enjoyment (as they weren\u2019t even big enough to sustain me on their own).  In turn they saw me transition from male human being to glowing god.  They saw my control, my power, my lack of compassion, my insatiable appetite for both their torture and their bodies.  When the video ended they had all reached the same stage: depression.  Every one of them was in shock.  Some huddled together, some shivered, some sobbed, some sniffled, but nobody spoke.  Nobody thought it wasn\u2019t real, or that they could beg their way out of this.  Finally.  Silence.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow then\u201d, I lick my lips in anticipation, putting down my homemade cookbook, and eyeing them hungrily.  \u201cLet\u2019s take stock of my current haul.\u201d<br>\r\n\tI reach into the hamster cage, one of twelve holding devices set up in my kitchen, so quickly that the boys don\u2019t even realize the door has been opened.  The other cages, tanks, and jars are currently empty.  I usually like keeping a stock of certain types: a jar of gay twinks, a box of Senior High School Jocks, a skater and emo assortment in a tank for quick snacking and special recipes, but having just returned from vacation, the usual cacophony of screaming- ranging from prepubescent to manly- is not to be heard.  I\u2019ve decided to inspect my new treats in age order.  My fist clenches around Jensen before anyone knows what is going on, and he is dragged out with a sudden gasp from my intense squeeze.  Immediately the other morsels are back to their begging and screaming and threatening, especially his older brother, who I had managed to capture at the same time.  Opening my fist, Jensen Gering, the young model, wheezes for breath, all of the air having left him with my swift retrieval of him from the cage.  Tiny fists pound at the closed door and I beam down with an intentionally toothy grin, ignoring the others.  <br>\r\n\tUsing one finger I flick the youngest snack in the chest, forcing him onto his back where he immediately struggles to get up.  However, my pointer finger placed delicately on his smooth tummy has him squirming to no avail.  While I begin unwrapping my treat I get a good look at him.  He\u2019s got messed up blond hair, quaffed to one side like an emo, but his face makes him look too young for that.  If he wasn\u2019t veal I\u2019d call him almost androgynous.  His pink lips are juicy and sit between two equally juicy cheeks.  With sun-kissed skin and a completely smooth face, he looks mouthwateringly delectable.  The lines of salty tears pouring down his plump cheeks as he begs for his mother only add to this assessment.  With a popping sound I have both shoes off of his kicking feet.  Immediately I go in for a sniff of his tiny socked toes.  The aroma is heavenly.  Not the pungent scent of the older boys, but rather sweet, almost powdery fresh.  My tongue darts out and pulls both legs into my mouth, up to his knees.  He panics, thinking this is it.  I savor each succulent moment, and when his socks are considerably moist, I use my front teeth to gingerly suck them right off of his tanned feet.  He flails around uncontrollably from the feeling of my wet tongue slithering along both soles with the tip sampling between each digit.  He lets out whimpers that sound like a mixture of screams and giggles.  All the while my now free hand, the one not balancing his quivering body and pressing one finger onto his stomach, is busily tearing off the remainder of his clothes, roughly.  By the time his feet are removed from my mouth with an audible plop like that of a wet dick coming out of a tight asshole, trailing enough saliva to coat his entire body if I wanted to, he is left in only his underwear.  Panting for breath, he begs for me to stop.  <br>\r\nHis brother and all of his cellmates are screaming at me to let him go, that I\u2019m sick, that he\u2019s just a kid, etc.  They look up at my 25 year old body, ripped from the gym and all of the protein I eat\u2026 them\u2026 and can\u2019t understand how such a hot-looking young God, one who would appear like a sweet dreamboat if they were average size, would revel in this kind of torture on younger men and teens.  The truth is, eating younger guys, people who may still live with their parents, is thrilling.  Having so much control over someone\u2019s kid, a guy with so much to live for- there\u2019s just nothing like it in the world.  And when I hold them, and play with them, and molest them, and trap them in my gut just for my pleasure\u2026 it sends shivers all the way down.  <br>\r\n\tI move my hand closer to my face, directly under my chin now.  Slowly my tongue snakes out.  The screams refresh now, as though the brief reprieve meant they felt momentarily secure.  My finger comes off of Jensen\u2019s stomach only to have the slithering tongue, like a cobra, push into his bare chest.  I run my smooth, moist muscle across each tiny nipple, my tastebuds dancing all over him and moving slowly lower.  I lap at his supple stomach, and take some gentle nibbles, jabbing at his navel and exposed muscles again and again.  Finally I move further downward, my powerful tongue lifting his waistband and pushing it down a bit.  He stops struggling and goes rigid.  The tips of my tongue has begun slithering in between his warm asscheeks, raping his tiny brown cherry and moving further and further inside.  All the while his cock\u2019s head scrapes against the moist flat area of my tongue and I suckle his balls.  He\u2019s too young to last long, a pity, and a moment later he convulses, showering me with a taste of his sweet and salty filling.  It\u2019s just a tiny load, an appetizer for what is to come, and he lets out a long moan is my tongue pushes his underwear down past his cute little feet.  I smack my lips and swallow his socks, which were still on the side of my mouth, his underwear, and his speckle of seed all at once.  Then, as he continues to breathe heavily, too winded to move, I pucker my pillowy lips and kiss him on the chest, my tongue jabbing out for another taste of his salty skin.  Then I do the same to his stomach.  And then I wrap them around his dick.  No longer hard, although he came so fast I\u2019m not even sure if he was hard to begin with, I suckle a bit, making sure to get every last ounce of tasty young seed.  The tip of my tongue slurps at his head and I suck so hard I\u2019m worried of dragging his organs out through his slit.  But he remains motionless and I deposit his nude form into a cage directly next to the first one, also suspended under a counter.  He heaves heavily and I watch the rise and fall of his cute little body.  <br>\r\n\tLocking the door, I look at the still screaming youths in the first cage once more.  They instantly go silent, wondering who I am going to examine next.  The door is swung open wide and they scatter, knowing that jumping out would only lead to broken bones and a swifter demise.  They had seen in the videos what I do to snacks with broken bones.  It doesn\u2019t bear repeating here, but it is as graphic as you could imagine.  My fingers move around in excitement, dancing along the shaking bodies, even though I\u2019ve already decided who is next.  Finally I grasp Jackson in my hand.  His entire body vibrates as I drag him out and lock the door.  Just a year older than Jensen, and a year younger than Jensen\u2019s brother, I acquired Jackson during what I\u2019m guessing was a date with his girlfriend.  He\u2019s the only non-celebrity of the group, but is just as tasty.    <br>\r\n\tBringing him up to my face I scrutinize him, my breath pushing his hair back in long gales.  He\u2019s cute, pale, and skinny.  There isn\u2019t a hint of muscle nor of fat on his slender, skeletal frame.  Each smooth leg looks as brittle as toothpicks and each arm equally so.  His face is angelic which explained why he had the girl swooning all over him when I first saw him.  His only downfall, aside from lack of meat, is his hair.  It looks like his mother is still cutting it for him- stringy tufts feathered over his forehead and then off to the right, yet still somehow shorter than my own glorious locks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My tongue lolls out of my mouth and Jackson grimaces as though a dog was just licking his face.  Instead, he finds my tongue much less pleasant.  The saliva is thick and sticky, plastering down his too narrow eyebrows.  His tiny button nose drags over my taste buds and my rough muscular tongue slurps at each nostril- not that it\u2019s done consciously, but rather, having such a large tongue on such a small treat forces my tongue baths to roughly penetrate every opening it passes over.  I feel the breath sucked from his nose and tight lipped mouth.  His body spasms from lack of air but all I can think about is how unexpectantly sweet he tastes.  Almost like his sweat glands excreted sugar instead of salt.  <br>\r\nPulling him away I don\u2019t wait for him to catch his breath before ripping his clothes off of his slight frame.  Everything about him is little.  Little hands, tiny cute little slim fingers, tiny feet, a tight tiny booty, and a tiny cock.  He\u2019s still gasping for breath, positively wheezing out all of the spit he inadvertently swallowed, so he doesn\u2019t respond to my taunting or my thumbnail flicking his flaccid dick.  I push him down firmly as he continues shuddering not from fear, or pain, or cold, but his inability to recatch his breath.  Again the air is forced out of his lungs as my point finger digs into his back, pushing his smooth stomach against the tough ridges of my palm.  His skin is so smooth compared to the course indentations on my rough hands.  The ball of my finger caresses the arch of his back to his shoulders, petting him like a hamster.  Then my tongue replaces my finger.  He has tears in his eyes, coughing uncontrollably, while my tongue molests his supple frame.  Each long, slow, lick starts at his pert clenched cheeks and rolls slowly up to his shoulders, alternating each time.  With no warning, my next lick pierces his defences and plunges into high tight virgin hole.  He stops mid-cough and screams in sudden pain and pleasure while I greedily dig in as deep as I can.  His struggles merely egg me on and soon I am pushing so hard that my lips rest on his cheeks, my tongue mining into each crevasse.  The suction is audible when I pull away.  I lift my finger up and he moves into a fetal position with his head still down. His raw ass is still pushed up as he knees find his chest so I nuzzle it with my nose for a moment, inhaling the musky scent, before flicking it once, hard, with my thumb and forefinger, sending him soaring forward into the second cage.  Jensen\u2019s motionless body cushions his fall and I can see a huge red welt taking over Jackson\u2019s small ass.  He sniffles, clutching the younger boy like a teddy bear.<br>\r\nBy the time my focus returns to the cage, Dillon Gering has already figured out that I\u2019m going in age order, and knows he is next.  He doesn\u2019t hide in a corner, as he is too scared to move.  Instead he stands in the middle of the cage, shaking uncontrollably as my hand slowly reaches in, its shadow covering his entire quivering frame, and grasps him tightly.  The only sound he can muster, despite the deliberately slow way I\u2019ve snatched him, is a high-pitched \u2018meep\u2019.  Like his brother, Dillon is a young model.  He\u2019s tan lithe, without being too thin, has a beautiful head of light brown with blonde streaks in a surfer style, and a baby face similar to his brothers.  His cheeks are positively pinchable, although if I were to attempt it at this size I\u2019d yank his face right off the bone.  The freckles on his face make him look even younger than he is, and the little bit of his ears visible under the mop of hair look crunchy and suckable all at once.  Once my hand opens he retains his pose, unmoving aside from the quivering lower lip, the steady blinking as he stares into my gigantic handsome face, and the shaking of his shoulders.  Clearly about the break down, he stands on my palm, his weight somehow feels adorable, focused on his two tiny feet.  I can feel the treads in his sneakers pushing down with the smallest force imaginable.  It was like having a GI Joe standing perfectly upright in the palm of my hand.  Deciding that he\u2019s too freaked out to be any fun at the moment I gingerly begin undressing him.  After he\u2019s seen what I did to his little brother and the other boy he doesn\u2019t fight or complain.  Nor does he help me get him perfectly nude.  I can tell that his dick was a full inch or two bigger than his brother had they been at regular height, but his still sits  flacid on the side of his thigh.  I have no desire to play with him at his present state, as he\u2019s being no fun at all, so instead I give his body a long lick from toes to the top of his head, turn my hand and do the same to his back.  Smacking my lips I nod in appreciation of the peppery aftertaste.  \u201cDelicious,\u201d I mutter.  Now nude he feels even cuter.  His tiny well-manicured feet can feel the blood course through my veins and I can feel his own rapid heartbeat through his soles.  His feet are smooth and uncalloused, but still moist and rank from being stuck in shoes and socks.  He\u2019s been lifted to eye level so I can smell the sour sweetness of his little piggies.  Yet the odor is far fainter than those of my normal morsels.  Perhaps he isn\u2019t as active physically as his lithe figure would have me believe.  His shoes had been well-worn but not visibly damaged.  Somehow he maintains his pleathery black Nike\u2019s shoes in ways teen boys usually are unable to, or merely don\u2019t care to.  The smell is mild, like a provolone cheese.  Lapping at them with the tip of my tongue like a puppy taking a sip of water, I find that they even taste like provolone, whereas his younger brother\u2019s were closer to a bleu cheese mixed with a sharp cheddar, the norm for my treats.  Slowly and easily I put him down in the second cage.  As soon as he is out of my hands he screams.  It\u2019s a long, piercing screech that has clearly been building throughout the whole ordeal.  Finally regaining his senses he begins sobbing and rushes to check on his nearly comatose with fear and disgust brother, pushing Jackson out of the way in the process, cradling Jensen like a mother to a dying child.  He clutches him so hard that Dillon comes out of his stupor as well and hugs his brother back.<br>\r\nMelvin Melblom is the last of the veal, and the last of the models.  A full two years older than Dillon, yet the cutest of the bunch so far, he trips over my other treats as I bring my hand slowly closer and closer humming the theme from Jaws.  The last few inches I lunge at him, holding his furiously struggling body firmly, and drag him out.  I have to hold him by the hood of his jacket, dangling him to get a good look at the morsel.  Definitely the tannest in the haul, and the tallest of the veal, he\u2019s got the adorable face and fluffy dirty blond hair, quaffed straight up in the center, and to the side on his right, of an instagram celeb.  As he dangles, swaying from side to side and twisting from his struggles, I realize that I can\u2019t control myself.  I can\u2019t keep inspecting him, as was originally the plan, for his mouthwateringly succulent appearance demands that I taste him now.  Opening my mouth like a lion his eyes go wide in fear as I maneuver him over my mouth like a bunch of grapes.  Instead of prolonging his discomfort and lower him slowly, I drop him straight in, clothes and all.  I was right not to wait.  Sure, all the lads so far with delicious, but Melvin\u2019s taste in practically orgasmic.  My eyelids flutter in ecstasy and I moan in satisfied pleasure.  His struggles only help me get a better taste, despite his clothes.  While I\u2019ve never been able to tie a cherry stem with my tongue, I am nonetheless very adept at undressing my young men in my mouth.   Using my tongue, teeth, and roof of my mouth I have Melvin completely nude in under a minute.  I even separate him from his no longer needed garb, spitting out the shirt, underwear, and jeans, swallowing the socks and shoes, while Melvin is stuck in one cheek.  My tongue laps at the flavor all over his supple young flesh, tickles his feet, and caresses every contour of his body.  I can\u2019t stop moaning and mmming, sending vibrations throughout my entire mouth.  Clearly, despite his struggles, he is also enjoying the sensation as his cock has grown exponentially.  Without even trying hid needlelike dick is digging into me.  Maneuvering him a bit I position him so that his firm ass is at the roof of my mouth, pushing him into my undulating tongue.  He is pressed down by my pallatte again and again, fucking the spongey moist muscle.  Despite the humidity and dank moistness of my cavernous mouth which must feel like being back in the womb, he is able to come within moments, dousing his seed all over the top of my tongue.  I allow him to rest for a moment while I suck on his entire body.  His come pools with my saliva at the back of my throat, held back by the wagging uvula, before plummeting into the black abyss below, giving him a preview of all of their fates.  My roiling stomach sends up a spout of come-flavored gas which I hold in my mouth for a moment, torturing melvin, before I release it into the cages.  A moment later, Melvin is also limply spit into the second cage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to have some fun with the more seasoned and aged meat, I take out two at a time; Colin Ford and Dylan Minnette.  While Colin is the younger looking of the two, both are actually the same age.  Friends from before their current ordeal, they were procured together.  Colin has the sturdy rectangular face with a wide jawline one expects from the all-American boy look.  He is slightly shorter than his friend, but far more fit. Clearly an athlete, his six pack, pecs, and straining muscles are visible beneath his shirt at all times.  His hair similar to Melvin, albeit shorter, he is one fine looking specimen with comically gigantic feet and long slender fingers perfect for digging through my teeth as a toothpick after I eat my first morsels.  Dylan is a bit lanky.  His abs are also painfully obvious in his tight fitting shirt, but more from being skinny than being muscular.  Yet somehow, above his abs, there is a clear definition of meaty pecs and powerful biceps.  His eyes are squinty as though he is always looking into the sun, and his jaw, though not as angular as his friend\u2019s, is equally powerful.  Dylan\u2019s hair is dark and short with a little flip at the front.  Both are among the palest in the haul, and both are making my mouth water.<br>\r\nThe two young men are squeezed in both of my hands.  I can feel them struggle, as the uncomfortable grip I have on them makes it difficult to breathe.  Yet they gain no traction and it only feels like a slight vibration in my fist.  Satisfied with the inspection I deposit both studs in one hand where they stand on the palm, quaking in fear.  Again, the feeling of their shivering, just from their little shoes touching my rough skin, felt amazing.  These two young men, formerly in their physical prime, showing off their prowess to any lady who saw the two friends walking down the street, were now nearly weightless, both fitting in one hand.  <br>\r\nA droplet of saliva falls from the tip of my lip, cascading down and exploding on both of their heads.  I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve been drooling.  Clearing my throat I give them one simple command.  \u201cStrip each other\u201d.  Colin and Dylan stare up at me, the momentary confusion after my order was given replaced with unadulterated fear.  They know not to disobey me after all they\u2019ve witnessed, both with the other captives and in the training video.  Rather than plead or curse at me, they immediately turn to each other for fear of the repercussions of disappointing the giant god before them.  First Cody takes Dylan\u2019s hoodie off, followed by his undershirt, and then the process is repeated by Dylan.  Normally I\u2019d tell them to make it more sexual, but this batch of morsels seems to be more petrified than any haul/shopping trip I\u2019ve ever taken.  I\u2019m worried that the slightest thing could set them into a comatose state; and those boys are never fun to play with.  Either the heat from my hands, from their bodies being near each other, plain fear, or a combination seems to have left them both in a thin film of sweat, making every inch of their smooth skin glisten the more clothes they take off.  Soon their supple bodies are completely exposed with the exception of their underwear, and skater sneakers.  Clearly they noticed in the video what my favorite places to taste are.<br>\r\nI roll my eyes as Dylan looks up at me unsure.  I give him an expectant look and he nods, resignedly, before returning to his undress his best friend from his last remaining wrappings.  Colin leans on Dylan\u2019s shoulders as the former\u2019s shoes are untied and removed, along with the musky, sweaty socks beneath.  The way Dylan\u2019s head is bent, it looks as though he\u2019s giving a blow job.  Finally he gingerly puts his fingers into the hem of Colin\u2019s underwear, slowly lowering them to the latter\u2019s smooth pale feet, making absolutely sure not to accidentally graze against the flaccid dick.  Even limp, Colin\u2019s cock is massive for a boy of his size.  I suppose it\u2019s true what they say about boys with big feet, I think as I lick my lips at his ordinarily size 13 monsters.  Shivering in the cold, Colin returns the favor with Dylan.  Dylan\u2019s dick is the same size as Colin\u2019s however it is less impressive as he is currently sporting a massive erection.  He looks at his disgusted friend, embarrassed by what he\u2019s showing.  Clearly something about being undressed or undressing his closest buddy has turned him on.  That, or he\u2019s a secret macro fetishist.  To be honest though, I couldn\u2019t possibly care less.<br>\r\nUsing my pointer finger, as Colin is already kneeling down to take off the shoes of his mate, I gently pet his shaggy hair, making him stop his actions and shiver with fear.  His shivering wears away as he realizes I am merely stroking him like the pet that he is.  He thinks that being my toy must be better than my meal, but I\u2019ve had hundreds of former sex toys who would eagerly disagree with that notion\u2026 had they still been around.  His fear\u2019s submission is short-lived, however, as he attempts to stand up after removing Dylan\u2019s shoes.  He finds that the pressure from my finger is keeping him on his knees in the palm of my hand, and a little bit more pressure on the back of his head clues him into what I have in mind.  He struggles and screams as realization sets in, but his open-mouthed cry for help is all I need.  Immediately his lips are around Dylan\u2019s cock, and Colin gags audibly, never having had anything so large in his mouth before.  He\u2019s eager to bite down in a fit of fear and homophobia, but doesn\u2019t want to bite off his best friend\u2019s dick.  Dylan, though initially squirming away, after finding himself unable to back away, as my fingers curled up behind his back, now closes his fluttering eyelids in sheer bliss.  The other boys in both cages watch with newfound fear as they see just how twisted I truly am.  After a few minutes of this excitement I find my own dick has grown to twice the size of the tallest boy.  I reposition the friends into a 69 position, lying them both down and forcing them to suck for all they are worth.  Dylan is having an even harder time, as after a few licks from his wet mouth, Colin\u2019s dick has swelled to a ridiculously large size, pushing against the back of the former\u2019s throat, bending at the end, and sliding down almost to his stomach.  Having the two boys orally fuck on my palm has resulted in no small amount of precome to burst from the tip of my own cock.  As I lick my lips over the young men rolling around on the rough skin of my palm, my own one-eyed monster is drooling from his own hunger.  <br>\r\nAll of the potential snacks notice it, and whimper in fear.  Here\u2019s a young guy who is older than all of them, and should want to help.  Instead, he is in fact the reason for their present predicament, plans on gobbling them up, has tortured thousands of lads in a similar predicament over the years physically, sexuallty, and mentally, and now it appears that he is also massively turned on by that same torture!  I begin absentmindedly stroking my dick.  Colin and Dylan attempt to remove the cocks from their mouths so they can breathe and stretch out their jaw muscles, but I just clench them tightly together.  <br>\r\nWith my dick stroking hand I reach into the first cage and draw out the final two delicacies.  They\u2019re British Harries twins, here on holiday, and they are the definition of twink.  Both have lithe figures, with very little muscle, but with skin so smooth and pale they may as well be newborn babies.  Aside from their heights, everything about them is small and cute.  They\u2019re pink feet, tiny fingers, and even their button noses and pursed lips are adorably delectable\u2026 or delectably adorable.  Either way, they are both somehow straight, and so are not the least bit amused when they are put on the same hand as the wrestling best friends.  The added weight of the twins, and their warmth, is a feeling quite indescribably cute.  It\u2019s like when you see a puppy that is so adorable you just want to squeeze the life right out of it.  The pressure off of them finally, Colin and Dylan roughly detach themselves.  \u201cI definitely want you stuffing each other with cream filling at some point, but for now, will you help unwrap the twins?\u201d  Finn, the twin on the left with somewhat bigger biceps and a barely older looking face, opens his mouth to protest but closes it a moment later, reconsidering.  Colin begins undressing Finn as Dylan peels Jack like a ripe piece of fruit.  Pushing Dylan and Colin\u2019s heads together they get the hint and begin making out, the taste of their own dicks on the other\u2019s breath.  Finn and Jack look terrified when I swivel their heads to face each other too.  They\u2019re brothers after all and would never in a million years ever have\u2026 their thoughts are stifled when they find themselves forcibly making out with one another as two other boys ripped their clothes off of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they\u2019re finished I line them up into a square on my palm, and they immediately get to sucking each other off when I push them into their new partners.  Colin has his mouth full of Jack, who is gagging on Dylan, who struggles to suck on Finn, who has a good taste of Colin.  They all writhe in sweaty glistening flesh, more uncomfortable than they\u2019ve ever been in their lives, yet hard as rocks merely from, what is essentially, being orally raped by one another.  Turning each one over I then repeat the process, this time rimming each other.  The twins have tight, lean asses whereas the two friends have some bubblicious badonkadonks I find myself moving the twins out of the way every once in awhile to snake my own tongue in for a taste, widening their holes with my wide muscle.  They scream in pain and pleasure as I lap at their backs, run my tongue up their legs, squiggle it in to join their own tongues in the ass of their neighbor.  <br>\r\nAt last, roughly, I force them all into the standing position, one behind the other, where they are pressed together, hard, at their asses.  Each finds a sudden popping of their stiff slick cocks into the ass of the boy in front of them, in the opposite order from the last ordeal.  Jack has his cock stuffed inside Dylan, whose hips are gyrating against Finn, who fucks with all of his might into Colin.  They are all in intense pain, but the tight hole of their partner still fills them to the brim with rapturous delight.  The train begins to pick up speed and they move as one, tears streaming down their faces as my hand still hold them firmly by the ass of Jack and the stiff dick of Colin, rubbing both (Jack with my thumb and Colin with my pointer finger.)<br>\r\nWhile they moan and cry and scream and beg, reach into the other cage with my unoccupied hand.  Nobody in there is paying me the slightest attention, as they are far too busy watching the forced quadruple rape with unadulerted terror on their faces.  All four boys are clinging to each other, no longer afraid of touching the nude bodies of their prison-mates, as the present horror outweighs the homophobia.  As one they all gasp, as the air is emptied from their lungs, and then scream, when they find themselves trapped in my palm, a wriggling mass of pale succulent flesh.  I close my fist, with the veal inside, against my dribbling cock head, rubbing their flailing bodies up and down my shaft.  They sputter at the musky taste of my skin as they are pressed roughly against it again and again, finding their own dicklets turn rigid from the friction.  They feel like a vibrating fleshjack as they struggle to breathe, to separate from one another, and to stop the pressure against my dick.  <br>\r\nWith an audible plop I seperate Dylan from Finn, edging the former just as he was about to spray his seed.  Before they can say anything I shove Finn and Colin unceremoniously between my lips, only their lower halves sticking out.  Finn continues fucking Colin, though petried that I\u2019m about to eat them both, as he is so close to coming that he can\u2019t stop.  Colin\u2019s own dick, which has not yet had the pleasure of entering another hole, soon finds itself sucked into the dark abyss of my mouth, as do their twitching legs and asses.  I roll them around in my mouth, tasting sex and delicious boy meat.  Maneuvering them a bit, I turn Finn so that his head is against Colin\u2019s toes.  He\u2019s in so much bliss that he even sucks Colin\u2019s meaty toes.  Once they are fully slathered in my saliva and their own salty sweat and precome, I push them back from between my lips, turn Finn again so he can wrap his arms around Colin\u2019s waist, and then lower them to my puckered hole.  Neither one has time to scream as they suddenly realize what is in store for them, before I shove them up, head first.  They\u2019re kicking feet are all that is left of them on the outside, which I pinch to draw them some of the way out, and then push to put them all the way in.  I continue this quicker and quicker, using them as a giant vibrating dildo while Finn continue to push into Colin.  Colin\u2019s cock scrapes against each ridge of my ass ring and colon, the friction pleasuring him immensely.  I can feel their soft hair tickle my prostate.  The four other lads are still gagging on my smelly dick as I rub them faster and faster against it.  I pull the conjoined Finn and Colin out and then plug them in feet first this time, allowing them to catch their breath, before opening that coiled fist, where Jack is still fucking Dylan.  They see the heads of their friend/twin poking from my meaty ass, looking like my sphincter is blowing a double bubble.  <br>\r\nReaching back up, I separate the two boys, leaving Dylan on the counter, and throwing Jack into the air before catching him in my mouth.  As soon as he enters my dank dark maw, hot and humid and soft as the womb, I attack him with my tongue, molesting every inch of his succulent flesh.  I spread his cheeks, dig my tongue in as far as it will go, slather is chest, suck his toes, etc.  Allthewhile one hand strokes the younger young men against my dick while the other pushes Colin and Finn inside my tight ass and pulls them out again.  And Dylan sits on the counter, terrified, at full mast, and with aching blue balls.  Every hole filled, my whole body alive with sensations and pleasures unknown to most men, I position the tasty youth in my mouth so that his ass is poking back while he remains in the fetal position, making the forced metaphor of the womb complete.  Pushing him with the tip of my tongue, his bubbly ass escapes my pursed lips, and Dylan sees it coming closer and closer to him.  He is so horny that he doesn\u2019t think twice, but immediately shoves his hard cock into Jack, who screams at the sudden uninvited guest.  Dylan plows away as all the others struggle to breathe, trying their hardest not to give me the satisfaction of coming, despite the sensations they are all forced to experience.  I suck Jack back inside, pulling away from the counter while Dylan is still fucking away.  His body rests on my pillowy lips, but his cock is now being sucked by me, and up the ass of Jack.  His pleasure is as insurmountable as my own, the suction from my mouth coupled with the tightness of Jack\u2019s virgin hole, when all at once\u2026 we come simultaneously.  Legs buckle, hips gyrate eyelids flutter, and assholes spasm.   <br>\r\nJack is filled with Dylan\u2019s sweet cream, as he explodes his own seed on my waiting tongue.  The four boys against my cock go limp as they fire their loads, mixing the milky concoction with the giant glob that has erupted from my own dick.  The friction from my hole has Colin ejaculate inside of my ass and Finn unleashes his load into Colin.  Panting, sweaty, coated in come and sweat and tears and saliva, all 8 morsels lie in a heap in the second cage, a mass of pulsating flesh and glistening muscle.  Even I need a moment to recollect myself.  \u201cThat was one for the books, boys\u201d, I finally mutter.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s left me famished.\u201d  As one I hear every boy\u2019s panting stop, they\u2019re hearts all missing a beat.  \u201cLucky for you all, I found your tastes so exquisite, I want to make sure I have enough of your meaty little bodies to make a proper meal out of you.  So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll waste time soaking you in juices, getting you nice and tender, and marinating you slowly\u2026 but I definitely want to fill your little tummies, fattening you up before you fill my own tummy.\u201d             <br>\r\nTaking advantage of their exhaustion, as they panting too hard to even attempt speaking or fighting back, I clean myself up quickly and then grab each boy, depositing them in a different bowls.  My preparations for the meal were thankfully completed as they went through their five stages of grief\u2026 the first time.  So now there was nothing to do but pour the fodder into the bowls along with them.  I carefully arrange the bowls in order of how I will eat my dinner.  Similar to tapas, each three-five inch morsel will be in a small dish, so as not to fill me up too quickly.  As the bowls are moved around, each lad falls again and again, the slippery porcelain combining with the high lips and bodily fluids coating the living meat.  Once they are in order I speak to them as though this was just the most ordinary thing in the world.  I muse to myself that I really should start a \u2018Cooking with Men\u2019 show one of these days.<br>\r\nI begin by plopping fresh relish and sauerkraut all over Jackson, until he is only a cute little head poking out of the mound.  \u201cNow, unlike most maneaters, I don\u2019t like fat prey.  I\u2019m not a witch and you\u2019re not Hansels.  I prefer lean meats\u2026 your protein is what helps me stay in the godly state I\u2019m in now.\u201d  I put the remainder of the relish in the refrigerator, my pectorals popping for emphasis at my last comment.<br>\r\n\u201cInstead I just like stuffing you guys enough to have a small pudgy bulge, not of fat, but of filling.  I don\u2019t have time to wait for your lithe bodies to get fat as it is, plus plump boys just aren\u2019t as tasty as the muscular and fit ones.  You really just made yourself all the more delicious for me by playing sports and working out.  Had you been pigging out, and not taken care of your appearance, I probably never would\u2019ve even noticed you.\u201d  I chuckle at the irony while sprinkling cheddar and provolone cheese cubes all over Dylan.  He runs around the small space in the bowl as it rains down on him, each blow sending him reeling. <br>\r\n\u201cI want a tiny paunch,\u201d I continue explaining.  \u201cYou\u2019re just going to eat enough to be super uncomfortable.  A little jiggle in your belly.  You shouldn\u2019t be able to physically fit any more of it in your mouth without it just sliding back out because there is no room left.\u201d  Next, Melvin finds himself dodging slices of pineapple in much the same vein as Dylan was.  He soon finds himself stuck inside a coil of swirled pineapple.  The juices will no doubt accentuate his deliciously sweet flavor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moving onto Finn, he has the pleasure of being showered in bacon bits, which don\u2019t pound on him like the last two boys, but do assault him with stinging bits of small meat.  It feels like a hard hailstorm beating against his defenseless nude skin.  \u201cIt should feel like the slightest scrape against my sharp teeth will rupture your tummy, sending your belly\u2019s tasty contents all over my tongue.\u201d       <br>\r\nJack has the misfortune of having a hot fondue set full of melted cheddar cheese poured all over him, the contents burning his flesh ever so slightly.  He screams in pain but is soon used to the temperature.  \u201cI want whatever you\u2019re stuffed with coursing through your veins and flavoring your supple, juicy meat.\u201d<br>\r\nFinally, moving over to Colin\u2019s bowl, I see his shaggy head looking up with terror.  He is the luckiest of all, however, as I only have one solid wedge of bread stuffing to join him inside.  It is easily twice the size of him, filled with spices, onions, potatoes, etc.  The onions and fresh garlic have tears streaming down his eyes in seconds.  \u201cAnd if any of you refuse to swallow your designated stuffing,\u201d I growl, eyeing each one carefully, \u201cI will force it down your throats and then shove the remainder up your tight little holes.\u201d<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all that needed to be said, because after a second\u2019s pause, all six of the boys begin chowing down on the bowl\u2019s other occupant.  Jackson, Dylan, Colin, and Finn use their hands to tear off and scoop up large bites, eating quickly and somberly, though efficiently for fear of repercussions, like always.  Meanwhile, Melvin and Jack are getting themselves covered in liquid as they are forced to dive in head first, eating their way out of the gooey substances entrapping them.  Only Jensen and Dillon, the young brothers stare up in confusion.<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, for you little treats, I need to do this a bit differently.\u201d  I leave the counter for a moment before returning with some hot fudge, some caramel, an eye dropper, and a small funnel.  Checking the lads nearby to ensure they are still stuffing themselves adequately, I am satisfied and bring the funnel over to Jensen.  He looks terrified as my shadow passes over him, and opens up his mouth to question my intentions.  As soon as it opens I shove the edge of the small funnel inside, pressing firmly to ensure that he can\u2019t spit it out.  He gags on in for a moment, falling to his knees to try rolling it out of his mouth.  I tilt the caramel inside the other end of the funnel slowly, and watch as his eyes bug out of his head, his throat filling with the sticky plasmic substance, unable to breathe.  Dillon screams out at me to spare his brother, that I\u2019m killing him and need to stop.  The other lads hear the ruckus, but upon seeing how I\u2019m torturing Jensen, decide they better not get distracted if they don\u2019t want to join his fate. After thirty seconds I can already see his belly distend slightly, and remove the funnel.  Jensen tries catching his breath, his throat sore and his stomach uncomfortably full.  But before he can get out more than I wheeze I\u2019ve flipped him over and inserted the end of the eyedropper as far up his virgin ass as it can go, making him gag and squeal.  I\u2019m half worried he\u2019ll spit up some of the caramel, but he keeps it down, as he knows I\u2019d just make him eat it again.  With a strong squeeze his intestines are flooded with caramel, a tad leaking out of his sore hole.  He is so exhausted he remains there, ass in the air and knees at his chest.  <br>\r\nBy the time Jensen has turned back around, panting on his back as a slow dribble of caramel slips between his soft pillowy cheeks, I have the hot fudge ready for him.  He is too tired to even scream as it cascades over his entire body, the heat wafting over him in a burning wave.  A moment later I tilt Dillon\u2019s bowl into his brother\u2019s.  \u201cJensen won\u2019t survive long under all that hot fudge.\u201d  The older sibling is bright red, both from rage and the heat of the fudge all over his smooth young form.  \u201cYou need to eat all of the fudge off of his body that you can, before he suffocates.\u201d  In an instant Dillon has his face in the mess, drinking it up, using his hands to reach for his brother, scooping fistfulls into his own mouth.  When he feels Jensen and yanks him into a sitting position, he begins using his tongue to lick the fudge from the younger boy\u2019s face, tasting both thick chocolate and his brother.  Now he must realize why I do what I do.  His brother\u2019s salty skin mixed with the sweetness of the fudge must be mouthwatering\u2026 It\u2019s how I intend to eat him after all.  <br>\r\nGlancing around I see that all of the treats have slowed down.  The lethargy from eating too much too fast has caught up to everyone, and they look like zombies as they slowly try forcing more food down into their already full stomachs.  Giving each of the first six a light poke in the belly to check for jiggling, each one cringing in pain despite the gentleness of my prodding, I am satisfied that they are stuffed to the maximum.  \u201cYou six can stop now.  You all look positively scrumptious.\u201d<br>\r\nI turn my attention back to Dillon who has been sucking on his brother\u2019s skin even faster than the others had been eating, so he is already as full as they are.  Jensen\u2019s face is free of fudge, but his entire body is cocooned in the thick substance.  \u201cYou can stop too, Dillon.\u201d  I smile at how nicely everyone has done.  Glancing at each bowl I see that all the boys are splayed out, with barely enough strength to move.  Gorging themselves so soon after the physical torment of our sexual congress has left them logey and the food in their stomachs makes causing constant belly aching.  For the first time since their capture, not a one of them sobs or screams or curses or begs.  All I hear among the bowls is a low, pained, exhausted moaning.<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get my dinner ready\u201d, I beam down at their tired, sweaty faces, licking my lips for emphasis.  The fear has been replaced with pained fatigue for the time being.  I know from experience, however, that by the time they enter my churning gut, they will be actively fighting for survival again, just in time to feel their delightful squirming and death throes as they digest alive.  Nothing feels as good as an internal massage.  <br>\r\nTheir lack of movement and their inability to make a sound other then the groans makes the preparation process all the simpler.  Jackson is first.  The young treat is lifted from the small remains of relish and sauerkraut, dangling listlessly from between a pair of tongs.  As one of my favorite foods has always been \u2018hot boys\u2019 (sometimes called \u2018man wieners\u2019, Frank furters [when the lad is named \u201cFrank\u201d, \u2018dude dogs\u2019, etc.) I bought a hot dog grill years ago.  Made for 24 cocktail weenie sized men, or 6 foot long lads, the rollers get just hot enough to cook my chosen meat until their skin gets browned and flakey, turning them around to grill them evenly.  It\u2019s a bit depressing plopping Jackson down there alone, but I want a smorgasbord tonight, of all different delectable treats.  While he is turning on the rollers, groaning from the heat and dizziness now in addition to his other ailments, I use a spatula to lift Dylan up from between the sprinkled cheese bits, and lower him onto a heated pan.  Again, the flame licking at the metal is not high enough to burn him, but certainly enough to cook him through, leaving him alive but in intense pain.  He tries getting up, rocking back and forth like a turtle stuck on his back, but his full belly makes it impossible, and his flesh soon begins sticking to the bottom of the pan a bit. I throw in some onions and mushrooms to grill up nicely alongside him and then flip him over, marveling at his pert cooked ass as it jiggles abit.  A moment later his entire backside is covered in a blanket of swiss cheese which instantly melts against him in a gooey cocoon.  When he is done I turn him back over, looking at the tears stream from his eyes.  He notices the sizzling beef patty beside him and is very aware of his new position in life, as well as his fate.<br>\r\nWhile the two lads get their unwelcome tans, I scoop Melvin out of the pineapple remains.  His skin glistens not just with sweat, but sweet juice as well, and I can feel his stickiness when I bring him over the slice of pizza left over from the night before.  The remainder of the pie was eaten, along with the delivery man, but this one slice was saved for my current meal.  I push Melvin into the dough and cheese firmly, his ass, legs, and arms sticking in deep, spread out in the middle of the slice.  Putting the whole slice on a cooking sheet, then sprinkling on a few cut up pieces of his unfinished pineapple, I cover the whole plate in tinfoil and toss it roughly into the pre-baked oven.  Soon the smell of roasting boy flesh is in the air, and my mouth waters in anticipation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as my meat has finished cooking I begin with Jackson, using the tongs to grip his slightly crispy, browned body under his armpits.  He is nestled gently in a soft cocktail weenie roll, the opening allowing his head and arms to stick out the top, the fold coming just under his armpits, and his feet to stick out the bottom.  If it wasn\u2019t for the large slit down the middle, exposing his supple body, he\u2019d look like he was a kid wrapped up in a blanket.  Although I suppose he really is a \u2018kid in a blanket\u2019 as opposed to a \u2018pig in a blanket\u2019.  After adding the ketchup, mustard, and leftover sauerkraut to his midsection and groin, the cocktail weenie is put on a large plate and covered so as to keep him warm for consumption.  <br>\r\nNext I use the spatula to lift up my beef patty, depositing it onto the bottom half of a slider roll.  Dylan\u2019s eyes watch as his cooking mate is taken from beside him, and they follow the descent when it comes back to dig under his damaged skin, scooping him, and the melted cheese coating his back, up.  I give him a reunion with his friend, the ground beef patty, placing him on top of it.  Even if he had the energy to move, the melted cheese has him so firmly glued to the meat patty that he\u2019d be unable to even turn his head.  Grilled onions, mushrooms, lettice, tomato, pickle, and barbecue dressing are strategically placed all over his burnt skin, giving him some cooling sensations, before the top bun is lowered onto his body.  Like Jackson, his head, arms, and feet are outside of the bun, while the rest of his form is stuck within.  Jackson is relieved to see the light when the lid comes off of his plate, but after his companion is placed beside them, their moans of greeting are silenced by the lid\u2019s return.  This reunion occurs once more a minute later, when a slice of steaming pizza, with Melvin sweating atop, takes up the remainder of the space on the plate.  Again the lid is put over them, trapping them in the steam and darkness until their consumption.  The appetizers secure, I move onto the main course.      <br>\r\nColin\u2019s long, lean body, now with a slight paunch visible behind his glistening abs right where his stomach is, rests with his back against the remainder of stuffing.  He is so listless that I don\u2019t even have to compete with a single struggle as I raise him between two hands and mold him like clay into the exact shape I want, using a tiny bit of twine to keep him stuck in that position.  My mouth continues to water as his glazed eyes look up at me from my hand, trussed like a turkey.  His legs spread eagle, large succulent feet in the air, arms bound at his sides, he looks ready to eat, but I\u2019m not satisfied yet.  I tear off a few chunks of the stuffing he hasn\u2019t finished eating, and smile as his eyes go wide, understanding my intention.  Colin\u2019s mouth opens to scream, but a cherry tomato is jammed inside before he can make a sound.  Now free from any noise, I take my time carefully spreading his pillowy cheeks, and then shove the stuffing deep into his tight hole.  Tears stream out of his eyes while my thumb pushes each piece in past his asshole ring, forcing it as far as it will go, the pad of my finger gently caressing his taint, cock, and balls at once.  When the stuffing reaches past his colon into his prostate, his dick springs to life, growing to exceptional height and girth.  I can\u2019t resist a few quick licks, my humid breath and spongy tongue sliding up his shaft and lapping at his cock head.  A few more strokes from my fingers, up and around his towering shaft which would be so large had he been regular sized- but at this height smaller than my thumb nail- and I\u2019ve milked him of his sweet seed.  His chest receives a glob of come.  \u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d I moan.  \u201cNormally I\u2019d marinate you for awhile, making you tender and juicy, but you\u2019re already covered in my favorite sauce.  Sweat, tears, and your own creamy filling.\u201d  Using a marinade brush I spread the substance all over his body until he is glistening and sticky.  The bristles tickle every inch of him, but he is unable to laugh or cry, his mouth still crammed full of tomato.  Placing him on a coated pan, I push him into the waiting oven and move onto the side dishes.<br>\r\nFinn and Jack have their complimentary food stuffs already completed and warming on the stove top.  Finn is dropped onto a mound of creamy mashed potatoes first.  I mix it and him around with my spoon, careful to coat his body in the delicious starch, adding some of his uneaten bacon bits to the mix.  When he\u2019s stuck, only his head sticking out of the globs of buttery potato, I coat the top with gravy, which washes the mash out of his hair and off of his face, but replaces it with warm brown sauce which he sputters through.<br>\r\nJack\u2019s bowl is then tilted over a saucepan filled with homemade mac and cheese.  Again I use a spoon to stir him around, although he is already coated in the cheese sauce from his time fattening up.  Both he and his twin are scooped out and plopped on either side of a second plate.  I check on Colin but see that he is still sizzling nicely, not yet browned enough for my liking, and close the oven again.<br>\r\nJensen is put into a bowl and thrown into the freezer so that his fudge coating can harden, making him caramel filled center expand outward.  But before I close the door, I remove some chocolate mint chip ice cream from inside.  After scooping out a few spoonfuls and putting them into a second bowl, his older brother Dillon is forced into a sitting position, and his ass pushed into the top until he is sunken in up to his belly button.  A squirt of hot fudge to compliment his fudgy filling puts his tiny body into shock, as it opposes the freezing sensation in his lower body, the heat and cold fighting on both parts of his miniscule form.  He is then covered up to the tops of his shoulders in whipped cream, and a cherry is placed into his mouth just as he begins to scream at me to save his little brother from freezing to death.  I let him keep the latter company in the freezer while I eat my meal.  Before the door is closed for the final time I whisper, \u201cthe next time you come out, you\u2019ll be the last two morsels left outside of my gut.  Say \u2018see you later\u2019 to your little friends.  When you next see them they\u2019ll look very different, and you\u2019ll be too busy screaming in pain to say \u2018hi\u2019.\u201d  The door is slammed and the brothers are in silent darkness as they wait for their doom, knowing their fellow captives are being tortured and dined on only a few feet away.<br>\r\nWhen I next check on Colin he is finished cooking, so I use my oven mitts to slide his tray out, use my spatula to lift him out, and put him on the second plate between the twins.  His cooked flesh is so intoxicating that even Finn can\u2019t help but lick his lips.  With a scissor I cut the twine from around his body.  He is in far too much pain to move an inch, which helps me to reposition him.  As I mold his tender flesh again, using the oven mitts so as not to burn myself, he whimpers in pain from around the tomato.  I put him on his knees, his cute little toes poking out from under his bubbly ass which is raised into the air so that its contents does not spill out.  His arms are forced at his sides, and his head is raised up, looking directly at me.<br>\r\nSatisfied that my meal is complete I pour myself a glass of chianti, (Ruffino Riserva), light some candles, and put on a bit of light music.  My casual demeanor somehow frightens the youths even more, as I finish the preparations.  A napkin, knife, and fork are put on my place setting, the knife there merely for appearances as I have no intention of piercing their flesh\u2026 feeling the boys alive and struggling from within makes for the best post-dinner sexual entertainment there is.  After all, they are here for two purposes only- they exist for two reasons only- my sexual appetites, both carnal pleasure and literal hunger.  It\u2019s why they were put on this earth.  Sating my id is all they are good for\u2026 and all of the time they\u2019ve been raised, going through the trials and tribulations of life, caring for their delectable bodies and feeding their minds, was only to make them more desirable snacks/toys for me.  Of course, having them think that I plan on dismembering them, cutting their meat away, slicing heads and limbs off, removing organs, and chewing them all up, is all well and good though.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I push the second plate into the center of the table, below the flickering candlelight, and remove the top of the first plate, setting it down in front of me.  I begin with Jackson.  My hands wrap around the bottom of his bun, feeling his weight which is heavier with the condiments and his added girth, and I slowly raise him to my lips feet first so that I can smile at his wide-eyed terror.  Jackson knows it is time.  Anything he\u2019s been telling himself about it ending happily ever after or thoughts of delaying the inevitable with my procrastinating food preparation is gone.  All that\u2019s left is pure consumption.  My tongue darts out suddenly and laps at his cute, pale little feet, tickling the soles and then quickly moving on to the tops and delicate toes.  I suck on each one separately, and then both together, resting his smooth calves on my lower lip.  The wind is then knocked out of him when I pull him from my mouth and spin the entire cocktail weenie around.  I hold him upside down for a moment, devouring him with my eyes one last time, and then open wide, the shadow of my maw passing over the top half of his body as he is slid inside head first, the bottom of the bun resting on my salivating tongue.  I block out his screams and those from his trapped fellow prisoners below- it seems they finally got their voices back\u2026 aside from Colin whose mouth is still full.  Suddenly, when he is in up to his belly button I slam my teeth downward as though I am about to bite him in half.  Shrieks of fear ring out from within and outside of my dank musky maw, but I stop just short of his skin.  I love teasing my prey.  Jackson\u2019s sigh of relief is short lived.  The rest of the appetizer is pushed into my mouth and my lips close, sealing him in darkness.  My tastebuds are flooded with flavor, from the doughy consistency of the bread, to the tartness of the condiments, to the meaty delectable morsel that is Jackson himself, everything mingles together beautifully.  I batter him around, sampling every inch, every combination of tastes, separating them and combining them, sucking and slurping and licking, etc.  I chew at the bread, swallowing it down first as a preview of what is to come.  He is exhausted and can barely breathe in the dank warmth, so when I finally swallow a few minutes later, all the flavor and condiments sucked off of his smokey cooked skin, he goes limp and slides down effortlessly.  The lads below trace his descent in my throat, and I can feel him plop into the waiting acids below.  My stomach flutters like I\u2019ve just spoken to a secret crush, but I know it is just the renewed struggling of the young man, as the acids burn at his already bruised and cooked skin. <br>\r\nAny thoughts of this turning out alright in the end, or being a dream, or me faking my intentions is gone now and the room is in silence following my audible gulp.  The only question on anybody\u2019s mind now is \u2018who is next\u2019.  I sigh contentedly, continuing to act as though nothing out of the ordinary has occured- as though I don\u2019t have two plates full of abducted shrunken youths in different kinds of food, two in the freezer- as though I hadn\u2019t just eaten a kid with a whole life ahead of him- as though this is how every man eats his dinner- as though every meal leaves the consumer in a state of sexually charged bliss.  After a sip of wine I answer everyone\u2019s question by pulling the Melvin and pineapple covered pizza off of the plate, eyeing it hungrily.  To an outside observer who didn\u2019t know a young man was stuck in the gooey cheese, my look of primal hunger might seem normal.  Who doesn\u2019t lust after pizza when famished?  But knowing he is there, seeing my bestial and predatory appearance, scares the ever loving shit out of my little morsels.<br>\r\nSpeaking of shit and my little morsels\u2026 as Melvin looks positively petrified, his lower lip quivering as he stares directly into my eyes.  With a wink from me his eyes slowly drifts down to the O-shaped cavern of my hungry maw, glistening white teeth juxtaposed with the pale red of my lips, gums, and mobile tongue.  Stuck to the cheese, legs spread wide, he is a delectable looking morsel and I bring the tip of the slice up for a bite, gnashing my teeth as I chew the first bite.  The pineapple\u2019s sweetness accentuates the acidity of the sauce.  If it wasn\u2019t for the trembling succulent youth, the pizza would have been delicious enough, garlic melding with cheese and perfectly crisped bread.  The meat just makes it even more heavenly.  As a New Yorker I\u2019m used to gigantic slices, but for fear of Melvin being lost in the background, I\u2019ve made a much smaller pie.  One more bite has me teeth come down millimeters away from the tip of Melvin\u2019s plump little toes.  I take care to eat all around his body, chewing noisily and greedily to show how much I\u2019m enjoying my second appetizer.  His head rests on the crush like a pillow so I continue eating all of the crust surrounding it.  Soon, all that\u2019s left is a single bite, too big for the average man to fit in his mouth, but the perfect size for one trained in the art of sucking down boys.  Melvin sits atop the small piece, bite marks surrounding the pizza all around him.  I bring my head over him and give one quick kiss on his chest.  My lips part as the peck turns into a sensual session of making out with his entire body.  I can taste the grease from the pizza saturating his smooth toned young flesh as my tongue dances across his entire exposed body.  I have the entire pizza prison on my palm below me, my mouth craning to sample the flavor Melvin\u2019s prone body.  It\u2019s even better than the initial taste test, and soon his small body is enveloped by my probing tongue and pillowy lips.  I leave no part untasted, lapping at his nipples, gargling his tiny balls, slurping his surprisingly meaty dick, and sucking his head.  With an audible plop I release him and see his eyes narrowed from all of the saliva.  His head was pushed against my tongue so that I could taste each feature, saliva and my slithery muscle pushed in both nostrils and sucking the air out, the cushioning from my tastebuds tantalizing his blemish and hair-free face. As has become common practice with all of my favorite morsels, when I finally threw the final bite into my mouth, I took great care to finish Melvin\u2019s cock off.  The humiliation of spraying his load inside the mouth of a man about to eat him always makes the final taste all the sweeter, plus it helps lube him down for his ultimate destination.  Almost immediately he comes in my mouth from the feeling of dank wet warmth, the pineapple juice on his skin combining with his sweet cream in an orgasm of flavor.  My tongue continues molesting him, separating him from the remainder of the pizza.  When I can\u2019t control myself anymore, my mouth full of flopping appendages, sauce, cheese, come, and pineapple, I swallow.<br>\r\nAfter another sip of wine and a smacking of my lips, savoring the meal, even going so far as to lick each finger clean, I return my gaze to the nearly empty first plate.  \u201cOh, Dylan!  You look so lonely there! Well\u2026 lonely and delicious.  Why don\u2019t I return you to your new friends.\u201d Without another word, Dylan is up.  My thumbs support the bottom of the cheeseburger and my other fingers dig into the top, pressing roughly into the roll so that Dylan\u2019s sore abdomen can feel the pressure. Because Melvin\u2019s face was so tantalizing I neglect Dyaln\u2019s bottom half for a moment and begin with his head.  Slowly I bring the burger up to my open mouth, letting him gaze in wide-eyed terror at my undulating uvula and waiting wagging tongue.  My shadow closes over his head and I close my lips over his neck.  Again his face is pressed firmly against my tongue so I can taste the soft powdery feeling eyebrows, crips protruding ears, perfectly chiseled chin (which I tickle with the tip of my probing tongue), tight lips, and rounded nose.  With his face cushioned by my pillowy slimy tongue, I begin sucking on his head like a lollipop.  Dylan\u2019s ears instantly pop and all of the air is sucked from his nostrils.  He is the perfect head for this- it\u2019s round with short hair, and I can\u2019t get enough.  Just when I start to worry about sucking his head clean off of his body, I part my lips slightly, reducing the pressure and allowing him to sputter, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.  His arms rise to wipe the saliva off of his face so I close my lips again, and begin tasting his meaty arms, dancing it over his meaty shoulder, cradling his biceps, and tickling his musky armpits.  A few moments later he grows dizzy as I remove him, spin the burger around, and repeat the process with his large pale feet and kicking legs.  I hadn\u2019t noticed before, but there is a bit more than peach fuzz on his calves, tickling my tongue, and making him taste extra salty.  Clearly the extra hair has caught his sweat and flavored his lowest third amazingly.  Again I suck, my tongue slathering up each leg and digging between each manly toe.  If I sucked hard on his head it is nothing compared to what I do now.  He nearly gets sucked out from between the patty and condiments into my mouth from the pressure I\u2019ve built up.  It even hurts me how hard I\u2019m going, but he can\u2019t even form a scream as he\u2019s still coughing from his head behind sucked nearly off like a grape.  When I finished with his legs I do not swallow the saliva down.  It\u2019s flavored with Dylan so I begin nibbling at the slider all around him, letting his own aroma tease my nostrils while his taste mingles with the rest of the burger.  After chewing everything around him my mouth is bursting so I swallow a few times, leaving only Dylan and a little bit of roll remaining.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From below I hear his best friend\u2019s gravely voice speak for the first time since being in the oven.  The cherry tomato has been bitten through and it pains Colin to talk, his throat so dried out from the cooking process.  \u201cLeave him alone you giant fucker!\u201d  It takes him almost thirty seconds to rasp out the sentence.  <br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s so delicious,\u201d I fake argue, putting the other side of the tomato back into his mouth before he can respond.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  You\u2019ll be reunited soon.\u201d  With that I toss Dylan and the remaining bite of the burger into the air.  He screams at the descent, but is silenced when he lands on my tongue and my mouth shuts him inside the darkness.  I tease him with my tongue a bit more, and once he\u2019s separated from the roll he\u2019s pushed into one cheek as though he was a nut and I was a squirrel.  Focusing on his dick he gets hard very quickly, much faster than any straight young man I\u2019ve ever had squirming in my mouth or wiggling in my gut.  Worming my tongue into his pert clenched ass, I push him forward so that he is shoved against my teeth.  Pursing my lips, his stiff cock slides out between them into the cool open air.  I bend my head, turn the other plate around, put it atop the now empty one, and shove my nose into Colin\u2019s musky meaty ass.  It\u2019s still propped up in the air invitingly, so after a good sniff, I move my lips to the opening and shove his friend\u2019s rigid dick deep inside.  Colin bites through the other cherry tomato and screams in pain, his stuffing being pushed further up into his body.  Using my tongue I push Dylan harder and harder against my teeth, his dick rattling between the gap in them, out between my lips, and into Colin\u2019s stuffed hole.  It doesn\u2019t take much before Dylan\u2019s hips buckle, back goes rigid, and has filled Colin to the brim with his come.  Even with his ass straight up in the air, Dylan\u2019s jizz dribbled out a bit, cascading over his waist and thighs.  I turn the plate back around, listening to the sobs of pain, and then open my mouth just enough to show Colin his best friend breathing heavily in post-coital bliss.  \u201cColin, I\u2019m so sor-\u201d<br>\r\nI snap my jaw closed and swallow Dylan down.  All Colin manages to say between gritted teeth is \u201cyou bastard\u201d.  The tears streaming down his eyes make me wonder if they are from pain or loss.  Regardless I smile and raise my fork up, ready to dig into the main course and side dishes.  Beginning with, what could only be called, the traditional food first, I tilt the gravy boat over Finn and his mashed potatoes, moving my wrist so that it polls around and slowly begins cascading like a waterfall onto Colin\u2019s raw cooked back.  The sudden heat on his already sore skin makes him bite his lip in pain.  My fork raises up and stabs down directly next to Jack, impaling some of the macaroni and cheese, the tine scraping against the plate loud enough to make all boys flinch.  I raise the melted cheesy morsels to my mouth and chew thoughtfully, my gaze on all three trapped lads only whetting my appetite.  While both side dishes look so cute, lying their trapped under their respective foodstuffs, it\u2019s my main course that has my tongue lolling out between eager bites.  He is still on his knees, his pert ass pointed upward and his back arched, as though he\u2019s an eager little twink begging to be fucked.  In reality his ass is already full of stuffing and the come of his late best friend, (now struggling to stay afloat the stew of digested boys/food and stomach acid), and his slightly burnt skin makes any movement out of the enticing position impossible.  I figure he deserves at least one last nut bust, so as I alternate between the mashed potatoes and macaroni, both flavored with the delectable twin meat, I inch Finn and Jack closer and closer to the juicey entree in the center of the plate. <br>\r\nMy knife is raised on top of Finn, who is suddenly positive he is about to be severed in half, or eviscerated with his disemboweled guts hanging out.  Instead he finds the hard, cold side of the blade pushing him and the small amount of buttery potatoes and gravy, still coating his smooth pale skin, to lie directly in front of Colin.  A little pressure on his head and Finn slides down a bit, his flacid cock now directly below the downward facing stuffed main course.  Colin can\u2019t take his eyes off of the older boy\u2019s dicklet, not out of any lust, but merely because it hurts too much to raise his head.  He knows what I want from him, but he knows he\u2019s doomed either way, and makes no attempt to appease his hungry captor.  Unbeknownst to him, my fork has been repositioning Jack as well.  Covered in cheese sauce, still on his back, he too finds himself under Colin, although he has an identical view of the younger lad as the latter has to his twin.  I slide his feet upward, maneuvering him so that Finn\u2019s feet are touching the top of his head.  If they were upright Finn would be standing on Jack\u2019s head, but as they both have their slick backs against the cold porcelain of the plate, they are instead staring upward.  Finn looks at the ceiling, while his dick droops lazily beneath the face of Colin.  Meanwhile Colin\u2019s own dick dangles over the head of Jack.  <br>\r\nDespite Colin\u2019s complete late of hope, Jack appears to not have given up.  He knows the only chance, as small as it is, of getting out of this alive, is to put all inhibitions aside and put on a good show for his giant tormentor/consumer.  He arches his neck upward and takes Colin\u2019s entire foot long dick into his mouth, gagging but unwilling to let that get in the way of his last chance for freedom.  Colin, in his prone position, can do nothing but moan in pleasure, his flakey cooked dick receiving some much needed relief; the moisture and soft mouth of the twin is a blessing to his lightly burnt balls and monster cock.  Not wanting to give me the pleasure of knowing I\u2019ve broken all three of them, he silences his moans with the only thing he can stuff into his mouth.  Soon his groans of ecstasy are silenced and picked up by Finn.  The stuffed turkey boy finds his knees slipping in a mixture of mashed potatoes, cheese, and gravy while he is sucked off from beneath by one twin, and sucks off the other.  Pert ass clenched as tightly as it can in the air, a dribble of stuffing coated in come sliding down his thighs, his back arched in orgasmic pleasure, he feels Finn fucking his mouth while he is being milked from below.  The stuffing combined with Finn\u2019s humping makes him feel as though he\u2019s being spitroasted, which was actually a method I had considered cooking him earlier\u2026 spitroasted on an open flame, supported only by the twin\u2019s stiff cocks, as I rotated him around slowly.  But I\u2019m just as happy with the stuffed turkey I\u2019ve turned him into.  <br>\r\nJack, still desperate to put on a good show for his master, turns onto his stomach and rises onto his own knees, stepping back a bit.  Now Colin\u2019s cock is pushed back against his taint while Jack continues sucking, slurping, and milking the younger man\u2019s engorged balls and dick.  It isn\u2019t long before both Finn and Colin shoot their loads into the dy throats of their suckers.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNice job, boys\u201d I sputter from behind all the saliva that\u2019s been building in my mouth, \u201cwhat a perfect send off for Colin.\u201d  Before any of the three can respond, my fork has taken the former position of Jack, directly below Colin\u2019s unmoving form.  My knife goes in front of his head, and pushes, sliding him back back a bit so that the fork is now under his entire front side.  Before raising him, I can\u2019t resist a lick.  My soft pillowy lips land on his arched back and I plant a kiss, pushing my togue out slowly and giving his whole backside a large, long lick, from his taint to the back of his head, going back twice to get each meaty shoulder.  The cooking, marinade, sweat, etc. has made him covered in every juice the human body can produce in addition to the brown sauce\u2026 the only way to describe it is heavenly.  He tastes positively orgasmicly, mouthwateringly, delectably, delicious.  It\u2019s true that the English language has some flaws.  But perhaps the biggest one is that his salty, sweet, musky flavor and heavenly smokey aroma have no better words to describe him.  Finally, I lift him up off the plate onto the fork, and can almost see his sad eyes reflected in the glistening eyes of the twins.  I notice that Jack is whispering something out of the side of his mouth to his brother, and assume it\u2019s an escape plan,  but am soon pleasantly surprised to see Jack fall flat on his back, his brother eagerly lapping at the former\u2019s already dribbling cock.  If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think they were starting to get off to this ordeal.  However, every time they turn to look up at me, it isn\u2019t with excitement, but rather terror, as though they are looking for encouragement that they are doing the right thing and I\u2019m thankful for the entertainment they\u2019re putting on for me while i have dinner.  It\u2019s pathetic how broken they are.  As if I would ever spare their lives for such a half-hearted display.  Nevertheless I do watch them go to town on each other, trying out all sorts of positions for my pleasure, while I slide their former conquest between my lips, removing the fork from my mouth with a slurp.  <br>\r\nColin is too pained to put up any sort of fight.  So I easily slide him around my warm wet maw, digging my tongue into every hole, snaking it between each fold of succulent young flesh, and sucking the flavor from every last speck of him.  It doesn\u2019t take long, as he isn\u2019t moving, and it isn\u2019t all that much fun anymore.  So I send him to the back of my throat and swallow him down to see his friend one last time.  Being immobile, I know he won\u2019t last long trying to stay afloat of the roiling acids and churning gut below.<br>\r\nI don\u2019t wait for a moment after the swallow.  Instead I stick my head down and give the fucking twins a tonge bath, inserting it between their dicks and assholes while they plow one another, widening their spincters to help them slide into one another more forcefully.  I\u2019m not one for incest really, but they are actually having a good go of it.  After a few minutes of playing my stomach rumbles, indicating that it\u2019s working hard on the previous treats and is ready for more entrants.  Using only my powerful tongue, I wrestle both lads into my mouth.  Finn begins to panic, but Jack keeps him calm, undoubtedly still under the impression I just want to get some entertainment from them, and I\u2019d be spitting them out to keep as toys/pets once we were done with our fun.  They continue fucking in my mouth, adding more sweat and sweet precome to the mix of mashed potatoes and cheese that I suck off of their pale smooth pulsating twink flesh.  Once I\u2019ve swallowed all the traditional food down, I separate my side dishes, putting one in each cheek.  I can\u2019t tell who is where, but whoever is in my right cheek is pushed outward onto his stomach atop my flat tongue.  His brother is still stuck in the other cheek with my molars clenched tight so he can\u2019t see what is going on.  With a quick flick, the former flips through the air, colliding with the back of my throat, and I swallow.  He reaches past the edge of my tongue for his brother, and then descends into darkness.  Letting the other twin out, he explores for a moment.  I can feel his clenched toes against my taste buds as he crawls around, attempting to walk, but finding my jaw closing more and more.  He panics when he can\u2019t find his brother, realizing all of their work was for nothing.  Resignedly he collapses and I get one final taste of his tasty cheeks and clench asshole while he sobs in the fetal position.  Another quick swallow and I\u2019m finished with my meal.  <br>\r\nNormally people wait for a little bit after eating to have their dessert.  Those people also probably feel full once in awhile.  When it comes to shrunken men, I\u2019ve never been full.  I\u2019ve eaten entire frathouses in mere minutes, and then gone looking for more college kids to consume. I\u2019ve taken an entire team of football jocks, put tem in a bowl with steep sides, squirted some Hershey\u2019s syrup on top, and told them that whoever puts on the best show can live a little bit longer as a sex toy while all of his friend are gobbled up\u2026 kind\u2019ve like Polyphemus\u2019 reward to Odysseus for the great wine.  Then for an hour I sat back and watched as the bowl was stuffed with quivering young flesh, supple muscles coated in come, sweat, tears, chocolate sauce and my own saliva (as I drooled all over them and when in for some quick tastes).  I was barely able to control myself watching the writhing nude straight bodies entwined.  But when they were done, I ate every last one of them, and then took out from a bag the opposing team, offering them the same deal.  The stupid little turds didn\u2019t even realize the bowl they were dropped into was already coated in tiny footprints of come and chocolate sauce.<br>\r\nSo naturally, I\u2019m hungry enough to go straight to dessert.  Both boys, shivering uncontrollably, are taken out of the freezer and deposited in front of my place setting.  They look around for their fellow prisoners and begin bawling in fear, seeing that they are the last two outside of my stomach.  Dillon pleads for himself and his younger brother, selflessly offering himself if I\u2019d let Jensen go.  My response is wordless, but I think the point gets across.  Jensen\u2019s cold fudge-coated body is removed from the ice cream, and put, feet first between my two lips.  Both boys begin screaming, Jensen in terror and Dillon is anger.  \u201cHe\u2019s too young!  He has a full life to live you crazy sadistic jackass!\u201d  <br>\r\nPicking up the Maraschino cherry from the (formerly) hot fudge and whipped cream cream, I shove it into the older boy\u2019s mouth, silencing his livid language.  His eyes narrow in a deep hatred that I\u2019m surprised doesn\u2019t melt the ice cream he is stuck in.  Meanwhile my tongue dances around the thick chocolate, warming it up, and then sucking the gooey liquid from between Jensen\u2019s toes.  His terrified blubbering dies down a bit as I suckle and lick all over his smooth skin.  Every few minutes I suck him between my lips a tiny bit more, and his unintelligible sobs and screams begin anew.  He looks like a cigarette at first, rigid in his candy coating, only his head visibly out of the delicious fudge.  Although, his angelic blond hair still has streaks of caramel from his forced feeding earlier.  But soon, as the chocolate melts and more and more of his body is in my mouth, being assaulted by my brutal tongue, he hangs limply from his midsection like a piece of pasta being slurped into the mouth of a toddler.  <br>\r\nWhile Jensen watches his little brother slowly disappearing between my lips, his eyes soften from unadulterated hatred, to sadness.  The last he sees is Dillon\u2019s screaming face from between my pursed lips, his whole body now free of chocolate, as my tongue has explored ALL of his body, (every nook and cranny), before he is slurped inside audibly.  I suck and taste for a bit more, but most of the flavor has already been swallowed down with the fudge and saliva.  I make sure to tilt my head up so that my last little morsel can watch the bulge that was his utterly delicious brother slide down my throat and disappear between my heaving pecs and beautiful abs.<br>\r\nSmacking my lips, I raise a spoon and smile down at the final frightened youth.  Dillon seems convinced that he'll be first into my mouth, so it comes as something of a surprise when I start by taking a scoop out of the ice cream surrounding him, then a second spoonful out of the ice cream he's sitting on. I carry on eating around him, and all the time he doesn't move from his sitting position. As the sundae disappears around him, he sinks lower and lower into the bowl.<br>\r\n\"Are you ...\" he starts, but seems too nervous to finish.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat me soon? I ...I can't take much more of this.\" Chuckling to myself, I just continue to eat the ice cream, until finally all that's left is a few traces of melted vanilla and fudge, too small to be properly scooped up. All that really remains is Dillon, who is positively dripping with everything I\u2019ve added to the sundae itself.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to be so very, very sweet, Dillon,\u201d I say menacingly, \u201cthough undoubtedly not as sweet as Jensen was.  I wish you could have tasted him, but his feeling in my tummy as he struggles for life is just as delicious.\u201d<br>\r\nI pick the bowl up with both hands and raise it up to my mouth. Fixing Dillon with a hungry stare, I lick my lips one final time, the sight of which causes him to panic and attempt to escape. He's too covered in melted ice cream and sauce to get anywhere. He just slips and slides and stays pretty much in the centre of the bowl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still scrambling uselessly, Dillon begins sliding towards my gaping maw. He tries desperately to grab on to something, but he's too slippery himself to get a good grip on anything. He quickly slides off the rim of the bowl and straight into my mouth.  Quickly sealing my lips behind him, I tilt my head forward to prevent him from sliding straight down my throat. I start to caress his body with my tongue, his meaty taste mingling ever so wonderfully with the richness of the ice cream he's coated in. He is delicious! Unfortunately, it's not long before my tongue completely clears him of his cream coating, and I\u2019m left with just Dillon. Not that this takes anything away from his magnificent flavour, but I decide that it's time to finish this succulent meal. With one great gulp, Dillon slides head first down my throat to await digestion in my stomach surrounded by the remnants of the others. I wipe the remnants of ice cream and sauce from your mouth, lick my lips for some final traces, and begin cleaning up the kitchen.<br>\r\nThe sight of the dishes, combined with the knowledge that most of the boys are already done suffering, fills me with a familiar emptiness that contrasts sharply with the full feeling of my stomach.  Fortunately, unlike my food, I go through all five stages of grief very quickly.  <br>\r\nThe denial lasts a fraction of a second, as I see the empty cages, ready to be filled once I go on another hunt for... let\u2019s call them groceries... tomorrow.  <br>\r\nI punch at my stomach angrily, when I feel the final death throes of the brothers.  Why couldn\u2019t they just enjoy the experience that so many others would gladly accept?!  They get to be a part of my godlike body and should be pleasuring themselves inside!  But the real anger is at myself.  Why couldn\u2019t I control myself?  I could have lasted a little bit longer before gobbling them up!  I missed out on so many wonderful tortures for the delectable morsels.  <br>\r\nBut then I bargain with myself, if I can really torture a few of the young men I procure tomorrow, then the rest I can eat while I\u2019m doing the tormenting! <br>\r\nUgh, but I have to go out tomorrow, find the tastiest snacks, get them alone or in small groups, and shrink them down.  The tedium is awfully depressing.  <br>\r\nNo.  I need to accept the fact that the hunt is part of the fun!  There\u2019s no point in grieving the loss of my little treats when there are so many more to find tomorrow.  Afterall, I have to refill all of those cages! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In with te black berries, raspberries, etc. James is far more comfortable, a blueberry sits around his waist like a hula hoop, covering his cock and ass.  Four more blueberries have been attached to his elbows and knees like delicious skating pads.

One of his designer boots must have not made it through the process. You poke your probe into the sole of his white sock covered foot and he lets off a protest. \"Hey! Watch what you're doing! Put me back to normal!\" You ponder whether to respond and decide it might be fun. \"Raj my meaty little hunk, I am afraid the process only goes the one way.\" His brown dewy eyes trail downward as you reach in and with a gentle pluck untie his remaining boot. \"I shall need to get some measurements.\" With tweezers you pluck his wallet from his jeans pocket and place both the wallet and his boot on a metal dissecting tray. You set the still wriggling little man down in a heavy glass container with high walls. You give him a smile as he runs to the side and begins to pound shouting for help and for you to let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a special scope you determine that his hot little feet were once size 12.

You write these down in a log book which will need to be certified before you are allowed to obtain higher celebrities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into the glass cell and pluck Raj back up. Humming as you work you pluck off his two white socks and watch his plump little toes curl in response. With hooked pins you secure the young man's wrists to the black waxed surface of the pan. With a gentle tug you pull each ankle outward until the beefcake is spread evenly once again securing each extremity with a hooked pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha what are you doing?\" Raj's bravado has finally turned into the fear it should have been originally. You ignore his question and gently set the pins of calipers on the top of his head and the center bottom of each foot writing  your measurements down carefully as you go.

He tenses up and issues a few idol threats throughout the process. With a gentle tug you free his jeans from his body.  He now lays spread still with a black t-shirt and a hint of abs still sitting above a pair of tight boxer briefs. You finish your work snipping away the t-shirt and with two precise cuts pluck away the underwear. While kept as a memento by many a client, you will need to have the fabric analyzed against the same type of material at its original size to check for any flaws in the process and maybe determine what happened to the missing boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have your little YouTuber stripped you can continue to measure him. You move up and down his muscular form with the forceps making precise measurements and noting them in your journal. He tenses repeatedly as you make your way down the sides of his lats and take circumference readings on each little bicep.  You use your thumb and forefinger to pry apart his little fingers and toes as you measure each one in detail. Nothing goes unmeasured. When you are finished you let out a quiet sigh and set your calipers down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you take out a small plastic box. You wink at your little captive as you adhere an electrode to his forehead and another to the sole of his left foot. You decide to see if the Raj's ego is still as big as his body used to be. \"Hey Raj, I bet you have a pretty stellar body mass index.\" you pause to see if he is willing to go for the bait. \"7.3!\" Raj shouts up to you willingly. You check the instrument and whistle. \"According to my measurements you are now a plump 17% fat\" you end your terse statement with a lick of the lips and a wink. \"It is a pitty you aren't a real star, I would have received quite a bonus for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Three tasty little toys look up into the blinding light of your kitchen trying to make sense of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What is this shit?\" Nick shields his eyes trying to make out anything that might give them a clue. Joe and Vic spot their brother from different sides of the box and move his way. In the darkness of transport they must have become disorientated. \"Yo man I don't know but this is fucked up!\" Joe looked agitated as he surveyed his door and windowless environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I could shed some light on your situation boys.\" Your booming drew the attention of all three young men, their eyes finally adjusted to the light they spy your giant face looming over them in their cardboard prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, who is he?\" Nick's cocky confidence seems, at least for the moment, to have left as he inspects your looming face with wide eyes. Vince starts to express similar worry and then his face lights up. \"Nah bro! This is just some sort of prank. I bet someone is taping the vine right now!\" This seems to momentarily bring relief to Joe and Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid you are mistaken my beefy little man.\" you pause to let them soak in the truth. \"I have shrunken the three of you and will now have the pleasure of playing with, and then eating you one by scrumptious one....., now which of you morsels shall I have fun with first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant the three little men stand frozen in fear, but then they start to run. You watch in delight as the three little brothers work together to try and get over the wall of their cardboard room. Nick manages to get first dibs on the top of the wall, your first toy just choose himself! Joe, who is just beneath Nick in the human chain clutches desperately at his brother only to fall backwards on Vince with Nick's newly dislodged blue Vans in each hand. The two remaining brothers watch on helplessly as Vince's twin hottie brother Nick flies upward past the edge of the box into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspect your first toy. He is kicking fiercely between your fingers, dangling by the neck of his tight blue half button t-shirt. His legs are covered in a tight pair of beige jeans and his proportionately large feet are covered in no show blue socks. \"Yo man what is this shit! Let me go you fucker let me go!!\" Nick's cocky little protests only makes him more appetizing and you begin to salivate a little. Rather than address your toy's complaints you begin your play. You pluck off his tiny socks playfully sniffing each one and dropping them back into the box as a sign of things to come for his imprisoned bros and as a memento of this delightful experience. He has no clue how the soles of his kicking feet are shortening his time outside your mouth and stomach. Besides, you get double the tasty fun with Vin later. As you ponder what to do next you feel his shirt begin to rip. \"Whoa shit ahhhh!\" Nick falls for a moment only to land in the palm of your left hand. The speed of the moment and Nick's hot surfing skills results in the little man righting himself instantly. His abs are beautiful! His sculpted arms and upper torso is a delight to the eyes. You enjoy the sensation of his sand buffed feet rocking back and forth against the palm of your hand. He ponders a jump for his life, but better judgement stops him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desire to get him down the hatch is overwhelming! You brush him to his tight little but with a flick of your finger and begin to tug on the cuff of his pant leg. \"Stop it you fuck stoppp!!!\" Nick's jersey accent squeaks slightly in his diminished state. You hear a faint pop sound as his jeans button gives way. You chuckle as he tries in vain to keep his jeans from slipping off of his muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe and Vince scatter as yet another article of their brother's former wrappings land unceremoniously before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou invert your toy for the big finish by grasping his right ankle. He tries in vain to push with his left for freedom and then finds himself flailing helplessly as you raise him above your head like a bunch of grapes being gobbled up by ancient Roman emperor. \"Ah shit... man don't do this... I'll do anything, anything man just don't do this!!\" Nick continues to protest his words sound delightfully pathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think Nick, all that time in the gym pumping yourself up, all that time showing yourself off to the world through the Internet. Every narcissistic moment you and your brothers spent, was for my pallet and stomach. Later dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick continues to shake his head holding out his meaty hands as you release his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick plummets quickly, his hands offer no guard against your massive open mouth. As he begins to plunge towards the back of your throat he finds himself caught once again by the ankles, only this time by your lips! He whimpers in terror as he feels the sharp edge of your incisors at his mid section.gently tickling his perfect little abs and buttocks. His body is salty and musky with for some reason slightly sweet. He struggles helplessly as he finds his body tossed aimlessly through your oral cavity his every surface tickled thoroughly with your taste buds each contact registering pure joy! You tilt your head down into the box. Vince and Joe who are now cowering in one corner of the box jump to their feet and stare upward as they see their brother staring back at them framed between your teeth. Nick starts to say something just as you decide to end the first play session. His wide eyes disappear between your lips and a lump passes down your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack your lips and exclaim! \"That was amazing! Who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remaining brothers eye each other in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a split second's decision, but you decided as you reached into the box to save Nick's twin for the finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught the buff second course by the cuff of his left pant leg and are marveling at his struggles as he hangs upside down in front of your looming face. \"Your brother was so satisfying! Even now he continues to massage the inside of my stomach, I had better play with you a while, wouldn't want any family reunions in my stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the bite sized little stud cursing wildly as you begin to play. </span></div></div>",

The giant room appears to be some sort of kitchen. He tests the world beyond the black stage with the toe of his right Van sneaker. He then hops down to the massive marble surface below. \"Yo!

The granite surface is smooth and cold against his light blue Van sneakers. Feeling vulnerable Chis puts his hood over his ball cap covered head and tightens the strings. It is daytime and the kitchen is filled with light allowing him to see many details. He looks behind him trying to figure out how he got to where he is. The black stage appears to be a computer screen with a mark that says \"iWonkavision\" in a label below. He realizes he has activated part of the screen by stepping on a keyboard that is projected in front of the screen and steps back. He realizes he is on a counter top island and across from him he sees a stove and a magnet holding sharp looking knives. He instinctively reaches for his phone.. <i>dude its gone</i> the little man thinks to himself. He looks down at his feet thinking of what to do next, when his eyes return to the surroundings he is startled to see a person standing where there certainly wasn't one before! The giant smiles in a way that makes Chris uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my little man! Welcome to my kitchen!\" the giant's enthusiastic voice booms loudly over Chris knocking him back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yo bro! What is this? I was like about to do a Vine post when like suddenly I was here and all. What is this man?!\" Chris's voice squeaks a bit from your perspective. You give a chuckle and respond to your newest toy. \"Well, perhaps it would be easier if I just showed you!\" Without giving your tiny captive time to respond you quickly sweep him off his little feet holding him by the back of his sweatshirt. \"Let me go! Let me go!\" Chris's tiny protests are of no consequence. You briskly escort you now kicking little toy over to a case on the other side of the kitchen. Gently you set the little man down on his sneakers and let him explore a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looks down past his sneakers into the strange glass case. Below him there are tiny glass displays. There are trendy looking clothes mounted on boards in the displays and Chris squints to make out the labels. \"The Miuccio Brothers... what is this? Where are the Miuccio Brothers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Chris, the Miuccio Brothers also came though my special device just like you. We played a bit and...  then I devoured them one by one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words hand in the air for a bit as the little man processes what he has learned. \"Dude! No way man! No fucking way!\" He looks around for an escape. There isn't one. He tries to run across the slick glass case only to find himself once again swept upward between pinched fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What is this?\" Finally his form comes into full resolution. From Cody's perspective the world around him has just came into full resolution.

He immediately jumps to his feet and blinks wildly. \"Holly shit! Dude! This is real!\" He begins to scurry a bit around his local environment trying to get bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm afraid it is.\" you respond to his revelation with dull interest. You reach to a nearby shelf and retrieve a marsh mellow. \"Perhaps this will put things into perspective my tasty little man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody jumps back as you set the marshmallow next to him.  \"Holly fuck!

Without effort you pluck  him up removing his remaining sneaker. You savor the scent and pull each of his big pink feet into your mouth. He continues to protest as you lower him like a bunch of grapes towards your mouth. \"Please! Don't do this! Oh God don......\" his cries are muffled as he plunges head first between your lips. Your tongue explores every delicious surface as you proceed to taste his upper torso. You feel the sensation of his jeans against your lips. With a flip and a pop his belt and buttons are free. He tenses up inside your mouth sensing your actions outside. His toes clench in vain has you tug gently, slowly at the cuffs of his jean legs pulling him ever deeper inside. Much more slowly than with Darin you savor his form in your mouth.

His eyes trail from the lump that was Chord... back to your face.</span></div></div>",

He struggles of course and you hear a pleasing little sound as both of his sneakers dislodge from his long tender feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to struggle between your fingers as you whistle plucking his sneakers up and placing them aside. \"Mementos you see\" you explain to him as if he would understand. \"I like to remember all of the little men I have played with and gobbled up.\"</span></div></div>",

But the spoon only makes it down two shelves forcing the intrepid little guy to find yet another means of escape. Luckily, there is a knot hole on that shelf which appears to drop off onto a shelf that is close enough to the previous ones not to cause harm... however in this instance it is a balance trap that tilts suddenly rolling its unsuspecting user down a little slide into a jar filled with grape jam! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!

His toes, still clad in a no-show sock curl in protest to their involuntary liberation. \"Uh guy, I don't know what this is about, but I want to go back now... please.\" You ignore his please as the pungent odder  of his sneaker wafts through your nostrils.

You remove the socks placing them inside the shoes for a nice memento. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god oh god dude please stop!\" Austin continues to protest as you grasp him by his ankles to enjoy his upper body.

I do NOT want to experience that again! Put me back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you ignore his pleas. His eyes go wide as he quickly finds himself plunged back inside your mouth. His struggles increase as he senses you popping off his belt buckle. With a gentle tug the jeans are gone, and then his pants below. Two lean legs struggle in vain as you pull him in further sucking and savoring him thoroughly.  You bring him inside playing with him tortuously with the tip of your tongue. With a tuck and a push you flip him around like an old cigarette trick allowing his handsome little head one last chance to see the outside world. \"Dude, guy... please stop! I will pay you anything you want any....... umpf!\" his words are cut short as he finds himself plunged in for the final act. As the meaty little actor finds himself pulled into the warm humid acidic darkness of your stomach you look down at the little pile of clothes that once house his hot little self. Delicious!</span></div></div>",

You look down at the empty little clothes and wish there were another Austin to satiate your taste buds. Then it hits you! You spin back to the control panel locking onto your target. Once again a little man's form appears before your eyes. Austin Butler much like his similar previous toy searches the environs of your lab confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is wearing a pair of skater sneakers, skinny jeans and a shirt with a sports jacket. His longer hair is swept back. He does not seem to notice you as he hops down from the platform of the edible doll maker. He makes his way across the lab bench surface until he happens across Austin North's emptied sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mysterious no?\" Your booming voice from above finally catches the little man's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who... who are you? What is all of this? Wha... whoa!!!\" Austin's questions are cut short as he finds himself swept off his little feet and carried upward towards your face. Austin manages to use his surfing skills to keep balance in the palm of your hand and shields his face from the proximity of your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a hungry giant Austin, those shoes you are holding belonged to another tasty little man named Austin.\" the words hang in the air as your little captive's wide gaze passes between your massive looming face and the empty sneakers in his hands. \"Normally we would have a little play time, but my stomach is really grumbling. Let's begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin, still in shock begins to shake his little head in protest as the shadow of your left and passes over him plucking him up by his jacket. He tries to escape by sliding out of the jacket only to find himself once again in the palm of your hand. He tries to lift his feet to jump only to find his right foot lodged firmly between your fingers. He still manages to free himself falling towards the lab bench wearing one sneaker and one dark colored sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth one little fella!\" you catch the little morsel in mid flight and lift him up by his now liberated right ankle slipping his sock free with a tug landing him once more in the palm of your hand. He considers flight again, but the height is now too great. He sits cowering in the palm of your hand looking rather pathetic with one bare foot shaking nervously over the edge of your cupped hand. </span></div></div>",

When comes to a stop he faces away from me, giving me a look at his fine meaty ass, bubblicious and waiting for a me to taste it.  Before he can turn back around or even get a bearing on where he is the pink and spongey muscle is snaking up from between his succulent feet. It rises up a moment later forcing the tasty young lad into the air as he is forced to bend forward, supported only by his pelvis.  My tongue cradles him like a newborn, the tip caressing his nipples as he faces the ground.  His ass digs into the base of my tongue right outside my mouth and I can taste meaty sweaty crack and taint, feeling the pleasure of his growing erection despite his best efforts to the contrary.  His cock head swells into my tastebuds and leaves him writhing in inexplicable pleasure.  He is fully supported by my tongue, forced to ride it as though the tip was a wet head of some alien steed, slurping at the owners pecs.  His legs strattle it and he is forced at a strange angle, facing slightly down and forward.  Suddenly he feels my tongue sliding back into my mouth.  It leaves his tantalizing nipples giving him a breath of relief as he thinks the retraction means the game is over.  Instead it slowly traces his abdominals, pushing against his flesh firmly so that it forces his erect, smooth, hard cock back down behind him like a drag queen trying to tuck.  It is uncomfortable at first but he quickly grows used to it, the pleasures of the sensation overriding the strange position.  My breath warms his flexing back, the tip of my nose pushing into his shoulder blades slightly.  Then I stop withdrawing my tongue.  His long hard dick is pressing roughly into my fleshy tongue, which offers only a tiny bit of wet give.  If he were to come now he would be coming into his own asshole, yet I\u2019d still get the exquisite creamy taste.  I could feel the blood coursing all the way up his shaft, rushing against my tongue with such force it tingles in my mouth.  The taste is beyond description and I relish his sudden motion.  His pleasure is too great and he finds himself unable to stop gyrating into my moist tongue.  No matter how terrified he is the writhing pulsating rhythmic jumping becomes more and more intense and he wraps his formerly powerful arms around my tongue as much as he can, trying to support himself while he rides my salivating tongue for all he is worth, grinding into me with each thrust.  I slurp and suckle until I feel his knees quake and his hips buckle.  That\u2019s my cue to roll my tongue back into my mouth quickly.  Again I don\u2019t pull it all the way in as his body trembles, longing to release his hot milky come.  His dick is still pushed back into his ass but now only the tip of my tongue is against his shaft.  Slowly I lick up the long hairless cock, stopping at the head which in jab with the edge a bit before repeating the motion, like his meaty dick is just a tiny salt lick.  Again and again. I push his dick between his own ass cheeks with only my tongue, feeling his whole body rigid with pleasure.  In a cry of triumph from him and of delicious \u201cmmming\u201d from me, he comes more than anyone his size could ever be expected to.  Streams of salty white goo shoot out in five different loads that convulse his entire sweaty body, pooling at his own ass.  While he lies there, panting and exhausted and humiliated, face down, I finally release his still engirged cock which rests between his powerful thighs.  I lick all I can from his puckered asshole, enjoying the musty taste of his ass cheeks, the warm sourish taste deep within his rectum as my tongue plunges in like an explorer, and when I\u2019m done sucking I slurp lazily at  the source for all that remains.  It leaks lazily out onto the ground between his legs, his succulent balls on either side forced behind the front of his thighs like tight little meatballs.  Smacking my lips I give the entire back of his body a few long, slow licks, coating him in saliva and some of his own come and sweat. He continuesnpanting while I taste his whole back in the low stroking laps, as though I was massaging him after a good hard fucking.  In reality I\u2019m giving him what I could only call a giant kiss while trying to get his bodies taste to mingle with the taste of his balls cock ass and come, lingering on my tongue.</span></div></div>",

Let me go man fuck this shit!\" His captor dismissed his protests as he dawned a pair of magnifying goggles. \"Let's see my beefy little man... what are your new measurements?\" Clay's eyes trailed the giant man's hands as he found a pair of calipers on the bench below. \"Wow you were 6 foot 1 before miniturization... now you are 3.121 inches....\" Clay's eyes close tightly and feet ball up at the sensation of the cold metal tip on his head and soles of his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe straps disappear forcing Clay to fall into the open palm of the giant. Before he has time to struggle much he finds himself dropped onto a cold metal platform. \"200 pounds of yummy beefcake is now... a 1.5 ounce meatball!\" The giant seems to be enjoying the exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He does not feel the friction of sliding, but the passing beams of light give the sense that he is sliding down some sort of long tube. He tries to move but finds himself paralyzed only able to glance down towards his toes and what appears to be a fast approaching end to the strange tunnel. With a bright flash of light Clay's world changes again. This time he is laying on a cold surface bathed in a bright light from above. \"Hey man like what the hell just happened!\" his cocky voice is absorbed by the strange surroundings. He finds he is able to move and jumps to his feet. As he scans around for answers a figure moves out from the shadows. A giant face looms from above. \"Ah! Mr. Honeycutt! Welcome to Edible Toys Incorporated! Aren't you a nice purchase for some lucky buyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually cocky and confident young man tries to absorb what he is hearing. \"Hey!

Still sleeping from the journey is an adorable little 5 inch hunk; Corbin Bleu.  He's wearing dark jeans, a graphic tee, two funky Nike's, and a ring on the middle finger of his right hand.

I believe that's what she had said.  Although she kept switching back and forth between fire, siffocation, snakes, etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now his brain is going a mile a second.

With one finger you drop off one of his shoes and marveel at the size of his plump feet, hidden beneath a gray sock.  Removing that too, drool starts accumulating at the sides of your lips and you move the boy lollipop back to your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cries as he sees the pink snake of yout tongue come slowly back out of the cave and approach his revealed foot.  Starting with the soles, you lap up the strong, salty flavor, and proceed to tickle each plump toe indivdual and then all at once with your tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another idea hits you.  Do you want to continue licking the tasty captive?  But how many licks does it really take to get to the center?  Maybe you should stuff him full of chocolate and suck on him like a tootsie pop.

The pasta and the sauce is soon on the boil, but it's the boys you want to keep an eye on. The meat that's packed around them will be nicely brown when they're ready to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what to do in the meantime. Do you fish another shrunken boy out, purely for company?

You want to save Daniel Radcliffe for later, so instead you scan your box for a selection of hot and delicious actors from the film series. The box is so full of terrified shrunken celebs that at first it's hard to spot them, but finally you pull three of them out. Rupert, Devon and Robert. You hold Robert in one hand, Rupert and Devon in the other and carry them over to the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Put us down! We're getting squashed together!\" shouts Rupert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move your shoulder out of my face!\" says Devon, his voice a little muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, the pair of you!\" barks Robert. Their argument amuses you to no end, but now it's down to business. You're making a proper meal out of the three of them, so you'll need some potato product of some kind as well as some veg. Torturing and devouring young men is all well and good, but a balanced diet is important. You place the squabbling threesome inside an open tupperware bowl to keep them from escaping, while you see to the rest of your meal. Once the fries are in the oven and the veg on a slow boil, you turn back to your squabbling meat. A quick tap on the side of the bowl reminds them that you're here and they instantly stop arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you three have one last chance for salvation, but are you sure you want to hear about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding us?\" exclaims Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want to end up like Tom. Tell us!\" demands Rupert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a while before I need to start cooking you. I'll be frying you so it won't take as long as the fries or the veg. However, I won't cook and eat you if you three provide me with some pre-dinner entertainment.\" This is an out and out lie, of course, you have every intention of eating them whether they agree to this or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asks Robert slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three of you get naked ...and then get a threesome going.

He stands behind Robert and brings his body right up to Robert's long, slender back. Robert is taller than him, so Devon rests his head between Robert's shoulder blades. He than wraps both arms around the two of them, bringing his hands to rest on Rupert's bottom. He applies gentle pressure, bringing all three of them closer.

As you chew, his enhanced flavour bursts out. You eat a few fries, a few veg, then move on to Rupert. He's not quite as 'bite sized' as Devon was, so you have to carefully cut him up. He proves to be even tastier than Rupert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eat the rest of your meal, saving Robert for last. You decide to pick him up rather than use your knife and fork. You stick him half way into your mouth feet first and bite. His legs are good, but they're nothing compared to his upper body, which soon ends up in your mouth as well. Seeing as he was the last one in the pan, he's not quite as crispy as the others, but he's still just as delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning away your plate, you suddenly find yourself feeling rather tired. You pick up the box of boys and carry it into the living room. You peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dear little delicacies, I'm going to have myself a little nap.

Those of you who know what's good for you can start undressing now. I don't want to have to wait too long to prepare my post-nap snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the terrified whispers of your future meals, you set the box down at the foot of the sofa and sit down.

There's two possibilities here, either Justin really is a willing meal (you've heard of people who go in for it, after all) or he is in fact a distraction.

If this is the case, then he probably drew the short straw and got sent up to offer himself to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, a quick check of the box should tell you what's going on here.

You suspend him over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes! Do it now!\" he insists. \"Eat me!\" You smile, marvelling at this boy. You never thought you'd find someone who was not only willing to be eaten, but excited at the very prospect. You hear him breath in one final time as he sees your mouth open beneath him. He is lowered into your mouth, landing gently on your tongue. You close your mouth and then slowly sit up, so that swallowing him will be much easier. For the moment, however, you're savouring his flavour. The sweat he managed to build up from masturbating so vigorously makes him taste even better. He's not squirming, like most boys do, but rather he's moving in time with your tongue, letting you taste every little inch of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the time comes to swallow him. You tip your head back a little, hoping to let him know what's about to happen. He seems to get the message because he stops moving, making it all the more easy to send him hurtling down into your stomach. You can only imagine the joy he's feeling now that he's in there, but you have no doubt that he enjoyed being eaten as much as you enjoyed eating him. Soon enough he'll get his final wish. He'll be digested and become a part of you forever. You rub your belly, hoping that he can feel it and may even be rubbing back as he waits for the juices to take effect.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm thinking you'd do well in a white wine sauce, with a few choice herbs sprinkled in. It won't do much to tenderise you ...not that you need it.\" You take a minute to stroke his chest and belly.

The sauce is just deep enough for Tom and the others to lie in without drowning, as long as they remain on their backs, that is. You want them alive when they go on that barbeque. You lay Tom in the dish. He lies straight, the sauce covering most of him. His face, toes and glimpses of his chest and belly are just above the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, thank you.

Buying the box was a bit more expensive than a box of average Joes, but I'm sure you'll be worth every penny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do you know that?\" asks Robert, finally deigning to speak to you. \"How do you know we'll taste so good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a well known fact that young male celebrities taste excellent, Robert. I'll prove it.\" You reach in and run your index finger up and down Robert's naked body. He remains perfectly still (not that he has a great deal of choice). You then pop your finger into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I can taste the sauce ...but your own personal flavour is coming through very strong.\" Robert merely falls silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to taste me, if you like,\" says Tom helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with you, Tom? Do you want to be eaten?\" asks Matthew incredulously. Tom turns his head as best as he can so that he can just about see the others. Once again he's trying to convey his plan to them. Not that it will do them any good, because you don't plan on leaving them alone for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? We've been told we're tasty often enough by our fans. All we have here is a fan who wants to take that to the next level. That's the way I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barking mad,\" Dan mutters. You check your watch to see how long they've been marinating.</span></div></div>",

No, sorry. I've come too far in the preparation process now not to eat you. Any further pleas or arguments really would be a waste of time.\" There's silence for a few minutes. You pass the time by gazing at their naked bodies. Finally Tom pipes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ready yet? I expect we're as tasty as we'll ever be now, and I'm sure you must be looking forward to having us for dinner. I know I'm looking forward to being your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother transparent attempt to influence the culinary process.

Pretty soon he's up to his knees in them. \"Right, you get started on those. They should fatten you up very nicely and more importantly, quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" sighs Tom. \"No sense in waiting.\" Knowing that he'll be eaten anyway if he refuses, Tom starts to chow down on the chocolate chips, taking one in each hand and chomping away.

Now you finally get to eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter removing the rest of his clothes, you take a moment to taste him, licking him lightly around the face and belly. You lap up some of the chocolate that he managed to get on his face, but you can also sense a deeper chocolate sensation waiting within him. Taking hold of his legs, you raise him up above your head. He stares down at your mouth, his plump tummy swaying and jiggling slightly as you dangle him. You slowly lower him in, taking him in with your tongue so as to avoid him going straight down your throat. You want to taste him properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prediction turns out to be wonderfully true, his belly tingles and tantalises your tongue. His natural meaty flavour coupled with all the chocolate he ate makes for a remarkable combination. You chew him ever so lightly, just so you can release a little more of that chocolately goodness. When you finally do swallow him, you take particular pleasure in feeling his plump gut slide down your throat. It's with a satisfying 'plop' that he lands in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, so tasty,\" you mutter to yourself. You wonder what to do next. Another snack, perhaps?

He'll taste just as good depressed as he would happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish arranging the fruit around Lucas.

Your original point stands though, there are two of them. No matter how skinny they are, and no matter whether you decide to eat them both together or one at a time, they're going to be very filling. Besides, since when was plumpness indicative of great flavour?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" says Oliver with great eagerness. He's obviously trying to pick up where Tom left off, but his fate will ultimately be the same. \"See how skinny we both are? Sure there's two of us, but just think of how much more filling we'd be for you if we were fattened up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ...\" says James with less enthusiasm. He slowly rubs his own tummy. \"Yum, yum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen, you've put forward a very good case for making you fatter, but I've decided to eat you as you are. The more interesting question as far as I'm concerned, is whether to eat you both together or one at a time.\" The look on Jame's face goes from anxious to gut-droppingly terrified. Oliver, on the other hand, looks thoughtful. He knows, deep down, that if you choose to eat them one at a time, then there's a 50% chance of him not going first. Therefore he'd be able to attempt an escape. However, that would mean he'd be leaving his brother to be devoured by you, and the guilt of that is already gnawing at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnily enough, all you can think about is how to start gnawing at them ...literally.</span></div></div>",

He can't get down, but he will have a bird's eye view of what will soon be happening to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asks James, still shirtlessly trapped in your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I was about to ask,\" says Oliver, peering over the edge of the shelf for just a moment. It's a long way down to the counter when you're as small as he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put you up on the shelf, Oliver, so that you can have the best view possible,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best view of what? The kitchen?\" You let out a little snigger, then casually start removing James' trousers and boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the best view of this.\" You take hold of James' legs and tilt your head back. You can see Oliver standing on the shelf, paralysed with fear and helplessness. There's nothing he can do to save his brother, who is naturally begging for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! D-don't do it! I'll do anything ...have m-mercy!\" A wide grin spreads across your face. You open your mouth and poke out your tongue. You bring James a little closer, so that he eventually finds himself with his face, shoulders and arms resting on the middle of your wet tongue. You give said tongue a little flicker, which causes him to jiggle in your grip. He tastes delicious. You raise him up again so that you can speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so very tasty. I just hope that you have a similar, if not better taste, Oliver. It's your turn next.\" You now turn your attention to the upside down James. \"Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower him slowly into your open jaws, which does mean you have to put up with his screams for longer, but it also means that Oliver is getting a very clear and agonising idea of what's in store for him. Finally only James' legs remain, and after you gently let go of those, his whole body flops straight onto your tongue. Your mouth closes and plunges him into darkness. Speaking of a plunge, that's exactly what happens next. His unusual landing on your tongue, coupled with his flailing means that he slides almost instanteously down your throat, barely savoured and not even remotely chewed. Still, it's very satisfying to feel him slide down alive. You can even almost feel him inside your stomach, alive and kicking. You give your belly a rub to soothe both him and yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious ...absolutely delicious. Now, let's see how you match up to your brother, Oliver ...\"</span></div></div>",

His long, slender legs are sucked in like tendrils of spaghetti. Now that he's fully in, you push him upwards with your tongue and pin him against the roof of your mouth.

You caress his body, and he simply stands there and allows you to do so. He even gives you a little guidance, taking your hands in his and directing them slowly towards his groin. His penis stands erect and seems to tremble at your touch. You wrap your fingers around it and move up and down, slowly at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" asks Oliver. Well, you do have two hands after all. You give Oliver the same treatment as James, and it's not long before they're moaning and gasping together. Faster and faster you go, happy to give them this one last favour before you cook them. Within minutes they have both climaxed. The excitement has left them out of breath and drenched in sweat. You ask them if they'd like to lie down for a second, but they both shake their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get straight into the pot. We're ready now!\" gasps James. Sure enough, a stepladder has suddenly appeared out of nowhere. You help them both up it one at a time. The two naked twins are now both inside the large pot, up to their chests in water. They relax as though they're merely taking a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're both inside, it's time to light the fire,\" instructs Oliver. \"We won't cook all that well in cold water.\" After removing the stepladder, you suddenly find that you have a box of matches in your hand. This dream is providing you with your every need! You go about the task of lighting the logs underneath the pot in several places until the fire spreads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fire looks like it could take a while,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the better for you. We'll taste so much better if we're slow cooked,\" explains Oliver. You stand up after lighting the fire, and find that the pot is just the right height for you to be able to watch these delicious boys cook, as well talk to them properly. They look over at you with their identical smiles, clearly loving the whole experience.</span></div></div>",

They're too far back to defend you from William, but you soon realise that you're holding your own sword and shield. You must be getting ready to fight him in single combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We settle this here,\" says William, obviously in character. \"If I defeat you, you let your prisoners go free.\" By this you assume he means the boys trapped up on your shelf.

You sink down onto one knee and see William about to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respite!\" you exclaim. William looks tired as well, and so after some consideration, he lowers his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\" Why you insisted on three minutes rather than five is lost on you. It just felt like the right thing to say. William returns to his side of the battlefield, where his 'brother' is waiting to tend his wounds. You return to your side with the help of your generals. Your knee is bandaged, and the time to return to the fight soon comes. William is barely in the middle of the arena before you launch your attack. It seems you've been holding back up until now, and even you are surprised by your skill. Locking your sword with his, you manage to dislodge it from his grip. Now he only has his shield to defend himself with. Your attacks are powerful and focused, continually hitting his shield until he can hold it no longer. It falls from his hands and he stands before you, defenceless. You bring your sword point back to his chest once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have lost, your majesty.\" Far from looking defeated, William smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have won me.

This is certainly the kind of spread you'd expect to see set out for a king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting him to fill up too much on meat, you pick up a plate of small cakes and hold them directly in front of him.

Nobody else throughout the whole restaurant seems to be taking the slightest notice of what's going on. They must all be used to seeing the waiters suddenly strip off and allow themselves to be eaten. You suddenly notice a woman at the table across from you lowering a naked Cole Sprouse into her mouth. Naked, whole and alive, in fact. You remember seeing him serving up his brother earlier, and now it seems that under the terms of the 'Waiter Deal', it's his turn to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a polite cough coming from your left, and you turn to see that Jamie is now fully naked. He's standing almost to attention, emphasising his chest and broad shoulders. He's slim, though very well built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care to taste me before you consume me?\" asks Jamie, as casually as if he were asking if you'd like to sample the wine before ordering. You take a look around at all the other diners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I do that? I mean, just start licking you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It is your right as the customer to decide if I merit full consumption. You may, as you put it, 'lick me' to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then ...I'd certainly like a taste. Come here, please.\" Jamie obediently takes a step closer. In your current sitting position, you find your face right by his flat, toned tummy. After taking another nervous glance around the room, you lean in and begin tentatively licking him around the belly button. If you were to look up, you'd see the ill disguised look of contentment on his face. You don't look up, however, as you're too busy burying your head in Jamie's delicious flesh. You widen your licking to other areas of his belly, but soon decide that enough is enough or you'll never get round to eating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste excellent. I'm ready to eat you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. One last question, would you care to eat me lengthways or curled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Lengthways' involves starting with the head or feet and working along the body, much like how a snake devours it's prey. 'Curled' involves the meal embracing a curled position, tucking the legs up against the torso and holding them in place with the arms. It means opening one's mouth wider, but I have it on good authority that it is a good position for intensifying the flavour of the meal.\"</span></div></div>",

Just like when he stripped off, nobody else seems to think this strange. Standing now on your plate, he deftly crouches down, bending his legs and holding them right up against his chest with his arms. He looks at you one last time. \"It has been a pleasure serving you. Start whenever you wish, and I do hope you enjoy your meal.\" He then tucks his head down onto his knees, making himself as compact as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach round him and take hold of his waist with both hands. He's either surprisingly light, or you're surprisingly strong. Either way, it takes practically no effort to lift him up off the plate, still in his crouched position. You find that no matter how you handle him, no matter which way you turn him, he remains in that position. Now this is service!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom watching the other diners, it becomes obvious that you have the ability to open your mouth wider than normal while you're here. Unable to wait any longer, you do this with the greatest of haste. You decide to insert Jamie directly into your mouth rather than lower him in. You send him in head first, and you're greeted by the strong aroma of mint sauce. The waiters must rub various condiments onto themselves on Tuesdays on the off chance that they get eaten. You find that Jamie's choice of mint compliments his overall flavour perfectly. With Jamie's head and shoulders firmly lodged in your mouth, you begin slowly pushing him further in, while swallowing at a steady pace at the same time. Very soon he's halfway in, and while you may not be able to taste individual parts of him, the sensation of packing his entire body into your mouth at once is incredible! His flavour is so intense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before his folded legs are inside you, and the last thing anyone who might happen to be watching would see of Jamie is a glimpse of the bottom of his feet as they disappear into you. With one great gulp, Jamie lands in your stomach, which bulges outwards to accomodate him. If the feeling of having him in your mouth was good, it's nothing compared to having him in your stomach. His position won't have changed a bit. He's just a giant meatball as far as you're concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push back from the table a little to give your belly some breathing space. You pat it, greatly satisfied by your meal. You see another waiter approaching your table. It is, in fact, Justin Berfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy my co-worker?\" he asks in the impeccable manner that you've come to expect from the staff here. You grin as you give your belly another pat and an extra little rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much, thank you. He was delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care to see the dessert cart?\" asks Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh ...no, thank you. I couldn't eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Your bill,\" says Justin, producing a slip of paper from his pocket. You take it, and your eyes feel like they've bulged outwards as much as your stomach when you see the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you exclaim. \"You've got to be joking!\"</span></div></div>",

Staff are difficult to replace, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but it doesn't change the fact that I can't pay for Jamie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Please wait here.\" Giving a little bow, Justin turns on his heel and marches off towards a door marked 'Office'. He must be going to get the manager. You decide that perhaps it's time to get the hell out of here. This is easier said then done, however, as your belly is weighing you down. It's ironic, really. When you picked Jamie up and ate him, he weighed practically nothing. Now that he's sitting in your belly, slowly digesting, it feels like you're carrying a 180 pound baby in your abdomen. You can't even hoist yourself out of the chair, let alone make a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin soon returns, with the manager at his side. The manager being Elijah Wood, of course. Elijah takes a seat at your table, sitting directly in front of you. He puts his hands together on the table and stares at you for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you took advantage of our Tuesday Waiter Deal? In more ways than one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ...yes, I suppose you could put it like that ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a greatly valued costumer here, but I'm afraid rules are rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um ...what rules would you be referring to ...exactly?\"</span></div></div>",

They escort you right through the 'In' door, and you're met with a hot, steamy kitchen brimming with activity. You're quickly dragged over to a large sink, given an apron and gloves and told, quite bluntly, to start washing. The apron, suprisingly, fits over your Jamie Bell filled belly, so you don't really have any excuse not to start. Considering what you thought was going to happen, this will be a doddle ...even if you do have to wash a mountain of plates before you've earned enough to pay the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wash, you steal glances around the kitchen. There are plenty of chefs you don't recognise ...it's the young celebrities in various states of undress that you're interested in. Over in one corner you can see Taylor Lautner being cooked in a large pot of boiling water. A bit further on there's Cody Linley lying naked on a counter while one of the chefs bastes him with cooking oil. On the same counter, you see Skandar Keynes sitting cross legged on a large plate. He's arguing with the chef about the best way to prepare him. Away from the actual cooking area, you see what looks like a lounge. There are several couches, and they all have naked boys sitting on them. They must be waiting their turn to be cooked. Devon Murray and Jesse McCartney are just the first two that you recognise when a loud knocking distracts you. Where's it coming from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're woken very suddenly by the second knock that's coming from somewhere in your house. Your eyes instantly dart downwards to see if your stomach is as big as you think it might be, but you can see that it's the same as it was when you went to sleep. There's a third knock, which is rare when you consider that your postman isn't nearly so patient ...the postman! </span></div></div>",

Leaping the last few steps, you dash across the corridor and grab the door handle. You open it to find the postman about half way down the garden path. He hears the door opening and turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Sorry, I didn't think there was anyone in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK ...you have ...something for me?\" you ask breathlessly. The postman smiles as he hands you one of those electronic things they use to register reciept of deliveries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sign there and I'll fetch it from the van.\" You do so, then watch as he returns with a fairly large parcel tucked under his arm. After checking that you've signed, he hands the parcel over. \"Enjoy,\" he says rather simply. You're sure you catch a knowing look and a cheeky smile on his face as he turns to go. You check the label on the box and it says 'Body Enlargement Device'. You kind of get the feeling that the postman thinks it means something other than it's true purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind you, you first go back upstairs to fetch your box of boys. You carry them back downstairs and place the box gingerly onto the dining room table. You then turn your attention to the parcel and begin carefully removing the device. You take out the instruction manual that's tucked in at the side, then sift through the rest of the packaging until you find what you're really looking for ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overall machine stands at just over 25 inches tall. You remember what the flyer said about it enlarging shrunken snacks to a maximum height of 20 inches, which looks to be the rough height of the chamber built into it. It's cylindrical in shape, and the chamber is accessed by a see-through door at the front. That must be so you can watch your boy snacks grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're immensely eager to start making big meals out of big boys, but there's a little voice in your head that's telling you to read the manual first. Something could go wrong if you don't know exactly what you're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? Listen to the voice in your head or the rumble in your stomach?</span></div></div>",

Then there's the more specific rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Once a boy has been enlarged once, he cannot be shrunk again or made any bigger. The change is permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Only one boy in the machine at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Make sure all clothes are removed from the boy before placing him in the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all seems fair enough.

There's even a seperate function that can increase the size of ...other body parts. Such a function was installed in case the consumer has a particular fondness for any one part of the anatomy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving read the manual, you're ready to use the machine itself.

You fish him out of the box, holding on to his shirt carefully as he kicks and screams. You'll have to be careful that he doesn't try to escape once you've enlarged him, seeing as he's the panicking sort.

It will be fun to watch that hope fade and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean ...you mean you're going to make me normal sized again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not quite. The biggest you'll ever be from this point on is about 20 inches, that's if I decide to make you that big.\" Holding his legs in your fist, you poke his plump belly, jiggling it about. \"Having more of you to eat is going to be fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere goes the hope in his eyes. It's gone, definitely gone. He resumes yelling as you place him inside the machine, closing the door on him and trapping him. You can see through the door, so you see every futile gesture he makes, banging on the door, kicking it, running back and forth. Once he starts crying you decide that enough is enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the controls on top of the device. You can either make Jason's whole body bigger, or you can expand one part of his body. It strikes you that if you were to do so, you'd make his belly bigger.

There's a maximum expansion for this procedure to prevent any real harm comin to the boy inside the machine. As far as Jason is concerned, he just got inexplicably fatter. The humming stops and a little green light comes on at the top of the machine. You open the door and let Jason stagger out under the weight of his newly enlarged belly. He seems to be having trouble keeping his balance. Not that it'll matter where he's going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me?\" he gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made you just that little bit plumper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit plumper?

With your hand gripping his legs, his belly sticks out across your index finger. You give it a little poke and are delighted to find out that it's wonderfully soft. You then bring him closer and stick out your tongue, giving his belly a few experimental licks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, delicious!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hey!

You get placed inside a cage that's only just big enough to accomodate you and your enlarged belly.

Still being held in place by the waiters, Robert licks his lips as he looks your body up and down. He then looks Dominic and Jason over. Obviously he's deciding who to start with.</span></div></div>",

You're surrounded by darkness as his lips close on your neck, his tongue caressing your face. You then feel him begin to swallow. You can literally feel his throat muscles contract, pulling you further in. It's not long before your shoulders and chest are in, and Elijah begins devouring your magnificently plump belly. This is where you're convinced Elijah will fail in his attempt to eat you. There's no way he can fit your tummy into his mouth. Right now your head is just about to enter his stomach, but it's not too late for him to cough you up, which he should do any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, the nightmare continues as Elijah's jaw stretches to accomodate your belly. It seems there's no stopping him. He is going to eat you. You can hear his groans of pleasure as he tastes that soft and round flesh. Once your belly has been eaten, he slurps your legs down in one go, propelling your entire body towards his stomach at a speed you hadn't anticipated. You're forced to curl up, your arms hugging your enormous belly. One of the first thoughts that hits you is the irony of having Jamie Bell curled up in your stomach, while you in turn are curled up inside Elijah Wood's stomach. You strain to hear Elijah's voice as he starts to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahh ...delicious. It's a shame that we don't get more customers that are unable to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have plenty of staff that you can eat whenever you want. Myself included,\" says a voice that you recognise as being Devon Werkheiser's. He must have been in the office, watching you being eaten. \"In fact ...I was ...sort of ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of what?\" asks Elijah as he strokes his enlarged belly. You can feel him doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of hoping you'd eat me tonight,\" finished Devon. Elijah chuckles, making his whole belly shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some day, Devon. Tell you what, if none of the customers decide to eat you next Tuesday, you'll find yourself in my stomach very soon after closing time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir voices fade away, replaced by the sound of stomach acids beginning to pool around you. It looks as if the most nutritious parts of you are going to be with Elijah forever. What's left ...well, what's left gets flushed. You close your eyes and try not to think of it as you black out ...</span></div></div>",

Gravity does most of the work now as Daniel continues to slide down into Rupert's waiting stomach. He gives you a cheery little wave before putting his arms by his sides in order to be eaten with greater ease. He's still smiling as Rupert's lips caress his belly and chest, and even when it's only his head that remains, he still has a great big grin on his face. That grin is the last thing of Daniel you see as Rupert makes one final swallow and closes his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so pre-occupied with watching Daniel being eaten that you failed to notice the effect it was having on Rupert. He stands there, still naked apart from his boxers, except now his belly is bulging outwards. For a few seconds you could have sworn you saw that enormous belly squirm, but it soon stops again. Rupert smiles and rubs his tummy lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just getting comfortable. He deserves to, of course, seeing as he was so delicious. Now then, you'd better hurry up and eat me before I digest him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ...but ...your stomach ...it's so big ...I'll never ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be able to swallow me as easily as I swallowed Daniel.\" He gives his tummy another rub as he walks towards you. \"Now kindly eat me while I'm still so very, very plump.\"</span></div></div>",

You stroke his large belly with both hands and feel Daniel wriggle inside. Rupert smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes that, but we'd both prefer to be inside you. Eat me. Eat us. We're so tasty ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught up in a sudden rush of excitement, you grab hold of Rupert's waist. Surprisingly, you're able to pick him up easily. You've already managed to lift him a couple of feet off the floor. It's as if he's weightless! Yet, that wonderfully fat belly of his tells you that he can't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat me, or do I have to jump down your throat?\" aks Rupert, getting a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ...no, of course I'm going to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then hurry up. I want to be inside you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the fact that you are holding this hefty boy up as though he weighed nothing wasn't enough to convince you this is a dream, the things he's been saying certainly are. No boy you've ever enslaved in the real world would talk in this ...rather exciting fashion. Wasting no more time, you raise Rupert up above your head. Looking up you can see his massive, Daniel Radcliffe-filled belly, and the thought that you're soon going to eat it is overwhelming. With some help from Rupert, you lower his feet into your mouth, which is now stretching to fit round his feet. Your throat is also expanding to accomodate the passage of his feet and legs down said throat and into your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh yes ...I hope you're enjoying me!\" says Rupert. You're in no position to answer, what with your mouth being so full, but the part you're going to enjoy most is coming up now. With his legs fully consumed, you're now at the very base of Rupert's belly. Your mouth expands even further to accomodate it, and you ever so slowly begin working your way up. The plumpness of the meat would make it special enough, but as his tummy finds it's way deeper into you, you can feel Daniel squirming with excitement inside. The subsequnt effect to your taste buds is amazing. After a few more good gulps, you've eaten his belly and are making your way up his chest. Now that's he's full sized, you can really appreciate the individual taste of those perky nipples of his. After eating his belly, his broad shoulders certainly aren't a problem. Finally only his head remains. Out of the bottom of your eye, you're able to see him smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy me?\" he asks. You gurgle a response that is as close to a 'Yes' as you can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it was all worth it. Bon appetit!\" calls Rupert as he disappears into your jaws and down into your stomach, curling up like Daniel must have done inside Rupert. You look down at your own stomach and are delighted to see a decent bulge. The best thing about it all is that you now have Rupert in your belly, who in turn has Daniel in his. You stroke your enlarged tummy and shiver with delight as you feel them both wriggle in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert really was delicious. If only you could swallow him like that in real life ...or at least fatten him up by feeding him another boy. Your subconscious leaves you with one parting thought ...the machine!</span></div></div>",

He was followed by Tom Felton and Dominic Cooper. You had them both raw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach a double doorway at the end of the corridor, you notice a rather large and empty space on the wall. You ask Matt what goes there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where my portrait will hang when you ultimately decide to eat me, your honour. If I could bring your attention back to the present, however, there is an important banquet tonight and you usually insist on selecting the meat courses personally.\" He opens both the double doors and then stands aside, waiting for you to go in.

The flavour of his flesh tingles every inch of your insides as he gets further and further into you. Very soon his chest, arms and belly are all inside you. You spasm with delight as you swallow his groin, followed by his legs. It's with one final swallow that his feet join the rest of him inside your body, and his entire form slowly but surely makes it's way to your middle. Just think, that bulge in you was once sitting right in front of you, whereas now he's lying inside you, awaiting a slow and pleasurable (for you, anyway) digestion. You stroke the bulge with the tip of your tail and curl up a bit to fully enjoy your meal. He moves only slightly now and then, but ultimately by the time the effects of the hypnosis wear off, he'll be in no state to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yessss,\" you hiss to yourself. \"A most delicioussss meal.\" You take a moment to actually look at your surroundings. Perhaps you were too distracted by the walking meat that was Frankie to notice it before, but now you can see that you're in a very exotic location. It's hot and you're surrounded by large trees and strange plants. Forgetting the sights for a moment, you suddenly hear the sound of voices coming from nearby. Male voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! More man cubsss ...which means more ssssnacks!\"</span></div></div>",

You tentatively poke your head out of a large clump of grass in order to see better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself looking at a camp. There are makeshift shelters made from wood and matted leaves, a few hammocks strung up between some of the trees, a few camp fires here and there. Sitting by the closest camp fire, you see two naked boys. Christian Cooke and Sam Clark, no less. Sam is cutting up some strange looking plants and dropping them in a nearby bowl while Christian is trying to get the fire going again. You lie low and listen in on what they're saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't Frankie be back by now?\" asks Sam in that wonderful Austrailian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better be,\" says Christian irritably. \"I don't want this thing going out once I've gotten it going again. I hope he doesn't bring any damp wood like he did last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't suppose he'd have gone off to the beach and joined the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he has ...damn,\" mutters Christian as he continues to fail in getting the fire lit again. \"If he has, I swear I'm going to cook him over this fire instead of that boar we found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find that rather hard,\" you think to yourself as you remember how delicious Frankie was. They must have sent him to gather firewood, and instead he found you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think ...it ...got him, do you?\" asks Sam. Christian sighs, puts down the sticks he was using and looks Sam right in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, mate, there's no monster out there. It's all in your head. Granted, there are a lot of wild animals on the island, but if there was anything dangerous we would have run into it by now.\" Considering the matter closed, Christian goes back to lighting the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you're on an island. That's good, because it means that these delicious boys have no way of escaping you. Plus, you've learned that there are more out there. Exactly how many more, you'll find out later. Right now, you need to concentrate on making these boys your next meal. You don't feel confident enough to take them both on at once. No doubt they've made themselves some weapons. Your only choice is to wait patiently until one of them leaves the camp, then you'll eat whoever gets left alone.

However, rather than go after him, you decide to get him to come to you. You plan to use the fact that you still have your own head to your advantage. You position yourself so that only your head sticks out of the long grass, while making sure your body is ready to pounce and wrap around Christian once he's close enough. You adopt a pained, anguished expression and call out weakly to Christian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help ...help ...help me!\" Christian hears you, though it takes him a few seconds to find where your voice is coming from. All he sees is a fellow human, presumably crawling through the grass, in desperate need of help. In desperate need of a snack is more like it. Sure enough, he comes running to your aid. Once he's standing right in front of you, you dart out of the grass and propel your coils round and round him, moving so fast that by the time he even realises what's happened, you've pinned his arms to his sides and his legs together. He's not going anywhere except into your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolisssh man cub! Sssee where your kindnessss got you?

You can hear Christian's voice, and the voice of the boy he's brought to be unwittingly eaten, but you can't quite make out who it is yet. You slink back further into the cave, and hide in the shadows. You keep your eyes on the mouth of the cave, and sure enough, Christian soon appears there, standing just behind Devon Werkeiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one,\" says Christian. \"We'll find them in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're sure you're edible?\" asks Devon, peering into the darkness of the cave. Obviously Christian has lured Devon here under the pretence of collecting mushrooms or some other edible fungi. Unfortunately for Devon, the only thing around here that's edible is him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive. Let's go.\" Devon strides into the cave, while Christian only takes a few steps, making sure that he doesn't get too far into the cave. A wise precaution, as you instantly spring from your hiding place and seize Devon while's he still at the mouth of the cave. This way it's not too dark for you to get a good look at your meal, and it's not too dark for him to see what's happening to him. Within seconds you've wrapped your coils around him. It wouldn't have taken that long anyway, seeing as he's so short. As he looks at you in terror, you merely smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I congratulate you on your first choice of ssssacrifice, Christian. Sssmall, but very chunky. Make sssure tomorrow's meal is just as good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" says Christian flatly, as he turns on his heel and walks steadily back towards the camp. You're now left alone with Devon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here? Where's Christian going?\" asks Devon, his voice small and a little wheezy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your beloved leader has brought you here ssso that I may eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! He wouldn't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just did. He's ssstrolling back to your camp now, and tomorrow he'll bring sssome other boy to be my meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ...but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To save his own ssskin, of course. Oh, I had to do a little hypnotising to make absolutely sure he'd do it, but the deal is that if he brings me one boy a day ...I won't eat him. Now, ssspeaking of hypnotising ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon have Devon under your spell, and his face adopts the same grin that you saw on Frankie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssso tell me, man cub ...how do you feel about your current sssituation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ...it's okay ...I'm ...small but ...chunky ...\" says Devon. These, of course, are his last words as you open your mouth wide and slowly insert Devon into it. He packs a great deal of flavour for one so small, and his smooth skin feels wonderful as it passes through your lips and into your innards. He is delicious, though of course it doesn't take long to swallow him. You make sure his progress down to your middle is slow, so that you can enjoy him for longer. Eating him was great, but digesting him is going to be even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've now got little to do but wait until Christian brings you your next meal. Once again, you do not notice or experience the passage of time like you would in the waking world. You decide to take a little nap while you digest Devon ...so you're dreaming that you're going to sleep for an hour or two. Complicated stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon wake up though, and find that your last meal has been properly digested, and your next meal is due.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eager to continue, my jaws closed over Mitch\u2019s plump curved rear as well as his now very erect groin. As Mitch\u2019s groin neared the back of my throat, I could feel its stiff tip move atop the roof of my mouth, causing it to pulse.

I almost regretted having to continue consuming Mitch, though I know I had to and preferably fast sense I was all but in the open. Mitch was now waist deep in my mouth his large round butt and erect groin seemed to be somewhat challenging to swallow, more so then I had first suspected but all the while worth it. Sensing the need to hurry I contracted my throat muscles faster, gulping down Mitch\u2019s chest. Then right before Mitch vanished from sight within me, I looked at his face one last time. Still asleep he expressed a relaxed smile as if he was or had recently experiencing the most intense orgasm of his life, and with that I gulped down his chest, leaving only his head in my mouth along with his arms which stretched out limp to either side of my jaws. With one last large gulp Mitch\u2019s head slipped down my throat followed quickly by his limp arms leaving only his hands exposed which soon also followed suit sending Mitch, now merely a bulge along my body, moving ever deeper down my cylindrical form where in the end his tasty little body would rest for digestion among his two unlucky comrades Zac and Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last of the two sunbathing boys consumed I decided it would be best to retreat back into the woods in order to digest my rather large meal properly.

If all these boys could produce such a flavor from that certain place, then it would be well worth my effort to exploit that flavor what ever way possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps my hypnosis abilities could ease the process of obstructing that delicious fluid from my future meals. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's standing right at the edge, and he looks like he's ready to jump. \"Now listen, you're going to let me go free ...or I'll jump!\" You let out a chortle, which quickly escalates into a guffaw. Oliver shouts above the noise of your laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh all you want, but it's my guess that you won't want to eat me after I've splatted myself all over the floor. So let me go free, or you'll lose out on another snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't that be 'let me go free and you'll lose out on another snack'? Oliver, you're really not thinking straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing your brother get eaten probably has that effect!\" shouts Oliver angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I let you go, I'll definitely lose another snack. If you jump, chances are I'll catch you before you hit the floor. Be sensible about this. If you're going to meet your end, wouldn't you rather meet it the same way as your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, being tortured, licked, tasted and then swallowed? No thanks! At least this way it'll be quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my dear little friend, I can make it quick if you like. Tell you what, why don't I stand right below the counter, and you can step right off and into my mouth. Then I'll swallow you right down, I promise. That way you'll be with your brother ...and besides, it sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ...you want me to feed myself to you? To just ...just jump right into your mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider the alternative. If you try to jump, I will catch you. Then, once I've got hold of you, I'll make sure the process of consuming you is a very long and agonsing one. So, the choice is yours. What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill perched on the edge of the shelf, Oliver looks like he could go either way. He obviously hasn't thought this through all that well. He's really not in a postion to name terms. However, here he has a chance to finish this whole thing quickly. Pass that chance up, and he risks his end being a very painful one.</span></div></div>",

Once you step onto the stool, you find your head at just the right height for Oliver to step off the shelf and into your waiting jaws.

Maybe it's the fact that you're getting more of a chance to savour him, but he's definitely tastier than his brother. After a few more sloshes round your mouth, you finally swallow him so that he can join his brother and await digestion in your stomach. Another fine snack, and this one actually fed himself to you.

You start to wonder if you can find someone else who can be tricked into feeding themselves to you. Then again, it might be easier just to eat them forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, if you're still hungry. You've just had Tom Felton as well as both of the Phelps twins.

Stay undressed too long and the sigh of your bare bodies may persuade me to eat you anyway.\" This makes the boys change in record time. Rupert is soon wearing the baggy, patched trousers, the purple vest and the fez. The vest means that his arms as well as most of his chest and stomach are exposed, and he is rather conscious of this. He reckons you were serious about deciding to eat them anyway, and he is right to think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew takes just a little longer to dress, but now he stands next to Rupert, wearing the blue trousers and top, his pleasantly hairy midriff exposed.

You hold back a chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two. You can start ...and don't forget, this is to be a real performance. I want to see you singing to each other like real lovers, looking into each other's eyes, all that stuff.\" Rupert and Matthew turn to each other reluctantly.

After taking a deep breath, he begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show you the world, shining, shimering, splendid. Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew's doing a fairly good job of not letting on how creeped out he is by the whole thing, and Rupert's singing voice turns out to be fairly good.

Start taking your clothes off while I get ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for- uh- what?\u201d Rupert swallows, audibly.  Clearly their terror is not gone.  After all, fear of the unknown is one of the most primal of fears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you rather I rip your clothes off and throw you both in the deep friar?\u201d You chuckle.  Both boys gulp and frantically begin stripping as you get ready.  While you move about the kitchen you talk to your little pets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, a little back story, you boys, whether you know this or not, are positively the most delicious things I\u2019ve ever tasted in my entire life.  Hands down.  Like succulent, tasty, little morsels of sweat and savory meat.  Finger-licking good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth have slowed down a bit by now, their terror hampering their progress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, we get it,\u201d matt whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.  Well anyway, there\u2019s more to eating you than the taste and the smell of petrified cooked boy... or even raw boy.\u201d  You lick your lips just thinking about your precious meals as the two boys on the table look at each other fearfully.  That\u2019s when you set down a slice of bread on one plate, and a hat dog roll on the other.  They open their mouths to speak but you interrupt them by continuing.  \u201cAnyway there\u2019s more to it than that.  There\u2019s something... sexual about the whole thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys have stopped undressing and stare at you with mouths agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou- you get off on eating us?  On killing young guys?!\u201d Matthew is incredulous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl from either your throat or your stomach has them removing the remainder of their clothes a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just that\u201d, you take the glare off of them as you reach into the pantry for something.  They can see you inspecting something and clearly making a selection followed by two quiet screams.  What you\u2019ve taken, you hold one in each hand, is unseen by them so far.  \u201cIt\u2019s the whole process.  Owning you young men in the pique of your physical prowess.  So much to live for.  So strong!  Reduced to mere playthings and treats.  My pinky figure is enough to crush you, my tongue wrestles you to the back of my throat and then your serve the sole purpose of pleasing me and becoming muscles on my godly form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you like, get hard eating us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wank off to torturing us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, of course I do.\u201d  You purr, dying their now completely nude succulent bodies.  Matthew is as muscular as they come with a nice gift of hair which you know will tickle your tastebuds, while Rupert\u2019s smooth flesh is positively porklike and shows and exquisite sheen of sweat on his goose-pimples pink flesh.  You realize you\u2019ve just described them out loud, accidentally and both try covering themselves up.  You quickly swipe their clothes off the table and continue eating them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm... didn\u2019t you say we\u2019re doing this so we\u2019re not eaten?\u201d  Matt whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t taste that much like pork!\u201d Rupert whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCooking you, cutting you up, biting your arms and legs and heads off, eviscerating you, stuffing you, disembowleing you, using you as sex toys, it all makes me deeply horny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sick, man!\u201d Matthew shrieks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe so.  But therein lies your sanctuary.  You see, while I eat 99% of the boys I have, a rare 1% is saved from certain death.  The issue is that it is not merely your choice... you need to pass a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what kind of test?\u201d Rupert stutters out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.  There\u2019s no studying involved.  I have a harem, of sorts, 36 young men, used by me as opposed to eaten by me.  They please me sexually, are shoved inside my other orifices, are licked all over while I masterbate, are shoved in fleshjacks while I eat their friends, but mostly just fuck each other\u2019s brains out for my amusement... usually on my dinner plate so I can eat the ones who are less than amusing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys look up at you in chocked awe.  They aren\u2019t sure which is a worse fate now: immediate death or being used as a sex toy by a young giant for eternity.  Here\u2019s the thing... I have 3 dozen in my harem.  I always have 3 dozen in my harem.  So you have to prove to me that you are worthy enough.  If you get in, to be trained into obedient pets, two spots need to be freed up... you know what that means of course.  My two least obedient toys, or least seductive, will take your place as my meals.  Are you still willing to do anything to stay alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a moment\u2019s hesitation and the two whisper to each other.  Their nude bodies tremble but glisten in the heavy kitchen light.  Finally they remove themselves from the huddle and stare right into your eyes.</span></div></div>",

You just lie on the bread or roll I have put on the table while they massage your whole body with a very special oil.  More on that in a moment\u2019s. Round two will involve you arching your ass up and getting pleasured with baby carrots I\u2019ve nibbled down to size.  My little toys may also insert fingers to widen the area.  While doing this you will be milked until you are empty.  All cream filling will be collected by my pets.  Lastly, assuming you have made it to round three, you will be fucked, orally and anally.  It\u2019s as simple as that.  Your only goal through all of this, is to pretend you enjoy every moment of it.  You may moan in pleasure, writhe, etc.  you may not push your partner away.

It is composed of honeys, spices, oil, and the come milked out of the other harem members when they undertook the same test as you.  During your part two, when you are milked, your own seed will be collected as marinade for future recruits.  If, at the end of the trial you have passed I will lick or suck the tasty marinade from your flesh.  If you have failed, I will close the bun/bread you are lying on, toast it slightly, add condiments, and gobble you up right then and there.

He manages to stammer a few protests as you start to pull off his shoes, trousers and boxers. You're still holding him by his shirt so all it takes is a few gentle shakes and he falls out of it, right onto your waiting palm. Your fist closes around his naked form, trapping him. He's certainly more hairy than Tom, but not overly so. He's got just those little tufts of belly hair that tickle your fingers ...and are sure to tickle your taste buds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only then that you notice Rupert, who has finally gotten up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ...I guess you can let me go now, huh?

Oh no, you don't get off that easily. You're going to stay here and watch. A little preview of your eventual fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure he doesn't escape, you pick Rupert up and place him inside a drinking glass.

You hold him there for a second so that Rupert can see Matthew's bare backside and legs sticking out, kicking out of pure panic. You slowly suck him in, taking time to enjoy his treasure trail. Finally all it takes is one last little suck to pull his feet in. He continues to thrash around inside your mouth, giving you a proper taste of every little bit of him. He may not be quite as cute as Rupert, Tom or Dan, but he's proving to be as delicious as any of them. Perhaps even tastier than Tom was. You decide to swallow him alive rather than chew him, so with one big swallow Matthew slips and slides down your throat. You can still feel him struggling as he goes down, but it's no use. He finally lands in your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack your lips and even let out a little burp. You look down at Rupert, mouth and eyes wide open in shock. He saw the whole thing.

A quick glance at the oven tells you that the pizza is close to being ready, so you need to finish this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie is very slim, though not quite as thin overall as Chris. You move on to James and Oliver, who probably somewhere in between Alfie and Chris in terms of slenderness. Robert Pattinson is suprisingly thin. It must have been all that weight he was trying to lose recently. Devon is just ...well, small. Apart from Rupert, Dan seems to be the only one with any trace of fat on him. Never mind, the thinner they are, the easier it will be to fit them on one slice of pizza each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down on your captives, all naked to a man. They each seem to be trying to maintain a sense of personal space, nobody wanting to be too close to anyone. The reality of the situation has sunk in, even for Chris. They're all shaking. You're a little tempted to offer them one last way of escaping their fate, namely to have a massive orgy within the bowl. It'd be interesting enough just to see if they'd agree or if they'd rather be served on a pizza and eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to make the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pay attention, potential toppings.

Now you have to lie in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the boys start panicking a little, running back and forth inside the bowl and bumping into each other, falling over and ending up in all sorts of tangles. After slicing the pizza into eight seperate slices, you're ready to start adding the boys. You start with Chris, seeing as he's shown himself to be the ringleader of their resistance, removing him first will help to show the rest of them who's in charge. You pluck him right out of the bowl, take a good grip on him and force him into a rigid, upright position. You then select a slice and carefully place him on it, applying just enough force to stick him to the pizza without crushing him. He tries to move, but the melted cheese is too gooey for him to move. He can't even move his head enough to try and eat his way out. The other boys see what's in store for them and fall into a state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go for the twins next, giving each of them their own slice to lie down on. You don't have to force them as much as you did with Chris, as they're in a much more receptive state. Robert feels positively limp as you pick him up and place him on a slice. Devon and Alfie go next, followed by Dan. You save Rupert for last, so that he could watch all his friends being added to the pizza, before it's finally his turn. As soon as you pick him up, he goes rigid, his arms snapping to his sides. He's offering no resistance whatsoever, he's even helping you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it's ready. Your Potter Pizza. Eight delicious little actors, all lying on a slice, their arms stuck to their sides, and their entire bodies stuck to the pizza itself. It's a beautiful sight, but it wasn't made for looking at. It's time to eat ...but who to start with?</span></div></div>",

You'd think the boys would be used to the temperature by now, but their raw skin scraping against the smooth hot bottom of the saucepan keeps causing them to scream in pain anew.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert's shaggy red hair is dripping wet, with water streaming onto his shoulders and face, burning every patch of skin they touch.  Matthew's hairy face and chest however, seem to have made his suffering less extreme.  You marvel at this, chuckling, and fetch the other ingredients from a nearby table.  First you throw in a handful of baby carrots, one at a time.  Each one lands on an alternating boy, causing more pain onto their already damaged bodies.

He's been sobbing and trembling all the time while being sucked into your mouth, but for a moment or two there you think you feel his whole body stiffen. You can't stop now though. After letting go of his legs, you suck them in until only his feet remain protuding from your mouth. As for poor Tom, he is now staring straight down your throat, being kept there by the grip your lips have on his lower legs. Suck his feet in and he'll probably slide straight down into your stomach, if you let him. You could use your tongue to keep him in your mouth and taste him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued tasting sounds good, but then again there's something quite appealing about the thought of swallowing him alive, whole and straightaway. You'd be like a human anaconda, and that notion sounds bizarrely exotic to you.</span></div></div>",

You giggle as you see his kicking legs and struggling feet.  Soon, he has to be pushed the rest of the way, until the marshmallow takes up the space under his armpits and down to his knees.  While his arms, legs, and head are free, he can barely stand up on his own, under the weight of the large white obstructrion, without falling over.  There's no way he'd be able to run.  You stick the Tomallow on the edge of a long stick, behind the struggling teen, and prepare to roast him over an open flame; just enough to melt the marshmallow, and brown Tom a small fraction.  Suddenly, an idea strikes you.  There are eight other incredibly pale Harry Potter actors.  Why not do the same to them?  You can eat them up one at a time, and they'll be melted into their graham crackers, so they would just have to sit there, as you enjoyed tasting them all.  So how about it, give Tom the satisfaction of a prolonged existence while you prepare Rupert Grint, Devon Murray, Oliver Phelps, James Phelps, Matthew Lewis, Robert Pattinson, Bronson Webb, and Daniel Radcliffe?  Edit: You can add all the HP actors including those playing side characters like Zacharia and Dean Thomas and Colin Creevey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine delicious pale actors?

You ignore his whimperings and start to gently nudge Tom's fluffy prison with your pointer finger, causing it to roll slowly from one end of the counter's surface to the other.  You hold back a smile as he turns over from his stomach to back continuously.  Everytime he comes up again his expression shifts.  Sometimes he looks petrified, sometimes nauseous.  Your favorite is when he looks at you with a hatred, similar to the look of loathing he gives Harry in the movies.  His eyebrows arch and he wears a scowl.  It's deliciously cute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this you use a tad more force, rolling the young boy from one side to the other, more quickly now.  Soon you grow tired of this, much to the delight of Tom.  His happiness is shortlived however as you pick up the stick at the other end of the marshmellow.  You bring him over to the box of boys sitting on the kitchen table and stick him over the box so that he is facing his shrunken brethren, your delicious young snacks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping your face out of sight you speak for the Tomellow, using him like a puppet to entertain the other morsals.  In a high falsetto voice you mock, \"hello, my name is Thomas Felton and you are all going to be eaten.  There is no escape.  Ha ha ha.  I'm lucky enough to be first, and I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some screams for you to stop.  They must be petrified watching their shrunken friend stuck in a marshmellow and used as a puppet.  You continue anyway.  \"I'm so excited to be a tasty little snack for our owner.  And you should all be flattered too.  After all, what a great compliment for him to judge us so delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the Tomellow back to your face, holding him by the stick, and lay it back down on the table, chuckling at the look of contempt he has given you.  Lying on his stomach, Tom faces the edge of the counter and only has a view of your feet. So you squat down to get a better look at your captive audience of one, (soon to be nine).  \"Tom, you seem to have some marshmellow on your face... Allow me to get that for you!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed there is quite a deal of white gook covering his face and drenching his blond hair.  His face scrunches up in fear as you extend your tongue.  In his attempt to pull back into the marshmellow like a turtle, you have ample time to savor the moment, slowly pushing your waiting tonuge forward.  His eyes open at the last second, staring down at his own chin where the red muscle first meets his skin.  It is deliciously smooth, completely dimpleless and free from acne.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lap up the taste of sweat and marchmellow before licking upward to his full cheeks, button nose, and glistening forehead.  By now you can even taste the succulent nectar of his tears, flowing freely.  Soon you can't take it any longer and take in his entire head.  You can hear muffled screams but easily pay them no mind as your mouth is filled with the sugary taste of heaven.  He is even more exquisite than you could have imagined as your taste buds press against each of his features.  His eyebrows taste of powder and his silky hair like honey.  Its such a salty-sweet clean taste.  You suck again and again letting his face rest on your powerful tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you have to let him out to breathe and he gasps for breath, all traces of marshmellow lost from his head.  He is glistening all over now, and he stares at you with a look of absolute terror.  You stand up.  While Tom is still catching his breath you turn him over so that he is again facing you and begin pressing down heavily on his front.  His chocolate-filled belly aches with pain as you do this, and he soon feels almost like he is pregnant.  Tom coughs and screams, flailing and writhing in pain.  Soon you remove your index finger and turn him around again to curse you quietly.  Where would you like to taste now, since only two more places are outside the gooey white prison?</span></div></div>",

They almost match the color of the marshmellow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue snakes out and catches him on the sole of his right foot.  The toes curl reflexively and he gasps in surprise.  As soon as the well-manicured plump little digits unclench again, you move closer, sticking the whole row in your mouth, sucking repeatedly and audibly.  The taste is exquisite and you can't stop the audible 'mmm-ing' sounds even if you tried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom attempts to kick you with the other foot and shake his leg free of your mouth.  You feel nothing, and your strong hold doesn't loosen at all.  The flavour is absolutely delectible, probably the greatest thing you ever had in your life and you pull his large foot in further.  Savoring the semi-sweet and sour taste.  \"I hope all the boys taste this good Tom.  You have no idea what a treat this is... I wish you could try some of this,\" you say with your mouth full, smacking your lips togetehr for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does not respond, playing machismo once again, but you can tell from the way he is twitching that he is crying on the other side of the marshmellow.  You get past the ankle and reach the calf, your tongue lathering the entire foot with saliva, licking in between sucks.  It isn't enough, so you envelope his other foot too, tickling him out of his tears, although he is still far from laughing.  Your tongue works its way between each toe, and over every ridge, satisfying your hungry lust and tasting every millimeter of young flesh.  It's like the worlds best-tasting lolli-pop, except it never runs out of succulent flavor!   </span></div></div>",

Oh yes,\" you say, finally taking your eyes off his body. \"Quite simple really, I want you two to wrestle each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked?\" asks Daniel. \"Isn't that a little ...you know ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're actors. Just pretend you're filming an epic movie set in Ancient Greece. They used to wrestle naked all the time. The only difference is, none of them were fighting for their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean ...\" Zac begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. The loser gets eaten. The winner is spared. You could refuse, of course, but then you'd both get eaten. Doesn't seem like a sensible option to me. So, what's it going to be?\"</span></div></div>",

Apparently Daniel is prepared to fight for his right to not be eaten. Zac is knocked to the floor, but he shows surprising resilience and quickly rolls out of the way of Daniel's next attack. Daniel changes direction but all too late, because Zac is up and going for his waist. Zac wraps his arms around Daniel's belly and tries to get him off balance. Daniel struggles valiantly, his sweaty back rubbing against Zac's abs. Finally through sheer hard work, Daniel manages to loosen Zac's grip and is now facing him, though still partly locked in Zac's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this is turning you on to no end. Anyone who didn't know they were fighting for their lives might think they're having a particularly passionate make out session. You suddenly remember what made you want to see two boys fight in the first place. The sight of Daniel covered in saliva. You look around for something to pour on the boys.</span></div></div>",

It takes one great push, but Zac manages to send Daniel flying backwards, giving him the time he needs to stand up properly. Daniel recovers quickly from his fall and stands up as well.

This fight is possibly the most erotic thing you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel and Zac run at each other simultaneously and grapple with each other, their arms and bodies locked together. They grunt and gasp with the effort. Finally, when it seems that their arms are deadlocked, Zac sweeps Daniel's leg with his own and knocks him to the floor.

Your tongue sends him rolling round the inside of your mouth, letting you get a most intimate taste. Finally, just like Daniel, you take a great gulp and swallow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointment of not having Alfie in your box is still quite strong. In short, you're down in the dumps and eating two boys alive didn't seem to help. Maybe you should eat to forget your disappointment? Perhaps a diversion might be more helpful ...a little bit of torture ...</span></div></div>",

You'll barely feel a thing.\" Holding the top end of the spoon, you position Daniel so that he's a few inches above the flame. He's being warmed by it but is in no danger of being burnt.

You've got to admire his nerves. Your tongue caresses him, paying particular attention to his head and belly.

As your lips close gently on his waist, you can feel him struggling inside you. Now this is a more typical response. Obviously Dan doesn't have Robert's nerves of steel. That's not all that he doesn't have either. He tastes good, but it doesn't compare to Robert and his mature, meaty flavour.</span></div></div>",

You therefore tip several cubes into the bowl with Rupert, who covers his head as they fall all around him. He's shivering with fear, but the hot water you're about to add to the jelly cubes should warm him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing fit to warn him, you begin slowly pouring the water in. You are, however, not entirely without mercy. You don't pour the hot water right on top of him. You pour it in at the side of the bowl so that it can slowly pool around him. He cries out at first and hops up and down in an attempt to get away from the rising water, but eventually his body gets used to it. You keep pouring until the water is up to his chest. Once the jelly sets he should be fairly well trapped inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen here, Rupert. You might be tempted to eat your way out of the jelly once it sets in some half-baked plan to escape. Keep in mind that the bowl is rather deep, and eating any of the jelly is only going to make you plumper and sweeter for me when I eat you. It really would be better for you to stay perfectly still and simply be eaten as part of the jelly. Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rupert can answer, you open the fridge door and place the bowl inside, shutting the door behind you. It'll take a while for the jelly to set, so in the meantime you decide to fish out either Daniel or Robert once again. They thought they were safe, but now one of them will become your plaything while you wait for your strawberry snack to set.</span></div></div>",

With the chocolate bubbling away, you start to fish around in one of the nearby cupboards for a mould. Finally you find it. It's your own design, tailor made for encasing teenage boys in delicious substances. The mould is rectangular, tall and thin, just wide enough for the boy to fit in but too tall for them to be able to climb out. All you have to do is place the boy inside, pour in the liquid until it reaches their shoulders, leave it to set and then open up the special hinges on the mould. Presto, one perfectly set chocolate bar, complete with a still live meaty centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the mould upright on the counter, you alter your grip on Rupert so that you can lower him into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing? What are you going to do with me?\" Rupert asks anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snacks shouldn't ask so many questions. It get's them eaten before they're ready,\" you say as you lower Rupert's naked form into the mould. You instruct him to stand upright with his arms by his side, which he does for fear of angering you. You then retrieve the melted chocolate. You can feel that it's pleasantly warm, rather than overly hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you stand very still, Rupert.\" Before he can ask why, you begin pouring the chocolate into the mould. It pools round Rupert's feet and slowly creeps up his body. You stop pouring just as it reaches his shoulders. His delicious head is pretty much all you can see in a pool of equally delicious chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't think of doing anything stupid like drinking the chocolate before it sets. Spoil my snack for me and I shall be very upset. Do you know what I like to do when I'm upset, Rupert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head, causing ripples in the chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take a shrunken teenage boy, and I make his life miserable. I make things so bad for him that he ends up begging me to finish it by eating him. I find the whole process just cheers me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then ...then I won't try anything stupid ...\" says Rupert quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" you say as you carefully pick up the mould, open the fridge and place it inside.

A chocolate fudge sundae, with a lovely ginger coloured cherry on top. You place Rupert inside a nearby tupperware tub while you make the preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start by adding several scoops of vanilla ice cream to the sundae bowl. In between scoops you add a few squirts of chocolate sauce. When the bowl is half full, you then add just a smidge of hot fudge to go on the top layer of icecream. The rest of the fudge you then proceed to pour all over Rupert, who wasn't entirely expecting this. He splutters and curses as he tries to keep his balance in the tub, but the fudge causes him to slip and fall on his pert little backside. You carefully take hold of Rupert, keeping your other hand underneath him in case he slips from your grip. You fix him with a stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, be a good boy and do exactly as you're told. When I put you down on the sundae, you're going to sit with your legs crossed. That should stop you from sinking straight into the ice cream. Got it?\" Rupert moves his head in what you assume to be a nod. You place him on top of the sundae, and sure enough, he sits with his legs crossed. The cold ice cream in contrast with the hot fudge is causing him some discomfort, but then again he's not here to be comfortable. He's here to be eaten. Now that he's in position, you take a tube of whipped cream and start spraying it carefully onto the sundae around Rupert, until only his shoulders and head are poking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up a spoon and grin. It's time to eat.</span></div></div>",

You slowly pull the spoon out, taking off the layers of fudge. Rupert sits in your mouth, whole and covered in whipped cream and fudge. He's knocked from his sitting position by your tongue as you start to relish his strong meaty flavour. The sweetness of the fudge and cream compliments him very well. You can feel him trying to grip your tongue, but he's too slippery to maintain a proper grasp. You lash him around with your tongue for a few more moments until you can feel that most of the cream is gone. You then give one big gulp and swallow the sticky young man right down. He tasted so very sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to eat the rest of the sundae. It all seems to taste even better than usual, Rupert's strong aftertaste enhancing the flavour of every spoonful. Finally you finish the last little bit and leave the spoon resting in the bowl. You rub your belly with satisfaction, wondering if Rupert is still alive in there. Doesn't matter. He'll soon be digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just finished a hearty dessert, you decide it's time for some fun. You wonder if you should take Robert Pattinson out again.

In the interests of fairness, you naturally need to make sure that Devon is in the same state of undress as Robert. Devon's shorter than Robert, but you find that the two are almost equal in muscle tone. Grasping the two shirtless actors, one in each hand, you raise them both up to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two, who goes first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what exactly are you going to do?\" asks Devon in that gorgeous accent of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a 'taste test',\" says Robert grumpily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, I want to find out who tastes better, you or Robert here. I have a theory that Robert's age might just make him that little bit tastier. So, I ask again, who's going first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you actually going to eat us?\" asks Devon, his voice shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that depends on which of you turns out to be the tastier, doesn't it? Tell you what, I'll eat the person who turns out to taste better, and the other one can go back into the box ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" cries Devon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be eaten at a later date,\" you finish, a wicked smile on your face. Devon's face takes all of a split second to go from being partially relieved to fully terrified again. Robert, on the other hand, still just looks moody. Wasting no more time, you decide to taste Devon first. You bring him closer to your mouth and slowly extend your tongue. You caress his face, taking in his rounded shoulders, finally finishing on his belly, which in your experience has always been the tastiest part. Moving Devon away, you lick your lips and contemplate his flavour. His skin was tender and juicy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you move on to Robert while Devon makes futile attempts to wipe the saliva off his torso. Just like with Devon, you start with Robert's head. His chest and his stomach give you pause for thought as you feel a burst of sensations across your tongue. It's almost as if he comes with his own natural spice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a close call, but who is your gut telling you should end up in your gut?</span></div></div>",

It was froma small shop that just opened up down the street, selling only famous young male action figure collectibles.  While they only cost 5 dollars each you were very surprised that they had only one of each kind on the racks.  There was only one box with a Joe Jonas, one box with a Josh Hutchinson, etc.  Regardless, you had only taken a five dollar bill with you when you went to check out the new store, so could onyl purchase one.  Satisfied with your selection you lay the box on the table, reading the large print boasting; \"Lifelike teenaged action figure.  Contains small parts, easily ingested.\"  Then, below was the strange addition to the warning, that you couldn't quite understand, \"Keep within reach of all children!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming it was just some stupid joke, you turned your attention to the back of the box once more.  Here was the picture of the toy inside, that looked so realistic.  That's what made you want to buy the collectible inthe first place, and you assumed would make you want to go back to the store sometime soon.  There were several pin sized holes all over the boxes though.  Initially you had tried bargaining with the smiling clerk, claiming the box was damaged and you should receive a discount.  He had assured you that you would be happy enough with the item, that it remained undamaged, and that you would be pleasantly satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting much time at all, you decide to start opening the top of the box, but stop suddenly.  As soon as you started tearing there was a strange scurrying sound, like that of small feet.  Staring intently at the brightly colored packaging you raise your eyebrows.  There!  The box had moved.  Slowly, carefully, you finish opening the lid and stare inside.  You instantly forget the boxe's moving as you see a toy-sized Ryan Shecjler huddled in one side of the box.  Emptying the contents onto the table you can't help but gasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, look at all it includes!\"  Inside is a large collection of tiny clothing, all skaterish of course.  There are several bathing suits, and even a couple of those small 'finger skateboards' for you to play with.  The last thing to fall out was a sheet of paper, marked 'serving suggestion recipee.  Collect them all!'  Strange  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at the tiny teenaged toy.  \"You look adorable.  So lifelike!  And you feel real too, what markmanship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you big idiot, I'm not a toy, I'm a real kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't know this was a talking action figure.  Maybe I'll have to take out the batteries to shut him up for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screams angrily, \"Get your freakin' hands off of me!  I'm not a toy, and if I had batteries they definitely wouldn't be wear your finger's are heading!  I'm really Ryan Sheckler; just like all those other guys trapped in toy boxes are real too!  We were all approached individually by this guy.  He offered us billion dollar deals to make us into action figures.  We all fell for it, assuming he meant make toys that look like us, but instead he literally made us toy sized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you snigger \"that's what you get for being such sell-outs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignores you and continues, \"So he packaged us up and wants to start selling us.  He used the billion dollars to silence the police, so now we're stuck tiny!  And that's not the worst of it, we're being sold to fans not just to play with, but to eat too!  Apparently, people think we must be the tastiest things in the world.  You gotta help me and maybe even rescue the others!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wear a hidden smug expression, knowing that the little star is telling the truth.  You did a good job of hiding the shock, so now you have options.</span></div></div>",

Without wasting another moment you unceremoniously drop the scared tasty lad onto your shaft reveling in the feeling of his tiny shaking body.  Small hands grab wildly as he falls face down, clutching your monster erection with arms and legs, still not managing to wrap fully around.  The young daredevil seems to be too scared to even stand up and surf like a proper skater/surfer.  Not that you mind the feeling of his own groin straining against his jeans onto your throbbing cock.  You begin to get even harder, pushing him backwards against your pubic hair and making his grip tighten.  He is afraid of sliding off, down to the floor miles below.

As the Californian twinks and Texan twunks and college boys galore start arriving and selecting rooms you watch from above, licking your lips behind the dark glass and gently stroking your cock.  Friends from previous videos, ex-lovers, and some enemies hug below and you check off each one as they come.  There is a ridiculous amount of hot, delicious, 18-20 year old guys in this one large building, and you control them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: You announce that you have one-upped Hugh Heffner's Playboy mansion.  This place is now a paradise for your models.  Each room has cameras for subscribers to watch as you all/ we all screw around.  The building is essentially self-sufficient, they'll have all needs met and more as it's a paradise, and they will be paid handsomely as residents.  The only conditions are that each boy must be involved in some sexual activity every day, which shouldn't be a problem, since they're pros.  You can take advantage of being the CEO of course.  What they don't realize is that whenever you want, (after sex, when angry, when bored, when horny, when hungry), you can shrink down any of the models you'd like to torture, play with, and eat.  The subscribers also happen to be huge vore fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: You exit the building, shrink it to the size of a very large doll house, and leave it in your home.  the boys will not age.  However they are your new toys.  You can play with, torture, and eat them whenever you would like and will never have to pay another cent for the mansion (which disappeared somehow), or your boys (who also disappeared). Perhaps your adventures are also recorded for vore fans.  Either way you long to put a lithe twink in a flesh jack or have tiny waifish college boys jack you off by hand, rubbing their nude bodies against your shaft, fucking your slit, humping your head, while others are fucked by your hard nipples and you suck a twunk like a lollipop, as two threesomes fuck on your plate trying not to be the group of cream-filled twinkies that end up getting eaten. </span></div></div>",

Before he can come the German again speaks to the producer.  Another boy, already bought by the German, appears behind the glass and both boys are promised a small fortune to suck each other off.  An ogre nearby then offers money to see them fuck.  The announcement is made and both boys consider the offer.  They refuse.  The faux offer is increased and the boys reconsider.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both boys are panting the bidding escalates.  Even you can admit, for a stringy little twerp, that was quite the hot performance.  The bidding continues for a short while and finally the German stands up victorious.  He has spent all of his money and goes to claim his prize.  We see the room behind the glass get suddenly very light, hear some screams, and a gigantic hand carries the two come covered straight boys off.  When the top is placed back on the next boy walks in.  </span></div></div>",

He's got quite a bit of muscle: tan, dirty blond, and with an all American boy look.  Wasting no more time I decide it's time to start the show.  A flick of my finger sends Brady falling flat on his muscular ass in my palm and I immediately begin unwrapping my treat, starting, as always with his feet.  His cleats plop off audibly without the need to loosen his laces.  Brute strength has it's advantages.  The little lad tries to stand but a quick flick knocks him back with a soft cry.  His socks are moist and I bring them to my nose: one musky foot per nostril.  My breath is so strong the little football stud can't help but sit there as his feet are lifted up and into my nose cavity.  When I've had my fill of the smell I get to the source and peel off the damp socks.  His long delicious pink toes curl instinctively as my tongue darts out and pulls his barefeet into my mouth, sucking and moaning in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore the shrunken lad's cries of protest.  I spit Brady back out into my palm for a moment, smacking my lips as he shudders uncontrollably.  I return to the nearly paralyzed in fear jock whose lower half is covered In saliva.  If I'd cared the slightest about his feelings I would have seen that he was broken: a shell of his former self with no friends anymore, no star status, and no identity.   He was completely humiliated and I wasn't even started yet.  He was a snack and nothing more.    His whole life, everything he had done to get where he was and get in shape only served to make him a delicious snack for me and nothing else.  His future and present were mine as well.  I grab him back up and quickly peel the rest of my sweet fruit.  His legs and feet were positively delicious.  He has a beautiful body as he stands on the counter in only his underwear and a jock strap: muscular arms and chest and a six pack.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the back of his jock strap and snap it back, sending him reeling.  His ass is bright red when I take his pants off, but it's still muscular and I still want a taste.  I rub his chest and stomach, molesting him as I say how tasty he is and how thankful I am that he wasted all that time in the gym just for my scrumptious pleasure.  He cries softly and I nibble his butt and suck his nipples.  His cock is erect even though I know he's trying not to be turned on.     I almost wish I had saved him a bit longer to fuck the next shrunken straight jock I got.  He's a straight boy which makes it all the hotter.  But he's absolutely mouthwatering so there's no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab a little Hershey's syrup, squirt it into a bowl, and then dunk Brady in head first.  He's dripping with the gooey chocolate and my tongue once again lolls out in anticipation.  I lap up at his face, the sweet chocolate melding nicely with his sweat, tears, and supple meaty skin.  He's well groomed which I like.  Soon I can't wait any longer and I shove his whole head in, his face pressed against my tongue and I suck almost hard enough for his head to be sucked off.  His lungs empty from the pressure.  Eventually I remove him and dunk him one last time.  I eye my chocolate covered boy once more and hear his faint wimper as I lap up chocolate from his ass, chest, and legs.  I lick his entire back in long motions and then drop him in face first once more.  I suck him in so that only his kicking legs and muscular chocolatey ass are protruding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wink at his kicking beefy feet.  truth be told as much as I love the taste, I also love the feeling of the little guys as they slide down my throat and knock on the walls of my stomach with tiny fists as they slowly dissolve into nothingness.  </span></div></div>",

You remove the plastic lid and notice something rather strange, the foil seal has numerous holes punched in it.

I believe I purchased this container and everything in it.\"  Andy manages to climb onto the rim of the tennis ball tube and leap to the table surface.  As he attempts to run away you pluck him up effortlessly pinching him on the collar of his tiny polo.  As his feet kick helplessly in protest you examine his hot little abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime your eye also catches a small slip of paper in the tube.  You use your free hand to remove and open it.  It reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Purchaser:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a great fan of Novak Djokovic.  I could think of no greater gift to him and his game than to eliminate one of his greatest competitors.

Whoa wa wa...\" Phelps protests are momentarily stopped as the white light beneath his size 14 flip flops changes from white to green.  Disorientation overcomes him as his feet leave the ground levitated by some invisible force.  Feeling weightless, Phelps begins to do what comes naturally to him, swim.  He kicks and strokes in vain for a couple of moments when suddenly his feet begin to tingle.  Looking down in horror he sees his flip flops drop to the platform and jeans cuffs devoid of ankles or feet.  \"What the fuck!  What are you doing?!\" He screams and struggles as the device begins to erase his fingers just as it has his toes.  He blacks out as the device swallows what remains of his chest and head.  He senses only darkness....<br>\r\n      Light.  His head is pounding, but he sees light, blurred light... He struggles to move his limbs which feel like they are present. Was this a dream? He ponders as he wiggles his toes and stretches out his limbs... and feels glass.  For a moment he thinks himself still in the chamber.  He jumps to his feet to discover he is quite wrong.<br>\r\n     The crazy toy maker's face now looms massively before him, distorted by the bend in the glass.

You can't get away with this!!!\"<br>\r\n     The toy maker laughs at the handsome little dude's protests.  \"I'm afraid the device only works the one way.  Besides, my client paid far too much to have you returned to your freedom.  Now, let's get you suited up and ready for delivery!\"  The toy maker allows Michael to pace back in forth plotting an impossible escape from the jar like enclosure while he leaves the room.  A few minutes later he returns with a box professionally labeled with MICHAEL PHELPS in block lettering and a photo of the swimmer.  Michael tries to run when the glass container is lifted, but the toy maker's hand easily grabs the little swimmer by a foot and deposits him in the cardboard container. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite simple, you just step into the chamber, it scans you and makes you into a doll.\" The technician shows Tom some examples including a very realistic Ryan Lochte doll boxed up and ready for shipping. \"This is so cool!\" Tom can barely contain his excitement. Will I need to take my clothes off? He smiles a bit as if he would like the opportunity. \"No need Tom, just step up and the machine will take care of the rest.\" The technician opens the clear door and ushers Tom into the machine. Tom bounds up onto the platform and lets the technician close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looks around the well lit chamber and rocks back and forth on his Neo sneakers. \"How long will the process take? Do I need to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician pretends not to hear Tom as he works at the consul and hits a final button. The door of the chamber locked closed and Tom looked a bit nervous at the sound. The machine made a crescendo as its mechanism energized. \"Uh... is this how the machine is supposed to work? Isn't it supposed to scan me or something?\" Tom's voice sounded a bit concerned. With a bright flash Tom disappeared. The technician looked to his right where a smaller chamber identical to the first flashed Tom back into being. Tom looked disoriented... then he saw the large technician standing over the chamber. \"Uh... what just happened? Are you bigger?... wha.....\"  The technician opened the door... \"Uh Tom guy... we had a slight glitch... you feel ok?\" The technician's feigned concern seemed to convince the shaken little diver. \"This is totally terrifying! You've got to get me back to normal!\" Tom stepped out of the chamber onto the desk surface his brown eyes wide as he scanned the giant world around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Tom, of course. I know this is a little awkward, but I need you to slip out of your clothes... they won't be able to join you on your return to full size... I am sorry for any inconvienence this may cause.\" The technician came down to Tom's level as he spoke delivering his lines with expert skill.. \"This is completely unacceptable!\" Tom's usual cheerful tone turned to snideness as he pryed off his sneakers removed his shirt and jeans. \"I am sorry Tom, but you are going to need to loose the briefs and socks as well.\" Tom made a protesting grunt, but complied. \"This had better be quick I have practice later today.\" \"Yes, of course Tom we'll have this whole thing finished in time for lunch\" The tech smiled and pointed to his sandwich on the desk nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stepped back into the chamber.. he didn't trust the tech, but he didn't have much choice at this point... they would certainly be hearing from his lawyer he thought to himself as he heard the chamber door clicked closed. The machine hummed to life once more Tom closed his eyes anticipating the flash. The first time Tom didn't notice a difference immediately after the transformation, but this time was different. He was laying down... and something covered his body that felt like leaves... \"Wha... what is this... what happened!?\" Tom wriggled under the mass of the green and red materials that pressed him down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what did I tell you! All ready for lunch!\" The tech looked down at his sandwich, now bedecked with a meaty little British diver! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God... this is insane... I want to be put back to normal! You put me back at once!!!\" Tom looked around and teared up a bit as he found himself unable to lift the heavy rye bread and giant vegetables that covered him. The tech lifted his Tom Daley sandwich upward slowly savering every moment. He gave Tom's twirling feet a sniff and a lick causing them to curl in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tasty!\" The tech's eyes rolled back as he dug into his lunch. Tom's protests became muffled as he disappeared between parted lips. Like a bit of undercooked stringy bacon Tom found himself pulled free of the remaining sandiwhich bread but lodged. waist deep in the tech's mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom could see through the dim light of the technician's mouth... he cried out in horror and reached out desperately to reverse the repugnant trend his fingers slipping off the giant's molars! He cried out, covered in thick gooey saliva. The mouth opened slightly giving Tom a moment's hope only feel something pushing hard on the soles of his feet. He was completely inside now. He struggled in vain as the massive tongue pushed him around the warm hot cave. At one point he landed with his back on one of the molars.. his eyes went wide as the white teeth above began to close down on him. With a roll he avoided the teeth. He reached out in the dark.. and triggered the swallow reflex... \"Ahhhh ahhhh.... *gulp*\" Tom slid helplessly down the smooth slimy tube of the esophagus into the darkness below. He arrived head first into the stomach... \"Ahhhhh *splash*!!!!\" The air was hot and acrid burning his nostrils....looking around he could see the chamber of the stomach in a very dim light.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The room was a kitchen well lit but less than inside the box. The 4 remaining boys scurred around the box looking for a way out.

With thumb and forefinger the massive man easily freed the tiny arrogant man of his sneakers and with a second tug removed Ryan's t-shirt. The giant held the removed clothing in one hand and the hot swimmer in other. With a casual toss the shoes and shirt landed back in the box in front of the other tiny jocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guy! Let ..... me .... go!\" Ryan kicked on in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish Mr. Lochte ... as you wish\" the giant released his grip allowing gravity to have it's way with the tiny olympic beef cake. \"Whoa!!!!!! *splash*\" Ryan fell feet first into a large cocktail glass. Ryan's skills kicked in instantly as he surfaced and made a mad swim for the glass's edge. As he achieved his goal he shrieked in the realization he was being lifted towards the giant's lips. \"Shit man! ...\" he used his powerful body to make for the opposite side of the glass as it began to tilt the flavorful liquid now entering the mouth of the giant. Ryan wimpered as he swam against the powerful current. \"No nooooooo!\" Ryan's muscular form disappeared between the massive lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan held his breath as he slid helplessly between the massive lips. Dim light allowed Ryan to see where he was. As the drink continued on its journey into the unthinkable Ryan found himself pinned between the giant's massive tongue and the roof of his mouth. Ryan pushed against the rough surface of the tongue trying to make progress towards the dim light making a silhouette of the giant's massive teeth. Ryan struggled in vain but just as he thought he was about to slide down the tongue into the darkness he found himself plucked out of the giant's mouth. \"Oh god, oh god... please please\" Ryan whimpered defeated as he found himself dangled before the giant's face, the familiar smelling breath baring down on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan you are very tasty! I just wanted to let you know before... well you know... \" the giant smacked his lips and rubbed his stomach indicating Ryan's fate. \"Ah fuck no no !\" Ryan kept muttering and whimpering as he found himself flipped head over heels returning him to the giant's mouth. He struggled a bit more eventually finding himself holding desperately to the epiglottis. He reached out with is feet to find a secure path out of the mouth only to tickle the back of the giant's throat. \"Oh god oh... \" gulp!

I have money, I can get you anything you need! I like just won an olympic medal.... I will totally give it to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunnar's upward ride came to a stop. He kicked wildly looking into the eyes of the giant who held Gunnar so closely his eyes crossed slightly. The giant held Gunnar there for what felt like an eternity when Gunnar regained his voice. \"Uh does this mean I can g......\" before he could finish his words he found himself kissed by two massive lips then tossed into the air high above the giant's head. He screamed out as he fell but went silent as he passed between the giant's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, Jimmy, and Brock watched in horror as Gunnar disappeared. The giant's closed mouth seemed to still be holding something. As the massive face returned to the opening of the room his closed lips formed an evil toothless smile and with a spitting sound a pair of slacks, a blue shirt and Gunnar's remaining loafer landed saliva soaked before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boy's are good eating!\" the giant chuckled his booming voice vibrating the room that held the remaining Olympic boys and a rapist who had not served his time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Conger and Jimmy Feigen looked at each other and the clothing remains of their partners in crime from Rio... \"Please don't eat us! Please don't eat us!\" the two men cried out leaping over a cowering Brock to put themselves in a corner of the box. They sought shadow but, of course there was none in the well lit enclosure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy watched Jack disappear into the darkness and as before Jack's white jeans, shirt and boat shoes plunked down without their owner. Jimmy's eyes teared up at the loss of his last friend and soon the giant's hand returned for him. The giant quickly plucked off Jimmy's suit and then set him down on a nearby shelf... next to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Oh my God you're alive! Like maybe the others are too!\" Jimmy's heart still raced but he felt a glimmer of hope that he and his buddies would be returned to their homes naked but alive the victims of a cruel prank. Jack did not respond right away but stared into the distance. \"Jimmy what was that mojito like drink we had at the party... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh I think they called it a Caipirinha... why?\" Jimmy didn't like the look in Jack's eyes. \"Dude why do I smell that drink right...\" Both men screamed out as the shelf beneath them retracted into the wall causing them to fall downward into a massive blender pitcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude this is a Caipirinha!\" Jimmy and Jack shivered as they tried to swim between the ice cubes towards the edge of the massive glass container. As they reached the edge they saw the giant moving his finger towards one of the buttons. \"Ah shit dude no!!!!!\" The roar of the motor was intense but the liquid moved only slightly. The two boys tread against the swirling current. \"I think I can do this!\" Jimmy held on to optimism for but one more instant before the giant triggered the next speed on the blender raising the pitch of the roaring machine. \"Oh shit bro this is not good! Oh fuck...\" Jack did his most powerful crawl occasionally drawing some of the potent drink into his mouth. The next button was activated and it was too much Jack watched in horror as Jimmy disappeared into the drink and he found himself swimming in a blended drink with one more ingredient. With the push of the blend button Jack finally lost the fight and cried out as the blender found his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant allowed the blender to run a bit longer then finished off his Olympic treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned his attention to Brock... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

May I take your photo?\" some guy, looked like a reporter, held a digital camera awaiting Kayne's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not.\" Kayne's response was calm and confident. He loved his own body and thought 'Why not share a little bit of my sexy body with the less fortunate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter nodded focused the lens and pushed the button. It was broad daylight, but nonetheless the area was lit with a blinding flash. The \"reporter\" whistled merrily as he lifted a single smoking flip flop from the pavement, placed it in the now owner-less gym bag, and took it to his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"reporter\" was of course nothing of the sort. He worked for a special business that collected celebrities and turned them into bite sized toys for wealthy clients. His car buzzed through Gold Coast to the airport where a private plane awaited him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn flight the collector flipped though his \"photographs.\" Jordan Rapana's cocky smile looked back as as well as a few surfers the collector planned to add to his personal collection; sort of a job benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and licked his lips as the fasten seatbelt light came on. While clients throughout the world purchased these little morsels there was only one processing center. All was secret of course and to break that secret was not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car at the airport rushed the collector and his special \"camera' through the streets of the city and through the gates of Mini-Dude Toys. Retina scanners, thumb print identification etc. were used to verify him. He pulled a chip from his \"camera\" and inserted it into a large gray machine in the middle of a large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine sprung to life. The main computer began to hum as conveyor belt lit up revealing a row of 5 inch tall plastic jars capped with holed screw-top lids. Like a milk bottler the conveyor moved the jars along. Instead of liquid the tip of a device above the jars glowed blue and with each pulse a small figure appeared in the jar below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He recalled that the little guy had a California accent. There was no time for play, but it was important to test this batch of captives to make sure the process was free of glitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist of the jar lid and a break of the seal the little dude came to life. He had long somewhat curly blond hair and wore a pair of black board shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! this is fucked up!\" The little man looked around his glass prison in wonder. It seemed from his half smile that he didn't believe what he saw was real. The collector loved this part. He crouched down by the conveyor to examine his little captive. Just as he remembered the cute little man had blond hair and blue eyes. He was of medium height and had relatively small feet even when he was full sized.  Tiny particles of sand littered the bottom of the jar as he walked around testing the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector would have loved to play with his new toy, but there was no time. Paying clients awaited the receipt of their little rugby players. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little surfer dude's cocky smile melted the instant the collector's hand tilted the jar slightly causing him to fall towards the juncture between the floor and the wall. With two fingers the collector managed to take hold of the waist of the board shorts giving dude a killer wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What the fuck!  Let me go!\" usually a lover of extreme experiences the little fella, Jordan was his name, didn't care much for this one. The collector eyed his little morsel for a moment. He wore a necklace and ankle bracelets. The bite sized man yelled in protest as he was deposited unceremoniously on the surface of the giant's tongue. The collector clenched the guy's muscular little torso between his teeth and tugged at the legs of the board shorts. With a faint riiiiip the little shorts were liberated from the young man's tasty body.  The sensation of the surfer's plump little feet was amazing as they were used to push him further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a gulp it was over.

Tim try to cover his eyes, but his arms were pinned to his side as he was traped in the large Chinese palm. The man smiled greatly as he placed the little 4' American jock right in front of his huge face. Tim manged to free one of his arms from the tight grip. As the man brought Tim up to his face the little jock pounded the giant's nose and lips. Again and again the little stud whaled on the giant's nose. Tim was awesome in his power the guy had 24' arms and could lift over 500lbs, but to the giant the little man's punches were the mere swat of a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The Chinese man said, \"Lets see little one just how good do you taste.\" The giant tongue laps out and slurps siliva all over the tiny jock's bod. The huge tongue lashes siliva  all over Timmy's head wetting the boy's head and face. Tim cries, \"nooooo, dam it, stop......\". The giant man replied, \"now little one shhhh and be a good boy while I taste your muscular, little American body. slurpppp....\". Tim's new giant master went on with his licking and tasting of his little American toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The giant made Timmy sit in his palm as he proceeded to undress the little jock out of his uniform. Tim could do nothing as the giant pulled of his shoes, pants, and jersey. Timmy was now sitting in the giant's hand in just his little white jock strap. The evil giant looked down wickedly at his tiny prize. Tim once again said, \"Please sir stop, don't hurt me any....... nooooo!!\" As the massive giant tongue came down once again and covered the little jock from head to toe. The tongue slavered poor little Tim's manly chest and ran up and down the little jock's back. The giant brought down his index finger over Timmy pushing the little man down as the huge tongue licked over Timmy's crotch and up his beautiful ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Tim yelped as he felt the massive wet tongue cover his crotch and swirl up his big jock but. The Chinese giant even got playful as he pinched Timmy's butt between his to fingers. The boy yelped again as he reacted to the giant pinch. The massive giant just chuckled as the boy screamed and kicked at the giant tongue. The Chinese giant was in heaven as he finished the little man's bath. The fun was just beginning for the giant and the terror was just beginning for his little American, jock, boytoy!</span></div></div>",

Thoughts of lust an hunger mixed in the Asian's mind as he continued to finger the little hunk's ass.

The giant held his little toy under the arms as he smelled and took an occasional lick of the tiny butt. Again Timmy protested as he felt the huge tongue probe deeply into his steaming ass. Timmy cried. \"nooo stop, please...\" as the tongue probed and licked deep into his butt and up to his prostrate. The giant leaped in joy when he found out that his last lick caused Timmy to spurt out another glop of by cum. Quickly he turned the handsome little man around and licked clean the cum off the boy's muscular little bod. The giant was happy, butt he noticed his little toy was getting more depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The giant man looked down at his litle prisoner and said, \"Awhhh little one you look so unhappy, but I know what will cheer you up\"! He quickly lowered Timmy down and placed him on his giant brown cock. The giant chuckled and said, \" come now tiny one bounce on your new toy, bounce and play little one play with my large happy cock\"!

The giant's cum sauce was all over the place including on the tiny man that was spread out exhausted on the huge dick.Tim cried and try to wipe off thick goo that now covered his bod from head to feet. The boy tried to get up and climb off the penis, but he slipped in the slimy, thick goo. Unable to get up the tiny man was beginning to stick to the Asian's dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Watching the muscle boy slip and stick to the dick was much fun for the giant, but he wanted more than play he wanted to taste his human prize.  The Chinese man reached over to his dresser were he had put some sauces that he brought from the kitchen. Without warning the Asian giant had pored several glops of orange sauce onto the little American. The tiny American football player coughed and tried to shake the sauce from his bod, but it was useless he was now covered in Asian cum and orange sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Thankfully the Asian man was somewhat of extorsionist as he bent his head down and over his penis. As Tim looked up he saw a enormas tongue come down upon his back. \"Slurp....! Lick....!\" the sounds of licking and sucking filled the room as the American jock got a tongue bath and the Chinese giant got to taste a muscular and tender piece of jock meat.

His head still soaked in dressing he looked at his capture for what would be the last time. The giant's face loomed before him and on it there wore a delighted grin. The grin transformed into an opening as Timmy's oily little head drew near. \"Oh God, Oh God Please No Nooooooo emph!\" Timmy's voice turned to muffled noises as he became lodged in the giant's cavernous mouth. Sucking and slurping the giant savored poor Timmy for what seemed like an eternity. Gradually Timmy slid further into the giant's oral cavity until only his two plump muscular legs remained. The chop sticks now withdrawn the giant pushed slownly on Timmy's once size 14 feet feeling the little man wriggling.<br>\r\n    Then it happened. Timmy hit the wrong spot in the back of the giant's throat and the swallow reflex ingadged. Within seconds the flailing legs were reduced to the soles of two yummy looking feet.... and then he was gone.<br>\r\n    The giant took a gulp of beer as he continued to feel the wonderful butterflies caused by the jock within.  The next day the Giant framed his prized memory. Timmy's uniform down to the shoes where mounted under glass.   </span></div></div>",

The Chinese giant chuckled and began his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst he plucked and peeled Tim out of his little clothes against the tiny man's struggles. His tennis shoes were pulled free. With a flick of the finger his belt buckle was loose. In a desparate attempt to stop his fate Tim grabbed ahold of the waist of his jeans. With a chuckle the giant lifted Tim upward and held him up to his face, bouncing Tiim up and down by the cuffs of his jeans. With a yelp Tim's hand's gave to the force and with a plunk he landed in the soft palm of the massive man. With fingers pinched on either side of his Gator's t-shirt the giant pulled it free revealing Tim's meaty torso. Lifting the little man beneath the arms the giant finished the stripping process plucking free Tebow's little black socks and boxer briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never get away with this!!!!\" Tim finaly found his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant did not acknowledge his captive's protest, instead he plunked Tim back into his glass container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim stared on with continued concern as the giant combined:\u00bd egg white, 1 Tablespoon cornstarch, \u00bd teaspoon salt, 1 Tablespoon rice wine, \u00bc teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a tall clear glass bowl. Tim ran for the opposite side of his little glass container as the giant proceeded to grab him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will make a delicous cashew shrimp! The man said with excitement as he licked his lips and rubbed his stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shook his head in protest \"you can't do this!! Oh Jesus.... please don't let this happen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh the Chinese man responded \"Oh lord, thank you for this meal I am about to recieve.

Instead of spending his birthday with his girlfriend or all his friends parting down he was spending it dying on a hot grill in Chinatown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The giant Chinese Chef was laughing as he saw Drew moan and struggle under the mountain of onions.

Grilled vegies and slices of oranges were placed all around the boy's partially grilled body. Drew was the centerpiece of a  grilled masterpiece. The asian Giant who had brought Drew Weatherford in never thought that he would turn out so tastey. The giant droped his head down right over Drew's bod and sniffed at the little boy meat. Drew was not dead as he lifted hid head looked at the giant and said, \"Noooo.... please... Noooooo!\" The giant smiled and poked at little Drew's cock. The giant finger began to rub and massage the little blond stud's cock. With in seconds the boy was stiff and spurting his last cum all over his belly and legs. The giant laughed as his massive finger began to smear the boy cum all over Drew's naked legs, crotch, belly and chest. The giant said, \" Yum that will give you just the final touch. There is nothing better than jock covered in his own boy sauce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The giant lifted the dish with Drew on his bed of rice up to his massive face, Drew was struggling to get up, but the little jock was to tired and to weak to get away he was doomed. The giant Asian said, \" Goodbye my sweet little football toy, its time to die!\" Drew screamed as the plate was tiled and he slid down the bed of rice and into the huge gapping maw of the Asian giant. As Drew fell half way into thee mouth he squirmed as the giant sucked on Drew legs and butt. The boy's legs and but were in the mouth as his upper half fought and struggled to get free. Slowly the giant slurped and swallowed the cute tiny football player. Drew Weatherford left out one tiny last scream that was cut off when he was swallowed whole and droped down the Asian Giant's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The last that we ever saw of Drew Weatherford was his muscular tiny body slideing down the throat of a giant Asian nerd.

As he drunkenly leered at the big screen he saw the most beautifully manly football player he ever saw.

He truely was every gay Asian man's dream. The nerd bragged to the others in the bar how much he would  love to fuck the handsome Bill's LB. The Asian finally got him self kicked out of the bar, but not before a strange man at the end of the bar over heared the Asians love for the football player. That strange man would be the one who would send a now shrunken Paul Posluszny all wrapped up to the Asian nerd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The nerd opened the box carefully and unwrapped his tiny NFL football doll. Paul was dressed in his home uni. He had a clean blue jersey on a pair of tight, white football pants. The Asian could not help but notice how the tight, white pants made Paul's ass look like a pair of plump Polish Hams! Now the Asian nerd knew that Paul was a Polish/American and that was very nice. The Asian always thought that these Polish guys were so cute with their baby faces and studly bodies. As the Asian picked Paul up and into his massive hand he saw that the handsome tiny football boy was still asleep. The Asian thought it was time to wake the little muscle boy up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The giant nerd first took shook the tiny man which at first stired the tiny man awake, but he needed to do more. The Asian decided to take Paul's tiny shoes off and out came the huge, wet, sticky Asian tongue. The Asian licked gingerly at the tiny man's sweet feet. Paul began to chuckle as he laughed at the tickling sensation on his feet. Paul laughed and struggled in the mighty grip until he opened his eyes and saw that he was looking right into the eyes and mouth of some giant Asian guy. Paul screams, \"Noooooo! Christ!! Nooooo!\" The helpless squeaky cries coming from the tiny football player made the Asian nerd giggle. He now had a tiny NFL linebacker in his grasp and in the privacy of his dorm room.

Paul quickly grabbed the rope and figured he could swing his way over to a near by cabinet and climb down it to make his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   What Paul did not realize is that the rope was not a rope, but a spider's web. As Paul garbed the rope he swang away looking just like Tarzan swinging threw the jungle. Paul was happy the nerd was distracted and he was making his great escape. All was going well until Paul tried to let go of the rope and found that his hands and naked legs were now stuck to the sticky rope. Instead of heading downward Paul was being lifted upwards. The rope that he was stuck on was being lifted upwards and when Paul looked up he was terrified by what he saw. The rope and Paul was being hoisted upwards by a massive hairy spider in it's web. The big ugly house spider had set out fishing lines in hopes of snatching some insect prey, but it caught some thing that no spider had ever caught before, a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Paul screamed as the huge spider pulled the tiny man up to it's web of death, The boy was stuck and was facing a horrible death. Just as the massive spider pulled tiny Paul into it's sticky web......</span></div></div>",

You own him from head to delicous toe and a conversation would not be interesting. With your thumb and forefinger you reach over and pull free his right shoe. You marvel as his plump little toes curl inside of his thin socks in response to their liberation. With dramatic pause you bring the dislodged footware and bring it to your nose... the scent is delightful! \"Dude! Put back my fucking shoe!\" Kris is arrogant even in his bitesized form... you poke him in the tummy and smile. Setting the shoe on a nearby shelf you force Kris's sock covered foot into your mouth. It bursts with flavor! He protests and struggles... in vain of course. He lets off a final yell as you pull his foot free of your mouth.... minus one black sock. His eyes go wide as he spies your tongue and his missing sock. With a swallow his understanding of the situation changes completely.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What is this?!\" Lonzo Ball looked around the very dark surroundings of the materialization chamber with confusion until he spied the giant face looking back at him then he looked with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness! We I thought you were going to get lost during transmission!\" The giant spoke as though everything was quite normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do to me!?\" Lonzo stepped back only to find himself pinned against the infinitely black surface of the chamber. The giant looked concerned about Lonzo's reaction. \"I have observed that many of you get confused just after transport. You should not have felt any pain. Did you feel any pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLonzo took in what the giant asked... \"Man, what the hell did you do to me!? I need to get back to training. Is this some sort of illusion or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant smiled a wide grin. \"Oh no Lonzo! I am afraid your training days are over. I used a drone and shrank you to a fraction of your original height. You and I are going to play for a while, then I am going to eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way man!! This is nuts!\" Lonzo made a dash for the front of the chamber and escape. The giant watched the tiny basketball star leap off the stage of the chamber with delight and make his way across the counter. Lonzo darted back and forth defensively, it looked like part of his basketball training, then darted towards and edge. The hot little guy stopped to peer over the edge to the long drop below then reversed course finally diving behind a bowl of fruit placed against a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I a so glad that you are up for play!\" The giant sounded excited at the game of cat and mouse. He lifted the bowl and winked at the cowering 3 inch tall jock. \"Keep it up little man, maybe I won't eat you after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLonzo driven by instinct and fear darted down the counter along the wall until he spied a small hole. As he attempted to squeeze in he discovered to his terror that he couldn't get all the way in. The giant casually reached down and pulled off the tiny basketball player's purple sneaker and plucked away his tiny sock. Lonzo looked on in horror as the giant sniffed his footwear and set it aside. \"I hope you taste as good as you smell Lonzo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant walked away and pretended to loose interest. After a while Lonzo decided to make another attempt at escape. He ran awkwardly with only one sneaker on across the counter towards a telephone cord that he hoped would deliver him to freedom. As he stepped over the edge of the counter and began to make his way down he saw the giant waiting below with a wide grin. \"Oh no man oh no!\" Lonzo attempted to climb back up but the giant quickly grabbed him and lifted him up for inspection. </span></div></div>",

Standing there at Barnes and Noble, staring at the periodical section, the word just popping out at me, I had to scratch my head.  The dumbfounded response was so cartoony, but that\u2019s what I did.  God help me I was young, and foolish, and\u2026 suddenly very hungry.  It just made no sense.  Wouldn\u2019t anyone who read it be a reader- simply by definition?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect I realize that it was not a cover article of a newspaper.  It was not a command from the government, or a survey of numerous readers.  It was merely a publication titled \u201cReader\u2019s Digest Kids.\u201d  Funny how a simple mistake in punctuation or a sticker in the wrong spot on a magazine\u2019s cover can lead to such travesty.  For five youths it did at least... And who am I kidding, a handful more over the years.  But don\u2019t paint me as some kind of monster.  Remember, I was young and inn- I almost said \u201cInnocent\u201d.  Ha.  Well I was young.  I\u2019m still young.  I consider myself young at least.  Maybe it wasn\u2019t so long ago after all.  Regardless it was far enough in the past that the publication is no longer called \u201cReader\u2019s Digest Kids\u201d.  First they added \u201cEdition\u201d after the \u201cKids\u201d, a stipulation of the lawsuit perhaps, not that this was any help to those youngsters or their friends and families.  Then they added a colon between \u201cDigest\u201d and \u201cKids\u201d.  That was after the second incident I think.  I don\u2019t know.  In those early days of being a giant I had so many lawsuits and blamed so many others (just to keep myself innocent in the eyes of the law) that I can\u2019t keep them all straight.  It wasn\u2019t until later that I learned the art of never getting caught!  Whatever the case, the magazine said \u201cReaders Digest Kids\u201d with no apostrophe, no colon, no \u201cedition\u201d, and no clarifications.  I didn\u2019t need to be told twice.  I wasn\u2019t looking for trouble, having ignored the command of the red-lettered title.  I certainly didn\u2019t want to be left out if so many others were digesting kids!  If I have committed any crime it is that and that alone- being a follower of fads and wanting to stay ahead of the trends.  The magazine said it, and news, or advice, or survey, or law\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter!  True, I could have thought they were referencing baby goats, but that\u2019s besides the point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here was the problem: I had never been a fan of veal.  (And I don\u2019t mean the beef, although I have always avoided that as well.  Those poor little calfs!!!)  I found the prospect of eating anyone before they were in the prime of their life utterly unsporting, horrid, and in bad taste\u2026 or that\u2019s what I originally thought.  It was unsporting because they were too dumb to have any real fighting chance.  After all, kidnappers, the lowest of the low, are able to abduct these guys!  It would be like stealing candy from a- well I guess more like stealing a baby from- making a baby into candy\u2026?  They weren\u2019t babies or anything though.  It\u2019s just a saying.  It was horrid because they hadn\u2019t even had the time to face the trials and tribulations of real life.  And it was in bad taste because, let\u2019s face it, the middle, end, and right after puberty is when guys are at their tastiest.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s those juicy muscles, or the hormones, or the sudden growth which gives you so much more meat\u2026 sorry, I\u2019m trying to stay focused.  No more exposition.  Whatever the case, despite my reservations I was willing to try.  Hey, I just realized!  They don\u2019t even have an \u201cReader\u2019s Digest: Kids Edition\u201d anymore!  I guess they finally learned their lesson and gave up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I thought would be the toughest part, ended up being the easiest.  I had elected to find the morsels which appeared closest to their older counterparts.  Searching the internet was like browsing a gold mine, not even for gold, but for a gold mine!  It was all around!  The inventions of instagram, steroids, and the \u2018bro mentality\u2019 was a vore-enthusiast\u2019s wet dream!  Everywhere guys were posting pictures of themselves, scantily clad, dripping with sweat, showing off their meaty bodies!  It was like the entire internet was one giant menu for man meat!  There were groups dedicated solely to those I was looking for!  Teen boys with bodies of men ten years their senior littered my news feed.  It took awhile to narrow my selection to the five I wanted to try, a shorter while to find them, an even shorter while to shrink, and no time at all to put them in my meal tank at the kitchen counter, barren of all former occupants for tonight\u2019s dinner.  Those who had been there were carefully put away elsewhere so as not to get jealous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part about these tasty treats was their size.  Yes, they were bulging with muscle, but they weren\u2019t as long as my usual delicacies, a fact which proved favorable to all involved.  I didn\u2019t need to cut anyone, or chew, or bite.  Preparation was much simpler than ever before, and I told them such.  They still clung to each other, sobbing, pleading, screaming, but I think I calmed them with a few pets from my gigantic fingers and soothing words about their slow digestion in my roiling gut.  I reminded them that they had obviously volunteered for this by increasing the progression of their bodies to such a degree and then posting those mouthwatering pictures for people to drool over.  As they were too simple to understand I informed them they would not be tortured physically or sexually which somehow only increased their fear.  Strange little creatures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jakub_fabry/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/jakub_fabry/</a> Wasting no more time I reached in and pulled out my first morsel.  Jakub was pale and blonde with a constant bitchy face, perhaps accentuated by his prominent eyebrows and snub nose.  His tiny ears and beady eyes made me think of a buff chipmunk.  Jakob was lithe, with bulging biceps, an obvious six pack, and an hourglass figure that girls would be jealous of.  His chest was less pronounced than one would expect but his ropey muscled legs were nothing to gawk at.  I think it was his strange haircut which stood out to me most.  The sides were shaved but the top was fluffy and quaffed to one side.  He screamed and cried and begged, as did the others, but I quickly grew accustomed to the usual sound of my meals paid his squeaks no more mind, deciding instead to enjoy my meal.  A glass of merlot was poured and a candle lit in my intimate dinner for one\u2026 er six.  Sampling his smooth flesh first with my nose, then my finger, and then my tongue, I slowly traced his entire outline, tasting the salty muskiness I had grown to love, but something altogether new to my palate.  There was a distinct sweetness and a hint of fruitiness I had never experienced with my older morsels.  Smacking my lips and humming to myself, his whole body shaking from the cold air and the vibrations of my \u201cmmm\u201ds, I decided to make my first dish a soup.  To keep him warm I stuffed his entire body into my mouth so suddenly my closed soft lips didn\u2019t even need to stifle the scream.  It never left his little lungs.  Sucking and slurping on my meal, my tongue dancing over his mouth watering toned body, I heated the broth, cut the vegetables, and danced around to the agony of my other morsels who watched with wide, fearful, doe eyes.  My stale, humid breath danced around Jakub\u2019s body, enveloping him in it\u2019s dankness, and pushing down into his every orifice as he sputtered for breath, battling the tongue that continued to batter him around like a bull to it\u2019s rider.  Every once in awhile I pushed him to the back of my throat for a quick view at his ultimate fate, letting the spit accumulate there before swallowing it down as a preview of his own destiny.  At once his eyes were blinded by the sudden light and fresh air, only to be dropped into the steaming broth below.  He instantly turned as red as a lobster and began treading water rather than have to sit on the bottom where the fire made it hottest.  Bubbled exploded in his face until I set it to simmer and reached in for the next treat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the struggling young man between my thumb and forefinger my tongue lolled out against my command and saliva began leaking onto my shirt.  Broad with tanned skin, sand-colored hair, veiny arms, and a chest and eight pack that was so contoured I could feel each ridge even with my gigantic padded fingers.  Again I licked the taste off of his entire body before slowly sucking on both of his proportionally tiny by nonetheless meaty feet.  My tongue tickled each sole and worked in between every perfect plump toe.  Moving over to the counter I prepared for Carter\u2019s dish.  The work was slow at first, but that just gave me more time to taste Carter\u2019s supple body and delicious flesh, my tongue snaking all over and under him.  When I was ready I lay Carter down on the chopped meat concoction and began kneading him into it.  He looked up fearfully, and completely helpless, probably for the first time in the stud\u2019s life\u2026 and certain to be the last time.  The tasty little Swedish meatball looked perfect.  His head stuck out one end, his hands spread out on the sides, and those delectable feet twirled around below.  Placing him on a tray I put it in the oven to get it golden brown, closing it behind him after an air kiss and wave goodbye,then set the timer.  The heat was low enough to make him a fraction of a shade darker, but not enough to kill him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxdumenko/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/maxdumenko/?hl...</a>  Max was taken out next, leaving the last two lads hugging one another in the tank.  Clearly the youngest of the group, Max had a button nose, olive skin, and a baby face.  His tight lips were pursed between two chipmunk cheeks and his dirty blonde hair was completely buzzed on one side, leaving a permanent quaffed bowl cut on the other.  That\u2019s where I started the tasting.  The soft locks cushioned my fleshy and spongy taste buds while the prickly buzzed side tickled me to no end.  I cannot recommend this haircut enough to those who like textured meals!  Look for them in schools, malls, parks, and anywhere that attracts edgey delinquents!  He inadvertently flexed his arms in his discomfort, causing me to stop licking his head and suck both muscley arms into my mouth like wet noodles, sucking so hard I was about to slurp them clean off his shoulders.  His fingers tried in vain to grip something, merely grazing the tip of my tongue.  This little lad avoided a fate worse than all the others combined.  Nowadays I have a special spit to roast my delectable boys.  Both ends detach so that I can rope the middle up the butt, through the intestines, into the stomach, up the throat, and out the mouth, almost like the cameras used in endoscopies and colonoscopies, except those don\u2019t go nearly as far obviously.  Reattaching each side to the stick allows you to have a kebab without killing the little treat.  It is unbelievably uncomfortable and the lad can barely breathe, plus the stomach acid slowly trickles into the other organs as the valves are forced open by the stick, but by the time they begin digesting themself they\u2019re already being digested by me as well.  Back then I only had a regular skewer which would impale the tasty delicacies from the butt up through the mouth, piercing everything in its path and killing them much quicker.  Luckily for Max, it was still in the wash from an entire soccer team I.  I had pierced all of their chests, lining them up, and then slowly cooked them over a fire as they bled out.  I liked blood more back then\u2026 And I didn\u2019t like sex stuff as much.  Strange how your tastes change when you get older.  Instead, I found a large meat thermometer, which Max was convinced was about to go into either his flesh or another orifice as he screamed bloody murder.  He was trussed up with some parsley and attached to the thermometer, some pepper, mushroom, onion, tomato, and pineapple pierced above and below him.  The fruit and vegetables were large enough so that when I put him on the grill, no matter which way I turned him, he wouldn\u2019t be burned.  I hate charred meat.  Getting out my marinade and brush I coated the terrified lad until he was glistening with the sweet syrupy stuff, instead of just sweat, saliva, and fear.  Putting the whole mess on the automatically rotating grill, I returned to the tank to choose the penultimate squirming mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rost_17_/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/rost_17_/</a> Rostik, the second youngest was removed from the arms of Ryan, leaving the last little guy all alone.  Despite his age, Rostik was the second biggest, with the manliest face.  Fair skinned with an eight pack and chiseled chest that rivals Carter (makes sense since I found them working out together), Rostik\u2019s brown hair, glistening areolas, and flexible meaty body made him an easy pick.  After seeing his rippling back my tongue immediately starts there, lapping the salty sweetness again and again, slowly rubbing my wet spongy, powerful muscle up and down his arched back.  He struggled so I use one finger to force both of his arms at his side, pushing him hard against my palm with my tongue.  He was incapable of moving anything except his butt which he tries using to nudge my chin off of him to no avail.  Again, this once powerful lad with the world at his large, meaty feet was no match for even my tongue or finger tip!  The smell of him and the others was almost as hypnotically delicious as the taste!  It was a sweaty young man smell with a hint of Axe Body spray and stale mustiness.  Rostik was the easiest boy of the bunch to prepare.  The jumbo shrimp having already been cooked I merely wrapped it around the struggling lad, placing them both atop a pile of zoodles.  It was tight enough that he could struggle all he wanted and not budge an inch.  Additionally, as an added precaution, the bottom of the shrimp covered his feet, making escape impossible.  Ironic, after calling so many newbies at the gym \u201cshrimps\u201d, this swollen \u201cdo you even lift bro\u201d young man, was now a quarter the size of one, and about to be eaten with it.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rch.aesthetics/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/rch.aesthetics...</a> Ryan, the last studly body-fatless ingredient, was crouched in the corner, rocking back and forth in the fetal position.  It would have been adorable if it wasn\u2019t so mouthwateringly scrumptious instead.  He looked like he could have been Rostik\u2019s younger brother, even though he was a year older.  A slightly darker skin tone, caramel colored would be the closest comparison, with less build and more firm tone and a younger face, Ryan was a sight to behold.  Wasting no time I popped the morsel in my mouth, forced him to lie on his stomach, and pushed his little feet with my tongue so that his head was sticking out between my two cushiony lips.  Teasing him a bit in my mouth, unable to control myself, I set to preparing the desert.  Most of it was already done so that I wouldn\u2019t have had to wait for it to set, but there was still a fair amount of prep work, fetching supplies, cleaning, etc.  He was forced to watch as I prepared the dish which was to become his tomb.  Pressing my lips together harder, I stopped him from flailing around so much, concentrating on the desert.  When it was all set up I spat Ryan directly into the center of the congealed chocolate mousse.  Had he had a little more fat on him he may not have sunk so quickly, but thankfully for me for many reasons, he was the perfect specimen of fitness, and he was soon up to his chin the the chocolatey goodness.  Just for fun I pulled him out, gripping only his head between two fingers, and slowly licked the gooey chocolate from his body, sucking the remainder off a moment later.  After putting him back into place I put a dollop of whipped cream on top of his head, a cherry on top of that, and I was done.  He looked like he was wearing the strangest hat in the world, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his ridiculousness, much to his anger.  Amazingly he was the first to get angry, instead of just fear and sobbing of his brethren.  A lick of my lips was all it took to turn that aggression back to catatonic horror.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ringing of several cooking timers, almost simultaneously, told me my dinner was ready.  I set the table quickly, the drool building up at the corners of my mouth once more, put everything on platters, and tucked in.  \u201cI\u2019d thank God for all he has given me, your young lives (and a scrumptious group of boys you are too) in the foreground\u2026 plus the thousands I\u2019ve eaten before you in far more gruesome ways- actually maybe you should be thanking God!  Or thanking me!  Or maybe we\u2019re the same thing.  Hmmm\u2026 That\u2019s a bit of a quandary for you.  You guys praised him on every picture you posted- why do you young weightlifters do that by the way?  Anyway, sorry to ramble on.  I\u2019m just very hungry so I figured I\u2019d get the polite dinner banter over at the beginning.  I don\u2019t like talking with my mouth full anyway.\u201d  The boys looked back at me with hatred and unadulterated horror in their eyes: horror of what I had done in the past, horror at what I had to them, horror at what I was about to do to them, horror that I actually thought they tasted better than any other substance on Earth, and horror that they\u2019d never again experience a happy moment, cool breeze, good workout, high five from a friend, good grade, kiss from their mother\u2019s, etc.  The looks merely whet my appetite more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose I liked tapas before the craze hit.  The little meals, pun intended, made it possible to eat small portions of regular food in between the real meat of the dishes.  I didn\u2019t have to waste time digging through noodles before I found my prize snack, it was right there in front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started with the Jakub soup, and truth be told, it was a little bit too salty for my taste.  The broth was watery rather than creamy, but the flavor was incredible.  After a few slurps and what must have looked like half a ton of vegetables to the frightened youngster, I dipped my spoon directly under his butt, lifting him and some lukewarm broth up to my mouth.  He was sitting with his ass flat on the concave base, feet spread eagle over the sides, but he quickly rolled out of the way before my mouth closed on him and the spoon, landing, with a splash back into my bowl.  With only a few mouthfuls left anyway, I placed my spoon beside the bowl and the relieved meaty teen.  This relief quickly gave way to renewed terror as he felt the entire bowl slowly lift off the table to my waiting supple lips.  The broth washed into my mouth and down my throat in quick swallows while Jakub swam against the current with all the strength he could muster.  Just when he got a foothold on the inside lip of the bowl, as most of the liquid was already gone, I flicked the back with my finger causing Jakub to lose balance and fall straight onto my tongue which immediately retracted into me mouth.  I savored him for a moment, bashing him against my teeth and tongue and bulging in my cheeks, swishing the liquid and coating him in saliva, before tilting my head back and swallowing him whole.  The other boys watched, terrified, as the large lump slowly traveled down my throat and splashed into the acidic goo beneath the surface.  When I burped, the smell of him wafted over the other tiny guys along with the solitary quiet scream of their fellow prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMopping my lips I pushed the bowl aside and turned my attention to the large, round studly Carter-filled swedish meatball amid a forkful of egg noodles.  I poured the sauce directly onto Carters beautiful face, making him sputter and cough before soaking the rest of him and the meatball.  Rather than pierce the meat immediately I played with him a little bit, turning the meatball this way and that, rolling it around the plate with my fork like the Oompa Loompas did to Violet.  His face hit the hard plate as did his hands and feet, all desperately trying to get a grip so he could attempt to waddle away.  As funny as that would have been to see a rumble from my stomach told me Jakub was ready for company.  Carefully, I pierced the meatball, avoiding the delicious center, and heard the tines hit the ceramic on the other side.  Quickly I twirled it around, making Carter visibly dizzy, as I got all of the noodles underneath him.  Putting the whole forkful between my lips I closed my mouth and then retracted the fork, leaving Carter in complete darkness.  I chewed softly, sure to only pinch Carter\u2019s sides and break up the meat.  The meatball had complimented Carter\u2019s flavor impeccably well and I was in food heaven: utter bliss!  Even my eyelids twitched in excitement.  As I chewed some more, grounding the meat into a paste, the young man did his best to avoid my mashing teeth, scared nearly stiffless by their sheer power, capable of turning a morsel like him into mush in mere seconds.  He was momentarily freed from the meat but found his body wrapped tightly around by a noodle.  Smiling at this new development I casually spit out Carter, keeping the end of the noodle in my mouth.  He dangled in the light of the kitchen from my mouth, held only by a long egg noodle which had intertwined itself around his leg.  I swallowed the rest of the mouthful and grabbed the end of the noodle closest to my mouth, pulling it up over my head.  Carter now dangled high above my mouth, slowly being lowered into the black abyss.  My tongue darted out and licked at the soles of his feet before I lifted him up as high as I could.  I began biting the air as hard as I could, making audible snapping sound every time I closed my jaw, once per second.  Each time I opened my mouth I lower Carter a fraction of an inch lower.  It was cruel, I know, but as I say, I was young.  I still played with my food.  Just as I was about to clamp down on Carter\u2019s leg, severing it completely, I again switched tactics and put the end back in my mouth.  Then I sucked.  I slurped the noodle for a good half a minute, very tentatively pulling Carter in closer and closer.  He looked down, or up in this case, past his feet at my pursed lips and saw the strand going in getting smaller and smaller.  Finally he had reached my mouth and kicked feverishly.  This only served to lodge his only free leg into my mouth which I slurped right up.  Then his other leg followed suit.  Soon after he was up to his armpit.  When I close my lips on him one last time I tasted him all over, swirled him around, and gulped him down, noodle and all.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hungry, (after all who wouldn\u2019t be with a meal like this), I put the small plate aside and pulled up a matching one.  Max remained immobile, tied to the meat thermometer with his parsley binds, and trussed like a turkey.  On either end were the fruit and vegetables, but this only served to accentuate that meaty middle, drawing the hungry eye like a magnet.  His skin now tanned, not brown but certainly darker, looked a little flakey, only making him look all the more mouthwateringly scrumptious.  The appetizing little cutie was so tired from the ordeal and the constant rotation that he didn\u2019t even have the energy to scream as I lifted the entire meat thermometer.  Starting with the bottom I ripped off some of the pineapple and tomatoes with my teeth, chewing intentionally audibly and gnawing ravenously.  My vicious teeth gnashing had the desired effect on the three tiny piggies left outside of my roiling gut.  As I chewed I began waving the skewer back and forth over the frightened other boys, stuck in their own dishes.  The air whizzed past Max\u2019s frightened face and he had a hard time catching his breath, but I was having too much fun, and had the tastiest meal in the world in front of me, so I didn\u2019t care in the slightest.  Lifting the thermometer and turning it 90 degrees, angling the point directly down my throat, I lowered it quickly, snatching off the closest vegetable.  I did this again and again until only Max remained, and one or two onion pieces by his delicious pink little feet.  Somehow they didn\u2019t tan as much as the rest of him.  Like a skilled sword swallower I pushed the skewer down again, deep throating the blade and feeling the top of Max\u2019s head tickle my undulating uvula.  I closed my lips just under his foot and pulled out the thermometer, sans the meat.  Still trussed like a turkey with the parsley twine, the little lad wriggled like crazy, his taste positively dancing on my tongue.  The marinade was the perfect accompaniment to his flavor and yet again the sensations were orgasmic.  After sucking all of the marinade off and flicking Max around a few more times I felt his writhing die down, making it clear how exhausted he was.  Bringing him to the back of my throat I let him see into the darkness below, listening to the gurgling of his friends being broken down to become a part of me.  And then I swallowed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With only one morsel left before dessert, I reached for the jumbo shrimp, the dark shadow of my hand- the shadow of doom- cast down on the whimpering Rostik.  But instead of grabbing his plate, my hand went right over his head and pulled over my rich and creamy dessert.  Ryan couldn\u2019t believe his misfortune.  His one stroke of luck was being put into the dessert, giving him a few extra moments on Earth, or rather, on the outside of my stomach.  \u201cSorry Ryan.  I never could wait for dessert.  In fairness I did have enough meat and vegetables for a sweet treat\u2026 and what a sweet treat you will make!\u201d  Noticing Rostik sigh with relief I felt obliged to tell him, \u201cdon\u2019t get too excited.  I\u2019ll still have plenty more room for the final course!\u201d  Digging my spoon into the deep dark pudding I scooped up a healthy mouthful from right next to Ryan.  In fact, with each dip I intentionally grazed him with the edge of the spoon, making him wonder if this is his bite\u2026 or rather my bite of him.  As more and more of the exquisite chocolate deliciousness disappeared between my lips, and I saw more of the quivering muscular form, I realized that he was positively shivering from the cold.  \u201cOh no.  Was the mousse too chilly for you?  Not to worry.  I\u2019ve got the perfect thing to warm you up!\u201d  Even though the mousse was still up to his armpits I scooped him right up and deposited him gently on my tongue, ignoring his loud incessant scream.  With my lips closed I warmed him up, sucked the excess whipped cream and chocolate off of him, and then spat him back into my hand where he gagged and sputtered.  The shaking was now obviously less from the cold and more from the unadulterated fear coursing through his veiny body.  But that wasn\u2019t as fun to taunt him about.  \u201cI guess my mouth wasn\u2019t warm enough!  Don\u2019t worry!  There\u2019s a place I have in mind that\u2019s much warmer.  In fact it\u2019s like a hot tub down there.  The acid will churn you up so your whole body is covered in goop so hot it\u2019ll take the chill out of those bones, and the bones out of your skin.  I\u2019d tell you to ask the others but\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be responsive when you go see them.\u201d  Before he can scream again, and I did see his mouth opening into the familiar \u2018o\u2019 shape of all my prey, I grabbed the cherry which had rolled off his head earlier, and jab his face into it.  He looked like the Headless Horsemen and I just had to laugh at him and his flailing limbs.  He tried desperately to take it off of him, but it was stuck on good, right up to his shoulders.  I could tell he was choking on the cherry juice so I quickly snatched him back up and brought him to my mouth for his final performance.  That\u2019s when I noticed that there was only a drop of savory mousse left in the cup.  Strange, it had reached up to his underarms before I pulled him out.  Was the displacement that much?  How dense was my delectable meaty little treat?  Before putting him in my maw one last time I dunked his cute little feet back into the goop.  Then he was in.  I sucked the cherry off his head, letting him watch it sit on the edge of my throat before tilting it down.  He was too dazed and still panting for breath, coughing up cherry juice to scream any longer.  After slurping the last of the mousse from between his long toes, digging the tip of my tongue into every groove, I said my goodbyes and sent him to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy left, Rostik was sobbing uncontrollably.  He was hysterical so I didn\u2019t waste any more time.  I lifted him and the jumbo shrimp up to my mouth and stuck both inside, biting hard at the end of the tail.  The end came off easily and I was sure to get all of the meat out of it.  The juices from the shrimp mingled with Rostik\u2019s flavorful body in a way I hadn\u2019t even imagined, pairing with the citrus of the sauce like a dream.  I rolled my eyes in ecstasy yet again and continued sampling every inch of them both.  Soon I was tired of the shrimp, so chewed it into mush and pushed it down my gullet, leaving only my last piece of veal.  Using my powerful tongue I was able to sculpt the little gymnast and bodybuilder into any shape I wanted.  And I did.  It was fun for a time, but I eventually got tired of my game.  It had been an incredible meal, one I would no doubt repeat with different recipes.  But the fun had come to an end and it was time to torture some other shrunken young men.  Tilting my head back for the last time that night, I swallowed.  Less than an hour later the muffled screams and sobs stopped emanating from my belly and the thrashing died down.  I was left alone\u2026 well alone with a few hundred shrunken toys and pets\u2026 and my thoughts.  I couldn\u2019t believe I had been so cruel as to try veal.  I couldn\u2019t believe I had snuffed out five young lives with so much potential.  I couldn\u2019t believe it had only taken a misread magazine to get me to question my morals.  I could, however, believe that I was going to do it again\u2026 and soon!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to wait for her to get back and not look too eager or assumptive. <i>Ah a sip of the wine won't hurt</i> he thought to himself bringing his lips to the glass. <i>It is so cool that we are both into bible study</i>. The wine tasted a bit off, but the handsome jock certainly did not consider himself an expert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa... what the... Trevor's head spun and he rocked back a bit in his seat. A strange sinking sensation came over him, almost like the tingling someone feels going down on an elevator. He stood up and tried to walk towards the mirror on the other side of the room but the vertigo increased. He took a step and realized his loafers were loose on his feet. \"Whoa! Whooooa!\" The sense of sinking intensified rapidly. Trevor's shirt became baggy all around him and his trousers dropped to the floor. \"Hey! Clarisa!\" Trevor cried out as he tripped and plunged forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where am I? What the hell just happened?</i> Trevor found himself plunged into a strange darkness covered in some sort of thick cloth... He quickly worked his way up towards a region of light. \"What the.... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor emerged to see a world he could not believe. He was standing inside his right sock which was inside his shoe which was now the size of a car! Trevor managed to climb out. The drafty old house made his naked skin shiver as he stepped out onto the toe of is shoe to survey his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house he just entered a short time before was all around him. The wine glass now sat high above him on the coffee table where he left it. Trevor hopped off his loafer and walked towards the leg of the sofa. \"Clarisa! Clarisa!\" Trevor cried out but it was unlikely she could hear him in his new shrunken state. The beefy young man glanced towards his massive trousers. Trevor had the strange sense he was being watched. He glanced behind him and his heart raced. \"Oh shit oh shit!\" Clarissa's black cat leapt from its stalking pose into a run as it pursued Trevor as prey. Trevor ran as fast as he could across the old wooden floor his mind racing. <i>Her bedroom! </i>He dashed to the door and there was just enough space for him to crawl under.  He squirmed and felt the rough sensation of the cat's tongue as it managed to lick his left sole. </span></div></div>",

The cat screeched in response to the advanced and Trevor took the moment to speed past the cat towards his clothes still piled on the floor.

The cat looked down at it's trapped prey and licked its lips. The cat licked Trevor in the face with it's rough tongue then opened its mouth wide to take a bite. Trevor punched out only to have his beefy arm sink into the beast's gaping maul. The cat chomped down removing the meaty appendage. The cat swallowed quickly and helped itself to the remaining plumpend bicep. <br>\r\nShock overcame the tiny man as he stood on his two remaining appendages and tried a final run. The cat opened wide taking Trevor inside up to his waist. The inside of the cat's mouth smelled like fish and the tiny figure squirmed helplessly as he felt his feet leave the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisa smiled at her cat as two meaty feet kicked and disappeared between its gleaming white teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Sebastian, you should have left some for me!\" </span></div></div>",

Mitch doesn't know too much about the process, but from what he could read they are going to make him into some sort of edible toy. <i>Probably some sort of 3D modeling whatever, the money they paid was good</i>. Mitchel is used to modeling so when they ask him to slip into a pair of work boots jeans and a white t he doesn't question it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few questions before we begin.\" The attendant is wearing a white lab coat like a doctor which seems strange to Mitch. The questions are odd too, for example asking him if is ticklish and what his last meal was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh is this going to be complicated?\" Mitch raised an eyebrow showing a bit of concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Mitch, this is just standard procedure for the process. Please come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter a room with all sorts of lights and Instruments. In the center of the room on a platform is a round chamber. It is clear on one half and opaque on the other.  \"So this is the 3D scanner pretty cool man.\" The attendant smiles awkwardly and invites Mitch to step up on the platform as the clear side of the chamber slides open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please remove your pockets and put them on the tray.\" Mitchel is all set as the door slides closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device begins to hum. Mitchel is startled as the opaque part fo the chamber starts to rotate around him at first slow a green light flickering over his entire body. Then, like the next stage of an amusement park ride the opaque scanner starts to spin faster. The air pressure changes and for a moment Mitchels boots lift off the floor as if he were in a falling elevator. \"Yo man I think there's something wrong with this thing! Shut it down!\" Mitch reaches over and pounds on the surface of the chamber to get someone's attention. The device is moving so fast Mitch can no longer see outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strange sound the scanner slowly comes to a stop. \"What the fuck... \" Mitchel is terrified by what he sees. </span></div></div>",

Mitchell manages to see a look of fear on Trevor's beautiful face as his arms are sucked upward by the vacuum. With a thump the sound ceases, Trevor is gone. \"Man what the fuck is this?\" Mitchell thinks aloud as the sound of Trevor's voice returns.

His photographer is surprised when he looks through the viewer... brings the beefy Matthew Noszka into view and upon the press of the shutter button looks up to find a steaming pair of foot prints where his subject once stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew sees a blinding flash of light. The world seems to freeze. \"Hey! Are you guys seeing this?\" He looks at his entourage including the photographer but they too seem motionless. He tries to walk but finds his foot fall pushes him off the ground! \"Whoa! What is this!?\" Matthew flips head over heels and comes to a stop in a horizontal position, his feet pointed towards the camera. He feels a strange tug on both sneakers which proceed to pop off and suck into the camera lens. \"Hey! What the hell is this? Hello! Hello!?\" He feels queasy as his toes start stretching unnaturally towards the same lens. He instinctively tries to swim away from the pull, but he is helpless. Soon his entire beefy form squeezes into the lens and he is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh!\" Matthew plunges into darkness. In the torrent of confusion he happens to see that he sneakers are back on his feet and he appears to be whole again. He seems to fall forever when finally he gets the sense he is in some sort of tunnel. The tunnel slowly channels his downward momentum into some sort of slide. As quickly as it began the crazy journey comes to an anticlimactic end as he finds himself plunging into a pad that deflates to decrease his forward momentum. Engulfed by the pad he does not immediately see where he has landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA technician watches the entire process and waits emotionless for Matthew to arrive. Years ago he found the process surprising but that is in stark contrast to his current reaction to the bite sized little model making his way to the end of the reception buffer and stumbling back at the technician's enormous size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What is this?! Where am I?\" His mind was in shock. <i>Am I having a dream? Did they put something in my protein shake this morning.</i> The giant man before him wore surgical gloves and had a eye piece that made one eye look larger. Matthew's racing mind stopped briefly on the thought of Mr. Peanut. \"Hey! I asked you a question what is....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician didn't invest himself in the product. Once a year they were given a holiday bonus. Last year he snacked on a You Tube star who he found entertaining as well. He gently plucked off Matthew's right shoe and sock using calipers to do a quick height check. Before the miniturization process he was 6'2\" tall. \"2.06 inches... perfect!\"The tech mumbled himself as he worked. Matthew struggles helplessly as the tech quickly returns his dislodged footwear. and plucked him up by the back of his white t-shirt. \"Please! Just let me know what's going on! Dude, bro like, what is that... .hey I don't want to go in there... no! hey!\" With a brief smile the technician released Matthew and watched him plop into the thick liquid. The beefy little guy didn't have time to protest more because as soon as his body heat came in contact with the polymer it reacted freezing him in place. All poor Matthew could do is move his eyes to track the motion of the mysterious giant as he plucked up the cylinder and placed it in a box for shipping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Panicked or calm it really doesn't mater for Matthew Noszka is preserved from head to toe without need for food or oxygen while he is in stasis. Matthew watches as RJ King's hansom face passes up and out of the box. Behind RJ's package Adam Ayash's suspended form appears. Adam is in a tank top and shorts. One blue sneaker is on his foot but the other is suspended mid fluid as if he managed to dislodge it during the plunge. Darkness returns and light bursts in over and over. Finally. The other packages in the box are all gone. In darkness, Matthew awaits his fate. Finally, the box bursts open again and a rather plump hand with a brown sleeve makes contact with Matthew's container. Thoughts continue to race through the meaty little model's mind as he finds himself lifted out into the open air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump hand predictably belongs to a portly many in a delivery uniform. He has a cigarette hanging from lips framed in a day's stubble. Covering most of poor Matthew's view the man moves him to some sort of table. He removes the cylinder from the package. He removes a small injector from the back of the package and pierces the cylinder. Matthew begins to gain feeling in his hand and feet and soon finds himself free of the polymer that had trapped him for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moves his head for the first time and takes in his surroundings: He stands on what appears to be the plank of a picnic table that stretches out equally in both directions.  Next to him are two containers each about twice as tall as him, but over their tops he makes out what appears to be marinara sauce and some sort of ranch dressing. His eyes return to the delivery man who seems to have been looking at him the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a buff little fella\" The delivery man smiles down at his little meal. \"I deliver these once a week and never get to try one for myself. One of my colleagues swiped my leftover bread sticks at the office and it looks like someone lost your paper work so....\" the portly man trails off with his eyes and smacks his lips \"It looks like you get to be my lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew gasps and makes a run for it. With adrenalin pumping the world seems to move in slow motion. He sees the end of the table and possible freedom, but out of the corner of his eye he sees the plump hand swooping in for him. \"Get the fuck away from me!\" Matthew turns to miss the incoming hand, but it is of no use. He finds  himself dangling in front of the delivery man's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah tsk tsk. I have already lost one meal today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! Bro, like, I swear I can make it worth your while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word the delivery man tugs gently on Matthew's white t-shirt pulling it involuntarily from his muscular body. Matthew finds himself briefly on the table again only to be plucked up by his ankles. His swept blond locks point downward toward the gaping mouth of the delivery man. Matthew winces at the rather bad smelling hot breath. \"Damn man get a breath mint!\" he finds himself asserting despite the far graver issues at hand. \"Please don't please don....ahh ak ak!\" Matthew's beautiful features plunge rapidly between parted lips. The giant's massive tongue reaches out to greet him covering his face and chest in saliva. Matthew gasps for breath as he finds himself sucked on like a pop sickle. Moments later he returns from the giant's mouth covered in saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste even better than I expected! Best lunch ever!\" The giant grasps his unwilling meal by the lats and with thumb and forefinger begins to take off the red and white high top sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh get away from my feet!\" Matthew's protests are in vain as he finds his sneakers pried off one by one and set next to his discarded t-shirt on the table below. Matthew's stomach flutters as he finds himself once again returned to the tables surface, but this time he finds himself over his head in marinara sauce. The little human meatball struggles to tread on the surface and make his way for the edge of what for him is a Styrofoam pool. Just as he reaches the edge he feels a sharp tug on both pant legs as the giant proceeds to remove his jeans. \"This isn't funny man! When I get back to normal I am going to pound you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bravado only makes you more a pleasure to the senses!\" The delivery man grabs the now stripped Matthew Noszka by the ankles once more managing to force a face plant into the thick sauce. Matthew manages to get the sauce out of his eyes just in time to see a parting smile feel the breath of his captor once more. Matthew tries to push against the tip of the giant's tongue but his hands slip and he ends up meeting the tongue with his face. A strange suction sensation overpowers the young athletic guy as he finds himself buried up to his now naked waste in giant! The giant cleans the sauce off of Matthew's upper torso and then methodically inserts each meaty leg into his mouth to clean them. </span></div></div>",

Mathew spread his legs wide trying to make his form to big for the cavern now directly below him. He pounded against the giant's tongue whining a little each time a meaty foot made contact but slid downward. With powerful muscles the giant drew his mouth closed bringing Matthew's legs together and sucking him in to his waist. \"Oh my God... oh my God! Man don't do this don't do this ... \" Matthew was now up to his armpits in the hungry giant's mouth. His muscular arms tried to free him but to no avail. His protests became muffled as his head disappeared. The giant played with him in mouth briefly allowing Matthew's right foot to find it's last bit of freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz from the cell phone on the table sealed Matthew's fate. At tilted head sent the lad deeper than he had ever been. Powerful muscles massaged him from all sides as they undulated pulling him rapidly into the darkness. \"ahhhhhh\" plop! The perfectly formed boy dropped with a splash into the stomach. His feet and hands met soft slippery material wherever they probed. He cried out gasping for breath in the overwhelming humidity of the giant's stomach cavity. He briefly reached for something, a bit of chewed gum? \"Gotta get out of here!\" he continued to gasp as he heard a deep rumbling sound. The walls of the stomach collapsed rapidly squeezing him hard knocking out his last bit of wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the truck pulled away, a gentle breeze removed a bit of white material from the surface of the table. Two sparrows tugged at the pair of blue jeans. A passing child found a great pair of very realistic looking sneakers for her Ken doll. </span></div></div>",

Like a man caught in quicksand Mr. Hoffman struggled but with each effort found his meaty body winnowed further away into the mat.

You can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from the wheezing of his own breath, the fear of your threat coming to fruition, or shock that you would even consider something like that but you don\u2019t care.

Your tongue comes out and jabs at his flesh with each deep kiss so you can sample the meaty flavor which has mingled with the sauce like a charm.  He can't help but moan a little bit when your tongue comes out and tastes his smooth supple young flesh.  And you can't help but \"mmm\" at the same time.  Your fingers massage his back and pert ass, each dimple flexing, while your lips and tongue continue kneading him like dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is unable to control himself as you kiss and lick his stomach and chest, his toes curling in uncomfortable pleasure as you do so and he lets out another involuntary moan, which is just more proof that he's truly at your mercy. You continue tasting his upper body, your pillowy lips brushing the sauce right off of him, but the flavor has seeped into the flesh.  He hadn't planned on this being such a sensual experience and is equally terrified, embarrassed, irate, and turned on.  He looks as though he is about to tell you to just swallow him already but he knows the pleasure will end and his unimaginable pain will begin moments later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later your lips are wrapped around his dick and they vibrate with every \"mmmm\" sound you make while sample his flavor.  It's as though ten vibrators are massaging his shaft at once and you can feel the blood rushing to his steadily hardening cock through your tongue.  His back arches and he grunts out, trying to resist the unrelenting pleasure of my soft lips against his shaft, vibrating, and my wet warm tongue licking gently at the precome covering his cock head.  The humid air and spongey tongue are even more welcome to his damaged skin from his time in the saucepan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squirms even more, uncomfortable beyond measure despite the pleasure.  He knows he can't last very long, but he tries his best not to give you the satisfaction as he pushes his hands against your lips and beg you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands push ineffectively against your upper lip so you suck them in, slobbering over his whole arm like a wet noodle, despite the rippling muscle.   The taste of his cute little hands and tiny prick make you crave more and more of him.  His hips buckle as you continue playing with his rock hard dick.  Your lips suckle at the shaft with the power of a hundred vacuums like this is a giant blow job, which of course it is, while your tongue massages his cockhead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release his arms but only to get a better grip on his body. His toes curl on your lower lip and you suck them up past the waist, tasting each meaty sweaty foot and sauce covered bulging calf and thigh.   Your tongue cushions his meaty ass and you suck on him as if his whole lower half was a dick... still tiny compared to your own size.  Pushing him up with your tongue he is forced to furiously hump the roof of your mouth before you maneuver him around and have him do the same with your spongey tongue.   The roof of your mouth cushions his ass, making him feel every indentation as your tongue rises up to your gums, pushing him harder and harder and forcing his dick deeper and deeper into your tongue, which gives way for his needle dick taste and that of his whole body as his little prick pushes deep into my tongue, thrusting against each tickling tastebud.  His hands are in push-up position but he can't move a muscle of his sweating, spicy sauce-coated body except to gyrate his hips back as forth because of the pressure your tongue is pushing against him and the roof of your mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later and it's over.  A spurt of come shoots deep into your tongue and you get the salty tart taste.  It pools in the back of your throat and you leave it there a moment, letting the panting muscular youth watch it slowly disappear into the eternal black abyss to your stomach, showing him a sneak peak of his own voyage.  Your tongue pushes against his toes and brings him to the back of your throat as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the little pre-dinner snack!  I love when you guys marinate yourselves!  It also makes you struggle more when you're slowly being digested alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, feeling the bulging muscle man travel down and even hearing the splash of your stomach acid as he enters.  Immediately he gets his second wind and begins panicing, running into your stomach lining, banging on your sides, tickling you to know end.  You chuckle as the acid swirls around him.  His panics only tickle you more.  The more he struggles the more it tickles.  The more it tickles the more you giggle.  The more you giggle the more sloshing liquid melts his body into soupy energy for you to go out and get more young treats. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Austin Scoggin stepped into the studio. He had worked out an hour before and was ready to shoot. The shoot attendants quickly showed him to his place to change. His first outfit was a grey button t-shirt with skinny charcoal jeans and a pair of trendy looking black boots. He walked out and entered the studio for the shoot. He was pampered by attendants that made sure every blemish was hidden and that every hair was in place. \"Would you care for some water Austin?\" an attendant handed Austin an opened bottle of water which Austin graciously accepted and chugged. <i>Hmm this tastes funny</i> he thought to himself, but quickly pushed the thought aside and stepped onto the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone you know how I must work!\" The photographer clapped his hands together as his crew took the signal and began to leave the studio. He was an eccentric artist and everyone who worked with him knew they could not disturb the artist while he worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first everything seemed normal. Austin stuck various poses at the direction of the photographer while standing on a white background. After about 20 minutes, however, Austin began to feel slightly light headed. He and experienced worse and shrugged it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent Austin excellent! Now, my wonderful boy, I need you to move over to the kitchen background for a different set.\" Austin complied still shrugging off the feeling from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 10 minutes passed. As Austin changed his position in the kitchen backdrop his lightheaded feeling began to change somehow. He almost felt like the world was starting to rise up around him. He went to lift his right foot to place it on a stool and his boot slipped off dropping to the ground with a thud. The counter top next to the stool.. .and the stool were definately growing! \"Hey I don't feel so good. Maybe we should stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense my dear Austin we have just begun! Keep up what you are doing it is perfect!\" The photographer's enthusiasm didn't sway young Austin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah man, we need to stop. I feel like I am on acid or something the room feels like it is rising up!\" Austin spun around to leave the set. The photographer seemed unmoved by Austin's concerns and continued rapidly photographing the beefy blonde model. \"Hey John! I told you I need to sto.....\" Austin couldn't write off his sense anymore, he was getting smaller! He looked down towards his feet as his black boots seemed to come up to meet him. He instinctively tried to run, but he ended up falling out of both of his boots and tripping over his now giant charcoal skinny jeans. \"Hey! I need help! What the fuck is this?!\" He struggled through the endless gray blanket that just moments before had hugged tightly to his plump biceps. In shock he looked over to see one of the white buttons now as big as a plate to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photographer seemed delighted by the whole scene. Just as he had anticipated dear unsuspecting Austin had shrunken on cue managing to stay within the confines of the kitchen set designed by his client. Soon his beautiful form emerged from the crumpled pile of clothing. As if still taking cues the beautiful boy looked up towards the camera with wide hazel eyes and raised a dramatic hand to shield the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photographer continued to snap shots as the beefy young man proceeded across the white tile floor towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! What the hell was that?\" Austin continued to advance on the photographer seemingly not yet aware of the culpability of the now giant man. Through the lens Austin's anger and fear showed through brilliantly. <i>Little meat head isn't showing enough fear.... soon enough, must get him in this mode first</i> the photographer thought to himself and came down to the floor to meet his subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Austin darling you really should read your contract!\" Austin <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am afraid you have no choice.\" The photographer decided not to share the full contract with Austin, he needed to wait to build upon his great little facial expressions. \"Ok! Send in the next model!\" Joe leap from his low place with poor Austin and stood back to capture the next phase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next model?! They never said there would be.......\" Austin's protest was cut short as the floor rumbled around him like an earthquake. From the shadows came the next model. Compared to Austin's handsome tight form this model seemed very plain. Austin's eyes trailed upward taking in every massive detail. The unknown man wore white shoes, pants and a double buttoned white coat. \"No fucking way dude no fucking way!!!\" Austin gasped out loudly as he spied the massive chef's hat atop the dark haired man's head. The cheesy handle bar mustache reminded Austin of one of those cartoons of a pizza maker they had at local pizzerias. \"Guy I don't know what the fuck this is about but I am out of here!!\" Austin turned to run. The photographer had been snapping shots the whole time and zoomed out to capture what happened next. The chef model dramatically allowed Austin to reach the edge of the counter where he quickly dashed behind. Like a game of cat and mouse the chef quickly grabbed Austin's right foot before he made it out of the site of the chef or the camera man. \"Noooooooo!\" Austin screamed in terror and attempted to grab hold of a vent at the base of the counter only to be plucked away with ease by the massive chef. Austin's stomach churned as he felt himself drug skyward by his right ankle. \"Oh god fuck! Let me go man let me go!\" Austin kicked with his free foot and his toes clenched tight as he tried to dislodge the grasp of his captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin spied the inside of his now massive now empty right boot as the chef drew him up for inspection. The camera clicked away furiously as the chef bounced his tiny human prop in front of his face slowly and deliberately licking his lips for the camera and smacking them for added effect. \"I love my job!\" the chef's eyebrows raised slightly as he whispered to Austin. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The chef methodically moves towards a counter on the set occasionally wearing different expressions at the direction of the photographer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help help! Somebody help! Fuck man what are you doing? What are you doing with me!\" Austin's tiny voice cries out in vain as he finds himself dangled over a stainless steel bowl filled with flour. \"Hey I don't wanna go in there! Come on now!\" The chef again for the camera scowles and points a finger at Austin and then smiles and makes a small waving gesture with the fingers of his free hand. \"No man no man don.....'poof'\" The bite sized little hunk drops into the center of the mound of flour sending up a beautiful cloud of dust. The now kicking all 4 limbs wildly the Austin coughs and wheezes hysterically. The dry flour covers every surface of his sweaty body. Laying flat on his back looking like a man trying to make snow angels Austin finally gets his eyes open to find the camera lens just a few feet (inches from normal perspective) examining his form like a frog on in a dissecting scope. \"You're gonna pay for this you son of a.... ow! ah fuck man stop it!\" The camera pulls back to allow for the chef's massive hand to come in with a fork to poke Austin in the stomach. Austin flails trying to bring himself upright in the slippery steel bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Austin finally reaches his feet he finds himself grasped from behind by something cold and hard. Austin gets a momentary vision of himself in the mirror behind the photographer. The chef has captured him under his arms and he is covered completely in flour. As he continues to flex cracks form around his pecs and abdomen. Before he can think further he finds himself in motion once again this time towards a bowl filled with what appears to be whisked egg whites. <i>Holly fuck dude this is what we used to do to frog legs back home! </i> Austin whines audibly and kicks out as he once again finds himself tumbling through the air briefly. The egg is cold and slimy and thick. The chef used a lot of eggs to have the effect of seeing poor Austin tread for his life. His floury form now coated completely in the viscous protein. A special camera technique captures every precious millisecond as Austin reaches the surface of his egg bath and gasps for breath. \"Oh god oh god oh god!\" Austin tries to swim to the edge, but finds the egg keeps him trapped in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the chef returns with the tongs and once again Austin gets a brief glance of his once big beefy form now minuscule and helpless in the tongs of a perverse pair of giants. He swipes his hands across his face sending a splash of egg towards the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin knows what is coming next. Like a million pin pricks the sharp edges of dry bread crumbs pierce the soles of his otherwise well callused feet. He takes a few awkward steps before the unsteady mix sends him to his butt. He tries once again to make it to the edge of the bowl. The camera zooms in its master presumably relishing the sight as Austin whimpers pawing at the edge of the massive bowl each movement sinking him deeper into the coating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'll pay you anything you want! Just let me go man come on!\" Austin waves his hands in truce to the Joe. Joe ignores the little man's pleas. The chef's massive form once again appears over the bowl. He gently knocks Austin over and grabs his left foot. Austin lets out a cry as he finds his egg soaked head dunked into the crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin sobs and struggles as he watches the pan approach. It appears to be bubbling hot as Austin remembers what happened to all those frog legs. \"No no... I don't wanna be fried! Oh god please help me please!\" </span></div></div>",

'crackle' the liquid around Austin reacted to his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin's pure panic was just what the photographer wanted! Austin continued to flail around for a bit and as the shock subsided the little man sat up. For some reason he wasn't being deep fried. A bit of the powder from beneath his egg and crumbed hand fell into the acidic smelling \"oil\" and caused another session of sizzle and cracking <i>baking soda</i> he thought. Without asking aloud young Austin leapt to his feet and splashed across the shallow liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no my tasty little model, we must plate you now.\" The chef quickly grasped Austin, reapplied some of the breading material and sprayed the whole mess with some sort of golden brown food coloring, Austin's tiny form protesting the entire way. Austin found himself wired onto a frame which held him spread eagle on a plate, looking skillfully cooked, next to vegetables.

Come on little man, this will make you one of the biggest names in modeling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted in and in shock Austin Scoggin nods in momentary agreement. The photographer gingerly releases Austin from his plate and allows him to shower in a warm stream of water in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our final set will be titled, 'Just Desserts'\" We will make a tasty Austin Scoggin filled crepe out of you!\" Austin towels off with a cloth napikin \"Man! Whatever the fuck it takes to get this over with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good sport!\" the chef and photographer take their positions Austin willfully finds himself laying down on a soft piece of rubbery pancake the size of a King sized blanket from his tiny form. The chef poses briefly then wraps the crepe around the exhausted little model. They make a show of applying a bit of chocolate sauce which is cold and causes Austin to clench his toes and hands in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all of this for anyway?\" Austin remembered something about toys and food when he scanned the paperwork, but his agent rushed him along.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to become the first model for a new company 'Edible Toys Inc.' Men of your beautiful form will be shrunken, played with and eaten by very exclusive clients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?

I may have misled you earlier, I am afraid your being devoured is an important part of the session. Good bye my meaty friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin wriggled and whined as he felt a cold fork being pried under his head past his shoulders. With a sucking sound the fork pulled him up past the plate and towards the mouth of the chef. \"No! Noooooooo!\" Austin screamed as he felt the odorous hot breath of the chef. Soon Austin was up to his waist in giant. He reached out and grabbed the handle bar mustache but it was no use. Soon he was up to his neck his arms stretched out like he was sinking into a tar pit.  The camera zoomed in on his tear streaked face, a drop of chocolate running down his right cheek. The chef tilted his head back, with a unexpected thrust Austin ejected from the chef's mouth did an areal somersault and landed head first down the giant throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a wrap!\" </span></div></div>",

After searching the extensive menu you land on male models and select the doll of your choice, Daniel Borgato. The site promises quick service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Danielo Borgato is on a break between shoots. He is with a group of old friends skate boarding enjoying the hot Brazilian sun. Danielo shifts his ball cap and kicks his red van against the front of his board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acho que eu posso pegar o skateboard mais elevado desta vez!\" Danielo is enjoying the day so much he does not notice the hum of an incoming drone until it is practically on him. \"Ei, o que \u00e9 isso?\" One of Danielo's friends notices the drone hovering above his buddy. \"\u00c9 um drone. Eu acho que tem uma c\u00e2mera! Cool!\" The boys all push each other putting on a macho show for the flying camera. Danielo brushes off the attention he is used to and flips off the hovering machine with a wide grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys try to go back to skating, but the drone seems intent on staying with Danielo. \"Que diabos! Saia daqui! V\u00e1 embora!\" Danielo is starting to get irritated at the uninvited drone. The hovering drone's sound changes and it moves back slightly drawing Danielo's attention. A blue beam of light shoots down towards Danielo's feet and swiftly scans him from toe to head. \"Ei!  O que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo?\" Danielo turns to join his friends and leave this intrusion, but only makes one step when a second beam of light, this time red vaporizes him in thin air with a 'pop'! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh meu Deus, isso vaporizado ele!\" The boys stare on in silent shock Danielo's skate board falls with a clatter to the ground next to two size 9 footprints still smoking from the drone's act, its master gone in thin air. The young men erupt in protest as the strange machine that just vaporized their buddy pulls out of their reach and into the darkening Sao Palo Sky. </span></div></div>",

It has other stops to make this evening and this is the most efficient way to get product to market quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile thousands of miles away, a processing center is in full operation. Skilled techs receive newly shrunken boy toys who are then measured and placed in suspension for delivery to their hungry customers. \"Ei Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o sabe que eu sou uma a lenda do futebol? Eu exijo ver meu agente!\" a resolute little Cristiano Ronaldo pounds on the glass of his receiving chamber. Across from Ronaldo another glass cylinder shimmers with the green light of re-materialization. Tanner Patrick's lean handsome form comes into view and he spins around disoriented and confused. As a tech mounts the cute little Vine star for measure, a nearby chamber begins to shimmer. Tech number 23 quickly examines the small screen below the processing chamber to determine the ID of the new arrival. \"Danielo Borgato, yum!\" The tech's eye arches slightly at a sputtering sound he hears during the re-composition process. His look of concern disappears as Danielo's handsome form finally comes into view. The tech waits for the Danielo to scan his new surroundings and make contact with him,<i> they almost always react the same way</i> he thinks to himself passively. Danielo fairly quickly notices the most important thing in his new environment, the giant in a lab coat with magnification goggles. \"O ooo que \u00e9 isso? Que fizeste para mim?!\" The hot little man wears tight light blue jeans with red canvas sneakers. As he scans around he does so with his sunglasses tilted upward. Atop his head is a black ball cap with with what looks to be a SevenSeven logo. \"Ah yes Portuguese\" the technician makes a few quick adjustments to the screen at the front of the receiving chamber. \"Danielo Borgado, it is my pleasure to inform that you are now property of Edible Toys Incorporated. Please prepare for inspection and packaging.\" Tech 23 waits patiently while the computer translates Danielo his fate. \"Coloque-me de volta ao normal! Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode fazer isto!\" <span class=\"cblue\">Put me back to normal! You can't do this!</span> The machine translates both ways, but it is rarely of much use. With the flip of a switch the apparatus holding poor little Danielo lifts the glass cylinder and corrals Danielo toward the technician. \"Now my little man, let's make sure you check out!\" Danielo finds himself plucked up by the back of his black t-shirt he continues to struggle furiously as the tech plucks off a shoe and sock and straps him to a cold glass board. \"You are properly scaled. Let's check out your mass now my little friend\" A small platform comes out of the inspection desk and the technician gently inserts each of Dannielo's feet into tared clamps on the balance. \"Uh oh! This doesn't look good.\" Tech 23's eyes grow wide, he quickly summons another tech who verifies he results. It is slow, but the mass of Danielo is ticking downward. \"We will have to let this one go. I will send word to the client, might as well let the little man have a last bit of freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O que est\u00e1 errado?! O que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 fazendo?!\" Danielo sees the concern in the giants above. The first giant plucks Danielo out of his clamps and sets him on his desk. Danielo is about to make a run for it when he looks down at his hand. He shouts out in panic as it appears to be melting away! \"O que \u00e9 que voc\u00ea fez? O que \u00e9 que voc\u00ea fez?!!!\" The tech smiles back vacantly at Danielo vacantly. The tingling sensation in Danielo's quickly shrinking hand starts in the toes of his right foot. He quickly slips off his shoe to find his toes dissolving too! His right hand has now gone and soon his muscular tatooed arm disolves. </span></div></div>",

As he passes the check point and reports in to his supervisor he passes rows of other techs already processing today's inventory. He nods cheerfully at Tech 7 who is in the process of packing up Joe Jonas to a hungry customer. Tech 10 fails to greet him because he is too busy trying to retrieve who appears to be the sexy model Ricardo Baldin from beneath his work bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTech 23 reaches his station which hums to life as soon as the sensor detects his presence. He clicks on a few buttons and the machine begins to bring in the first catch of the work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas Dell snaps a selfie to post on Instagram before heading to class. <i>God I am fucking cute</i> he thinks to himself as he heads out across campus. He has his head buried in his smart phone and does not at first notice the quiet hum above him. \"Hey Lucas I think you are being followed by the Paparazzi!\" A couple of girls giggle as they pass the handsome young man. Lucas momentarily puts his phone in his pocket and looks for the operator. Seeing no one he glances up at the hovering craft. He spies what appears to be a camera on the device and flashes his trademark sexy face. \"Hey perv! Why don't you just check out my Instagram page\" &lt;sigh&gt; whatever.\" Just then the device begins to hum a bit louder and rocks back slightly. Lucas gets an uneasy feeling and starts to walk away. The device follows him and he begins to run. \"Dude! Like get the fuck away from me!\" Lucas stops and turns back toward the drone \"Don't make me call security on your ass!\" The device once again hums loudly and cocks back. Lucas watches as a green beam of light quickly scans him from the toes of this white canvas sneakers to the top of his head. \"What the fu....\" a second red beam vaporizes the young stud sending his computer bag to the grass without an owner. A few students nearby don't notice what has happened until they here the 'pop' of air rushing into the void previously held by the hot young man. One of them picks up the bag while a second snaps a quick photo of the strange scorched footprints on the pristine campus turf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of red... and then blue shimmering light.... <i>what the fuck was that?</i> Lucas turns around to get a bearing. The bright sunlight of the college campus has changed to an artificial glow. Austin is on a strange glowing white platform. From his perspective, the edge of the platform appears to be about 15 feet or so away. Beyond he is not able to make out anything, only darkness. \"Hey what the fuck just happened?! Hello? Hey I asked a fucking question!\" A voice through a speaker loudly responds. \"Lucas Austin Dell! It is my pleasure to inform you that you are now the property of Edible Toys Incorporated! Please prepare for being inspected and packaged for shipping!\"</span></div></div>",

His search is short for seconds later a massive face appears through what he now realizes is some sort of glass barrier. \"Is this like some sort of joke man?! Who the fuck are you?\" Austin assumes he is being punked or some shit like that. He walks towards the giant face and as he does the glass wall begins to lift away. The light beneath his feet dims as this happens and Austin is able to make out the world beyond a bit more clearly. He sees clearly now a giant man in a lab coat before him wearing magnifying glasses that make his eyes seem too large for his already massive head. Without the barrier Lucas begins to sense it might be real and starts to step back. 'thud' the back of Lucas's right sneaker collides with a steel grey barrier that is moving towards him from behind. He instinctively tries to move to the side but in each turn finds a barrier moving him in the one direction he does not want to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My aren't you an arrogant little man!\" the giant crouches down to the platform and Lucas recoils at the wind of his hot humid breath. \"Your buyer is in for a real treat! torturing and eating someone like you is a delight!\" Lucas starts to respond but gasps in horror at the giant hand moving in to retrieve him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Somebody help! What the fuck is this? Let me go!\" Lucas's feet kick wildly at the air as the tech grasps him by the neck of his long sleeve blue t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get your height measured first shall we?\" The tech skillfully plucks off Lucas's right shoe and sock and straps the little man to a glass platform. Lucas squirms helplessly as the giant turns to retrieve something from behind. A device Lucas has never seen before looms over his tiny helpless form and his toes curl tightly as one point of the device digs into his bare foot, his eyes trail upward as the second end of the device burrows through his thick blond locks on the top of his head. \"Ow! that hurts! Get the fuck offff now!!!!\" The giant's expression indicates he is enjoying his work. While still strapped down Lucas's sock and shoe are restored. He finds himself once again kicking at the air as the tech lifts him from one platform and sets him on another. \"Ah! I see the night crew re-calibrated. Good news my little man, you won't be melting into nothingness....\" Lucas whimpered and fought against the clamps holding his feet to the platform. \"The bad news is of course you will be played with and devoured by a giant. Makes you wish you hadn't posted all of those selfies huh little hottie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>selfies....</i> Lucas reaches for his trusty smart phone....<i> damn no signal</i>.... \"hey! noooooo!\" Lucas screams out as the giant snatches away his only link to the outside world. \"tsk tsk my little morsel, we wouldn't want you ruining your biggest fan's meal now would we.\" Lucas's eyes stay locked on his lifeline as it passes into a jar on the giant's desk. \"Well dear Lucas, as much as I have enjoyed having you here it is time to get you off to your buyer! The stasis gas will erase your short term memory so you get to relive being shrunken all over again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the processing station a conveyor belt brings a container with Lucas's name printed on it. Lucas cries out and thrashes at the air as the tech proceeds place him in a chamber. A hissing sound brings a vapor causing Lucas to stiffen up and drift into an involuntary sleep. The tech pulls and pushes until the hot little man looks like an action figure and slips him gently into his container. A moment later the container is sealed, more of the special gas is pressured inside. and Lucas is on his way to an eager customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Tech number 23 quickly examines the small screen below the processing chamber to determine the ID of the new arrival. \"Danielo Borgato, yum!\" The tech's eye arches slightly at a sputtering sound he hears during the re-composition process. His look of concern disappears as Danielo's handsome form finally comes into view. The tech waits for the Danielo to scan his new surroundings and make contact with him, they almost always react the same way he thinks to himself passively. Danielo fairly quickly notices the most important thing in his new environment, the giant in a lab coat with magnification goggles. \"O ooo que \u00e9 isso? Que fizeste para mim?!\" The hot little man wears tight light blue jeans with red canvas sneakers. As he scans around he does so with his sunglasses tilted upward. Atop his head is a black ball cap with with what looks to be a SevenSeven logo. \"Ah yes Portuguese\" the technician makes a few quick adjustments to the screen at the front of the receiving chamber. \"Danielo Borgado, it is my pleasure to inform that you are now property of Edible Toys Incorporated. Please prepare for inspection and packaging.\" Tech 23 waits patiently while the computer translates Danielo his fate. \"Coloque-me de volta ao normal! Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode fazer isto!\" Put me back to normal! You can't do this! The machine translates both ways, but it is rarely of much use. With the flip of a switch the apparatus holding poor little Danielo lifts the glass cylinder and corrals Danielo toward the technician. \"Now my little man, let's make sure you check out!\" Danielo finds himself plucked up by the back of his black t-shirt he continues to struggle furiously as the tech plucks off a shoe and sock and straps him to a cold glass board. \"You are properly scaled. Let's check out your mass now my little friend\" A small platform comes out of the inspection desk and the technician gently inserts each of Dannielo's feet into tared clamps on the balance. The technician looks with a smile at his terrified little model captive when he is distracted by something at a nearby station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meu p\u00e9! O que est\u00e1 acontecendo? O que voc\u00ea fez para mim?!\" Cristiano Ronaldo's inspection did not go well. The hot young footballer is standing on the inspection table in a pair of skinny jeans and a white shirt. His right loafer now sits empty as he hops around on his left. Another tech gently knocks Ronaldo to the table and plucks off the remaining loafer. Five plump athletic toes wiggle in the liberation.... and then vanish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk. Instability in the transfer... Tough break. You are lucky that didn't happen to you... .well the giant who is about to eat you is anyway\" Tech 23 flashes Danielo an empty grin. \"Let's get you packaged. \"No! No! I want to go back!\" Danelo squirms helplessly on the balance as the tech plucks him up gingerly. \"You won't remember a bit of this little man. One moment you will be skating with your friends, the next you will be a hot little Brazilian snack for our very lucky client.\" Danielo continues to protest and fight as he finds his muscular form lowered into a tank that fills with a strange smelling gas. Soon he has been rendered catatonic but still bendable. Techniican 23 adjusts Danielo's tiny cap and lowers him into the package for sealing and shipping. </span></div></div>",

One could not ask for a better afternoon. Landon senses a shadow passing over the bright sun entering his eyelids.<i> hmmm a cloud</i> the handsome green eyed model thinks at first and forgets about it. The shadow comes back this time accompanied by a whining sound. Landon opens his eyes and shields them from the sun to investigate. Hovering just a few feet above his head is a drone and Landon notices it has a camera. \"Ah man! Go bother someone else.\" With a dismissive swipe the buff young man closes his eyes and tries to return to his afternoon chill. The pitch of the still present drone makes a slight change. <i>The air feels different</i> Landon opens his eyes and instantly jumps to his feet \"What the fuck?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis beach chair is still beneath him but everything else has changed! He is now on a glowing round platform surrounded by darkness on all sides. On first site Landon is reminded of the catwalk he did last month in Italy. He looks down and flexes his toes on the strange new surface, bits of sand fall from his feet and sitter across the floor. He reaches for his cell phone next to the chair <i>gone... damn!</i> \"Hey! Hello is somebody here?\" Landon makes his way to the edge of the platform to see if he can figure out what lies beyond. About halfway a loud voice coming from a speaker above \"Landon Falgoust! It is my pleasure to inform you that you are now property of Edible Toys Incorporated. Prepare to be measured and packaged for shipment!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edible Toys? Property? Yo man I think there has been some sorta mist......\" His words are cut off by the sound of the barrier around the platform lifting and additional walls coming in from the side forcing the young man to move in one direction. Landon steps back against the barrier in shock as something moves out of the darkness. A man, at least a half a mile tall with a white lab coat and rather strange looking glasses as if he were to inspect a diamond or cut up a frog! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistake! Oh I hope not my dear little man. You are Landon Falgoust are you not? The giant is examining a pad and turns it around showing Landon doing an audition video on one of his agencies websites.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, but who wants to know?\" Landon's heart is racing as he continues to look around his strange new environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do of course! If you are not Landon then there are some alley cats out back that are really looking forward to eat... er a meeting you!\" The tech puts a hand over his mouth to repress a slight chuckle. Landon is not amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get back to the beach! My girlfriend must be worried.\" the words hang in the air as the tech seems preoccupied with something on his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am sure she is my dear boy. But her loss is our clients gain. Let's get you measured shall we?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air is stale and he stumbles panicked on what feels like some sort of foam mat. He runs against a smooth curved wall and feels around for a door. \"Merda! Onde est\u00e1 a porta?\" He curses to himself as he pounds on the wall in fear. He can  see absolutely nothing, but his sense of balance tells him the room is moving.<i> \u00c9 este um elevador? Onde estou?</i> thougts course rapidly through the models head. He finds himself thrust into the surface of the foam and the room finally comes to a stop. A loud tearing sound draws his attention to the ceiling above when a burst of light forces him to shield his eyes. Once again he gets butterflies in his stomach as the room moves upward into the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful brown eyed man blinks wildly trying to gain focus. The walls of the strange stale aired room are clear. Above he sees something dark that appears to have latched itself to the top of the room... or container.... the motion. He carefully inspects the object above. The main body is too obscured to see but along the edge .... <i>Aqueles parecido com dedos gigantes! N\u00e3o!</i> the thought is too insane for Ricardo to process. \"Ol\u00e1? Tem algu\u00e9m a\u00ed?!\" Ricardo cries out in hopes that someone might either open the room or wake him from this terrible dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two massive eyes and unsettling smile appear before him! \"It looks like someone woke up during shipping!\" A voice in English booms across the container from the massive lips. Suddenly the container drops again and lands on a solid surface with a crash. The hand which held the container now rotates slowly and air rushes in much to the very temporary relief of the displaced Brazilian model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Who are you? How did I get here?\" Still in shock Ricardo finds the questions rolling off his tongue rapidly. He wants more than anything to be out of the terrifying little room, but at the same time is terrified about what lies beyond. As he cowers in indecision a massive set of fingers. Ricardo's panic stricken mind briefly reflects on that fact that he is still in the clothes from the photo shoot with the drone. The giant now holds him by the back of his unbuttoned blue shirt. </span></div></div>",

A single flash from the camera and then .... silence.... everyone just vanished. \" Est-ce une blague? Ha ha gars tr\u00e8s dr\u00f4le!

He was dressed in black stylish boots, skinny jeans, and a tight v-neck t-shirt. His handsome face and hair accented with a grey wool hat. He didn't seem to notice the gravity of his change as he glanced back and forth with a vacant smile. He managed to look at the giant face now before him and wink provocatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon jour Monsieur Bonnamy!\" The giant looked at his newest toy with hungry eyes. His captive just smiled and responded. \"Hello. What has happened here? Is this some sort of computer thing?\" Still sporting his signature smile he began to notice the change and walked cautiously towards the giant scene spread out beyond the miniaturization chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's eyes widened. \"I am afraid not my beautiful little man. You have been shrunken and are now my personal toy and snack.\" Gio's confident glaze faded quickly. \"I hope you didn't have any big plans my dear man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni Bonnamy's looked around him finally letting reality sink in. \"Fuck man fuck! Awe man what ze fuck!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now morsel of a model first tried to run into the vast black background only to find it ended rather quickly as a wall. \"Merde! Merde! What ze fuck man what ze fuck!\" He scanned his now limited world with wide eyes quickly calculating that the only path to freedom was past the giant face guarding the stage like area he found himself. He bounded athletically towards his captor leaping from the platform into the world beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant, enjoying the game of cat and mouse, allowed Giovanni the false sense of success. The giant watched with amusement as Gio dropped to the surface of the kitchen counter and darted a bit seeking a place of refuge. His beautiful eyes rolled in his head as his mind raced to find a place to hide. There was no path to the floor without a terrible free fall. Gio darted across the marble surface and around the corner of an old wine box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Gio! You don't think you will escape do you?\" The giant played with his little toy's mind as he pretended to search for Gio. He gently twisted the box keeping one end on the edge of the counter forcing Gio's path. Soon the meaty little fellow found himself pressed against new pine breathing heavily trying in vain to make his form invisible. \"Do not feel bad my meaty little Parisian doll, you were never meant to escape! Now let's get you out of those clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGio's terrified eyes tracked the hand of the massive captor as the giant's fingers closed in on his minuscule form. Gio let off a whimper as two massive fingers gently plucked the hat from his head allowing his hair to flop down freely. Gio, devoid of anywhere to run, watched his hat travel over to a nearby shelf where the giant deposited it gently. \"Like you, the hat is now mine my dear Gio. I am afraid those clothes are going to remain in my collection a bit longer than their bearer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGio took the brief movement of the giant as a window to escape. He managed to make a few steps when he let out a cry of frustration. \" Laisse-moi! Lassie=moi!\" Gio kicked frantically as he found his boots lifted from the counter surface with swift force. His lean stomach tightened outwardly while tummy within churned with the butterflies of sudden upward motion. Gio's chiseled features turned in a futile effort to avoid the hot breath of his master who now held him firmly by the waist of his skinny jeans. The giant's smile was wide as he eyed Gio and licked his lips.</span></div></div>",

Matthew wanted to run but his legs were partially paralyzed in fear. Near him he spied a pair of jeans, Tom's shoes and a blue shirt strung haphazard across the countertop.

It maneuvered quickly in front of Simon and he could see the camera lens. \"Hey! Get out of here!\" Simon was usually a pretty chill guy, but this was not cool. The distraction caused him to loose balance and flip into the air. The drone timed the capture perfectly scanning him from head to toe and then with a zap of the red beam he was gone. His now empty board made its way to the beach as the drone zipped up into the humid air to transmit its latest capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the processing center it was business as usual. A rather displeased Zayne Malik was pounding at the glass of his miniturization chamber demanding to speak with someone in charge. He and others like him would soon be packaged and whisked away to their hungry buyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platform whirled with energy as Simon's form appeared. He thudded onto the bright white surface having been captured in mid air. As he writhed and found his bearing the platform squeaked against the sound of his checkered wet suit. \"Hey man what is this?!\" Simon began exploring his strange new environment. It was bright light below almost like a photo set, but there was nothing but darkness in all other directions. He took a few steps when a disembodied voice came out of the darkness. \"Simon Nessman! You are now the property of Edible Toys. Prepare to be examined for shipment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome young model looked around in disbelief. \"Like is this some sort of joke?! What......\" his inquiry to the air fell short as a wall appeared in front of him moving at a rather steady rate. With little choice he proceeded in the opposite direction only to see a barely visible glass move up in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Mr. Nessman! Won't you make a delectable treat!\" Simon staggered back against the still moving wall at the sight. A giant in a lab coat peered down at him with a rather evil looking grin. The man had to be at least 100 stories tall. \"Hey man like what the fuck is this... get the fuck away from me!\" Simon's voice shook audibly as he hugged against the still advancing wall pushing his feet forward even as he resisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to get a few measurements and make sure you are stable at the molecular level before we get you off to the buyer.\" Simon shook his head in shock and defiance as the massive technician's right hand moved in on him swiftly. \"Get the fuck away from me....\" He whined a bit as the technician pinched the upper part of his wet suit hoisting him upward. The technician ignored the now bite sized little model as he poked and prodded him with various instruments. The inspection came with a fresh water rinse to make sure he wasn't \"stinky when he arrived to his buyer.\" The technician spritzed him with a strange substance that made him stiffen up. The tech then molded him into an upright position and placed him on a cardboard platform. Another spritz... and the now sleeping hottie was ready for shipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a nearby station a rather pleased looking technician was explaining to poor Zayn that the client had changed their minds... and that the technician would be taking an early lunch break...   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marlon's eyes track a massive hand that makes a few movements above his head. Suddenly, with a gasp of breath he can move again. He streches and tries to take a look at his environment when he feels movement again. \"Ahhh merda!\" He slides head first out of the plastic bag and onto a cold glass surface. He has landed face down and sees what appears to be a vast kitchen floor below. His beautiful eyes go wide as his view is filled with the face of a cat licking its lips! He yelps and jumps to his feet only to reel backward at the face of the giant bearing down on him. \"O que \u00e9 isto?! Afasta-te de mim!?\" Marlon spins on his shoes and tries to run only to find the wall of his captor's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deixe-me ir! Deixe-me ir! Foda-se !\" Marlon feels a pull from behind as he is lifted by the waist of his jeans. His feet kick helplessly and he struggles in the air as he finds himself quickly thrust upward. The blur of the room comes into focus once again in the looming face of the giant only this time with no place to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God you look delicous!\" The giant's hot breath makes the hairs on Marlon's beard stand on end. <i>Ele acabou de dizer que eu olho delicioso. Ah Merda.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What uh, what is eso?\" Marlon tries to communicate in his broken English... </span></div></div>",

Marlon balls his foot up trying to resist the probing tongue and teeth. As he tries to recover the right foot finds itself treated to the same. The cool air of the room tickle the now saliva soaked feet as Marlson finds himself lowered back to the glass surface.

The cat peering upward gets to see Marlon's wide eyes as the giant manages to grasp him by the cuffs of his jeans and hoist him upward once more. His big hands flail outward in an attempt to find something to grasp. His beautiful bushy hair falls down over his eyes as his shirt droops revealing his lean tummy. He feels the giant's finger brush his lean abs as the massive finger rips through the buttons on his shirt and with a gentle tug he watches his shirt drift downward to land next to his shoes. The view is brief as he finds himself thrust upward by the cuffs of his jeans. The giant's face once again comes into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny model looks down into the cavern of the giant's throat now exposed by the giant's gaping mouth positioned directly below the helpless meaty model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Deus, por favor n\u00e3o! Porrrrrrrrrra!\" With a sharp tug the jeans begin to allow Marlon's muscular legs to slide free. Marlon tries to extend his feet to make them too large for the pant leg but to no avail. The giant gets one last beautiful sight of Marlon's handsome features and rugged beard before both slip rapidly between his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlon is disoriented but looks around and in dim light makes out the shape of the teeth and tongue. It is hot and humid and he tries desperately to push against a nearby molar to move out of the giant's mouth. The tongue lunges to meet his face forcing him to struggle for breath in the already tight quarters. He feels his abdomen scraping against the giant's incisors and the sensation of the giant tugging at his underwear. As his last remaining garment slides past his feet he begins to feel himself slipping forward. \"n\u00e3o n\u00e3o n\u00e3o n\u00e3o!!!\" He moves closer to the uvula despite his hands pushing against the slick tongue. He feels his ankles against the giant's sharp front teeth and he tries to get a hold. In his struggles he manages to tap the uvula with his right hand. Suddenly the seemingly random movements around him begin to coordinate. With speed he finds himself thrust into the darkness. He gasps for breath as he is pushed from behind by a wave of powerful muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an gooey plop he lands face first into the soft mucus lined stomach. He manages to sit upright in the squishy chamber and clear his eyes. The chamber is hot and humid and the stale air stings his eyes. As he tries to move the stomach begins to do its work pinning him down temporarily coating him with digestive juices. Soon he finds himself kneaded head over heels as the stomach begins the rather quick process of converting him to a more absorbable form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant, having savored every bit of the experience retrieves the doll like clothing of the super model and contemplates desert. </span></div></div>",

Dude, I'm feeling kind of closed in man!\" Neels taps on the glass indicating the desire to leave. \"You will be on your way soon, hot young man just chill.\" The tec taps a few more buttons and the scan begins.

He deposits the liberated footware into a nearby empty drinking glass. \"You looks absolutely delicious Alperen! Have you been working out a bit more?\" The casual nature of the giant's words contrast with the struggling little man who finally pulls himself free of the thick combination of starch and gravy.

Shock ran through the tiny man's body as he kicked off the bottom of the bowl to resurface. He was numb but fear kept him going as he dodged ice cubes as big as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked down at his toy with delight. </span></div></div>",

Dima made a lunge for the edge of the towel, but once again found himself scooped up against his will and deposited back into the tank this time naked from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant put on a show scooping up the tiny shoes and suit that once protected Dima's gorgeous  body. \"Ah collectables!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alvaro pulled up to the candy factory in his convertible. Before the handsome young amature model lept out of his seat he managed to snap a selfie giving a pouty face and an indecent gesture to boost his Instagram fans. It was a fan who made the offer to give him some free promotion by putting his cute self into some creative candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck him as a bit odd there were no guards at the gate but he figured like some of the other photo ops it might be after regular hours. His squeaky clean black suede sneakers squeaked a bit as he entered the front office. For today's shoot he choose to wear his trademark stonewash grey jeans and a black t-shirt. <i>Maybe they will make me into back licorice.</i> He thought to himself briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Mr. Mel! Welcome to Edible Toys!\" a man in a white coat sprang across the reception room and extended his hand. \"I am the Javier the one who contacted you and I am thrilled that you were willing to accept our offer!\" Alvero smiled with confidence. \"Nah man, thank you. I am glad to have the chance to further my modeling career. Uh, where is the photographer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Alvaro's inquiry the man in the jacket seemed momentarily flustered. \"Why I am the photographer! We uh closed things down for yearly maintenance and uh thought it would be a good time to get in some promotional work.... so let's get started shall we?\" Alvaro noticed the strange behavior but decided it was going to be cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall they went through a few rooms. As they entered the final room the lights were off. After a few moments of fumbling with a control panel the room burst into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvaro was waiting for a standard studio... instead the room was rather strange. There was a well lit stage with what appeared to be diode lit plates below. Above the stage there was a large glass bell with other scanner like instruments built in. \"Whoa! Like what is this man?\" the young hottie was caught between being truly interested and a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJavier noticed the concern and responded quickly with a burst of his own confidence. \"The latest in 3D imaging my dear man! You will be captured in every detail!  I just need you to step up here on the stage and we can get started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvaro shrugged and hopped up on the the platform. Like an old fashioned mouse trap the glass bell above the stage quickly dropped down on the unsuspecting young hottie. \"Yo! What the hell is this?!\" Alvaro jumped startled and pounded against the thick glass bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry Alvaro, not to worry! This is all part of the er... session. Just take a deep breath and relax, you may feel a little disorientation as the eh ehm scan begins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Meeeel' listened to the strange man with a shaking head. \"No fuck this man. I don't want to do this any more! Lift this damn glass thing right goddamn...n....\" The 'scanner' began to hum. Javier did not respond to the demands as he perused the control panel near the stage. With once last glance and a wink at his hot little subject he pushed a large button and the machine began to make a strange sound as if it were powering up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvaro's heart raced. \"Yo I told you to let me the fuck out! let me out!\" He looked around helplessly as the strange machine powered up around him. At first he only felt the hum of the machine but then he felt, disoriented. He was lifting off the surface of the platform \"Whoa! What the fuck?! No man shut this shit down!\" The hot young Instagram star found himself lifted a few feet from the ground as if some invisible force was lifting him. He twirled his ankles and tried to move but found that he was suspended and trapped. The crescendo of the machine was unbearable... and then with a loud click... silent. Alvaro struggled and whimpered in what was now dead silence. He looked out towards his finger tips trying to get them to reach a wall or place where they might be able to pull him to safety. Instead his lean little digits appeared to be sliding into the slieve of his long black shirt. His eyes grew wide as he realized his shoulder wasn't bending the way it should for that to happen! \"Ahhhh Ahhh What the fuc.....\" his attention was diverted by the sound of his right sneaker hitting the platform below followed promptly by his left. He scanned with his eyes and a bend of the neck his skinny jeans hung straight to the platform below without any feet sticking out! The silence of the machine broke with a new hum from above. \"What the...? What the? Oh fuuuuu.......\" In an instant a strong vaccum pulled Alvaro's modified form upward and with a final mechanical buzz his jeans underwear and black shirt plopped into the platform.</span></div></div>",

Faster than his senses and respond he shoots through a passageway and rolls onto a very soft surface. \"What the fuck man what the fuck?!\" He kicks around in the bright white material and soon is able to sit upright. He is in a brightly lit white room and he is on a kingsized bed. Across from the bed is a table with his clothes on them. His sneakers sit nearby on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart still racing the young man takes no time to jump out of the bed and get his clothes on. As he does he notices a strange scent, almost like almond and cotton candy and the jeans and long sleeved t-shirt seem like they are sticky. He sees himself in the mirror and everything checks out. He then checks the door.. <i>Am I dreaming? What is this?</i> he opens the door and steps outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah 'Meeeel' you are ready for shipping!\" Alvaro turns to go back into the door but it is locked. Beyond the illusion of the hallway our hot young internet model can make out the lab he thought he only dreamt about... and it is massive! His eyes follow the sound of that familiar voice.... \"Yo! What the fuck man?!\" Alvaro jumps back at the approach of the massive figure. Javier leans down looking over the rims of his glasses as if examining a bug. \"I see you found your candy clothing! How tasty! I sure wish I was the client, they are going to have a rather meaty little confection.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my clothes! What the fuck are you talking about? What have you done to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Javier smiles down and withdrawals an object from the darkness behind him. \"As you can see my tasty boy your old clothes are right here. You could use your old sneaker as a house. I assure you you are wearing the latest in edible styles. You are now officially and edible toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's words pour over poor, now bite-sized, Alvaro.... \"You see my dear fellow any young man with a handsome face and a cell phone now considers himself a model. As a morsel of a boy you have fetched me a fortune! My client will play with you, then when he is tired gobble you up leaving not a toe behind. You narcissistic little men are a gold mine!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A giant face passes in front of the clear container and Alvaro's eyes go wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud scratching noises fill the container as the giant fiddles with the packaging. Finally a rush of fresh air enters the stale container and Alvaro finds himself laying on the table still strapped firmly to the cardboard. \"Hey! You can't do this!

He manages a few steps before the giant's massive hand captures him. \"Hey man let me go! You can't do this let me go!!\" Alvaro swipes at the air as he flies upward secured by the back of his black long sleeved t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvaro holds out his hands in a vain attempt to fight back the warm humid slightly acidic breath of the giant. The looming mouth turns into a toothy smile. \"Whoa... Ahhhh!!!!\" Alvaro's brief pause is broken by a continued upward ascent. His stomach turning ride stops again. \"What the fuck.... what the fuck?!\" Alvaro kicks out as he looks downward at the giant's mouth now opening wide. \"Oh shit.. no no noooooo!!!\" Alvaro tries to kick out as both of his feet and legs plunge into the hot acrid mouth of the giant. His thighs sense the presence of the massive teeth but they do no more than scrape his legs. For what feels like a million years poor little, no longer cocky, Alvaro Mel squirms as the giant savors every part of him below the waist! Eventually the sense of the giant's invasive tongue ceases and Alvaro feels a strange sense of relief as he begins to leave the mouth. As a final departing act Alvaro feels the giant's teeth clench around his ankles forcing him to leave his sneakers behind. One sock manages to cling to his right foot while both the sneaker and sock leave the left. Cool air tickles the soles of his saliva soaked feet as he once again finds himself heaved around by the massive hand. The movement stops and Alvaro finds himself looking across at the giant's cavernous oral orifice. In the center of his tongue are two dislodged sneakers and a sock. The mouth closes briefly and opens again. Alvaro begins to struggle as he sees that his shoes and sock are gone, presumably deep within the giant.  </span></div></div>",

He looks back to see the giant watching with a satisfied smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvaro's mind reflects on the possible futility of his actions but there is no time for doubt. He notices his jeans are starting to melt away, likely because they are made of sugar rather than cloth. He finds a picture on the counter and slides on his still wet feet as he makes the corner. Now that he is out of the direct sight of the giant he looks around for a possible escape. He spies an old land line phone cord to the ground but it sits on a higher counter. The only way up is by climbing a gelatin that rather conveniently sits near the ledge. With no more time to think the handsome little fellow darts across the table springs onto the green desert and tries to jump to the next ledge. \"Oh shit no fuck man no!!!\" Alvaro's feet sink into the gelatinous material. He struggles violently but only sinks further. His shirt manages to stick to the surface of the mold and pulls up and off as he sinks into the mold. His protests are muffled by by his wobbling prison. He feels movement as the plate turns rather slowly. The giant looks with delight at his shirtless little morsel suspended in sweet green gelatin. </span></div></div>",

He was in the park making another Instagram selfie for his fans when there was a blinding flash of light.. and now he was here. In this odd place. Out of shock he continued to hold a box of doughnuts open as if to offer them to his fans. He looked down at his boots and the massive slab of marble that extended for a half kilometer by length and a quarter by width... it was a giant kitchen counter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is this?</i> Alperen asked himself in disbelief. As he turned to soak it all in he saw the giant. His heart was already beating faster, but now it was racing out of control. \"Whoa what the fuck!?\" Alperen dropped the box of doughnuts and ran. He shouted as his escape was blocked by the wall of a massive hand sweeping towards him. He screamed out and attempted to find freedom, but quickly he found himself dangling by the back of  his black jacket held with a firm grip. His stomach churned with a thousand butterflies as he felt the blood rush to his toes with the rapid upward movement. As quickly as the motion began it halted. Alperen's mouth fell open as he spied the massive face blocking most of his view. The giant's breath was warm against Alperen's exposed skin. Alperen whimpered helplessly and struggled to get out of the jacket but then as he looked down at the tile floor far below he reversed action finding himself hanging onto the end of his coat with both hands. The giant's left hand came up from below granting Alperen momentary safety, but no security. Alperen struggled to balance on the uneven and slightly moving surface of the giant's left palm. Finally, he gathered the courage to speak. \"What is this? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's massive lips formed a smile from pursed lips to a wide toothy grin. \"Why, I am your biggest fan of course!

This is totally fucking crazy!\" Alperen tried to climb towards a wrist only to find himself lifted upward by his right boot covered foot. The giant held onto the sole of the boot forcing Alperen's foot to support the weight of his body. It hurt and the boot held firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never joke about a good meal\" The giant winked and brushed the zipper on the side of Alperen's boot allowing gravity to win the war on his tiny body. \"Ahhhhh!\" Alperen cried out as he fell only to feel the sensation of a soft palm slow him down lowering him onto the counter. Alperen noticed the cold surface of the counter top on his now sock covered foot but on high adrenaline he didn't bother to stop. I have to hide, the tiny model thought to himself as he ran imbalanced across the cold stone surface. He wondered why the giant was not stopping him, but he couldn't afford to look back. As he ran he noticed dining room candles being lit and the sound of music in the background. Just as he reached the far end of the counter his progress was halted by the massive stem of a wine glass deposited directly in his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like wine with my meal. It enhances the flavor of the meat.\" Alperen screamed out as he found himself lifted beneath his arm pits and held firmly between two pinched fingers.

His mass was small, but the balance on the top heavy glass was easy to upset and it quickly crashed to the counter delivering its contents in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughtly little meat ball!\" Alperen heard the giant's words as he found himself jerked about chaotically. \"I will need something to clean this up!\" Alperen held his plump muscular arms close to his torso as the giant tugged at his t-shirt. The force of the giant won out and soon Alperen felt the cold air of the room tickling his shaved upper body. His t-shirt was so tiny it only soaked up a tiny fraction of the wine that was now scattered across the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lowered him to the counter and turned, likely to get a better towel than Alperen's doll sized t-shirt. The moment he reached the counter top he made another run for safety. At the far end of the counter there were utensils in a holder, a fake fruit bowl and other places to hide. Alperen stopped only to kick off the remaining boot that was slowing him down. He could hear the giant humming as he went to clean off the counter. Alperen slid slightly as he rounded the cutlery holder and reached the in-counter range top. At the back of the counter he spied a small hole produced to run electric, but perfect for a morsel sized Instagram model. Alperen spared no time dashing to the small opening and diving through. He thought he had succeeded until he felt the sensation fingers pressed down firmly on both feet. \"Oh shit! No!!!!\" Just a few seconds more and he might have made his way to relative safety behind the counter and in the wall, but the fates had other plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted the model found himself hurling upward once again. His uneasy grip in the giant's hands was short lived as he found himself dropped into a massive glass bowl. He attempted many runs to make it out before he collapsed in exhaustion and tears. The giant reached in briefly stripping off his wine soaked little socks. Alperen now sat shirtless and barefoot in the center of the massive bowl sulking in defeat. </span></div></div>",

The giant approached the bowl again and Alperen cried out at the pair of massive hands that managed to pluck off his remaining clothes. \"Time to marinade!\" Alperen gasped as he found himself drenched and then treading in red wine. He tried to swim to the edge of the bowl, but his hands and feet merely slipped helplessly. He tried no to, but found himself gulping a bit of the wine. After what seemed like hours the giant lifted the bowl and poured Alperen into a stainless steal colander giving him a tiny towel to dry himself. Red wine stained his toe nails and hair. He belched realizing his stomach was now filled with a considerable amount of wine. The massive hands returned dropping the buff little man into another bowl filled with flour. He gasped and struggled as the giant worked to cover his muscular body with flour. Alperen peered up through the dust with flour covered eyelids. \"Please stop... ple\" he was lifted again, this time deposited into a bowl of slimy egg he nearly drowned as he kicked and squirmed in the thick protein liquid. He managed to clear his eyes only to see his reflection in a nearby surface. Now powder white from the flour and shiny from the dripping egg Alperen could hardly recognize himself.  He cried out has his feet landed on the sharp crusty surface of bread crumbs which now stuck to the flour and the egg. He could feet crumbs between his toes ..... Alperen had watched schnitzel made countless times and he knew what came next. \"Please..... please don't fry me!!!\" He whined out as the giant laid him gently into a bath of hot oil. Strangely it only tingled and felt almost like a shallow hot spring, but when he was removed he could not move his arms and legs. From the corner of his eye in the water glass he could see what he had become. His well sculpted figure was now completely covered in golden bread crumbs and his head lay against a wedge of lemon. His spread out legs were divided by a mound of roasted potatoes and under his right and left arms were smaller mounds of pickled cabbage. </span></div></div>",

Hi Welcome to Edible Models please write your modeling stats down and we will serve you both shortly.\" The two handsome young men looked at each other in disbelief. \"How did you know who we are? Why do we need to write our shoe sizes and waist to get a table?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbly hostess peered over her glasses \"Well, our standards are very high and we only serve the best! You are very highly sought after models.\" This satisfied the boy's curiosity for the time and they complied.  Soon the hostess led them through a few series of doors to an elevator. \"When you get to the top floor you will be served.\" The hostess winked and left the two boys to enter the elevator and hit the button for the top floor. A bright light greeted them with the swish of the elevator doors and both young men stepped out the door quickly closing behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude hold that door!\" Neels Visser screemed desperately as a group of hot young men rushed the Stenmark twins trying to get to the elevator. \"Hey, mate like what's the matter?\" Zac asked a bit taken back by the group of desperate young men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! This isn't a cafe for models, it's a cafe for people who eat models!\" Zac and Jordan scanned the surroundings. It looked like a waiting room, the bright light was coming from above and the window where the world appeared to be endless light. Jordan ventured closer. Beyond the window lie the massive interior of a restaurant kitchen the size of a canyon. </span></div></div>",

He was stripped, tied up with sausage casing and positioned on a plate with a few vegetables and a tiny dinner roll stuffed in his mouth. The plate passed by the models location and they saw his wide eyes as he disappeared on a server's tray beyond a pair of swinging doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this shit?\" Zac's voice was high with panic. \"Brother we have got to get out of here.\" Jordan reached for his cell phone... no signal. The elevator opened again, this time Drew Schiff appeared with Charles Laurent. Another scream, this time Neels Visser was plucked from the room. Neels found himself stripped and trapped in a Neels Visser stuffed bell pepper. The chef artistically arranged his removed clothes around the plate and put a dollop of sour cream on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah bro nah!\" Sean cried out as the plate that once held his buddy returned. It was clean except for a few sauce foot prints that led to the center of the plate and what looked like the final pounce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Zac... I don't like the looks of this!\" Jordan looked up to see the chef over the top of them again, this time, the chef's eyes were on the two young men. Zac cried out and ran the opposite direction of Jordan. He reached the wall of the room and managed to grab a bit of molding. His grip was no match for the powerful hand of the chef. He squirmed helplessly as he felt the strong upward force of acceleration at the hand of the chef. Zac's stomach churned with butterflies and soon found himself in the opposite hand of his brother moving rapidly away from the holding room.</span></div></div>",

Confused, Brent twists in your grip, his firm butt pressed deep against your palm, and looks between two of your fingers.  Below he can see four other young men, all as tan as him, and all in nothing but their underwear, litters of clothing under them in a massive pile.  That\u2019s when he recognizes them.  Squatting in the jar are his two brothers, Brice and Blake, and his best friends Caleb Burton and Ben Azalert.  The latter is rubbing his heads having just been pelted by Brent\u2019s missing footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrent is that you?\u201d Screams up Caleb. All four seem to have been trying their best to sleep, considering the circumstances, only moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ben yells, terrified, \u201cthis psycho killed Lexi and Loren!\u201d  That\u2019s when Brent notices that unlike his best friends, his two brothers don\u2019t look terrified.  Instead they are teary-eyed and inconsolably sobbing.  \u201cThe asshole took them when he grabbed us, and when he saw they were girls he just squashed Lexi and ripped Loren to pieces!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut bro that\u2019s not the worst of it!  Then he ground them up in a blender and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest is lost on Ben.  He swallows hard as terror gives way to helplessness and sadness.  His beautiful sister and Loren... both dead.  And horribly too.  And he and his buddies were next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-eat us too!\u201d Caleb finished.  The jar was so stuffed with trendy clothing that Brent realized the lads peering up from inside, sitting on them, were only the most recent additions to the giant\u2019s \u201ccollection\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Brent,\u201d you chuckle.  \u201cGirls just don\u2019t taste as good eaten whole.  It\u2019s the boys who pac the real flavor and you five looked delicious.\u201d  So that was why his friends never showed up to Target for the video.  Only the Stokes brothers had made it and they were undoubtedly confused as hell.  First the checkout kid disappeared while they were buying new swim suits... that must\u2019ve been the disitntigrated young man mentioned by the giant earlier... and then he vanished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s finish taking you out of your packaging and have a little taste test before I decide how to consume you tasty boys.  Hmm...\u201d you inhale deeply.  \u201cYour aroma is intoxicating.  Maybe a desert!  Brent, Brice, Blake, Ben, and Burton.  Five B\u2019s.  Maybe a Boys and berry pie?\u201d You lick your lips for emphasis, wondering how you\u2019ll end up torturing them before the preparations begin.  After all you need some entertainment before the meal, whatever you decide that meal will be!</span></div></div>",

He can\u2019t dislodge it and you hear his muffled shrieks.  GortunTely he can breathe but try as he might, as hard as he pulls and no matter what grip he gets he is lodged in good, his face full of your snot and dried phlegm.  A second later ben is snatched up and pushed into the other nostril. They both sputter and lick wildly, hitting one another, clutching one another for help, and finally go limp, realizing they\u2019re stuck in there until you let them out.  It feels funny having two teen boys dangling limply from your nostril, swaying to and fro.  With wide eyes Brent\u2019s two brothers see the shadow of your hand come over them and they let out tiny shrieks.  You fold Brice in the middle so that his chest is hitting his knees and his pert little butt sticks out so cutely you can\u2019t help a quick nibble, a long lick up his ass and back, and then a deep slurp into his mostly hairless pink hole.  He squats at all three.  He is then lodged into your left ear, his butt pushed firmly in, so he is stuck bent over, his legs unable to even bend.  You repeat the process with Blake.  By now the boys in your nose have finally given up fighting completely and their little toes graze the top of your lip.  Your tongue darts out again and tickles the cute smooth boy feet, softened from the beach and pampered lifestyle, you suckle at the exquisite taste as they struggle anew.  You\u2019re enjoying their taste so much you forget Brent is stuck in your hand for a moment.  It isn\u2019t until you look in the mirror, laughing at the sight that is your face, legs and arms and faces sticking out all over, some limp, some screaming, some twirling helplessly, but all conscious, Undamaged, terrified, and disgusted.  Thankfully with your ears clogged you can\u2019t hear Brent\u2019s crying and cursing.  Finally done suckling on the feet of his friends for a moment your eyes fal back on brent, shuttling him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see... where to put you Brent, my tasty little Morsel.  I could put you in my mouth, but I\u2019m afraid I might swallow you accidentally when I taste your mouthwatering flesh.  There\u2019s always my other hole... that could be quite pleasureble... plus I could decide Head first or feet first with a game of \u201cheads or tails\u201d.  But then again, I could always use you to take care of my little friend.  That\u2019s when Brent notices the massive erection poking at the front of your jeans.</span></div></div>",

They look like mini fat sausages that I just wanna nibble right off the bone.\u201d  You bring both hands together and lower Grayson and Ethan into your mouth up to their ankles, mingling their feet together.  Yet you can taste the difference between the lads, although you don\u2019t know whose feet taste sweeter and whose are a bit tangier, you can correctly tell them apart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue continues dancing over the meaty digits, snaking between each toe as you make \u201cmmm\u201d noises, your eyes fluttering in bliss at the tastes and aromas.

Nick whines and struggles as his muscular hands try to keep their grasp. \"Whoa.... noooooo!\" Nick cries out as he finally loses his grasp. A stray staple on a 2 X 4 snags his t-shirt giving him a few seconds reprieve before tearing the shirt from his body and sending him through the hole in the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant smiles as he watches Nick's barefoot shirtless form slide helplessly up the clear tube of the vacuum and into the dust holder. </span></div></div>",

His look of shock, however, quickly reverts to a cocky smile. \"Man! This is one elaborate prank! did Jeremy put you up to this?!\"  He manages to dislodge his shoe from the caramelized onions and brown sugar and rather surprisingly walks towards you across the plate! \"Man this is sweet! How much did it cost for you guys to set all this up? You can tell by his body movements he is confident he is about to reach some sort of projection screen.

Shit man what the fuck!?\" Chase struggles as he finds your all-too-real hand clenched tightly to the back of his jacket with pinched fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase's stomach churns with butterflies as he soars upward. You bring him within a few inches of your face and you see his face wrinkle at the sent of your hot breath. \"Yo I don't know what this shit is about, but you had better put me back to fucking normal!\" Despite the hot young man's obvious fear you can tell he is used to being in charge and more than a bit entitled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is about my amusement and pleasure my dear young man. You are mine from those carefully sculpted hairs on your handsome little head to those toes you have locked away in your shoes.\" With thumb and forefinger you surgically pluck the laces of his right shoe. \"Leave my fucking foot alone dude!\" Chase flails helplessly in the air.  </span></div></div>",

Amongst the afternoon din a drone speeds down the beach preparing to make a pickup. The command \"Hot Italian Beef\" flashes in the visual processor as it scans the numerous restaurants looking for the right place. Finally the drone comes upon Leni's Italian Food and it  switches to hover mode.  It sees a plate with the desired item being placed on a nearby table... it brings the cheese covered sandwich into focus and fires off it's quantum entanglement beam... just as Tyler Gattuso joggs by... With a flash the hot young fitness trainer and model disappears from the afternoon din. His headphones clatter unceremoniously to the ground. A homeless man witnesses the event but decides to ignore it for fear of not being believed anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoa what the fuck?! </i>Tyler feels something strike him and a blinding flash of light. The beach scene gives way to a strange tunnel and Tyler feels himself falling. He glances down past his camo Nikes to see a point of light rushing up on him quickly. And as quickly as it began he is standing still again. His feet are firmly planted on some sort shiny white flooring. He looks up and around. <i>Man this looks like a giant plate!</i> he thinks to himself as he spins around. \"Whoa what the fuck man! what the fuck!\" Tyler spins and cowers as his eyes meet those of a giant looking down on him with what appears to be surprise. </span></div></div>",

He gazes up at the massive scene around him: A 15 foot tall wine glass filled with what appears to be gallons of red wine, near the china plate he stands on there are massive pieces of silverware, at least three times his height long. He spins around to take it all in when a voice draws his attention \"Hello Mr. Sewall, I hope your transport here was not too stressful\" The hot young model squints to make out where the voice is coming from in the dark when a face, equal in proportion to the massive fancy dinner stuff appears from the shadows. \"Don't be tense Alex, there's nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... what the fuck is this!?\" Alex's question stammers out as he turns on his sneakers to escape.

What the fuck is this?\" Matt Williams eyes were wide as he explored his disorientating environment. He had been jogging in Austin when a drone had approached him... a flash of light and the next thing he knew he was standing with a bunch of guys in this strange simulator. \"Dude it looks like some sort of VR thing!\" Neels Visser pressed against the glass looking at the massive restaurant scene around him. \"Isso \u00e9 uma piada?

Beyond the glass, a single diner's face loomed large on the \"screen\". \"That one! Matt Williams. I want to eat him and may I please start with the Emblem3 soup appetizer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank full of hot models all trained their eyes on Matt. \"Eat me?! Dude no fucking way!

He looks on in disbelief as the giant with him in tow walks past a pot with three young men swimming frantically as another giant captures them with a ladle and transfers them to a soup bowl. \"Emblem3 ready!\" A man on the line shouts as the bowl containing the three young men is whisked out of the kitchen towards the hungry client. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive cook drops the terrified, disoriented model onto a stainless steel countertop.

He tries to make a run for it only to be plucked back up this time by the back of his double layered t-shirts. \"Let me go you fuck let me go!\" Matt kicks out as the giant reaches out and pries on the heel of his right, then left sneaker pulling them off. \"What the fuck are you doing man?!\" Matt protests in vain as his dislodged 10 1/2 sneakers are tossed into a small stainless steel line insert.. The giant takes a moment to pinch both feet plucking free the tiny black socks looking down at his captive \"Want to make sure you stay nice and tender big guy! Hope the time in the gym was worth it!\" Matt sputters to respond as he finds himself thrust to the cold table surface. \"Don't worry little \"broh\" the only knife you will see tonight are the guest's incisors!\" before Matt can respond a large sharp knife runs the length of his back cutting free his double layers of long and short sleeved t-shirts.  </span></div></div>",

He runs at the steep walls of his latest prison but with each attempt finds his diminished self back in the middle. In the distance the chef busies himself setting out a tort shell and filling it partially with steamed vegetables. The rapid movements of the pan being turned and dropped shake Matt's glass bowl. \"Dude I can pay you anything you want! Just let me out dude!

With a less than gentle tug Matt's jogging pants are pulled free and with another pass of the knife Matt finds himself freed of every stitch of clothing. The hot young model of a man never has felt so vulnerable for good reason!  Plunked feet first into the center of the pastry Matt tries to struggle free. Before he can get far a lid of thick pastry is lowered over him leaving only his head sticking out. The potato and vegetable mixture weighs heavily against his chest as he struggles to find breath. \"No man... no.... \" the beefy pastry is lifted to an oven. Sweat pours from Matt's face as he spends what feels like an eternity in the oven lit only by the orange glow of the electric element. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air outside of the oven feels like a freezer as he finally is removed.

Finally enough filling was removed Matt was able to move a bit but still not enough to escape. He winced as the giant's fork grazed his ankle. \"Are you ticklish beefy?\" the giant's face lit up at his discovery.

The giant drew the meat from his pie up to his nose to inhale the rich smell of baked gym rat. As the olfactory inspection reached Matt's athletic feet the test turned to one of taste. The giant's massive tongue lept out to meet Matt's soles. Matt squirmed reflexively and cried out as he found each of his muscular legs pulled into the soft pink mouth of his captor. Matt cried out and wriggled as the giant proceeded to cover each leg in saliva and suck gently removing any remaining sauce from the time as a pie filling. The lingual probe continued until Matt found his hot little self pressed face first between two massive lips. Then, as quickly as it began the invasion stopped. Matt laid exhausted in the palm of his captor looking past his feet at the face of the oppressor. The look in the giant's eyes gave Matt one last burst of energy as he screamed and tried to roll free of the giant's hand. In one smooth motion the young man found himself thrust feet first into the waiting mouth. This time there seemed a finality to the giant's actions as Matt found himself buried waste deep then shoulder deep. \"Stop please stop!\" Matt whined one last time as the giant tilted his head back and opened wide. Matt saw the lighted sign of the restaurant disappear between the wall of two closed lips. He reached out for the tip of the tongue only to feel the toes on his right foot glaze the back of the giant's throat. He had sealed his fate as powerful muscles surged into action pulling Matt down the esophagus and into the awaiting stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sputtered and coughed in the hot and acidic environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check please\" The customer had a wonderful meal!</span></div></div>",

The beefy young model could only remember entering a chamber to be 3D imaged for a promotional doll at a company called Edible Toys Incorporated. They asked some rather detailed health questions asked him to remove his phone \"to keep from interfering with the equipment\" next thing he remembered he was here in this dark room with no moving air. His boots slid across the surface, sort of like a particle board from the feel. Above a very faint light came from a few small holes in the ceiling. \"Hello! Hey! What is this?! Somebody open a door!\"  Michael shouted in desperation. From beyond his dim cell he could feel the ground moving like he was on a train or a plane... so strange. A few muddled voices and the sudden feeling of dropping. Michael found himself on the floor as if he had just been through an earthquake. <i>I am so gonna sue this Edible Toys </i>Michael thought to himself as he regained his balance and stood up. Just then the ceiling of the room began to emit strange scratching sounds like there was someone on the other side.  A burst of light signaled the opening of the ceiling. Michael stepped back shielding his eyes from the sudden change. \"Uh hello!? Yo what is this shit? Did the scan work?\" Michael's voice trailed as he scanned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was without windows or doors and seemed to be completely made of particleboard. Michael looked down at his boots and noticed he was in the same black skinny jeans and beige cotton shirt as for the scan. Above he could see only white at first and some sort of shadowy figure... \"Holy shit what the fuck man!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive face peered down at Michael with a pleased smile. \"Michael! You looked so great I couldn't ignore you!\" Michael Dean's heart raced as he tried to make sense of what was happening. \"Oh man.. like this isn't real, like you are some sort of joke, some projection or something? I mean what the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked down at his new toy with a smirk as the tiny model fished for understanding. \"Ah Michael, the brochure said you might be disoriented, what is the last thing you remember?\" Michael responded quickly hoping to finally have an rational explanation for what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, that is right you were made into an edible toy. We are going to play and when I get board with you I will gobble you up like the other hotties.\" Michael let out a yell and tried to run to the far side of the box only to find himself lifted up by the back of his jeans.</span></div></div>",

The beefy young model kicked helplessly as his boots left the security of the cardboard box. The young man's world blurred and his stomach reeled with butterflies at the strange ride. As the upward motion stopped Michael found himself face-to-face with the giant. He was so close he could feel the giant man's steamy breath against his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My you are a beefy guy!\" The giant's massive brown eyes noticeably scanned Michael from head to toe. \"Just think, all of that time you spent eating protein supplements and working out was all for me!\" With his declaration he poked an index finger into Michael's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what are you doing? No!\" Michael protested as the giant proceeded to pry on his right boot in an attempt to remove it. Michael Dean clenched his toes, but his effort was no match against the massive fingers. Michael's movement temporarily paused as he watched the dislodged boot travel towards the giant's nostrils. \"Ahhh you smell as savory as you look!\" The giant set the freed boot down in the box below as if it were a prized possession. The giant repeated the action with the second boot then eyed Michael's kicking sock covered feet with temptation. \"Dude! Stay away from my feet!\" Michael's voice of attempted intimidation only aroused the giant further as the giant forced Michael Dean's two meaty legs together and sniffed his feet. Sniffing was not enough for the engrossed giant and soon his tongue lashed out drawing both of Michael's plump athletic feet into the giant's waiting mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, dude this is disgusting! Stop and put me down!\" Michael's demands were ignored as the giant probed the beefcake's feet with his inquiring tongue. Michael panicked as a suction sensation pulled his socks off. Eventually two saliva soaked feet reemerged from between the massive lips and Michael found himself deposited into the giant's awaiting left hand. Creeped out and terrified the tiny jock massaged his violated feet now covered in the giant's thick saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to that my little hottie\" the giant moved in close with a smirking grin \"that was just the appetizer!\"</span></div></div>",

I can do with you whatever my desire. As a matter of fact, I think it is time for a game of cat and mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Michael could respond he found himself set on the surface of the counter next to the box that once held him. Michael noticed the label on the box \"Edible Toys Incorporated, Making hot clueless jocks into a fun snacks since 1962\"  Quickly Michael sprang to his feet and began to run.<i> If I can escape this fucking lunatic I can find help and be returned to my normal size!</i> as Michael's thoughts raced he scanned for his escape route. The box sat on the edge of a long surface that seemed to be a kitchen island. On the far side of the island there was a short drop that led to counter with a stove and oven. Across the great cavern of the kitchen there was a counter with appliances like a blender and a toaster and a phone with a cord that appeared to reach the floor below. Ever aware of the giant watching him Michael made his move. He ran across the counter the sound of his heavy breathing and the patter of his bare feet dominating the environment. Soon he reached the first counter drop off. It was about 5 inches but from his perspective a drop of about 8 feet to the hard surface below. Athletic he had little trouble but as he reached the stove top the giant stood between him and the third counter placing a pan on the stove. \"Don't mind me little hottie! Just remember all of this ends inside my tummy!\" The giant pretended to ignore the hot blond man as he slid behind the countertop stove and made his way to the next surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god oh fuck!\" Michael Dean jumped twice before he could get a grip on the smooth ledge of the raised third counter. He succeeded and made his way to the appliances and the phone. The phone had a winding cord that almost reached the floor. Michael had a fair amount of experience with rock climbing but never without a belay rope! As he descended on the green cord he scanned for the next step. He could see a crack in the doorway to the kitchen that appeared to lead outside. There's my chance! he thought to himself as he reached the end of the cord and dropped the 10 or more inches to the ceramic tile below. As he made his way to the door the giant blocked the path. \"Sorry Mr. Dean! You will have to choose another way. The veggies are just about ready for me to add the meat!\" Micheal gasped and ran the other direction darting chaotically in search of an escape. He spotted a dark crevasse below the counter and decided to make a go for it. He screamed in defeat as he found the opening only went an inch back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant knew how the game was going to end all along <i>the cat always wins the meaty little mouse </i>the giant chuckled to himself as he pulled on Michael's right foot to extract him from the false hiding place.  </span></div></div>",

He kicked out with his free left foot to try and escape the giant's firm grasp. Soon the bite sized little hottie was dangling upside down in the face of his captor. \"Michael my hot little man haven't you figured it out? You are going to do anything I want.... and I am going to eat every last blond lock and meaty toe!\" The giant hummed to himself as he proceeded to pull downward on Dean's shirt forcing his arms to dangle temporarily before crossing in defiance and then waving around as if to find something to grasp. \"My Micheal Dean you must have had a legs day!\" The giant marveled and licked his lips at the two succulent appendages now wrapped tightly in black denim. \"These are going to bread very nicely!\" Micheal groaned and protested as he found himself gripped firmly around the torso. He tried to bend his legs but the force of the giant's hand was too much and soon he watched his jeans join his boots and shirt in the Edible Toys box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My all this cat and mouse fun made you get a bit ripe!\" The giant bounced the tiny model helplessly between his fingers as he walked across the kitchen to a nearby sink. \"Let's get you cleaned up!\" Michael yelled out once more as he found himself dropped unceremoniously into a large pot filled with hot soapy water. Michael surfaced and swam through the cloud of bubbles for the edge only to find himself submerged once more by the giant's massive hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael Dean struggled and gasped as he found himself manhandled by the giant. \"Ooo aren't you a ticklish little man!\" Michael Dean convulsed as his feet and armpits were subjected to a stiff plastic brush both tickling and cleansing his parts of soil. After an extended time in the soapy water the giant lifted him up, indicated with an exaggerated puffed face for little Michael Dean to hold breath before dropping him into the rinse. Finally Michael was plucked from his last swim and dropped without caution onto a large terrycloth towel with a small bit of paper towel for him to self dry. Michael whimpered and tried to pass on the towel for escape but soon the giant's hand took control and pressed his struggling form against the massive blotter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! I bet you are exhausted little hottie. I bet you are looking forward to getting eaten by this point eh?\" The giant looked at his captive with feigned empathy. </span></div></div>",

He smiled and patted his stomach as he remembered his last visit to Earth. The Tim Tebo's tiny clothes stood suspended in a jar as if his hot form still graced them.

Is there anybody out there!?\" Ryan stepped towards a point in the darkness cupping a hand under his eyes to try and see into the dimmer background beyond. HIs white Adidas sneakers squeaked a bit on the shiny glass surface. He wore fashionably torn skinny jeans and a tight black t-shirt. Ryan knew he was hot and he didn't mind promoting his brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Greasley! Welcome to my spaceship! I was just reading through your book and I must say the recipes here look very tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's eyes widened and he went into flight for fight mode scanning the darkness for the source of the loud voice. A face ten times as tall as Ryan's entire body appeared out of the darkness directly behind the young model. \"I do hope I didn't startle you too badly using my teleporter as you will soon see my coming down to speak with you might have been... problematic.\" Ryan spun on his heels to meet the source of the voice. \"Holy shit! What is this!? Like what did you just tell me?\" Ryan backed up away from the towering face as he felt the giant's hot breath against his skin. The warm wind had a strange... alien smell Ryan did not care for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now mister Greasely I just wanted to have some pointers on that delicious salad you suggested. I assure you your visit here will be brief.\" The giant raised innocent looking eyebrows hoping Ryan would see his cooperation as a way out of his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... yeah mate sure why not.\" Ryan's voice sounded as if he didn't quite believe what he was experiencing. <i>Please the giant alien, get home in time for a protein shake and bed</i> Ryan thought as he slowly approached the massive face to cooperate. \"Alright then big guy you will need 200 grams of romaine lettuce, Two tomatoes and......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid that salad would be much too small! I must scale up the recipe!\"  The giant reached out for Ryan causing him to cry out. Ryan could see beyond the blinding platform. It was like something out of a science fiction movie! There were strange lights and consoles everywhere. Near place where Ryan was standing in the blinding light just a few moments before was a rather normal looking tele screen. Ryan felt a moderate sense of relief as he found himself deposited on what looked like a scanner bed near the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... lettuce onions tomato.... \" the giant hummed as he went about beaming in the ingredients for his massive salad. \"Don't forget the protein... you will need 50 grams of chicken or equivalent lean meat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant turned to face Ryan. \"Hmmmm all those tiny little chickens... let's see what the scale value is.... ah here I need 35kg of lean meat\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan heard the number and gasped hoping the giant wouldn't notice... he did \"What's wrong Ryan is there something wrong with my calculations?\" The question hung in the air as Ryan's handsome face curled into a nervous grin. \"Uh no, that just happens to be my mass exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan stepped back as the massive face leaned in towards him. \"Why you delicious looking little man!

The giant watched with glee as his tiny captive hopped from the scanner and proceeded across the control console. Ryan's tiny muscles bulged as he used his upper body to climb down the console to the floor. Ryan's sneaker soon became lodged in some sort of goo the alien had tracked in from one of his planetary visits. \"Oh Ryan! I am a terrible house keeper do excuse the mess!\" The giant reached down towards Ryan forcing the hottie to ditch the glued tennis shoes in the strange substance. \"Oh drat, I had hoped it was time to eat!\" the giant feigned defeat as he watched the bite sized little man climb up a nearby shelf. \"It is a long way down my dear boy how do you plan to get off my ship?\" Ryan ignored the taunting running along the shelf. Ryan's heightened senses were able to notice the contents of the shelf one container having what looked like a swimmer trapped in amber. \"I've got to get home!\" Ryan muttered to himself as he reached what looked like a source of light and maybe escape. He wriggled into a crack in a small door that led from the shelf in the alien's room to somewhere else.  I've got to buy time... think Ryan think Ryan struggled to think of a way out ... his usually slow beating heart raced. The other side of the door was a dead end. It was just the cover to a port and Ryan found himself pressed against a clear barrier looking at the Earth far below. He whimpered as he felt the pressure of the port door removed and a massive force plucking him up by the back of his tight t-shirt. \"Let me go! Let me go!\" Ryan kicked out and swung as he dangled helplessly between the giant alien's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! I hope you enjoyed your little tour of my ship.

Ryan tried to run but found both feet stuck firmly to the strange scanner platform. Ryan looked down below him as numbers projected onto the scanner bed gave the result. \"37 kilograms! My Ryan did we have a leg day? Your are a tad bit meatier than you reported!\" The giant poked a finger towards Ryan's lean stomach and flicked downward releasing the fasteners on Ryan's tight jeans. \"I ..... want .... to ..... go home!!!!\" Ryan's voice quivered as he found himself bobbed up and down by the legs of his skinny jeans until he was forced out of them.  \"Let's get you out of that shirt little man!\" Ryan hit the surface of the table and tried to run only to find two giant thumbs pushing his uncooperative head through the neck hole of his t-shirt. The spacecraft suddenly felt a bit colder as Ryan once again tried to run only to find two fingers around his abdomen drawing him back towards the giant. \"Why do you humans wear so much clothing! Such terrible packaging for food!\" With a final pluck and pull Ryan found himself completely naked and trapped at the will of the space giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked down at Ryan's naked form and licked his lips. With a grasp on Ryan's right ankle the giant walked over to the awaiting salad. Ryan could only look down at the massive pile of lettuce and tomatoes (there were hundreds at least) when he felt the pressure on his ankle release. \"Ahhhhhhhhh!\" the beefy young trainer landed in the pile of lettuce and immediately tried to climb to freedom. The oily salad dressing clung to Ryan's skin making him very slippery. He cried in horror as he found the bowl that contained him and the rest of the Ryan Greasely salad proved too steep for escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last of the leafy treat crunching between his massive teeth the giant peered down at the bit of lean protein curled up in a fetal position at the bottom of the bowl. With his fork the giant proceeded to trap both of Ryan's wrists lifting him out of the bowl. \"Please no! Help somebody help!\" The tiny athlete cried out in desperation his hands too plump to pull free from the tines of the massive fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant relished the moment watching Ryan's tiny muscular form writhe helplessly his meaty little soles kicking back and forth as if to run to safety. Ryan whimpred as he found himself lowering slowly toward the massive opened mouth below. He swung a bit on his wrists crying out as he reached a toe out to grasp the giant's upper lip in hopes of avoiding the planned destination. His toes slipped and he found himself waist deep in the giant's mouth below he could sense the tongue tasting him. Ryan tried to push up but his well toned muscles were no match. Soon he felt lips brush past his arm pits as he disappeared in to the rank darkness of the giant's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange freedom came over Ryan as he could move his limbs again and at least crawl. Nearby he could see the incisors and beyond freedom. Ryan wriggled army style across the thick mucus covered tongue towards the light at the end of the tunnel. \"No no nooooooo!\" Ryan's foot slid and kicked the back of the giant's throat ending the taste session prematurely. Powerful muscles pulsed around Ryan as he found himself in complete darkness. He stood up knee deep in what had to be the giant's stomach. Somehow, a dimb light permiated the giant allowing Ryan to see the soft pink walls of this strange and treacherous cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan heard a strange vibrating sound which he soon realized was a belch from the inside. He tried to cry out but the remaining air space in the giant's stomach disappeared in instant beginning the processing of the hot little man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant picked what appeared to <br>\r\nbe a tiny watch from his teeth, performed a few of the exercises in the book and still felt hungry... <i>Perhaps one more snack before moving on</i>? He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve been auditioning muscular tan blondes all day and have a small cage full of boys you\u2019re saving for a \u201ccallback\u201d backstage and a stomach stuffed with those who didn\u2019t make the cut.  Fortunately you\u2019ve already narrowed down your search for \u201cPip\u201d to a few lean redheads, in a nearby cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome Florian.  I see that you\u2019ve signed all of the necessary paperwork so we can begin the screen test just as soon as you\u2019re ready.  The plan is to do the Goanna song.

With computers or-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a computer involved Florian, but we found that it\u2019s actually more cost effective to green screen one character instead of two and then putting them together.  The Goanna will be in front of a green screen so they can computer generate his appearance after the scene.  You, however, will be exactly as you appear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian wrinkles his perfect forehead and crinkles his nose for a moment.  \u201cBut aren\u2019t I too big?  Won\u2019t we need two green screens so I can be small and he can be a big lizard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the computer comes in.  The scene will be the Goanna\u2019s Kitchen in his home under some rocks.  He\u2019ll have a full kitchen so the lyrics about the different ways of- er- making you a snack will make sense.  It\u2019s a little bit more cartoony of an idea than the original which is kind\u2019ve Ironic, but it saves us having to film you running through a giant forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t-\u201c he cuts himself off.  He doesn\u2019t understand and just resolves to stop asking questions and trust in the direction.  \u201cWell who is playing the goanna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of using computer generated animals.  I\u2019m going to be playing the role, and my arm will look like a tongue coiled around you in the finished product.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not fully grasping how he will \u2018look\u2019 small, Florian just decides to read through the script and nod with acceptance.

He cries out in alarm as a number of other hot looking young men equally shrunken in a cage sing in chorus:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's wanna eat somebody<br>\r\nWhat a shocking appetite<br>\r\nRelax, you'll never feel it<br>\r\nHe'll do you in one b***<br>\r\nFloating down the river<br>\r\nLike an oyster in a stew<br>\r\nHe's wanna eat somebody\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They actually think I am going to set them free.</i> You think to yourself as you appear around the cutting knife block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's gonna be you<br>\r\nI'm gonna eat somebody<br>\r\nIt might as well be you<br>\r\nA tempting little morsel<br>\r\nA tidbit of fondue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian shifts his attention from the chorus of beefy little men back to you and returns to the chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian runs along the back of the counter spotting a hole in the backing where an electrical outlet would usually go. The meaty little man looks both ways and leaps in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than finding himself in a space behind the counter he finds himself shooting down a slide into the darkness. As he cries out in horror he can hear your voice from above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the foodchain<br>\r\nSuch a lovely point of view<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I'm gonna eat somebody<br>\r\nIt might as well be you<br>\r\n(Might as well be you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I'm gonna eat somebody<br>\r\nIt might as well be you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I'm gonna eat somebody<br>\r\nIt might as well be you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian sees light at the end of the slide.

He hears a snap as a spring releases tossing him head over heels through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No nooooo!\" Florian lands with a thud into a warm pot on the stove. As the panic stricken little hottie comes up for air his nose and tiny taste buds recognize that he has landed in a gulasch. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis feet manage to find a buoyant chunk of beef and he reaches the surface gasping. The tiny hunk of Austrian beef wipes the paprika and stinging onion riich sauce from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at him struggling and savor the meaty little man. \"Oh Gott, Oh Gott... please no... please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian's eyes go wide as a large metal ladle enters his field of view and splashes into the liquid below him. He squirms as the spoon tickles the soles of his feet. Like an elevator from hell Florian cries out as the ladle lifts him upward at a tremendous speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... no no oh Gott\" the cute little man finds himself deposited on a plate next to the sandwich he avoided earlier.

He squirms and struggles as your tongue explores his every patch of flesh. The motion stops and the tiny hottie looks up exhausted and drenched in saliva from handsome head to meaty toe. He looks past the silhouette of your teeth to the pile of clothes in the distance with the script laying on his right sneaker. As he tries to lunge for the opening your mouth closes and powerful muscles wripple forcing him downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian struggles in terror as millions if tiny cillia tickle every part of his skin. With a splash he drops into the dark hot acidic climate of your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome to the food Chain Florian.... such a tasty Austrian stew... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the sneakers and jeans in a nearby container and prepare for your next client.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second cage is so stuffed with meaty light haired models that there isn\u2019t enough room for those inside.  The squirming mass of muscular flesh quivers and undulates as the cage spins on its chain link.  Those on the outer edge are forced to sit down, their legs hanging over the edge between the bars and dangling down below.  The sight of all those meaty tanned soles and plump toes has you salivating so you reach up with your tongue and lick them as they come around.  The perfectly pedicures feet are smooth, salty, sweaty, and taste of cheese mixed with wood.  Your tongue is tantalized at the flavors as it spins around and you suck some of them up to their muscular calves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cage finally stops spinning you see the two lads closest to the outside right in front of you are Hendrik Geisler and Tobias Reuter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlorian, meet your competition.  All of these meaty muscular studs are vying for the same part as you.  Look at all that quivering fles, each muscle glistening with sweat,\u201d you say as you smack your lips.  \u201cI can\u2019t wait to add you up there between two of my German studs, your friends Hendrik and Tobias.  You\u2019re my first Austrian so far... and I may have to make some room in there before I can shove you in.  Or maybe we should all just start the auditions\u201d.  You slide the tongue around your mouth involubtearily as you lick up the saliva that has been dripping from your mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cries and squeals from these toned young men, these morsels so used to being the hottest and strongest boys around, whets your apetite as much as their smooth tanned bodies, supple tight flesh, muscle outlined torsos, nude forms, perfect nipples, and heavenly aroma of sweaty man meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHendrik and Tobias, squished against the bars of the cage with their cute little feet dangling down invitingly, made me lean in for another slurp.  \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get Florian up there beside you, his meaty monsters up there to suckle on,\u201d I moan in pleasure, four pairs of kicking feet in my mouth.  Florian blanched but was still to shaken to move.  All the bronzed skin and light hair on meaty bodies has me salivating again.  </span></div></div>",

The tour continued and Florian wandered away from the group to get a good selfie. <i>Hmm dass ist komisch</i> Florian noticed his phone seemed a bit bigger than before.

He nurses his arm and wonders if the strange compounds found in the rainforest might have caused him to shrink. His feet sink into the soft mud on the forest floor. He steps onto a stick to cross a pond size puddle of water. A mosquito the size of a bird flies near him and he waves it away in a panic falling from the stick into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bite sized model came out of the muddy water and shook his head while clearing the mud from his eyes. A giant single eye looked back at him. It blinked as if to wink at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorian let off a scream and turned to run. The creature, an iguana, turned toward the movement and began pursuit. Florian ran to a nearby tree and began to climb upward \"wau no no no!\" Florian whimpered at the sensation of the massive lizard's tongue tickling the sole of his foot as it shot out to get him. Having escaped the muscular young man walked across a branch like a narrow beam but the branch broke. \"Whoa! Noooooo!\" with a splat Florian found himself stuck to the bottom of a snail its cold wet slime holding him tight. \"No noooo!\" the iguana was persistent and moved in on its now captive prey. At the last moment the tiny man managed to free himself. As he looked over his shoulder he watched the snail disappear in the iguana's mouth instantly. Florian couldn't bring himself to imagine what might happen. He kept running. <i>Maybe he has stopped with the snail</i> Florian thought to himself as he rounded a corner... \"Fuck no no no!\" the iguana somehow managed to circle around and still seemed quite focused on a Florian snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular blonde fell backwards into mud and backstroked away from his pursuer. As he swam through the mud leches swam toward him like crocodiles in the Nile. Florian whimpered and squirmed past the toothy annelids. As he reached the other side of the mud hole Florian took a moment to catch his breath. <i>I think I have lost him... I have to get out of here.</i>  Florian spied his tour group in the distance. They were coming his way! In desperation the tiny man climbed another tree this time hoping to be at ear height by the time they arrived. He climbed quickly and reached out on a branch to get closer. \"Hey! Hey! Help I'm over here!\" Florian risked venturing out a little further. \"Whaaaa! Ahhhhh!\" Florian slipped his tiny cloth ripping abruptly from his body. As he fell through the air he felt something below him, something wet and flexible. The iguana's tongue wrapped around the beefy young man tickling him torturously. \"No no! Oh God no!\" The tongue came to a stop with Florian facing directly towards his captor. A gruff voice came out of nowhere \"My delicious little morsel don't have a fright your meaty form will be gone in one bite! Welcome to the food chain! \" Florian continued to protest as he found himself rapidly propelled towards the reptile's open mouth.  It was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god no fuck no noo! Florian squirmed as powerful muscles began massaging him deeper inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobias Reuter smiled as he felt the sun on his face. He could have sworn he heard Florian in the distance. \"Florian bist du da?... Au! das tut Weih!\" as he approached the spot where he heard the voice a thorny plant seemed to reach out and stick him. </span></div></div>",

Just walk down that corridor and the fantasy will begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabian followed the attendant's finger to a long rather dark looking hallway with a pinpoint of light at the end. <i>That looks rather strange</i> Fabian thought to himself as he proceeded. After about a 10 minute walk Fabian reached the door at the end and pushed a glass door to enter. \"What the hell? This is amazing!\" Fabian looked in awe at what appeared to be a giant version of the dressing room he had just left. Fabian walked up to one of his boots and looked up in amazement. \"Wow this all looks so real!\" Fabian smiled and reached out to feel the surface, the suede feeling coarse to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Fabian.... don't you look tasty.\" The beefy young trainer spun around towards the origin of the voice. \"Hey! You are supposed to be a woman... this isn't what I paid for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive figure knelt down bringing his face close enough for Fabian to feel the wind of his breath. \"That's odd, this is exactly what I paid for.\" </span></div></div>",

They are shrinking people!\" The giant caught up with the Fabian's tiny form in a single step. \"Ah ah ah... tsk tsk my meaty little man. We musn't disrupt their dreams now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabian cried out as he felt the hand of the giant reach around him. \"Relax Fabian, this will be fun, well for me at least, and when we are finished I promise you will be gone in a single bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He started to get into a limo with his entourage when paparazzi tried to get a photo and he jumped out of he car. \"Justin Bro! Get back here man!\" One of his body guards tried to talk reason, but it was no use. Justin staggered down the street a short ways and down an alley. He stopped to check out his cell and snap a selfie when he heard a strange humming noise above him. \"Ah man, fucking Paparazzi!\" Justin's speech was slurred. He adjusts his backwards ball cap and flips off the hovering drone above. The drone seems to respond to Justin's behavior by shifting backwards slightly and making a higher pitch sound. Justin drops his sunglasses over the brim of his nose and stares blankly as a blue light shoots out of the hovering craft scanning him from toe to head. \"What the fuck? Yo man wha.....\" His less than profound words are cut short by a second beam of red light that vaporizes him. His sunglasses drop squarely into his right sneaker which is smoking slightly. The drone climbs quietly into the smoggy city sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sees the name come up on the screen <i>Justin Bieber hmm tasty</i> but as the young pop singer's lean muscular form begins to materialize he can tell something is not right. He examines the site on the platform and raises the chamber without the usually protocol. \"Justin, do you er happen to remember the last thing you ate?\" The young man, rather stoned just moments before now seems quite lucid. His hands and feet twirl helplessly and his head rolls about trying to get a sense of what has happened. \"I was totally wasted and I asked Marty to get me a burger from Zak's Burger Bus. Bro, everything looks really big right now what's going on?\" The tech does not bother responding but gently pulls away the bun covering the now bite sized pop star. Rather than being embedded in beef Justin seems to have merged at a molecular level with his last meal. Justin's head two hands and two feet are all that remain of \"pure\" Bieber. The tech plucks away the remaining high top. </span></div></div>",

The giant savors the first bite and then continues... soon Bieber's left foot is gone... then his hands... the massive tech continues to gulp down until nothing remains.
