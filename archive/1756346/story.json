The rain was coming down hard as three young guys try to make their way home. Alex, Sam, and Zack were on their way back from a swim meet that ended with them not only losing, but losing bad. Maybe the other teams where just better, maybe they need to practice more but what ever the reason, their spirits were low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam slapped Alex\u2019s hand as he tried to change the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy car, my music\u201d Sam announced, like it was his catchphrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had known that I would have drove, you have awful tastes\u201d Alex proclaimed with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sat in the backseat, staring out the window. He hadn't said much since they left. He cound't help but feel like the other two blamed him for their dreadful time. He just kept dwelling on how miserable he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio was in the middle of a car insurance commercial when the car stalled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam tried to turn the engine but there was no sign of life in the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really should have drove\u201d Alex said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got this thing out of the shop, there is no reason for Thor to be acting up.\u201d Sam said befuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou named your car Thor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, because it\u2019s a dodge avenger\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Sam took out his phone. \u201cSomeone pass me their phone, I\u2019m not getting signal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex did the same and got the same results \u201csame here, Zack what about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack wasn\u2019t really listening; he was just steady watching the rain fall. While drifting he could swear he saw a light blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, space cadet! Phone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was started but quickly regained his composure and did the same as the other two with a similar outcome.<br>\r\n\u201cSatellite must be down or something. Crap, I don't want to sleep in the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, Zack once again could swear he saw something. \u201cGuys, I think there\u2019s something out there,\u201d Zack says while motioning in the direction of the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked out. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be, there\u2019s nothing but woods for\u2026\u201d Sam found himself cut buy a flash of lighting. The darkness was lifted for only a moment but long enough for them to see the imposing looking manor on a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we could ask to use their phone so we can call AAA.\u201d Sam contemplating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats staying in here\u201d Agreed Alex.</span></div></div>",

The front door seemed much farther away then they thought, by the time they reached the front door they looked like drowned rats. Sam pounded on the door with a fist but didn\u2019t get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shifted his weight and yelled over the storm, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was about to respond when the door slowly creaked open. They gave each other a cautious look before Sam stepped into the darkened entrance followed by the other two. The room was pitch black, no sign of light anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be in \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?!\u201d Sam shouted, ignoring Zack\u2019s concern. There was no response other then a slight echo. Though their phones seemed useless for contacting anyone, they still made semi-useful flashlights. They searched the area with their cells\u2019 tiny lights revealing dust covered sheets draped over furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like no one has been here for some time,\u201d Alex mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastic, we were better off in the car, I\u2019m freezing now.\u201d Sam bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was scanning the walls, eventually coming a crossed a light switch. He flipped the switch expecting it not to work, having long been shut off by now. To his surprise, however, the room was illuminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Alex let curiosity drag them along and began uncovering things, sending dust into the air. The main hall had everything you\u2019d expect to see: chairs, coffee table, big clocks, there was even a large creepy portrait of a Black haired woman sitting on a chair with a brown haired man standing behind her, touching her shoulders. The main feature of the room was the two staircases leading to a balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite until Alex spoke up, \u201cWe should split up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam lifted an eye brow, \u201czoinks scoob, lets go check out that groovy pantry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shrugged, \u201cYea, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. We should stick together so-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex once again cut Zack off, \u201cso the monsters don\u2019t get us? Given me a break. I\u2019m going to see if I can find a phone, if the lights work maybe the phone line does too. If you two are too scared then go ahead and stay here holding each others hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Alex took off into the depths of the house.</span></div></div>",

They slowly walked up the stairs, leaving wet footprints and small puddles from their dripping clothes. Once at the top they make their way down darkened halls while noticing paintings and photos. Friends and family most likely, and a few images of places that must have been important to the owners of the manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Zack eventually came to a room and once they flicked the light switch they saw a large bed. There was, strangely enough, no dust to be seen unlike the entrance hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam went straight for the bed while Zack looked around, puzzled by the discrepancy in the level of dust. Sam, placing his hands on the bed bounced it up and down, \"I call this room if we need to stay the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, a bit uncomfortable, \"I don't know. Maybe we should go back to the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why?\" Sam said looking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something doesn't feel right, is all. Like why does this place still have lights if there is no one around to pay the electric bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugs \"Maybe some paper work went missing or something, so they never shut it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" replied Zack, only half agreeing. A draft blows in passed the door and they both shiver a little. Zack walked into what looked to be a walk-in closet and looked over the clothes to see if there is something that might fit him, figuring if he was going to stay in this place, he might as well have something dry to wear.</span></div></div>",

He knew things were really off about this whole thing, but he was so cold he didn't care. He looked over the hangers and grabbed pair of brown pants, an undershirt and a dress shirt. He changed into the brown slacks and the two shirts, then grabbed a belt to keep the pants from dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201d Sam asked from out side the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found some clothes so I got changed.\u201d Zach called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, past me some pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Zack grabbed something and stepped out to see a stripping Sam.

They were really short, ending just under his knees. He looked down, and realized that he was wearing Capris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoron,\u201d Sam muttered wiping a strand of his long hair from his face. He pulled the feminine apparel off and tossed it. He stepped into the closet and started to look for some male clothes. He moved hanger after hanger of dresses but could find anything that looked neutral let alone masculine. There were only dresses, skirts and blouses as well as some sexy lingerie and high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? How did Zack find the only set of guy clothes?\u201d Sam yelled. He went back taking each dress down one at a time and throwing it to the floor in an attempt to find something that he missed. But soon he was ankle deep in feminine attire with nothing to show for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d Sam grumbled. He wrapped his arms around himself and shivered.

He stepped out of the room and called for Zack but it seemed that he wasn't in earshot anymore. Figuring that he might as well look for him, Sam started to head into the hall but he just couldn't take the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, why is it so drafty?\u201d Sam said, jumping back into the bedroom and closing the door behind him. Examining the room, Sam's eyes fell upon a door he hadn't noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's odd...\u201d Sam whispered to himself. He walked across the room and opened the door. Behind it was nothing spectacular, just a bathroom. A quick scan of the room in hopes of finding a bathrobe proved unfruitful, but there were a few towels. Checking the faucet, however, revealed that the water was still running. There was even hot water, and running his hands under it warmed his hands nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Capri pants fell to the floor and Sam stepped into the shower. It took a few seconds to get the hot water flowing but when it did it felt great. Sam realized that once he got out from under the water he'd just freeze up again so he planned to just hop into the bed in the next room and wait for Zack and Alex to come back. He glanced over and saw two bottles a shampoo and conditioner mix, and an unlabeled bottle which was most likely body wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, in for a penny,\u201d Sam said grabbing the shampoo and turned the shower head down. After lathering up his long hair, he used the bodywash. The liquid cam out like pink honey, and had an interesting smell. Kind of part flowers, part ...something else. He shrugged then lathered up his face, chest, and everything else he could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Sam's skin began to tingle and then burn. Grabbing the Shower head he rinsed off as fast as he could watching in horror as his body hair went down the drain. He just stood there, his mouth agape. He always made fun of Alex for shaving is body, which Alex always said was to shave off time for his lap time, now he was never going to hear the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that there was no point on dwelling on it, he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower.</span></div></div>",

Maybe the drinks would warm him up a bit, he was still cold from the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrink after drink, Alex downed the treasure he found and started to dull his senses.

All of a sudden, a wave of sleepiness hit him like somebody just slapped him in the face with a really heavy pillow. If he didn't find a place to sleep soon, he felt like was going to pass out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could set off to find somewhere soft to sleep, he lost his balance slammed against a door. The door swung open but Alex was able to grab the door frame to keep from hitting the ground. The first thing he noticed when he got his baring straight was the bed. It was white with some lace around the edges of the blankets. He quickly closed the distance and was feeling how soft it was, as if calling out to him to just rest a while. As much as it hurt to look away, he made a brief scan of the room. The room was simple yet feminine. After checking out the closet he confirmed that he was in the maids room, as he saw a woman's uniform. The dress looked sexy, but not in a slutty, Halloween costume sort of way. There was just something about it that had him wish he could have seen the maid that worn it. Wouldn't doubt the lady of the house would have been jealous of some cute servant sashaying down the halls in this little number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex lifted up his hand and touched the fabric. It felt so nice against his skin as he stroked the length of the dress. Indeed, he thought, it would be pretty hard to not be tempted by the girl in this dress. The master of the house must have had a permanent smile one his face seeing the little vixen bending over dusting the place. Shaking his head, Alex stepped away from the dress and closed the closet door. He was still pretty tired, and this room was as good as any, so why not sleep here tonight?</span></div></div>",

The shoes clomped to the ground, followed by his wet shirt, pants, socks and after a moment of consideration, his boxers. Absently, Alex thought about hanging his things up to dry but that line of thought drifted as he sat down. It was too much right now, and he was just too tired. It was even too much to get up and turn off the light, the switch felt like it was miles away. His head felt like it was stuffed with cotton and spiderwebs while his eyelids felt heavy. Alex didn't even realize that he was slipping under the blankets until his head was on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before blissful sleep took him. He slept deep, the kind of sleep that follows days of great mental and physical exertion. There was no dreaming, just perfect stillness and the darkness granted by his eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's slumber suddenly came to an end when he felt something jostle him. He bolted up but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing, that is, except that his blankets were on the floor. Leaning over the bed all he saw were his clothes on the floor and the comforter that he had been using. He was just about to grab the blankets and go back to sleep when he spotted something odd about the clothes. They weren't the right color, in fact, they weren't his clothes at all. He bent down and grabbed the pile and unraveled the mess which reveled the maid uniform and some lady under garments. The only thing left in the spot where his shoes had been were a pair of black heels, maybe 2 or 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Alex grumbled, concluding that Sam must have found him while he was sleeping and decided to prank him. It probably wasn't Zack, since he wouldn't have the spine to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll kill him when I find him.\u201d Alex snarled.</span></div></div>",

He took a step but stopped when he noticed that his hand felt odd. It looked like one of the pieces of the uniform, a lace glove, was covering four of his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust have gotten caught when I grabbed the clothes,\u201d Alex thought to him self before grabbing the drooping fingers of the the glove. Lightly tugging, Alex was surprised to see the glove wasn't coming off. He pulled harder but got the same result as before. He made one last attempt before giving up on it and changed his plan to finding a pair of scissors to just cut them off. He started toward the vanity but tripped and stumbled before he could get far. Something had caught his foot and kept it from moving, as if stuck. He had apparently stepped on a loose piece of fabric from the uniform, which was odd because it wasn't in the spot he put it. The attempt to untangle his foot from the pile was just as effective as his struggle with the glove. Kicking didn't work and neither did stepping on the pile with the other foot. In fact, When he went to remove the other leg, that leg got caught, too. He could feel elastic tugging on his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because he was not prepared for both of his legs to be ensnared, or maybe the drinks from earlier were still effecting his balance. He stumbled again but this time fell to the floor, landing on his back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fall didn't really hurt, but Alex didn't move for a short time. He was just breathing in and out, trying to calm down. After a few moments of that, he sat up and looked at his entangled legs. He tossed pieces of the crumpled uniform, not particularly careful where they landed, and was disgusted to see both of his feet had slipped into a pair of black silk panties. His right foot, the one that was stuck to the floor earlier, had also found its way inside a black stocking. The rest of the stocking was wrapped around a leg on the bed frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell...\u201d Alex said scratching his head with his lace covered thumb then froze. Slowly, Alex removed his gloved hand from his head. The lace glove was no longer just partially on his hand, it was now being completely worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was about to question how that could happen when he felt something strange around his shins. His gaze landed on his legs and his eyes widened. The silk panties were not only higher then they were a moment ago, they were still moving higher up his legs! Alex panicked, grasping at the underwear attempting to yank them off. He was able to stop them from advancing with his ungloved hand but he wasn't able to force them back down. Alex tried to bring his other hand into the fray, but it wouldn't budge. His gloved hand felt like it was frozen in the air, trapped by something he couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing to deal with his hand, Alex spread his knees apart which kept the panties from being able to slip up further. He brought his naked hand to the glove and tried again to remove it. When he grasped it, his glove hand suddenly flew to the side on its own. Alex was fighting to keep his arm still, his fingers interlocking, when he felt a strange sensation on his right leg rise to his knee. His eyes darted back to his legs and he saw his right leg almost completely covered in the black stocking. Alex's first instinct was to try and stop the stocking from getting all the way up but when he tried to swing his hand toward his leg, his gloved fingers would not let go of his naked hand. He struggled futilely until the stocking was in its final position. Once in place, his stockinged knee clapped closed against Alex's wishes allowing the panties easy access to his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping the opportunity, the silk panties raced over his knees and up his thighs. Alex had previously removed his body hair in order to shave off time in his lap speed. Some of the guys had made fun of him, but there was a bit of a difference in his final time. He would have shaved his head, too, but his girlfriend really liked his shaggy hair. Though his legs had been without hair for a while, this was the first time he had felt such a smooth materiel against them. It felt...nice. The silk panties wiggled and then found themselves at his hips, cupping his butt in a really strange and attractive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the panties were on, Alex felt himself being pulled up buy the waist. He was standing before he even knew it. His gloved hand pulled the naked one up, now by the wrist, up over his head. He was looking up when he felt something hug his abdomen and squeeze. The corset that was now around his middle was making it very hard to breath as it gave him an hourglass figure. The flesh of his chest was squeezed and lifted together into the cups of the corset, meant for a woman's breasts, creating a striking illusion. As far as any observer would be able to tell, Alex was now sporting his own pair of small, beautiful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was just held there as something spider-like scurried up his legs, middle, and cleavage. Crawling up his body was the other lace glove, dragging a thin black choker with it. The choker dropped off of the glove and wrapped itself around Alex's neck locking into place as the glove shimmied up his arm and nestled onto his naked hand. At this point it comes to no surprise that the last stocking would demand to be warn as well. Even though Alex wanted to fight it, his arms held his left leg firm, so it too would be consumed by the animated clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, under its own accord, Alex's legs stepped into the maid uniform and in a very feminine manner, bent down and slid it up his body. His arms placed themselves into the short sleeves and then zipped the dress up in the back as the corset attached small clasps to the black stockings. His feet slipped into the three inch heels and his body turned to face the mirror on the vanity. What was now standing before Alex from the neck down appeared to be was a shapely woman with long sexy legs leading up into a black and white maids uniform.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of the silk rubbing against his manhood causing some unwanted arousal. On the vanity table were an assortment of beauty supplies that seemed to call out, as if pleading to be used. Much to Alex's reluctance, his gloves obliged the supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moments were a blur of powders and sprays. He tried to turn his head away, but his gloved hands forced his face to except this new humiliation. With the makeup on his face, Alex found himself unable to turn his head, as if the makeup itself was holding his face in place. He watched helplessly as his hands painted his face with mascara, eyeshadow and lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done with his face, the gloved hands grabbed a pair of scissors and went to town on his head. His hair was getting kind of long, but his girlfriend liked it so he didn't mind before. Now he regretted giving, whatever it was that was doing this to him, anything to work with. After a short time of shaping and combing, what looked back at Alex in the mirror could ever have been mistaken for anything other than a beautiful young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands reached out and grabbed some kind of bottle that looked like perfume or something and it sprayed him lightly. Before placing it back down, his hands brought the nozzle to his mouth. His painted lips opened without Alex telling them to do so and his mouth was spritzed with the spray. The taste wasn't unpleasant, in fact, he kind of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his clothes seemed to be satisfied with his appearance, their hold over Alex disappeared. He stood quickly, so quickly he almost fell again. He tried to remove his offending attire but nothing would budge. Alex paced in the room trying to rationalize what just happened but couldn't come up with anything that didn't sound crazy. As he walked, his stockinged legs brushed against each other in a pleasing manor and their movement cause more unintentional excitement. Alex didn't like what was going on but the silk just felt so good on his skin. </span></div></div>",

Alex began rocking a little to keep the sensation going but it wasn't enough. He knew he should run out of this place, there was something obviously wrong here, but his mind was becoming cloudy with the urge for sexual gratification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's right hand drifted under his dress and to his groin then began to rub and stroke.

Alex soon found himself on his back with his right hand still between his legs and his hips still rolling in a sensual motion. His legs squeezed his hand, in a futile effort to get more sensation. He pushed his high heels into the bed and brought his left hand to his chest. As his desire mounted, he found himself moaning in short, breathy, girlish whispers, the corset preventing him from expressing much more then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and looked down at himself, taking in the scene he was creating.

The silence held in the air only for a breath, replaced once more with the girlish sounds being made by the maid on the bed.

She was so in need of a man's touch, she trembled with desire from just his hand touching her knee. He rubbed up and down, drinking in her curvy legs. His hands drifted up, only making a brief, light pass of her pussy, just to tease a bit. He caressed her tight stomach, feeling the corset under her dress. His fingers danced across her chest feeling her beautiful, soft, if  a bit small, breasts. The sensation was obviously driving the little minx wild. She wanted him so bad it must hurt, and he couldn't take any more himself. He leaned in and started kissing her lovely neck, summoning little lusty moans from her. He traced her jaw with his lips and worked his way back down to her breasts, inhaling the scent of  her perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Sam stripped off his shirt, followed by his shoes and pants, then settled himself hovering over the maid with his legs between hers. He scoped her into his arms, one hand around her waist, the other just under her head. He looked into her half lidded eyes and leans back in. When their lips touched it was electric, made all the more erotic by her squeal of delight. God, she was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just couldn't believe what was happening as Sam sat on the edge of the bed, his stockinged leg making room. Sam's hand rested casually on Alex's knee and gave it a little rub, which made him shake a bit in disgust. What was worse was when Sam began to feel up his legs, exploring the curves the cursed stockings imposed on his form. It was gross, wrong and felt much better then he wanted it to. His heart jumped into his throat when he felt Sam's hand graze his crotch. On the one side, if his panties stopped hiding his cock, then this horror would end now. The problem with that is dealing with the fallout of what comes after that. Alex sure as hell didn't want this to keep going but the alternatives were just as bad. Sam just kept touching him all over. When he got to Alex's chest, Alex tried to shake him off but his uniform only made him look like he was trembling. Alex wanted to stop him but couldn't prevent Sam from kissing his neck. His lips made a slow methodical, assault across his face and back down to his faux breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Sam stripped. Things were getting worse by the moment, and Alex was afraid of how far this would go. Sam jumped back on to the bed and slid his legs between Alex's, pressing Sam's tented boxers into Alex's flat panties. Sam wrapped Alex into his arms and kissed Alex's plump lips. Alex tried to yell, but all that he could manage was a girlish squeal.</span></div></div>",

When Sam finds his advances are reciprocated by the sultry little minx, he has all the reason he needs to keep going. A gasp from when their lips touch tells Sam that she wants more, giving him enough reason to plant a deeper, longer kiss that she won't ever forget. Their caresses turn into a full-blown make-out session, much to Sam's delight. In between kisses, he could hear soft moans coming from the gorgeous maid; adorable little squeals that escaped when their tongues would lock. While one hand held the sexy maid's neck in place for their kisses, the other wandered her body freely, running across her chest and giving her small bosom a good squeeze, to which she can only moan. \"Even small boobs are still boobs\", he thinks to himself, appreciating the soft feel of her chest and the lacy texture of the corset holding them in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand wanders further, across her ribs down to her hips. He grabs a handful of her behind and gives it a squeeze as well, to which she responds by pressing her hips against his... she is so ready for it, he thinks. Moving to slid down her panties, she responds by wrapping her legs around his waist, pressing their groins together. A lusty shudder runs down her back... \"She just can't control herself!\", he thinks, as he is more than happy to do a bit more teasing before getting down to business. Rubbing his manhood, even through the fabrics of his boxers, feels so good against her soft panties, and she looks like she can't get enough of it herself. As she lays there, biting her lip with painted eyes closed shut, he only imagines that she is trying to wring every ounce of pleasure from her fateful encounter with this handsome stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex can hardly believe this is happening; him dressed as a maid, trapped into pleasuring himself and now one of his best friends. Sam unfortunately doesn't let up, and when a gasp of surprise forces his mouth open, Sam uses that as his chance to dive in. Their prolonged tongue wrestling will haunt him for the rest of his life. Their teasings and petting turns into a full-blown make-out session, much to Alex's dismay. Each kiss causes Alex to want to gag, but the best he can muster with his corset is a petite, soft moan. It didn't help that it only seemed to encourage Sam. The longer this went on, the more daring Sam got with his hand, which was almost as bad. His fingers come across his \"breasts\" and start to caress them... Alex can only scream in a panic about being discovered, but again all that escapes his mouth is a subdued squeak. Part of him just wishes he would open the corset and put an end to this awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wishes are not answered, as Sam's wandering hand makes it down to his butt. Grasping it firmly, Alex only wants to get away from Sam's groping, only to inadvertently rub his pantied groin against Sam's tented shorts. Feeling that Sam is making a move to remove his panties, Alex panics, and wrestles with him the best he can. All he manages to do is wrap his stockinged-legs around Sam's hips, and in-between wet kisses he sees the scene that these clothes and the two teammates have created; a sexy young maid inviting a young man to bed her, with her legs wrapped tight around him so as not to let him get away until he has pleasured her... the very thought causes him to quiver in disgust. Worse yet, Sam has taken again to teasing Alex, rubbing his hard manhood against Alex's own... the panties hide the truth from Sam well, but still allow Alex to feel every sensation. And worst of all, Alex finds himself responding to Sam's gyrations... Alex isn't sure if this is the work of the clothes, or his own body betraying him in search of sexual release. Either way, as their hips move in unison, Alex can only bit his lip, imagining himself somewhere else other than grinding against his friend in women's clothing.</span></div></div>",

In the beginning, it was only historical fascination, but as her obsession grew, Ishtar came to her in her dreams. The young woman learned lost secrets of beauty, grace, and seduction, whispered to her by the goddess. During Iris' brief life, she was able to use her arcane knowledge to become a film star and a model. Men and women alike whispered about her prowess as a lover. She made each of them feel certain that their experiences were personal and irreplaceable, one of a kind, and they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris knew that she was fated to die young. She did not ask Ishtar to save her life, because she knew that the goddess's power was limited, and she wanted others to experience the joy of divine sexual love. She instead asked that Ishtar would bring others into her lifestyle, make them images of feminintiy to anyone who looked upon them, and bless them for pleasing their lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIshtar granted her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose whom the house chooses have a latent ability to transform. When the semen of their partners comes into contact with them, that part of their body becomes exquisitely sexy and feminine, and will become so whenever anyone looks upon them as a beautiful woman. The more places the semen touches, the more they will change when they are seen. If they ingest it, it will make them act more feminine whenever anyone who sees them as beautiful is looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, if Ishtar had resmembered to specifiy that it should only affect women, it would have been a pretty good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex fired off his load with a moan.</span></div></div>",

He soaped up his face and tried to scrub the makeup off as best as he could. It took several tries, but he got most of it. His lips were still stained reddish, his eyebrows were still arched, and his face was uncannily free of five-o-clock shadow, but he was back to his normal male face. Now to try to remove the clothes.</span></div></div>",

His hands were also normal. The burning was subsiding, but his hands were the same as they always were, down to the hangnails and scratched palm from yard work last weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the separate toilet room, closed the door and undressed as best as he could. He got the dress and a few other items off before he got to the corset. He was fairly sure it wasn't hexed onto him anymore, but he was sure that the lacing was some kind of black magic. He would need something sharp to cut the laces loose--or a helping hand, but he wasn't about to ask for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought about wearing only the corset, but he realized that the last thing he wanted was to give some hint to Sam as to the nature of their encounter. Reluctantly, he picked up the dress and pulled it over his head. It pulled itself on the rest of the way, tying its own laces and reapplying the choker, bra, panties, gloves, and all the rest. Aside from his lack of makeup, he was back to where he had started, but he was fairly sure he could still take it off if needed. Unfortunately, he would still need to hide his face or wear the makeup again to keep Sam from recognizing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out of the toilet room, flattening out the folds of his skirt, distracted by the odd feel of the heels, when he realized that his hands and face were burning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" said Sam, as casually as he could manage, \"Listen, I didn't get your name. I'm Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex froze. Something did not add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his hands. As nervous as he was, they weren't shaking. More importantly, they were also petite and spotless, with an impeccable French manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced up in the bathroom mirror. His face had rearranged itself. His nose was dainty, his chin was gentle, his lips full, and his neck soft. His cheeks were a little higher and, frankly, adorable. He may have been Alex a moment ago, but he wasn't right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" he ventured hesitantly, and discovered that his voice was now soft and girlish.</span></div></div>",

His hand muscles bulged, and the smooth manicured nails morphed back into the rough boy's nails they were every night until tonight. He wanted to watch, but he was determined to move quickly and avoid his friends at all costs. The clop-clop of his heels sounded hurried and clumsy to him, but he was too afraid to stop to take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was that beneath the flush of panic, seeing Sam again rekindled his horniness. He had to find an outlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and found himself in a library with at least 10,000 books. His thoughts flowed like water: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere there are libraries, people study.<br>\r\nWhen people study, they have to pee.<br>\r\nWhen people pee, they want locked doors.<br>\r\nAnd where there are lockable doors, <i>I can jack it</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex spotted a small unobtrusive door and made a beeline for it, snatching a photo book with a topless woman on it without slowing down at all. He made it as far as the sink before he had to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was titled \"The Cult of Astarte in Modern-Day Lebanon: An exploration of Mesopotamian pagan revivals in the Levant, with comparisons to historical sources,\" it sure read well.

He was about to wipe up the mess when he noticed something familiar on the next page. He turned it and saw a white girl, possibly French, wearing a maid costume similar to his. The caption read: \"(Left, fig. 18.e.) In certain European subcultures, the traditional garb of young women who work as domestic servants in wealthy homes has taken on a similar sexual connotation. It is remarkably similar to the role of the Akkadian acolyte's <i>taarip</i>. (Next page., fig. 18.f.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex could see exactly why Sam couldn't resist. He didn't look that different. If he squinted, overlooked his totally flat chest, lack of butt, largish shoulders, and just imagined himself as a girl with red lips and a manicure and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped. His face and hands were burning again. Before his eyes, they reshaped themselves into images of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When someone looks at me and thinks I'm a girl,\" Alex said slowly, with a songlike girl's voice, as the ideas solidified in his mind, \"my hands and face transform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and tried to purge the image. He opened his eyes again, hoping not to see a girl's face with his eyes, but it was still there. <i>Shit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, covered his eyes with his hands, and pulled his hair. He had to stop picturing himself as a cute girl! He thought of winning swimming meets, cutting his hand on the chainsaw chain, banging Jessica, and crushing cans with his forehead. He was pretty sure he was just remembering old beer commercials when he noticed his hands felt rough again. He took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and left the room to get away from that book and that mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't realize he left some of his genetics on the counter.</span></div></div>",

He imagined that it would really impress her if she came back from working and he was there in her bed completely naked. Seriously, for just a moment in his head, he could imagine that was the sort of thing strange girls he had barely met liked. In his defense, he was having a really unusual day, and his internal plausibility meter was getting decalibrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a rustle in the closet. He pulled his pants back on slowly and walked over to investigate. He glanced in cautiously and caught something moving. It almost looked like the clothes moved. He turned on the light, and the old filament bulb flickered to life. He was sure of it this time. In the corner, he saw what looked like an old girl's cheerleading uniform from the 80s and it was moving on its own. Right next to it, tied up in a bundle with red ribbon, was Alex's male clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit,</i> Sam realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This place has mice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had a commendably short list of irrational phobias, but as much as he tried to downplay it around other guys, mice were close to the top. He nearly slammed the door, as though he expected something to come lunging out of the closet at him, and shuddered involuntarily, thinking about the scratchy sound of their cold little mouse feet skittering across the bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should find Alice and tell her. She'll know how to get rid of it,\" thought Sam as he left the room, thinking behind the thoughts that this would be a good way to strike up a conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, his plausibility meter's busted.</span></div></div>",

He tried to turn on lights when he found the switches, but since it was an old house, the wiring electrician was very stingy with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way downstairs, found a parlour that looked like it had a decently stocked liquor cabinet (recently used, probably by that minx Alice) and made a mental note of its location for the future. The big double doors at the back of the parlour were open. Through them he found the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" he said quietly, his impulse to be quiet around books well ingrained in his subconscious. (As well it should be. He did not instinctively turn his phone to vibrate, however, so I won't feel too bad about doing humiliating things to him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one light on in the bathroom, and he went toward it.

He wasn't sure why it suprised him so much to find it; after all, of course a mansion has some form of transportation, but for some reason, he was assuming he was stranded until someone picked him up. Yet here were six cars, ranging from a pristine-condition Model A to an 80s Porsche, with the keys hanging up by the door. They clearly had not been driven in decades, and he wondered what it would take to get them driveable. But the potential was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also more sure than ever that aside from the people cleaning the place and keeping it from being colonized by raccoons, this house was abandoned. Help was not forthcoming, but no one was likely to arrest him either. The only staff here was him, the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shop near the back of the garage. He checked the gas pump and found that it was full and still working. It was immaculate and thoughtfully organized, very different from his dad's and his granddad's shops, which were a mangled mess of misplaced tools. In a drawer, he found a utility knife. He tucked in the front pocket on his dress, thinking he could use it to remove the corset later if necessary. Even better, in a bottom drawer, he found a green coverall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coverall was smaller and tighter than he expected, making him suspect that the mechanic was a woman. No coverall could possibly be as feminine as this French maid uniform, so he considered it a step forward. If he could stop dressing like an Alice, maybe he would stop turning into one.</span></div></div>",

He pulled off the dress and the choker, and stopped when he reached the hose. They did feel nice on his skin for some reason. He was also rethinking cutting off the corset. After all, what if he needed to pass himself off as Alice again? Besides, it was feeling more comfortable as he got used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the panties... Well, they were their own thing. Alex didn't feel completely comfortable about walking around in them, but they seemed to be magically active still, and occasionally would tighten and stroke him through the fabric. Right then, they were building up the action, and his hose and corset were joining in occasionally. It was as though they were trying to change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, being a teenage boy, was susceptible to this kind of persuasion, even when it was coming from a French maid outfit that had just cornered him into giving his friend a handy. But he felt that he had reached an understanding with these items, and told himself he could remove them as soon as they were done. He pulled on the coverall over the top and stumbled over to the Porsche. The door was open. He crawled in and unzipped the coverall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coverall over a corset, he looked like a mechanic girl saving a surprise for her man, like Kaylee in seduction mode. The coverall was surprisingly form fitting, and its cap sleeves stopped right on the edge of Alex's shoulder, revealing his arms. They were too muscular, but he could imagine how this outfit would look on a girl. If he came across a girl fingering herself in this outfit, he would have a hard time staying away. He let his mind run away with the prospect of that kind of car sex as the outfit stroked him and he worked himself, his hands changed into dainty, pained things, and his voice changing into from masculine grunts to feminine moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis load went across the from of the coverall, but he didn't even notice. The panties rearranged his equipment, tucking it away for aesthetics, but continuing to stroke him. The corset stroked his nipples, which turned him on even further. Somehow, it was going to get him to go a second time, just like a girl. But how? And why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy seeing you like this again,\" said Sam.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even notice when he grabbed her little boobs, but all he had to do was touch her neck or face and she would almost scream with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Alex drifted to his senses. He had heard that girls have more sensitive skin, but he realized that there was no way what he was feeling was normal sensation. He weaned his lips slowly off Sam's and loosed his grip on his arms.

Her little deft hands were working his balls delicately. His experience with oral was limited to one grudging blowjob from a ex-girlfriend, so he was surprised to see that she seemed to be enjoying it far more than he was. He stroked her face and neck with his fingertips and leaned back, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's body jerked when he went, as though she were feeling the same release he was.

She closed her eyes, and slid backwards, as though she was going to sleep. Her body twitched happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hesitated. He wasn't sure if this girl had some kind of nymphomaniac seizure, or if she was just that tired. He looked at the clock. If it was right, it was almost 3:45 AM. He checked her pulse, felt her forehead. If she was dying, you'd think she wouldn't look so happy. He decided to watch her for a minute to make sure she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a couple of clean blankets under a workbench and laid one over her, putting the other under her head as a pillow.

It was the same thing that had happened to his hands, thighs, and butt in the bathroom: intense heat and tingling, but no outward signs at all. He thought he might be able to feel his pulse a little more strongly on his chest, but he couldn't be sure it wasn't his imagination. The sensation seemed to be focused on his nipples, but they looked the same as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, he took off his pants to check out his thighs and butt. No changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to ask Alice what that stuff was once she woke up. But where she was asleep only a few moments ago, there was now just a crumpled blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex awoke to find his head still buzzing with pleasure, but once again in control of his faculties. His panties were drenched and clung to him heavily; he must have gone off in them at least twice, possibly more, although he couldn't remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the strange warming sensation throughout his whole body, focused on his chest and his mouth. He licked his lips softly and tasted something salty, musky and metallic, at once familiar and foreign. For a moment, he savored it, memorizing the flavor and taking pleasure in it. Then he realized what it was, and nearly vomited. He sat up and looked around the garage. Behind him at the worktable, Sam was taking off his shirt and pants, and Alex knew what was likely to come next. He silently slid out of sight behind the nearest car and made for the door.</span></div></div>",

The warmth increased every moment, and he found that it was getting more difficult to breathe. He found that he was stumbling frequently. He climbed a staircase, entered a bedroom and closed the door, falling on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wriggled out of the coverall and laid on the floor panting. He didn't know how much time passed, but when he opened his eyes, he was drenched in sweat and thirsty. He could only take shallow breaths because his chest was so tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn't his chest, it was the corset. Its cups were filling up with luscious breast tissue, breath by breath. He grabbed them and yelped involuntarily with pleasure, shocked by how sensitive they were. Even now, through the thick corset material and not even touching his skin, they were more sensitive than any of his male anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet, and walked into the bathroom. Although his mouth and new breasts were still burning, the warmth was leaving his body, and he could tell that something else had changed. He felt lighter on his feet as he walked, one foot falling naturally in front of the other, his hips swaying gracefully and alluringly with each step. His elbows naturally hugged his body. All traces of his slouch were gone. He wasn't even sure he could imitate his old walk if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the dark bathroom, he reached for the light switch and couldn't find it. Finally, he found it a good 4 inches higher than he thought it would be. The counters were higher. The ceilings and doorways were higher. In the mirror, he saw that he had lost more than half a foot in height and had slimmed down. His arm and leg muscles were smaller and less defined, and his neck seemed thinner. His athletic build and respectable height had dwindled to something larger than average, but not out of place on a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the corset loosen itself, and he eased it off, with apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't know better, he'd think he was looking at a sexy girl. Every move she made announced her femininity. Although she looked boyish and underdeveloped from the belly down, she had picturesque C cup breasts with big pink areolas, a perfect face, and a beautiful neck. Her hair was short and messy, and her arms and shoulders a little bulky, but he was incapable of thinking this creature was male.</span></div></div>",

His equipment was still there, unharmed, but looking more out of place on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped off the hose and heels. Clearly he would need new clothes, a shower, and a drink, but first he had to know if he could change back. He sat cross-legged on the floor of the bathroom, nestling in the thick oriental rug, and concentrated. He thought hard about every male thing he could think of. He thought of bench pressing, driving fast, ignoring fashion, and beef jerky. He thought of having sex with his ex. He felt his body changing and his breasts shrinking, but he opened his eyes to look and, seeing and feeling the undeniably feminine breasts attached to his chest, felt the transformation slipping away from him. He screwed his eyes shut and concentrated again. Slowly, bit by bit, the transformation rolled back. The changes slowed down more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, he opened his eyes, unsure if it was finished. His nipples were somewhat red and swollen, and his lips seemed bigger than usual, but he seemed to be himself again, at least 95%. His hair still had the same feminine style that the clothes had given him, but that was fixable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was warmer and moved more easily, his skin was much less sensitive. He noticed that colors seemed muddier, and wondered if in his male form he had always been slightly colorblind. How much of the difference was from being a different person, and how much was from being a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became aware of a lingering bad taste in his mouth. Going through the cabinets, he found some ancient mouthwash and a glass and cleaned his mouth liberally. Semen tasted far better to Alice than to him, he realized.</span></div></div>",

He lingered, and they became more and more sensitive. He moaned softly, and noticed his voice had grown higher. He touched them with his fingertips, noticing they had swollen, but stroking them anyway with a circular motion. His breasts weighed heavier on his chest and his body shrank as he indulged himself. As the change spread, sensations all over his body became more intense. His hands, lips, face, and especially his breasts were most sensitive, but the rest of his body was more in tune with them. Even his male parts were sensitized, rock hard, and seemed even larger in his small hands. He pushed and pulled his hips in a sexy rhythm as he grabbed his dick with one hand and rubbed his nipple with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything felt so much sexier and alive as Alice. He couldn't believe he was about to go again already, but in this form he knew he could go as many times as he liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning and squeaking happily, he could feel a massive load coming, and without thinking he leaned over and caught it in his mouth. He rolled it around his tongue, thinking that he preferred its flavor to Sam's. He swallowed, savoring the aftertaste that he disliked so much as Alex. The sensation was still building, so he continued, and moments later fired off again, and then a third time. The force of his orgasms was increasing, and he felt he had to stop, only because he couldn't handle the intensity of a fourth. He felt more awake and energetic than he did before he started.</span></div></div>",

It was a solvable problem. It would be easier to revert to male if he looked more masculine. His shaggy red hair, now with bangs, didn't look particularly feminine on its own, but it did next to his extremely feminine face. It had served its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough most of the cabinets were full of women's accoutrements, there was a cabinet full of men's items for the lady's special guests, including a folded men's bathrobe, an old-fashioned safety razor, and some sharp scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you, hair,\" he said, \"You served me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began trimming it down as best as he could, dropping locks of red hair across the counter. It was going look haphazard, but it would look undeniably masculine. He wondered if there was such a thing as men's hair product when this bathroom was last stocked. In the medicine cabinet, next to some perfumes, an empty pill bottle (DAUNOMYCIN, 200 mg. PATIENT: PAULSEN, IRIS. EXP: 03/03/1982. USE AS DIRECTED BY ONCOLOGIST), and Brylcream, Alex found a small tub of glass tub. It smelled good to him, if musky and a little metallic. He warmed it up in his hands and set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he realized what the smell was, it was too late. His scalp burned brightly as his hair started to creep back down his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" he yelled, \"Why? Why would anyone keep that in their medicine cabinet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hands away from his body, trying to keep from getting the old sticky spunk on anything else. His hair was already down to his chin. While his male hair was straight and auburn, his new female hair was wavy and copper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked more like an Alice than ever. </span></div></div>",

He glanced at the spines and noticed a theme. For every Mark Twain or Jane Austen, there were half a dozen books on Babylon, comparative religions, and sex.

During Iris' brief life, she was able to use her arcane knowledge to become a film star and a model. Men and women alike whispered about her prowess as a lover. She made each of them feel certain that their experiences were personal and irreplaceable, one of a kind, and they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris knew that she was fated to die young. She did not ask Ishtar to save her life, because she knew that the goddess's power was limited, and she wanted others to experience the joy of divine sexual love. She instead asked that Ishtar would bring others into her lifestyle, make them images of feminintiy to anyone who looked upon them, and bless them for pleasing their lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIshtar granted her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose whom the house chooses have a latent ability to transform. When the semen of their partners comes into contact with them, that part of their body becomes exquisitely sexy and feminine, and will become so whenever anyone looks upon them as a beautiful woman. The more places the semen touches, the more they will change when they are seen. If they ingest it, it will make them act more feminine whenever anyone who sees them as beautiful is looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, if Ishtar had resmembered to specifiy that it should only affect women, it would have been a pretty good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex fired off his load with a moan.</span></div></div>",

Alex was forced to open the door with a light creak, the light almost blinding as it washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his eyes adjusted, he heard a familiar voice squeak, \u201cOh! I'm sorry...I, I, I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt himself close the door behind him, then looked back at Zack. He was standing in front of a desk with an open book in his hands. Oddly, he was wearing a dress shirt and brown slacks, something he did not show up wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friends and I had, uh, well we were on our way home and we-,\u201d Zack started to ramble nervously, but was cut off when Alex swayed up to him, placed the duster on the desk and grabbed his collar. Zack immediately shut up as Alex went about fixing Zack's shirt. First he readjusted the collar then his hands slowly drifted down his chest, all the while his eye's never leaving Zack's. Zack was holding his breath and Alex could feel Zack's heart going a mile a minute. Alex was terrified buy what was happening, his hands moving with a mind of their own. When his hands passed Zack navel, his arms snaked around Zack and he felt himself step in close, his own heart doing its own dance. Alex began to tuck Zack's shirt into his pants from back to front, while Zack was frozen stiff. After Alex finished, his fingers lingered, just grasping the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was doing his best statue impersonation as a cute smile found its way onto Alex's face. Alex took Zack's shoulder and eased him down onto the chair Zack must have been sitting in before Alex stepped in. turning to a small cupboard behind Zack, Alex grabs a glass and a bottle of a brown liquid. He pour Zack a glass then puts the bottle away. He grabbed the feather duster, then went to work dusting the room. He sashayed from one end of the room to the other, cleaning everything, his dress tickling his stockinged knees.</span></div></div>",

His body moved as the clothes dictated, and even the makeup on his face forced his painted lips into a content smile as he admirably performed the cleaning duties of a maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clicks and clacks of Alex's heels on the floor were the only thing that distracted Zack from the surprising turn of events. He was afraid of running into someone while they rummaged through the house, but he never imagined that it would be someone so hospitable... or lovely, for that matter. There is something about this young woman that seems familiar, however. Zack can't quite put his finger on it, and he turns his attention to the glass he was given by the maid. He takes a sniff of the brown liquid, and reels back a bit; whatever it is, it's alcoholic. Zack had never had a strong drink before and thinks twice about it, but decides it would be rude to not try just a sip of the drink so generously offered by the lovely lady. He tips the glass to his lips and takes a drink, but it is much stronger than he imagined, and he nearly coughs it up. While Zack manages to choke the drink down, he accidentally spills some of it onto the slacks that he had found and put on, replacing his rain-soaked clothes. He sets the glass on a small table next to his chair and starts to wipe the excess liquid off of his lap using just his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stops cleaning for a moment to check on his \"guest\", which catches Zack's attention as well. The lipstick he wears puts his lips into a bemused smile, and he sashays towards Zack just after grabbing a hand towel that rested on a desk. Alex kneels down right in front of the chair that Zack is seated, and again they lock eyes, Alex staring back at him through his thick, mascara-coated lashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, it was an accide-\", Zack starts to explain, but he is stopped short by the maid's efforts to clean up the mess; Alex's gloved hands are gently patting the young man's lap down. Too embarrassed to stop \"her\", Zack only watches as the maid diligently soaks up the liquid as best as possible. So thorough is the maid outift at forcing Alex clean Zack's lap, that the physical attention to his loins (not to mention the maid's considerable beauty) cause Zack to get slightly aroused. He is embarrassed by his reaction to the maid's seemingly harmless gesture, and only hopes \"she\" doesn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, still in disbelief in what he has been doing this whole time, did not notice... but his lacy captives did. Alex gives the damp towel to Zack, letting him clean up his hands, and to the surprise of both of the young men in the room, Alex's fingers make their way to Zack's belt buckle. Not exactly a ladies man, Zack is immediately uncomfortable with the attention, but he again locks eyes with Alex and falls perfectly still. Painted to look sultry in mascara and eyeshadow, the maid only smiles as he slowly unbuckles Zack's belt and opens the front of his pants. Alex is terrified and disgusted as he sees his own gloved hand reach gently into Zack's pants and find what it is looking for. He can feel the warmth of Zack's member through the silk glove, and the feeling nauseates him; the make up of course hides this perfectly behind an eager and sexy visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gently massaging his member to full strength and wiggling down Zack's pants a bit to grant more freedom, the glove exposes Zack's erect manhood. The cold causes him to wince only slightly, but Zack is again greeted with Alex, staring him right in the eye with that adorable smile, seemingly all too happy to help keep Zack warm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither of the young men can hardly believe how quickly the situation has escalated, but Alex's lacy prison shows no sign of relent. Zack is too bewitched by Alex's beauty and seductive manner to offer resistance now. Alex, horrified at what has taken place already, can only watch as his gloved hand is forced to stroke Zack slowly. He only hopes that this is as far as things will escalate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hopes are dashed as the outfit forces Alex to lean in towards Zack's member, until he is nearly face-to-face with it. Despite every ounce of his willpower saying to do otherwise, his painted lips offer a cute grin before opening up to receive Zack's erect penis into his mouth. Alex closes his mouth around Zack's member, enveloping it and trying to warm it from the cold of the room. This causes Zack to shudder with surprise and pleasure. After just a moment, he settles down and looks at the maid to find, again, that he is looking right back at him, with his painted lips enclosed around his manhood. \"Her\" beautiful eyes stare back at him as Alex is forced to bob back and forth in order to pleasure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex can't believe this is happening, and tries desperately to imagine himself anywhere else, doing anything other than polishing off his friend's manhood. It is at this point that he notices that even his tongue is under the spell of these damned clothes... probably from that spray he was forced to put into his mouth. His tongue expertly works the most erogenous areas of Zack's manhood, but either from the spilled drink or the aforementioned spray, he doesn't find the taste to be terribly bad. It actually has a sweetness to it, which causes Alex even more stress and embarrassment to find that there is at least one part of this ordeal that he finds enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing that this nightmare would end, Alex wishes he could just get this over with, when he notices that the clothes are working to pleasure himself as well. As the outfit forces him to slowly receive Zack in his mouth, Alex's panties are gently massaging his own groin. It is hardly a consolation, but it is at least something to distract himself from the act of orally pleasuring another man while dressed as a sexy maid. Alex tries to imagine that he is the one receiving a blowjob from a lovely lady, and imagines the lacy pleasure he feels on his manhood being caused by a similar scenario to the one he finds himself in. The mental trick seems to be working, and Alex is able to focus more on his own carnal pleasures than what his lips and mouth are being forced into doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex closes his eyes to better envision himself on the receiving end of such treatment, and tt isn't long before Alex is stifling moans from the increased excitement from his groin, unable to do much other than a feminine murmur with his mouth full of Zack's manhood. The sensation becomes more and more intense the closer that Zack reaches to climax, and Alex finds himself being more receptive to Zack's member in hopes of finding release for the both of them... and that's when he notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes had released Alex from their hold just a moment ago, letting him close and open his eyes, speak if he wants to, and even stop the impromptu sexual act here and now. Sure enough, Alex flexes a leg muscle and moves a hand across Zack's thigh to test it, and he finds he has complete control over his body again. Eager to take Zack's penis from his mouth, Alex brings a premature end to the sexual escapade, only to find an unfortunate side-effect; the extremely pleasurable massaging of his own groin comes to an end as soon as he stops pleasuring Zack. Hungry for sexual release ever since being forced into this get-up, Alex is so desperate that he actually puts Zack's manhood back into his mouth to see if the sensation from the panties would return, which he is equally excited and saddened to find that it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack notices that the young maid is acting a bit differently, and looks down at her with concern. Alex's eyes catch Zack's, his mouth again full with his member, and Alex blushes straight through his rouge colored cheeks and looks away, taking the penis out of his mouth. Alex can barely think through all the hormones, but he surmises that he could put an end to this and slink away if he wants to; Zack is a bit timid and wouldn't pursue a stranger like that... but Alex is also hard-up for sexual release, so much so that he...</span></div></div>",

You don't have to keep going if you don't want to...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is strangely relieved to know that Zack believes him to be a \"miss\", and to calm his fears just long enough to get his own sexual satisfaction, Alex does his best to imitate the intense, lusty stare that the make-up had forced his painted face to make just moments ago... and he does so with great results, so much so that Zack finally responds with a smile as they stare into one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to keep up appearances, Alex adds some pleasurable moans to the prolonged sucking and slurping of Zack's manhood, and tries to help him reach climax quicker so that he might reach his own release. The timid Zack responds in turn, finding this new, sexy attitude of the maid even more exciting, if not nerve-wracking. Through an ironic twist, Alex finds himself acting the part of a sultry maid even better when not under control of the cursed outfit. The continued caresses of the panties on his groin only cause Alex to get more flustered, and he picks up the pace of his up and down bobbing on Zack's penis. Zack, unable to hold back much longer, grabs hold of Alex's head gently. Alex feels Zack's member stiffen even harder, pulsing in his mouth, as his own release is just seconds away. Both of the young men reach climax together; Alex filling his panties, while Zack unloading his seed into the back of Alex's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as Alex did to pleasure Zack with his mouth, it is the maid who appears most pleased in the afterglow of their impromptu fellatio. Alex doesn't come down from the euphoria for some time after Zack does, with the sexy maid still holding his manhood with Alex's soft lips. Once the pleasure has passed, however, Alex doesn't have long to enjoy it, as now he is in the extremely weird and awkward situation of being dressed as a maid and having just pleasured one of his best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow... that was...\" Zack stammers, \"...amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extreme burning sensation heats up Alex's cheeks, blushing harder than he ever has in his life.

Plus if you're so afraid Zack, you can just stay put!\" Zack's stomach was too busy growling to let him pay attention otherwise. \"But I'm hungry...\" he sighed. \"Maybe you should go check out the pantry then, I bet that's where they hide the Scooby Snacks!\" Sam chuckled to himself. \"Make me a sandwich while you're back there too,\" he bellowed as he walked off into the yet unknown depths of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was having none of this. Not only was he still upset at himself for performing terribly at the swim meet, but now he was stuck in a creepy house with two of his friends that probably hated him at this point. Dejected, he wandered towards what looked like the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counter top glistened as the lights flickered on, beaming down against the brown speckled marble. Zack shuffled around a few of the shelves only to find large sums of dust and no signs of life. Silently he kept hoping to find something, anything to eat, but started to wonder what kind of food would even keep in an old abandoned looking mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he poked his head in through the pantry doors, though, he noticed it was stocked full of goodies as far as the eye could see! Was this a cruel prank or a generous gift? Inspecting the box top of some cookies, he noticed that the expiration date was many months from today. Perhaps somebody still lived here? ... Maybe they wouldn't mind losing just a few cookies, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack rummaged around a few more cupboards before finding a set of gorgeous dinner plates, setting himself up a spread of treats: a handful of cookies, a fresh looking banana, and a warm cheese sandwich he managed to cobble together. Just as he started to stuff his face with food, a figure appeared out from a side of the room. Her focus was square on the shelves and sprawling counter in front of her as if she was... cleaning them? She seemed to glide across the kitchen and as if satisfied with her work, turned around before noticing Zack holding a bitten into sandwich. It was now he could make out her features, that of a very old looking woman in an even older looking maid's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face's wrinkles scrunched up as she looked closer at Zack. \"A bit early for your break time, isn't it dear?\"</span></div></div>",

As all these questions tried to flood his mind instead of this crippling fear welling up, the sandwich he was holding slipped out of his hands, toppling into his carefully planned plate of goodies and spilling everything onto the floor into a pile of crumbs and plate pieces. \"Honestly now...\" the old woman sighed. \"You act as if you've seen a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down and starts to sweep up the discarded food. \"At least give me a hand, wouldn't you sweetie?\" Her tone seemed both annoyed and exhausted. Zack shook his head, snapping himself out of the trance and bent down to pick up a shard of plate. \"Oww!\" The shard fell back to the floor as blood started dripping from his thumb. The old woman sighed seeming even more annoyed. \"Maybe you should have taken a nap instead. Right this way...\" she said, dragging Zack out of the kitchen and into the next room. She sat him down into a nearby chair, rummaging around a cabinet's contents before procuring some medical supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room itself was quite bare and just as dusty as the rest of the house. A few more of these tall cabinets, chairs scattered about, and even some changing screens. After his thumb was bandaged up, he stood up to leave, perhaps even run away. The old lady stopped him before any of these things could happen. Her wrinkles twitched in thought. \"By the way dear... \" she mused, tugging on his jacket. \"Where is your uniform?\" Zack was even more confused. \"M-my what?\" A smile parted her wrinkled face. \"Ah! So she does speak! Your maid's uniform, of course.\" As Zack tried to explain what was going on or that he wasn't a she, the woman shook her head. \"No matter, you are lucky a spare was left in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned as Zack finally looked inside the large cabinet. Towards the bottom he noticed the bandages and antiseptic sticking out of an open drawer, with a handful of closed drawers. As his eyes wandered up he noticed; a pair of shiny heeled shoes. A pair of crisp black stockings with white ribbons. A set of long, black gloves with similar ribbons. A gorgeous lacy white apron atop a black dress with frilled white accents around the sleeves and collar. And of course, a maid's cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Zack noticed that this maid's uniform was far more extravagant than the one the old woman was wearing. The kind of outfit you'd see girls wearing at a Halloween party, except much more authentic looking. As if the master of the house had this made with the intent that his maids would look cute while cleaning his house, while itself being both usable and sturdy. That still didn't explain why the old woman's outfit was so much more antiquated. He had tried to imagine her in such an outfit, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the old woman, her tone shifted back into a more accustomed annoyance. \"Well, what are you waiting for? Change into the uniform so you can help me clean up your mess,\" she huffed. \"Then you can help clean the rest of the house.\"</span></div></div>",

Her face seemed even more exasperated than before. \"Very well, dear. You leave me no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old maid lunged out like a cougar, reeling in Zack's good hand, and effortlessly lifted him off his feet with one arm. Zack may have been terrified of her before, but he was outright flipping his lid at this point. No further emotion seemed to cross the woman's mind as with similar speed she tossed Zack right into the cabinet. The gorgeous maid's uniform seemed to reach out like a catcher's mitt as it stopped Zack cold in his tracks. What looked like a fairly small cabinet seemed to stretch out forever in all directions. Zack's last thought was to try and run away with all his might, but by then it was too late. The maid's uniform held a tighter and tighter grip on him as the cabinet's doors were slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's heart lept out his chest. All he could see was pure darkness while his body quivered with the feeling of a thousand snakes slithering all over his cold flesh. He tried to shut his eyes and count down from three. Maybe this was just a nightmare, and he had fallen asleep in the kitchen. This is what he would have liked to believe, but the slithering feeling was doing no favors. It felt warmer and warmer, the slithering getting faster and faster. For a brief moment it stopped. He tried taking deep breaths but his chest felt tight, as if something was coiled around it. Then his feet felt like little snakes were constricting them. The cabinet had woken up again, perhaps after a little yawn. Zack's mind and body couldn't take much more of this and he finally passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up again he was surprised to be able to actually see. His eyes itched and burned but there was actual light. He tried to spin around on his heels to get a clear view of where he was but they wouldn't budge. Nothing would! Except for his head, it seemed. As if jostled by his awakening, Zack's body started to move on its own and towards a full mirror, as if toying with the poor boy's emotions. He knew all too soon that the boxom girl walking towards the mirror was him. His nose wriggled trying to rid itself the scent of a sweet perfume while a full set of lashes shyly peeked out underneath a row of bangs. His rosy pursed lips begged to be kissed. Somehow he had transformed into a very pretty little maid, but his body gave him little time to think about the hows or whys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to go to work.</span></div></div>",
