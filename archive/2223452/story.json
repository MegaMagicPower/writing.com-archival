As you walk deeper you see the trees has blocked out some of the sunslight though you can see a few raise bleed through the leafs. you can hear the birds chearping and you see a few fireflies flash their lights around you, their is something rather special about these woods though you don't think too much about it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then you here some quite quick flapping and then you see a glittery light zoom near you.

She then winked and flew up to your face, her yellow hair moves like the wind and here wings flapped as quick as the eye can see. \"I don't really talk to much humans. Mostly due to the fact that they rarely come around, so you can kinda see why I snapped at you like that I didn't really know what came over me their.\"  She then flew over to your shoulder and sat down, maybe this isn't so bad after all she seems rather nice granted her anger was justifie this could be a start of a quick friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned you head towards her \"No worries it was understanded, water under the bridge.\" She gave you a sun filled smile and a cute squeaky chuckle, you continue along the path but their is still one thing that bothers you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy dust from earlier you still don't know what the effects are or even if they even have an effect you head still hurts from it. Though it is starting to clear up Twig would of said that the dust she through had some magical effect to it. You look back at Twig and shes still sitting there swinging her feet back anf forth with a care free smile. So it must be nothing you are probably thinking to deep into it, you breath a sigh of relief. Then Twig tugs on your ear wanting to tell you something so you lean in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up on your shoulder and gave a small grin \"what if I showed you something cool lets just say it's a little suprise that your going to like.\" She flew off your shoulder and flew infront of you \"Come on follow me!\" She said with a musical tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do like suprises so you figured to follow her, if it's was that cool you have to go and see it so you ran after her at full speed. You never thought that some one as small as her would be that fast but the enegy she have shows it. You made it to a clearing in the woods and their she was waving at you, she then flew towards you now lets see what this suprise is all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the suprise?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twig flew up to you gleefully not letting anything stop her. \"So are you ready for that suprise I was talking about.\" You nod your head ready for anything. She gave a playful giggle and flew the the tree next to you, she reached into the small hole to then pull out a bottle of a strange purple liquid the battle appears be the half the size of her its roughly the size of your palm. She flew back and drops the bottle in your hand you lift it up and then stared at it with discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go a head drink it!\" Twig said with enthusiasm, usually you don't drink stange drinks random people give you and you can't really consider that you konw Twig so you hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Twig \"are you sure that this is ok I don't feel to conformable with this, I don't know of its poisonous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles \"It's not but I'm not going to tell you what ot does I dont want to spoil the suprise. But the one thing I will spoil is that it has a amazing fruity flavor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was not all too helpful but you guess you can take her word that its not deadly. But you don't want to be rude so you pull the cork of the top of the bottle making a clean and satisfying pop. The smell wasn't to bad it has an organic herb like smell, you look back at Twig and she gives you a thumbs up. You look back at the bottle \"Just one quick question do I need to drink all of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles \"you don't, you could just take a sip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes care of that so you took a small sip, you smack you lips as the liquid slides down your throat. It was... really good she was right it does have a nice fruity taste, blueberry, with a hint of strawberry. The flavor explodes in your mouth a punch of sweetness. You try your best not to go in for another sip, you manage to hold the urge you don't know what it even does yet. At first nothing so you figured that it was just a normal drink. After a few seconds you get a warm soothing feeling in your stomach, though weird at first but you start to embrace it, but then you get a sinking felling you feel your bones retract and the world around you starts to grow. Are you going on a drug trip or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you here Twigs voice but warped \"So how do you like it?\" your vision gets slightly haze, but then starts to clear everything just stops after that. Everything is normal exept for on thing but you can put your finger on it did the grass just get taller and then you look at Twig she is still small but she is at the height of you knee. She jumps up and down laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TA DA! Your now smaller.\" She then flies up and does a few flips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk me! Why!?\" you said in a shocked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwig then says \"Well I figured that that we can have some more things to do when your the same size as me. plus the potion not only shrink you but make you more durable and harder to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock you look back at the bottle and then at Twig then you thought that does make sences it must be hard to hangout with someone if they are 10 times the size and plus the activitys you could do would be limited \"You now Twig you got a point.\" You then drink all of the potion and you begin to shrink smaller and smaller until your the same hight as Twig at 6 inch (15.24cm). She smiles with joy but you get a strange feeling that this my not be the last time you will be shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands right in front of you \"So what's the first thing you want to do?\" Her voice was no longer high pitched, and sounds rather normal she has a high musical tone to her voice that is rather playful. You think of the things you want to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you plain to do?</span></div></div>",

You luckly manage to calm her down a feat that you though that would be impossible but out of sheer luck you did it. You took a seat right next to her you might as well start a conversation for since your most likely going to be this size for a while, you have all the time in the world. \"So what kind of hobbies do you do.\" though a very blunt question but you now twig is going to be the only person you see so might as well take the stupid and simple questions out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well flying around the forest is rather interesting. You see new things every day. Plus I do like test my magic and mostly potion brewing as you saw earlier.\" She has proven to be quite a potion maker though you question how many potions she has lying around. Though its best not to ask because it you don't want to imply shrinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to her \"So what kind of magic can you do?\" You try asking about magic to hopefully move on from the potions though you then regret asking that very question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a lot it would take me all day to tell you all of thing I can do but I do have some fun ones I can do.\" She then snaps her fingers and small fire work shoot out from her hand. It was amazing a show to be seen, though you wonder what other magical tricks she holds up her sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thats neat trick is there any more.\" You ask hoping that she pulls something out of her magical hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could but I rather hold off on it for now.\" She then leans back sliding on the ground and then put her head on the log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live her or is this just some place you go to have fun and relax.\" You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwig then stands up \"Well its many things it's not really my home even when I make it to be its more of a work place to see what magical stuff to do and also yes its a place I go to have fun. So enough talk and lets do something.\" She flighs up and ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you guys do?</span></div></div>",

I can arrange that.\"<br>\r\n\"What would that mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well....Don't freak out just hear me out. I think you would make a nice little pet for me. I would shrink you down so you would fit neatly in the palm of my hand. And then you wouldn't have to worry about anything because I would take care of you. I'd feed you, wash you and we could play with my magic.

You don't know that shrinking yourself smaller is the best but it is a week trial so you can turn back if you want so in the end their is not much to lose. It could help you ith your problem if you open yourself to the idea of being a pet. Man it will de degrading but lets give it a shot. \"Ok Twig I will try the one week trial.\" and just like that her eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy this is going to be fun! Just hold still.\" Twig then got some dust and squeezed it tightly in her hands a light bleed out inbetween her fingers and when she opened her hand the white dust turned to a hot pink. She took a deep breath and then blow the dusk at you, it sparkled like stars. You sneezed when the dust hit you, but then you felt odd it's something you can't describe, you feel like your slightly stronger but not in strength but as in endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that and mostly what did it do?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwig giggled,\"Well that made you more durable you see, just in case some bad happens you can at less tank it. I don't want my new pet to get hurt, don't worry I will take good care of you hopefully this helps you with your problem. I know its asking a lot but I just want to help my new friend.\" She then flew off and then pulled out another one of her shrinking potions. \"So we can do this two ways ether I can use my magic to shrink you or since you love my potions so much you and drink another one of my shrinking potions. This one is a little bit different it not a strong compared to the one from earlier and the effects are temperary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few seconds to choose you don't know what her magic is like, but you do like how her potions taste so might as well since she already has it out. You pointed to the potion and she nods handing it to you, once in hand you stared deep into the glass bottle the liquid was more brighter than the last one. As you stared you looked at your reflextion with in the liquid you exhaled and pulled the cork off the bottle. The pop rang and the mist of the liquid came out, you started to drink knowing you pasted the point of no return. Once finished you hand the empty bottle back to Twig though the taste didn't have a strong berry taste it was rather watered down but it had more of a honey taste to it. You feel your body sink and you looked at Twig see that this small fairy started to be taller than you and continues to get bigger and bigger. You past her breasts and she gives a playful giggle you shrink further and the Twig is now becoming an amazon compared to you. You reach her belly you look up you can hardly see her face past her breast she bends over and then gives a joyful smile you reached her waste line and you start to fell the effect slow down the less you want is to stare ate her privites for the whole week. Then finally you reached the point where the shrinking stops your bearly can reach her knee cap your are almost as big as her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up a the giant fairy before you, truely she is one to behold. she squats down and smiles you are at the mercy of this giantess fairy, but hopefully she is as gentle as she says she is. she then reached down and gentle wraps her fingers around you and picks you up your basically a doll to her now. \"Look at you! Your so cute and small just think of all of the fun e will have\" Her voice was noticeably louder and deeper but not by much, she then give you a great big hug smoothering you in her boobs the then puts you down and then thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she what to do?</span></div></div>",

She sets you down on the ground and then she takes a seat by the stream and puts her feet in the water you walk around and everything at this height is so different but yet interesting. A new perspective to look at things, you look at a \"small\" rock you try to pick it up you wrap both hands tightly around it and with all of your might you lift it up over your head.

Everything was great you never had berries or fruit be that jucy and sweet but now that you think about it what other food would you be having as time goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey twig I got a question? have you ever tried human food before like a steak or sandwich, ir fish of that matter.\" She takes a moment to think, and recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not really we do have things like that, though we had fish before but nothing like cow meat. We do have sandwichs before but with thing you maybe find odd or not familier with.\" Well it seem that does clear up your food question so just a little change but you know its going to be hard to get use to at first. As you lied down you look at Twig and you feel rather comfortable or maybe a little more. It's odd to feel like a pet to a fairy but does she really see you as a pet. You continue to eat what little you had left and it seems both of you are clocked out.

I'll let down the ladder incase you changed your mind.\" Like that a wooden rope tied ladder is then thrown out of the hole and dangles down to the base of the tree you lie down and pulla leaf over you and you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You feel a nice welcoming feel like this here was your home the whole time this is nothing foraign to you. You feel a light breeze bloww over you and then you hear a bird cherp, and lastly you smell a smokey smell and then you hear a sizzle you get up and there you see Twig cooking over some hot coals. By the looks oof it she is cooking one bird egg though a meal for her at you height its like breakfest, and lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there you are you sleeped well I was suspecting you to come in during the middle of the night but you did suprise me you lasted sleeping outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya its really nothing specal once I found the right spot I was good so you are making eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes would you like your have scrambled or sunny side up.\" she ask while cutting the egg in have on the pan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too picky whatever.\" She nods she then grabs a pepper and with a flick of her wrist ti goes into the air and then spins and begins to compact and then brakes up into grounded pepper. She then sprinkles it over the eggs, then she grabs a salt crystal and then she begins to mash it up in a fine dust. Like the pepper she sprinkles it on the eggs, you see her pull out every spice imaginable and mix it up in the pan. \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides a plate of your egg, yuo took a bit... It was fantastic she knows what shes doing in not just postion and magic but cooking as well. After finishing your egg you just collapse after that big of a meal you guess another perk of your size you get larger food portions. Twig looks at you and laughs, \"I'm guessing you enjoyed it?\" you put your thumb up you can't even speak it would be nothing but sloppy speach. \"Well once your done and ready I have planned out the day for the both of us don't worry their will be room for stuff you to do. Oh I almost for got can you pull your arm out.\" You manage to sit up and you stick your arm out and then she spins her finger in the air and a magical field forms around it. She points at your arm an then the magic raced to you and then snaps to your arm. It glows a bright radiant orange and then you look and see a glowing symbol on the back of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this do?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It links me to you in turn it allows me to know were you are it would only last at the end of the week. Just in case you run off I don't want to lose my little pet now do I.\" You look at the symbol again and you thought it was pretty neat its almost like a cool tattoo.</span></div></div>",

She can't see you and there nothing you can do every one of her movements is slowed down due to her massive scale and then you look up and the sun was blocked out.

As you walked around looking at the place around you seeing the sun rise and the early morning dew settle, you thought to yourself. This is a nice place here it has such a beautiful view of nature itself, then you hear Twig yawn from inside of her tree home. She flew out in a flash rubbing the sand out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well by the looks of it you selpt well.\" She tries to hold a laugh by covering her mouth with her hand when she looked at you face with bags under your eyes. \"What was the floor too cold for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it just I heared something in the night that woke me up.\" You replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you got scared\" Twig said mockingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it just kept me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just in case I got something for that here\" Twig pointed at you and a laze came out of her finger hitting you.

So if you decide to stay as my pet, then these spells will need to be recast.

I think that's enough for today.</b>\" <br>\r\nNow this had begun to feel like the pet experience you weren't so sure of. <br>\r\nBeing bossed around by a giant fairy with control of your entire life.<br>\r\nHowever you didn't feel any ill intent from her, just warm love.<br>\r\nMaybe someone like that having control isn't as bad.<br>\r\nMaybe that's what you needed.<br>\r\nAs you thought about all of that Twig picked you up and asked you<br>\r\n\"<b>So, do you want to sleep in my cleavage?</b>\"</span></div></div>",

Jaz then flies out of your hand and then flies next to you \"So what brings you to this forest anyways?\" She ask with a soft tone, it seems that she trying to make odds with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awnser her \"well I was just going down for a walk that's all. This is a new path that I'm taking because hey, you might as well explore as much as you can.\" Jaz gives a cute little chuckle and nods, it seems that she enjoys talking to you. Though she does seem to keep her distances around you, most like to not invade you personal space, at the same time she does hae that look that something is on her mind. Though you try your best to ignore it and not to make too much eye contact so you don't make her feel uncomfortable. Though in do time you had to ask the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see off put by something?\" Jaz quickly looked at you and then took a moment to think \"I'm just saying you seem rather bothered by something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh well you see... You know the fairy dust from earlier.\" She replied with a scared and doubtful, your face turns a pale white unsure on what she is going to say about it. She took a big exhale \"You see I don't kno what effects it might hold I just... blindly through it at you without knowing what it would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to keep calm and try to calm Jaz down besides she looks like she would even hurt a fly. \"Look surely you are over looking this. It must not be this severe as you think.\" Jaz looks at you then nods putting trust in your judgement. A few minutes pass and then you hear Jaz exhale like he figured something out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jaz find?</span></div></div>",

If I grow up too big to fly, my wings vanish until I get small again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So if you grow up to the size of a human, you can pretty well masquerade as a human - except for being magically beautiful,\" you said, and you weren't kidding; for a tiny three-inch naked fairy, if one ignored the wings she was a knockout of a girl. \"Would you like to spend some time in the human world? I'd be happy to be your escort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to,\" she said, \"but we have a rule about fraternizing with humans; if we spend time with them in the human world, they have to come back and spend the same amount of time with us in our world. Hey, fair is fair.\" I couldn't argue with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great to me. But we're going to have to get you some clothes before you grow up to human size; can you follow me to my house? My sister is away at school, and she left most of her clothes at home; I'll bet you can find something of hers to wear.\" You really wanted to meet this fairy girl face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that. How far away is your house? I can turn invisible, but not for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a five- or six-minute walk, and I'm there alone this week; Mom and Dad are on a trip by themselves, so it's the bachelor life for me this week,\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not waste time,\" Maple said, \"You can talk to me in a low voice and I'll hear you; I'll be right overhead.\" So you took off walking toward your house. A couple of minutes later, you realized that you didn't hear Maple's wings, so you said in almost a whisper, \"Maple, are you still with me?\" Moments later, you heard and felt a soft flutter next to my left ear, and a whisper of, \"You bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived home a few minutes later, unlocked the door, and stepped inside, In the quiet of the house, the flutter of her wings was audible, and as soon as you closed the door she reappeared. \"Wow,\" she said, \"I don't think I've held invisibility for that long in a long time. And flying that high and slow; wow, I've got a crick in my back muscles from all that flapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do?\" you asked. Without warning, she landed on your shoulder, and said, \"Is your room upstairs? Let's go up there; maybe I can convince you to give me a back rub.\" So, with an unlikely, three-inch naked fairy on your shoulder, you walked up the stairs to your room. Once you were inside, you closed and locked the door, explaining to Maple that some of your neighbors had keys, and that you'd rather not have to explain her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked, \"Now, how can I give you a back rub without damaging your wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you,\" she said, and she fluttered over to the bed, and started growing, stopping at just over five feet tall. As she had mentioned, her wings had entirely disappeared; by all appearances, you had one of the most beautiful girls you had ever met, naked in your bed, and she wanted you to put your hands all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you were up for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Maple, why don't you go ahead and lay face down, and I'll get started. I do a pretty thorough rubdown, so if I start to touch you anywhere I shouldn't, please tell me. I'm not trying to take any liberties that you don't want to give me; I just want to make you feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed sitting up for a moment, and said, \"You know, at this point every human male I've ever met has wanted to take advantage of me, for sex, or money, or for some other gain for themselves. What is it that YOU want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked her square in the eye, and said, \"I want the chance to spend a little time with someone who seems like an intelligent, unusual, magical person, who by the way is very pleasant to look at, especially since there's something I can do for you, which is to give you that back rub. If after the back rub you decide that you've had enough of my company, I won't try anything to hold you here. I'm just hoping we can become friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started leaking from both her eyes. \"I've never heard of anyone thinking that way about the fey folk; most people want something from us, or want to use us, or are afraid of us. But you just want --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friendship,\" you interrupted, \"just that. If it leads to something else, that's something we can both look at and decide on in the future, but for now I just want us to get to know each other better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears increased, and she stood up from the bed and hugged me. You were very much afraid that, as perceptive as she might be as a fairy, she might misread the involuntary reaction of a human male having his body pulled into close contact with what was as far as you could tell a female human body, which was not only the most attractive you had ever seen, but was also completely unclothed. However, either she didn't feel your erection or chose to ignore it; she released you from the hug, gave you a kiss on the cheek, then flopped down face-down on your bed. You sat down next to her on the bed and started rubbing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really amazing,\" she said, quietly. \"I've met so many other humans, and they just saw me as a THING that could hurt them, or could give them what they wanted, or that they could threaten others with. I could never be off my guard with them. Ooooh,\" she grunted, as you started working on a knot in her back muscles, \"that feels amazing, and I can RELAX with you. I'm pretty good at reading threats, and I don't think that you're a threat to me, or any of the fey folk, at all.\" A few minutes went by in silence, while you did all of her back that you could seated alongside her. At that point, you had to say, \"In order to finish up your back right, I'm going to have to straddle you to reach the rest of your back and rub it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that quite yet,\" she said, and reached out to touch your jeans, and jerked her hand back. \"I think that your clothes must be made of dead plants,\" she said, \"but not so much your shirt, since I could perch on your shoulder. But it's uncomfortable for such things to touch my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get rid of them for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that the denim of your jeans was made from cotton, as was your undershirt, your boxers, and your socks; essentially, she was asking you to get rid of all your clothes before you straddled her body. Your erection came back, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to be clear, Maple; pretty much everything I'm wearing is made of cotton, which is what you were feeling. Are you sure you want me to take off all my clothes? I swear I didn't know about this, and I'm not trying to force an intimacy on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled to face me, and reached out her hand to my face. \"You are the kindest human I've ever met. But I'd love to feel your body, without those icky clothes, against mine. So please - take off your clothes and climb up on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to tell you twice. In under 20 seconds, you went from fully-dressed to naked, and you climbed onto the bed and straddled her hips, resuming your back rub. Maple went back to her little moans of pleasure, especially during the three more muscle knots you massaged out of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you were done, and you asked her, \"How does that feel, Maple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it feels great, but something about wings is that it's not just back muscles; there are chest muscles involved as well. Would you mind massaging those, too?\" And she turned over underneath you, both her eyes and her beautiful breasts staring you in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou:</span></div></div>",

For most humans, a man rubbing a woman's chest, especially her breasts, is sexual foreplay. I don't want you to feel obligated to do anything for me, but I really don't want to get to the point where I lose control of myself and assume you're consenting to something you're not really expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Of COURSE I know it's sexual foreplay,\" she said. Just like straddling my body even fully clothed, just like getting naked, just like pressing your naked body against mine. And I told a little fib; your jeans were scratchy, but good cotton feels good against my skin, too. I just wanted to get closer to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted. Apparently this fairy girl was attracted to you, and the intimate acts you had mentally been playing down were, to her, full-on foreplay. \"So... you WANT me to make love to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat halfway up, grabbed your face with both hands, and said, \"You've been making love to me before you even touched me, with your respect, your interest, your tenderness. So yes, I want you to CONTINUE to make love to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you leaned down and kissed her lightly on her mouth, then started rubbing her chest area above her breasts. Her little noises of pleasure resumed, and got louder as you gently started giving attention to her very attention-getting breasts. You kissed her neck, then her upper chest, then each of breasts in turn, licking and sucking on her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to move your head down her body, and as you stuck your nose in her belly button, she went \"eep!\" and laughed. Finally, you started kissing her just above her pubic area. As you did, you reached down and started stroking the insides of her thighs; she moved her legs apart, and the sweet aroma of excitement seemed no different for her being a fairy. As you moved your hand up to gently hold her vulva, she shuddered as though in a moment of ecstasy, and burst out, \"Oh!\" then closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time. You placed a finger between her outer labia, and separated her inner labia, circling her vaginal opening with your fingertip, then moving up to her clitoris to begin gently massaging it. She shuddered again, and moaned, \"I want you in me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved between her legs and put your penis against the mouth of her vagina; you pushed in, and that mouth swallowed the entirety of your manhood. You continued moving in and out of her, while doing so touching her every sensitive spot you could reach not only with hands, but with your kisses. As she climaxed again, her feminine squeeze of you triggered your release, and you lay down on her, tired, spent, and very happy, still partially inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that felt so WONDERFUL!\" she said. \"I'm so relaxed...\" And as you watched, a glow like fairylight started around her body, and outlined yours as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou:</span></div></div>",

As you got off of Maple and she sat up, her wings popped out from behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means you're back at a size where you can fly,\" you said. She did a double-take, and almost frantically said, \"HOW did you get this small? Are you a fairy too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to show her your back. \"No wings, see? I think that since I was still in... touching you, when you shrank down, the magic included me, so here I am at three inches tall too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" She said, and looked thoughtful for a moment. \"Do you think you'd be up for an experiment? I'm... PRETTY sure you'll be OK. You WILL be OK, even if I have to get us some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought, <i>things can hardly get worse.</i> \"OK, let's try your experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably want to stand back...

You turned and walked away from her until she said, \"Good enough.\" You turned around again and looked at her, as the fairylight returned to outline her body again... and she grew again to just over five feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking the same thing, she said aloud, \"I guess now you know how fairies feel dealing with big people!\" You replied, \"That's for sure, and I can't even dodge by flying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin faded to a serious demeanor, and she held her hand out close enough for you to clamber onto, which you did; she raised you to her face and said, \"Now here's where the experiment comes in. I can't shrink smaller than my normal height without other magic, but I'm betting that you can, since it's not your magic doing it. What I want to do now is to put you inside me, and then shrink down again to my normal size and see what happens to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you THINK is giong to happen?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that either you'll be forced out of me as I get too small for you to be in there, or you'll shrink again, to a little under a quarter-inch.

You are quite un sure how small your going to be for all you know your going to keep on shrinking till Sky stops the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I might as well see what life ould be at your height its a new experience that one might not see.\" You try your best to look on the bright side for all you know Sky may be a nice person once you know her though you still hold your doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that's the spirit, life was made for you to take risks.\" Well you guess you are getting some where in that friend factor but see still seems rather bossy to full of herself. You begin to shrink a little bit more your at the size of a toddler you did not see your life be head this way but never the less you push on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this shrinking thing permanent just.\" You figured mostly because it the biggest problem at hand, you don't want to live your life as a dust mite. She gives you a off putting grin and you see your stomach sink, this is not going to be the anwser that you are hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to an extent I rather tell you later. How about you tell me what brings you to this forest?... Maybe you should not ask so many questions.\" Well... she does have a point but mostly what does she mean by \"extent\" maybe it will shrink me to a point and she then have to re-apply the shrinking magic? The shrinking does seem random on when it shrinks and how much it shrinks. Speak of the devil you shrink even more your merely 3' (0.91 meters)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I walk down this path manly because I it a nice forest to walk through. Its unlike any other forest I've seen.\" You look at Sky and she is the size of your shin man she not as small as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that makes sense we do try our best on making this forest. Little fun fact I made the plans on how the forest should look so you have me to thank for that. So I guess this is where the fun begins I have some plans for you.\" As she said that you begin to shrink more and more one big burst hits you and now your only a 10\"(25 cm) tall now a little bit taller than Sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you/she do?</span></div></div>",

The moment you stop talking she then looks up and then she talks about herself though knowing her this might take an hour or so you just mute her in you mind.

This doesn't boad well you feel embarrassed by the fact that a fairy is towering over you.

Just look at you no higher then my breasts.\" Her words cut deep you but you try your best to keep your pride and stand tall, and some how this makes you more confident. Though the state that you are in is... unappealing to say the less, you power through the insults thrown your way. You give a small grin and then look up at her and stare deep into her eyes, she stares back with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really think you can with stand me little one remeber I have you where I want you.\" Then with a flick of her wrist you begin to feel a sharp pain flow through your body bringing you back to your fear. She giggles with joy \"now little one get down on your knees and praise me as, and without hesitation you do what she says. You feel yourself shrink more feeling powerless, she smiles knowing that she has you under her full control and seeing you slowly shrink makes it even more enjoyable too her. This is the most humiliate you ever felt in years she then puts her foot on your shoulder and then looks down at you. \"I want you to praise me say that you are forever mine. Go on do it we both know that I have the most power here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost choke on your words but you didn't say any thing, Enchantra's face turns to anger she pushes down on your shoulder with her foot. The pain you feel is nothing you felt before but the fact that she is pushing this to point tells you that its best not to disobey her. Plus not to metion that if you are on her good side she did say she will regrow you. \"Ok, ok... I am forever... yours.\" you feel like shit after that you shrink a bit more and by the looks of it she is loven this. She pusts her foot off of you and then squat down to your level and she gives a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well wasn't that so hard I want you to stand up don't get too excited this is only to see how tall you are.\" She said in a demanding tone, and you spend not time so when you got up you where... Up to her waste though it may has it perks but the fact that your smaller than a fairy doesn't make this much of an upside. She smiles and then shuff your face in her vagina \"Hm you like that well maybe if your a good little boy I will let you have fun with it.\" she then thows you off and demans you to get back on your knees and of course you do as your told. Then with a snap of her fingers a throne appears a seat perferctly suited for her she grins at you \"Well now it seems you have come to terms that you are my slave which is perfect to know what I want you to do is you first task and this is a simple one is to get on all fours and be my foot rest. This is degrading on so many levels but you have to do it if you want to go bact to normal. So you do it but not for long due to your shrinking with in a minute or two you shink a little bit more that you were only ankle height. As you stand looking at her ankle and then look up to see the amazon of a fairy towering over you she then knees you in the face and ask you to get back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everything is peachy between use right?\" you ask hoping that she will just let it go she laughs at your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not I'm having too much fun with you and plus you we haven't really gotten to the real fun yet my little slave.\" Her voice sound different a little deeper and more powerful and by the looks of it this will be the case as time goes on. You try your best for it to not get the best of you you look around and see that her throne holds a lot of personal items gems, tomes, and a few glass most like potions or some kind of drink its hard to tell but most of all. Theres a magical orb, a dagger and lastly a whip. Enchantra looks down at you on her throne \"Now my slave now for your next task I want you to kiss my feet\" She then plants her foot on the ground and you gave it a light kiss she gives a little giggles \"I was kidding I just want to see if you would do it. What I really want you to do is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she want you to do?</span></div></div>",

You begin your massage and as you feel around you just regret everything but by the looks of it she is at less enjoying it, but you don't know that she is like the massage itself or your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suprised that you haven't lost you cool yet you are sadly getting use to this something you never suspected to happen.

I must say it was everything and more on what I wanted. Now since you are at that height clean my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what?\" you asked as you look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With anything use your imagination.\" She said begrudgingly. You look around now water not dry leafs or fabrics nothing. \"I got an idea why don't you use that tongue of yours.\" Thats what you are afraid of, you bend down and you start to lick you can just taste the salt and when you less suspected it you shrink more the fear of being treated like this you can't take it. You shrink smaller and smaller and you stop when you gain your bearings though the damage has been done you believe that your just bigger than her toes. You licked and licked until you manage to finish. Your tongue was like sand paper all dried up, you sit down and rest and then you see a shadow loom over you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Look at you so small and helpless. I must say you did a great job and for that you can rest BUT not for long</font></b>\" Her voice sounds deeper than before you feel powerless but you hold your fears back and regain your cool. Her foot swings up on her lap it moved slowly and you can hear the wind wip around it. You lie down you crashed from all that happened but you hope you can regain your enegy in time before she call for you again.</span></div></div>",

Shes caring and gentle to her friends and others. Her calm blue exterior can make her your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaple: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/karbo/art/The-final-dungeon-659990826\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/karbo/art/The-final-dungeon-659990826</a> Shes not like any other fairy, she has a tomboy like additude.

Bossing others is what she does best is it because of power she feels maybe. Is it because she entitled and damn good looking hell yes. Her looks comes first and it shows with her adittude additude though in some cases she uses her looks to get whet she wants... like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffy: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/elenadudina/art/Purple-fairy-819273483\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/elenadudina/art/Purple-fairy-819273483</a> She is rather shy, more shy than most fairies often keeping a lot of things to herself. Some thinks that its because shes hiding something or maybe because she just does not like attention. But she is rather gentle and carring to thoughs arounder her she is one to talk to if you get her to speak that is. Though if anything goes wrong all you can hear are her soft \"sorrys\" how knews how she would react to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/sayju/art/Classroom-Fairy-2-778725705\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/sayju/art/Classroom-Fairy-2-778725705</a> Shes rather calm and collective also rather smart, she finds humans rather intreasting and want to learn more about human culture.

She loves the feel of power and control it just all goes to her head though it makes her go \"over the edge\" at times. She sees others as lessers its now wonder others would call her the queen of power, and in your case you are just her slave maybe even less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore characters will be add overtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: I'm not very picky when it comes to restrictions but of course you have to have some to keep things in check<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No giant men or M/M. Just keep this giantess focused. Though I'm not opossed to small women just as long as they are taller then the men its fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Their are no size limites go CRAZY. BUT build up to it. Just note that you will start out at your normal size of 5'11\" (1.8 meters). Also if you so choose the fairies can grow same rule applies no limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No one sentence chapters unless the chapter is to extend more choices, other wise at less a paragraph or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Humans are allowed but keep them at a minimum this is manly focused on the fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. This is hard to enforce based on countries people live but any under-aged character please don't too sexual you can keep it playful but nothing this is under the lines of sex or any thing inappropriate I just don't want the FBI knocking on my door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Please write in english.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No extreme levels of scat or extreme toilet stuff. You can have it but don't go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. I'm not a huge grammer nazi but please spell check and try your best on using good grammer hell I'm not perfect either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. This is a shrinking story so keep the story on track on that. Plus as metioned previously growing is allowed its mostly focused on shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Please use 2nd person like \"you saw, or you felt\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. No single choice chapters. Two or more choices this is an interactive story after all it's a lot more fun if you have more choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. You are allowed to add more charaters just introduce them when mentioned (picture(s) is optional).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. Don't end the story too early let the story go as long as possible. Ideally want the story to be endless but I know that's not going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Lastly and this is a big rule... HAVE FUN and be created for example you could use magic to shrink or a potion or food or a spell that shrinks you when ever you *Insert thing here*. But just follow the story and the path that you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso check out my other story(s) <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2229271-Your-BIG-Dream-Come-True\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2229271-Your-BIG-Dream-Co...</a></td>",
