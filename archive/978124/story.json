It won't take us that long to get there because you're so huge now\".<br>\r\nSo Yuna and Tidus set off for Glenda's home in the mountains. It was very cold and Tidus nestled himself carefully inside Yuna's hand. As more and more time passed Yuna grew more and more disatisfied with her current situation. If she stayed this size, it meant she could never again be with Tidus, or hug him, or kiss him. A big tear rolled down her cheek and saturated Tidus. <br>\r\n\"Hey\", he said. \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing\", she said. \"But what if Glenda can't help me? What the hell am I supposed to do then?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course Glenda can help you\", he comforted her. \"She's the most powerful witch in the entire county.\"<br>\r\nYuna felt a bit better at these comforting words, and soon they arrived at Glenda's lair. <br>\r\n\"Glenda...\" Yuna called in her booming voice.</span></div></div>",

However though she had all this power she did find one fault to this. During the growing process it seemed her clothes were torn and shredded here and there. Her skirt which once covered her feet and legs completely now could barely hide her thighs also showing down below that her feet hit literally exploded out of her shoes, and that Corset which covered her upperbody completely ripped around the midsection yet somehow managed to stay intact just enough to cover her breasts and keep them pressed together to provide a nice and snug prison for Auron in this case. Though Auron wouldn't be the only one to be a prisoner of this as Lulu turned her attention towards the Blitzball Stadium, her intent on capturing Tidus and Wakka next, knowing that they are playing today,this step would be a breeze. Taking her first step towards her new cause she finds herself heading towards the Luca stadium making it there within only 4 or 5 steps across Luca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't these guys going to be in for a Surprise Auron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Warrior Monk in the canyon which was her cleavage however just stayed silent as Lulu  now stands infront of the Stadium, It not even close to coming past her Knees, only rising maybe mid shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cutting to the Arena*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fans were on their feet as they were watching the Besaid Aurochs taking on the Kilika Beast's just as Tidus scores a goal with the infamous Jecht Shot tieing the score 1 to 1. With only a little left to go in the 2nd half  The players take their respected positions as they ball is put into play and immediately grabbed by Wakka who swims for a bit before passing it to Tidus setting him up for yet another shot. Shooting the ball upwards while Tidus is doing a backflip in the water awaiting the ball so as to hit the Sphere Shot. Though just like in Zanarkand this shot would happen as soon a huge shadow casted over the Stadium and a nice earthquake sized rumble shook the fans to the core. Tidus misses the ball completely taken by shock at this Shadow and with his momentum switches himself back up right and more as he now finds himself laying on his back looking straight up, his heart nearly diving out of his chest at what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LULU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouts to himself, gurgling what in the processwhile looking up at the surreal sight above him, the angle of her gorgeous body as her tattered clothes barely were able to contain her assets. Wakka still unknowingly swims over to Tidus and shrugs his shoulders as if asking \"Whats up?\" His only answer would be Tidus pointing upwards. Wakka catching the hint looks up and his mouth drops taking in alot of water as the other Blitzball Players at this time have decided to bail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Boys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu says softly down towards them, however at her size, her soft voice was enough to rattle the insides of the people in the arena nearly making all of them deaf just from hearing her voice. Her eyes surveying the orb of water infront of her no doubt containing her friends and some players to stunned to move. A grin crosses her face as she leans down and begins to reach for the tiny orb which now is the size of a sphere from the Cloister of Trials compared to her. That would be when she noticed a very faint sensation touching the side of her foot.</span></div></div>",

She sat cross leg resting after ending the existence of another kingdom, and coming to rest on her old, lifeless home. She opened a single eye, now at her old height, surveying her once prosperous home. No children ran through the streets with expressions of glee on their face, no parents watched them with the eyes of a hawk, no, they all had met there final resting place under her foot, rear, or inside of her stomach. But a good portion had fled to the twilight cage ( see Sonic chronicles for details ). Who would think this whole thing had begone with her in the biggest depression of her life, due to her low success rate of jewel capture. Then one night, it all changed. She began to think back to that day, in which the fate of the universe was sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned and tossed under her decorated sheets, dreaming of how she had been failing so many attempts at theft. Unown to her, a small meteor fell free form towards the surface of the planet. Specifically towards the very complex that Rouge was currently calling her secret hideout. As the space rock entered earths gravitational pull, the rocky outer-coating broke of like the shell of an egg. It opened up to show a green slime that pulsed every second with a bluish tint that made it light up like a Christmas light. Many onlookers, including the many commanders of G.U.N, saw the object, and suspecting it to be a u.f.o, hoped in there cars and drove of to see the object. Soon the slime came to a crashing yet silent halt on the window frame of Rouge's room. Acting like it possessed a mind of it's own, it crawled through the crack in Rouges window, and made its way up onto her bed. It then broke of into three pieces and melted into Rouges skin, each one targeting a different organ. One went towards her stomach, and attached itself to said organ, making the stomach expandable and able to digest anything. The second and largest melted into her brain, changing her thoughts on life. And the final dissolved itself onto her heart, at that one point, making her virtually invulnerable to everything except love, and her new never  ending appetite. She quickly arose from her bed, and said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Man, this girl's got a need to feed \", as she walked towards the fridge and began zombishly ( I INVENTED A NEW WORD!!!!!!!!!!! XD ), devouring every object in the fridge, finally ending with the fridge itself. She was shocked for herself for a moment, and thought she would have to grow to lose all that weight, which ironically, it did, although the bloat disappeared all on its  own. This soon escorted an evil grin showing up on her face, showing that the slime was doing its job. Within a single minute she had devoured every single object in the room, all without awaking anybody else, or gaining a single pound, except for the ones she gained from growing. She layed down a went through what had just occurred. She could now eat whatever she wanted, and not gain weight, but instead grow, and now that she had just eaten all that fernacher, she was on the verge of a huge growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of thirty or so gun soldier and the entire population of night folk stood outside, watching a team of twelve detectives searched the area. A scream erupted from the crowd as Rouge grew to the size of the building, and finally proceeded to devour the building. As many men woman and children pleaded for help, there crys fell on deaf ears, as soon the entire building was submerged in her bodily acids. She then grew again to the height of the building plus her own, plus everything that was inside. After rubbing her stomach from the taste of the skyscraper, she looked down the crowd of speech less soldiers. As she turned, stepping on the detectives around her feet, the residents all fled. Rouge however sat down, and pulled in the crowd, shoving every last man and women into her mouth, missing one small boy. As she swallowed the thousands of people, feeling them clamber down, and meeting their dooms, giving her a period to grow. She reached out and picked her teeth with a news helicopter, swallowing it afterwords. She then yawned and layed her 400 ft giantess body onto the pavement, crushing the child with her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to now?</span></div></div>",

And even more disgusted when the giantess Rouge swallowed the helicopter. Seeing that this was his time to go, he grabbed his shoes, and snuck out to make sure he did'nt wake his girlfriend ( You'le choose that later ). As he sped through the streets, he saw that only those still asleep or who stayed behind were still breathing. When he finally arrived, he was  taken back by the size of the bat girl. He however was'nt the first to arrive, for hundreds of tanks and helicopters were already there and waiting. In fact the moment Sonic arrived, they opened fire on Rouge. Sonic covered his eyes as the tank shells let loose against the bat girl. Rouge awoke with a jolt, sending the  tiny men into the air. Rouge growled at the men as she reached down and grabbed the tiny tanks throwing them to the ground. Then as the helicopters let loose on Rouge, she yelled in pain as the bullets cut through her skin, small pools of blood appearing. Enraged, she wacked the helicopters away, stoping to eat one at the middle. As Rouge enjoyed the growth from the heli, she found her self falling back from a spindash sent by Sonic. She stood to look for her enemy, but felt him whack her in the back of the head. She had had enough of this, but found that her enemy had fled. Satisfied, she glided up towards the mountains to sleep once more. She thought about what she might do tommorow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I could go down to the city and devour everything in sight, that would give me some good growth \" she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Or maybe it would be better to rest up and practice on the animals around here, oh choices,choices, and more choices \".

I guess I ate my ice cream a little too fast...\" Cream said feeling a stronger pain now. Then she took a quick look at Cheese, who also felt the same pain, Then just like that, Cream and Cheese began to grow...</span></div></div>",

She came to from the pain and she saw that the buildings that once towered over her, she was towering over them! \"W-what's going on?!\" Cream shouted, her voice was extremley loud and it broke most of the windows on the buildings, the people saw the titanic rabbit and all of the citizens started to scream and scramble all over the place, just to get out of Station Square to keep their very lives! Cream started to walk and whenever she stepped it made a loud \"BOOM!\" Cream then accidently stepped on a passing car, crushing it like it were a bug. \"Oh, no! I-i'm so sorry!! What have i done?!\" Cream said starting to cry. But just then Cream and Cheese both felt a sharp pain in their heads. The pain was so intense they couldn't help but just fall to the ground in a kneeling position. \"O-ow!! My head...i-it's so painful...I-I can't stand it anymore!!\" Cream shouted. \"CHAO!!\" Cheese cried clutching his head. After about 2 minutes, Cream slowly opened her eyes, but instead of seeing the normal orange color, it was a very bright red, as well as Cheese's, then Cream and Cheese both adopted an evil grin on thier faces, not to mention Cheese had very very sharp teeth. Then she slowly got up, and stomped a car into the streets of the city, leaving a very big shoeprint as well as a somewhat bloody mess. However, the driver of the car somehow survived, so Cream picked him up with her index finger and thumb, slowly opened her mouth and dropped him inside, swallowing the poor man's life away. Cream and Cheese both crusied the city streets, crushing buildings and cars. One of the unwrecked buildings Cream looked inside, her giant face covered the entire view of the workers there. She evily grinned and slowly reached inside and grabbed one of the workers and crushed him in her fist, shattering all bones inside of him. Cream and Cheese continued their destructive rampage on Station Square, crushing buildings, cars, and bridges, and in no time at all, Station Square was completely in ruins. But just then on of the Team Sonic members noticed Cream's titanic figure.</span></div></div>",

Finally just as Cream thought she was going to fall into her best friends mouth, she felt her grip disappear and a strong lurch. She looked up and saw her dress was being held in between Blaze's teeth. Wondering what was going on, she looked out onto the horizon, and saw nothing. Then suddenly there was a shake, followed by a thump. Looking down, her face lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Indeed, Blaze had taken off her pants. Exposing her lower half, only her panties covering her private regions. Taking Cream out of her teeth, she held her to her only a few inches away from her face. \" Do you wanna have some fun Cream? \" She asked with a very devilish smile on her face. Cream was about to say something, but before she could answer, Blaze swung her hand downward and dropped it into her panties, and pressed her finger and Cream into her womanhood. A gasp escaped her lips, as her first ever friend was shoved all the way up into her womb, and left there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   By now her entire hand was submerged into her pussy, and finally pulled out, with a small layer of sticky liquid on her hand. She then fell on her ass, and began putting her pants back on. Once she was done, she stretched herself out, and began rubbing her belly. She could have sworn she heard Cream screaming to be let out. Then her old nature began to reach out from the back of her mind. A massive headache then waked her head, and she held her head in pain. But does she manage to overcome this new, evil, yet cat like self?   </span></div></div>",

During that incident, she remembered teaming with the Muay Thai champion Sagat and the American Ken Masters to save her sensei Ryu from the hands of the sinister M. Bison.  No, nothing unusual there, except for the disappointment at Ryu retreating into training to overcome something he called the \"Satsu no Hado\". She never even got that match he promised her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she flew home with her other \"sensei\" Dan Hibiki.  So what if the guy didn't know a thing about martial arts?  He took Sakura all over the world, or at least he did until last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If my student is going to be here, then I'll just set up a Saiyuki-dojo in town here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really not necessary, Hibiki-sensei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is!

In addition, he was hoping it would be a place for him to sell Saiyuki energy cola.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahoo!  I knew Master Gouken said I would never amount to anything, but this'll show the guy!  Now, where is that pupil of mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, an ominous rumble shook the street, and sent him, along with the ladder, falling to the ground.

And a bit further up was her skirt, giving him a direct view of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SENSEI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, he noticed the face that the enormous body belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well if it isn't my star pupil, hehehe.

Too long, in fact, and I've come to the sudden conclusion that I should retire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry's jaw yet again hit the floor. \"Excuse me? WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, him.\" Reaching down the front of his robe, Uranus pulled out a golden medallion in the shape of a brain with a W engraved on it. He tossed it to Terry. \"Congratulations, you are now the new Wise Man. May your reign be full of auspicious blah blah blah and now I'm outta here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a poof, Uranus transferred himself instantaneously to a remote island in the Caribbean, leaving poor Terry dumbstruck and his brother at the mercy of a horny naked woman. It looked like it was up to Terry to save his brother from a terrible, albeit amusingly kinky, fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mai had managed to pin Andy to the floor with one finger, making escape impossible. She gently slid her thumb underneath him and lifted him to face level. Andy squirmed helplessly against the unstoppable drive of a neglected girl and her powerful new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's eyes flashed with desire as she moved her blonde boytoy into better view. She batted her enormous eyelashes playfully. \"What's the matter, Andy? I thought you were the wild type? Well you're in luck, because it's about to get real wild for you in a way you never thought possible. Try not to disappoint me!\" And she gave him a kiss that enveloped his entire head in warm, soft walls of moist flesh. Hot breath washed over him and he felt her tongue move underneath him; it felt like he was being pressed into a wet bed that sagged just a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this was just Mai's idea of foreplay. Andy had a sickening feeling he knew exactly what was about to come next. But what he didn't know was that his brother had come out of his stupor long enough to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the ruined restaurant, Terry spotted a broken table (well, one of many broken tables, actually). This table in particular had been virtually splintered when Mai had lunged at her date in a passionate frenzy. The biggest piece left was just large and sharp enough to possibly do some damage. Terry grabbed it and, with a roar of determination, charged at Mai's smooth and vulnerable rear end, which made a humongous and reachable target as she was currently kneeling over her human tampon.</span></div></div>",

Alas, people would rather buy their drinks from vending machines than a guy in a pink gi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all hope seemed lost, he noticed a small crowd.  Like a moth to the flame, he approached, and noticed who was attracting the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Isn't she that idol from the TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" replied a nearby passerby.  \"Athena Asamiya!  She's signing autographs before her concert tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't lying.  Athena, in a bright red dress which seemed to illuminate light, was signing autographs and accepting gifts from the crowd of fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that Dan got his idea.  If he gave Athena Saikyo cola, and she liked it, he'd have a celebrity endorsement, and be able to disprove Sakura's claims that it turned people into giants!  After all, who are people going to believe, a schoolgirl or a pop idol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving his way through the crowd, Dan quickly made his way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Asamiya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards Dan, the pop idol replied \"Yes?\"  It was then that Dan held out the cola can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you were thirsty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am.  Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan couldn't believe his luck as Athena drank down the cola.

It looks like...she's growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dan turned around, he realized the people weren't lying.  Athena, much to her own shock and the shock of the people around her, was getting bigger and bigger.  Stunned, he could only watch as she continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somewhere in the back of his mind, he planned to apologize to Sakura.  If he survived this.</span></div></div>",

After going through repeating rooms and solving 8 puzzles in a tall tower, they made it to a very lengthy hallway, separated by a few doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't like this Mario, something must be coming up soon\" Goombella said. Mario and his partners walked down the hallway., battling enemies and opening doors. They opened yet another door, and were greeted by a dark and very spacious room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" Goombella asked. Suddenly, a gigantic figure emerged out of the shadows. It was a dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, mortals,\" the dragon roared. \"My name is Gloomtail. I haven't had any fresh meat in a thousand years. I wonder how you taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! What are we going to do Mario?\" Koops said. \"We are not in a good shape to fight Gloomtail after battling the enemies in the hallway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic! I think I may have a solution.\" Goombella pulled out a bottle with a drink inside. It looked like a power punch, but this drink was a weird green color. In addition to the power increase it would give, Goombella also wanted to drink it because she loved being huge, since as a Goomba, she was always short. In fact, it even turned her on when she saw how short Mario and the others were compared to her and when she could completely destroy smaller enemies with her headbonk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm I don't think you should drink that, Goombella.\" Koops said. \"It doesn't look right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I bought this at Glitzville. It can't be any different.\" Goombella then proceeded to gulp the contents of the drink. She expected to instantly grow like she has in the past, but instead, she started growing slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" Goombella was confused why the power punch wasn't working like it usually did. She looked at Mario for help, but the feeling of slowly growing larger than Mario was something she never experienced before, and it made her even more horny. She could feel her pussy becoming wet, and she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I think you're growing bigger than you're supposed to...\" Goombella woke from her thoughts when she heard Koops say this. She realized that she was taller than she should have been, and she was still growing!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She guessed she was 5 times taller than Mario, and she could probably completely cover Mario with her foot if she wanted to... Plus, she was still growing! Thinking about her size quickly changed her feelings of being confused and scared to being excited and aroused. She desperately needed some sort of relief, so she took her tattle book, (which for some reason grew with her) and put a corner of the book into her vagina and started rubbing it around. Mario and his partners backed away, scared of both her size and the possibility that she could step on one of them while she was pleasuring herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gloomtail intitally was amused to see what the mortals could do against him and waited to see what would happen when Goombella drank the punch. When Goombella started to grow, Gloomtail was surprised not only by her increasing size, but also her beauty. He couldn't see Goombella that clearly when she was her original size, but now that she was approaching his size, he could see how cute she was. And when she started to pleasure herself right in front of him, he was taken by surprise and felt his huge cock become erect. He had never seen a female for a thousand years, so he quickly forgot about Mario and focused solely on Goombella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella soon grew taller than half the height of Gloomtail, but she didn't notice it since she was so engrossed in pleasuring herself. She had never felt this amazing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Goomba.\" Gloomtail said. Goombella was brought back to reality when she heard the dragon talk. She had completely forgotten about him! Were Mario and the others alright? She looked down and saw Mario and the others against the wall, in complete shock. At least they were fine, Goombella thought. She then turned towards the dragon and was met with the sight of a huge, throbbing cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" Goombella screamed. \"Are you turned on by me, Gloomtail?\" She was supposed to be defeating the dragon, not giving him something sexy to watch. She looked up at the dragon's eyes and saw lust in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goomba. I never thought I would be aroused by a Goomba, but I will admit that you did turn me on just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww, that's gross!\" I never meant to do that! Get away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, goomba. I'll make a deal with you. I haven't had sex for a thousand years, so I am desperate for some relief. Seeing as that drink made you giant, you are the only one that can give me that relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not having sex with a dragon\" But Goombella knew deep inside that Gloomtail would give her the pleasure she wanted, since she felt her growth stop as she grew to a similar size as Gloomtail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I didn't tell you the whole deal,\" Gloomtail said. \"If you give me the pleasure I want, I'll let your little friends here live. If you don't then I'll kill you and then eat you all up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella replied by saying...</span></div></div>",

And who would say no to that huge cock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I knew you couldn't resist!\" Gloomtail said. Goombella and Gloomtail looked at each other lustfully before going in for a long, sexy kiss. Goombella couldn't believe that she was about to have sex with a dragon, and just the fact that she was large enough to do so made her crazy. They broke away from each other, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Goombella said. \"Now let's get down to business...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella lay down on her back, shaking the floors and the walls and exposing her cavernous, wet pussy to Gloomtail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon big boy!\" Goombella said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloomtail got on top of Goombella and thrust his cock into her vagina. Each thrust sent tremors throughout the whole palace, and the moans coming from Goombella and the roars coming from Gloomtail could be heard by anyone in the palace. Even those in Rogueport felt some tremors coming from below. Mario and the others escaped just in time, as the floor of the room started cracking and the pillars started crumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty good at -UHH- analyzing people, and I can tell -UHH- that you're amazing at giving a -UHH- girl what she wants!\" Goombella said in between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have been waiting so long for this that I didn't want too mess it up.\" Gloomtail replied. He started thrusting faster and deeper as the pleasure kept on building. Parts of the ceiling were falling on top of them, but they were too large and too focused to even care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're just having sex, yet we're destroying this palace. This feeling of sheer power is so incredible!</i> Goombella thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take it any longer!\" Goombella screamed as both she and Gloomtail climaxed. Goombella moaned and Gloomtail roared extremely loudly, making sounds that could be heard in Rogueport!  Gloomtail shot out hundreds of gallons of cum into Goombella, and Goombella's juices created a small flood in the room. At the same time, the floor crumbled apart, and Goombella and Gloomtail fell through that floor and a few others. Along the way, Goombella's hair and butt crushed dozens of enemies, but she didn't notice since they were both still basking in their pleasure. They finally stopped in a huge throne room, and unbeknownst to Goombella, she crushed both Bowser and Grodus with her hair. Luckily, they were both large enough that the fall didn't hurt them. They both lay down on their backs and rested for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their rest...</span></div></div>",

Never thought sex with a dragon would be so good.\u201d Goombella said as they were both lying on the ground resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will admit that you were better than any other dragon I've been with.\u201d Gloomtail replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't believe you killed him!\u201d A small voice cried out. Goombella and Gloomtail got up to see dozens of Bowser's minions on the other side of the room. There were goombas, koopa troopas, hammer bros, and many other minions. Some were sad and some were angry, although Goombella didn't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe just came from nowhere and crushed Lord Bowser\u2026\u201d One of the mourning minions said. Goombella looked down at the ground below her and saw what looked to be the remains of both Bowser and Grodus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, didn't mean to do that.\u201d Goombella said mischievously. \u201cI can't believe that I killed both of them by accident! I'm so powerful that it makes me so horny.\u201d Goombella thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell are we just going to let her get away with it?\u201d A ragged voice cried out. Goombella saw that it was Kamek. \u201cLet's make both of them pay for killing lord Bowser!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's minions gained a determined look on their faces and started yelling \u201cRevenge!\u201d, \u201cThey must pay!\u201d, and other similar phrases. Then they started their attack by charging, throwing hammers and fireballs, and casting magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a rush of power and excitement after crushing Bowser and Grodus, Goombella thought, \u201cDo they really think they can hurt me? I'm probably 100x bigger than them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay back Gloomtail.\u201d Goombella said. \u201cLeave these puny minions to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk fine, I never wanted to be in this quarrel anyways.\u201d Gloomtail replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella, feeling both horny and excited, stepped forward, shaking the ground and the minions, causing a few of them to waver. Her massive pussy dripped, creating puddles on the ground. \u201cLet me see what you guys got.\u201d Goombella said while smiling. The first minions to come were koopas, who shot themselves forward in their shells and were advancing quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that an attack?\u201d Goombella raised her gigantic foot up, waited for the koopas to come, and then slammed her foot down on them. Everyone heard the cracking sound of the koopas shells; when Goombella did, she just became even more horny, but when the the minions did, they stopped in their tracks in shock. Goombella lifted her feet up and revealed the mangled bodies of the koopas. \u201cWho's next?\u201d Goombella said excitedly. \u201cI've always wondered what goombas taste like\u2026\u201d She said, looking mischievously at the goombas. The goombas quickly turned around and started to run away, but Goombella quickly caught up with them and planted her foot down in front of the goombas, accidentally crushing a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, that felt so good! No wonder we goombas get jumped on so much.\u201d The goombas were terrified and started panicking and running around everywhere. \u201cSnack time!\u201d Goombella said as she lowered her tongue to the ground to pick up the goombas. She stuck around 10 to her tongue and brought them back into her mouth, loving how they squirmed. Meanwhile, Gloomtail, who was watching Goombella, was quickly turned on by the sight of Goombella licking up the goombas and loving every second of it. He grew a boner and started to pleasure himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella let the goombas squirm in her mouth for a few seconds savoring the feeling of power she had over them. Then, she bit into one of the goombas, and was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the goomba. She also loved how juicy and soft the goomba felt. After a few seconds of savoring the goomba, she ate all of the others one by one enjoying every moment and becoming more horny every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished eating all of the goombas, Goombella said, \u201cAhhh, goombas are surprisingly tasty! But now I have some other \u2018needs\u2019...\u201d Goombella needed some sexual relief and she wanted it really soon. \u201cWho\u2019s up for the task?\u201d Goombella said as she walked toward the remaining minions, pushing the minions against the wall. The minions, as a last ditch attempt, started to attack with hammers and fireballs, but Goombella just shrugged the attacks off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, that\u2019s cute, but your efforts are only making me hornier. Get in my pussy or else you will suffer the same fate as your fellow friends just did.\u201d Goombella raised her foot above the minions, showing the bloody remains of the koopas and scaring the minions. Goombella\u2019s pussy juices were leaking out of her vagina as she lay down on her back and told the minions: \u201cGet in my pussy and do your worst!\u201d The minions reluctantly jumped into her pussy, causing Goombella to moan in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels sooo good!\u201d The minions then started moving around and throwing hammers and fireballs, making Goombella squeal in pleasure. She loved how their attacks, which would normally cause her harm, now were giving her pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep on going!\u201d Goombella screamed out. Meanwhile, Gloomtail was watching Goombella\u2019s pleasure session and was getting increasingly horny himself. He saw Goombella\u2019s inviting pussy, and feeling like his claws were not enough to pleasure him, he went over to Goombella, his penis dripping with pre-cum. Without any warning, he stuck his penis deep into Goombella\u2019s pussy, crushing all of the minions in there. Goombella was initially surprised by Gloomtail\u2019s rude intrusion, but after a few thrusts by Gloomtail, Goombella felt how much better Gloomtail felt with the remains of the minions acting as lube. They went at it for a few minutes shaking the room and moaning loudly as they did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Goombella felt like she was about to orgasm, she said \u201cStop Gloomtail! How about you see how my pussy tastes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloomtail replied with \u201cOf course I will. I haven't eaten fresh food in forever!\u201d He took out his dick, which was dripping with pussy juices and the remains of the minions, and knelt down. He then stuck his tongue into Goombella and moved it around, trying to get all of the remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe combination of those minions and your juices is amazing!\u201d Gloomtail said before sticking his tongue in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour tongue is amazing too!\u201d Goombella said. \u201cSo amazing, that I'm about to cum!!\u201d She screamed out as she orgasmed, spraying Gloomtail with her cum, which Gloomtail happily lapped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me return the favor by cleaning your dick.\u201d Goombella said. Gloomtail stood above Goombella and put his dick into her mouth, and Goombella started licking his dick, savoring the remains of the minions still on his dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels so good!\u201d Gloomtail said. \u201cHow does it taste?\u201d Goombella replied with a muffled sound of glee. After a minute, Gloomtail said, \u201cI'm about to cum!\u201d Gallons and gallons of cum sprayed into Goombella\u2019s mouth. So much, in fact, that she had trouble swallowing it all, and some leaked out. After 30 seconds of cumming, Gloomtail took his dick out and lay against the wall. Both of them were exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kamek, who was hiding the whole time, saw this as a perfect opportunity to strike and get revenge for Bowser\u2019s death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe! These two murderers may be big now, but luckily I know a shrinking spell to bring them down to size.\u201d Kamek readies her spell, but who did she aim at first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sabrina was growing bored in Saffron City. Not many trainers were coming to face her, and the ones that did fell easily to her Psychic Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an average morning, and she was extremely bored on this day. She got up and showered, dressed, etc., and went out for some breakfast. She posted a \"Be Back Soon\" sign on the gym and went down the street to a coffee shop. She pushed the door in and was greeted by some people who were sitting down. She walked over to a seat by the counter and ordered a regular. As she sipped her coffee, she couldn't help but overhear what two women were talking about behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he really cheated on you?\" asked one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" she replied, trying to hold back the tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this... what a scumbag. You know what, Jen? I hope that something bad happens to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Amy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... something bad. Just desserts? I mean, just think about it! He thinks that women are just tools or something, so what if someone could get back at him? Like, say, a female? That'd show him, huh!\" Amy laughed. Sabrina took a sip, interested in their problem. She concentrated on one of them and read their thoughts, finding out where the guy lived and his name. All that she needed to do. Sabrina continued to slowly drink her coffee, while listening to them talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she said, thinking it over. \"You know, I kinda agree with her. He likes to make women feel small and insecure... when I bet he's small on the inside. Probably just a little scarred guy on the inside\". Jen started feeling much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... like a little bug. You could just step on him, right! Come on, Jen, lets go out and have some fun. Forget about that guy!\" And so, the two of them left the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina knew that they weren't going to Zack's house. So she would. Obviously, this guy deserved to be punished. And talk of bugs? It reminded Sabrina that she could shrink people. So... she would go and teach this guy a lesson. She payed her bill and walked out of the shop. No one at the gym. So, she went off to pay Zack a visit. It wasn't far from her current location, just about two blocks away. She quickly got there and saw a guy in the front lawn. She grinned as she approached closer, until she was standing about ten feet away from him. \"Hello, are you Zack?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think I know you. You run the gym, or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged. Speaking of guilty, you're coming with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I don't really intend to go anywhere, miss. What are you talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" her eyes started glowing, \"We're going to have some fun!\" She started chuckling as Zack started to shrink before her eyes, ending at a very small size. She could sense that the experience had knocked him out. She walked over to him, and outstretched her hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach awoke in a bed that was quite large for him. He was maybe half the size of it, probably less. He groaned while he began to get out of the bed. It was then that he noticed that the bed felt weird. Not like a normal bed. He got up and went looking out the window. No one in site. He went down the stairs and had to jump to reach the door handle. All the time, he was wondering just what the  hell was going on. His question was soon answered, because it sounded like an earthquake was coming. He ran out of the house and into the middle of the street. Something still seemed odd to him. He looked behind him just in time to see some large object above him. He gazed for a moment, and he could've sworn that it was the sole of a boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the object went past him and landed behind him with a large thud, and there was another object like it in front of him. Suddenly it came to him. He looked at the pinkish boot and a chill went down his spine. He slowly looked up, the boots going up to the knees. Then the upper leg. He continued up past her chest, looking into Sabrina's eyes. \"Well, well, well\". Sabrina repositioned herself so that he was just in front of her feet. \"Do you now understand just what you're in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach understood. He was in Sabrina's little play town, standing in front of her gigantic form, and no way to stop her. He couldn't think of what to say to her, so he just looked at her with fear creeping into his stare. \"Yes, you should be afraid, little one. I know all about what you did. What you've done.\" She began to pace around, making it very uneasy for Zach. \"You see, I don't take well to people like you. It's like your girlfriend... or shall I say, ex-girlfriend, said. You're just a little bug, literally.\" She casually stepped on plastic person. The entire thing disappeared under her with a snapping sound. \"So you see,\" she began to grind on the figure, \"I'm in control\". She stepped off the figure, and Zach could clearly see that the plastic person was crushed flat. \"Sure, you can't exactly be arrested for what you've done, but I've got my own way of taking care of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" he yelled up at her. \"Someone will find me, and save me from the likes of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina laughed at him. \"Really? I take that as a threat. Maybe I should just crush you before you can do anything, huh?\" She lifted her foot over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no! Wait, I didn't mean it!\" He tried to back away, but her foot was too low by now. He was forced down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick the sole of my boot. Now.\" She lowered her foot enough so that he had a small amount of room to crawl. Zach licked and licked, hoping that this would spare him from such a humiliating death. These were her normal everyday boots, so there was all sorts of dirt and debris stuck on and in them. He kept this up for what seemed like forever, when he was stopped by her moving her foot back next to the other. \"Very good. You are quite an obedient insect. Now, get on your knees and worship me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Wor-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said NOW!\" stamping her foot. Zach fell to his knees and worshiped her. \"Call me Goddess Sabrina.\". He called her Goddess Sabrina. \"Beg for your life. Say, 'Please don't crush me,' over and over.\" He did as she said. She smirked at his tiny form, begging for his life. After a minute, he started to slow down. Displeased, Sabrina inched her foot closer to him and made twisting motions. Zach caught a glimpse of this, and went faster than before. Sabrina's smirk came back. She made him do this for another minute, before telling him to stop. He did so, and looked up at her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what now, Goddess Sabrina?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, he asks? I'll tell you what, you get your just desserts. She put her hands on her hips. It's something you really deserve, my little ant.\" She slowly raised her foot up into the air. \"You're the first lowlife to have the honor of becoming a little smushed stain on the sole of my boot.\" Her foot was raised all the way to where her knee would be. He fell onto his face. \"Turn over.\" He didn't respond. \"Always gotta be the hard way with you.\" She used her powers to force him on his back. \"Now look up, take a good look at this sole.\" She put her hand on the toe area, and slowly went down the sole. \"A maggot like you doesn't deserve to even see my bare foot. But you're lucky enough to meet your end under my foot anyway. You've been a good little slave, but next time I'm definitely going to have to have more. It's just not as fun having one slave. Goodbye, bug!\" She stomped forward, putting all her weight and strength into her leg. The last thing Zach saw, was indeed, the sole of her boot, which he just had the pleasure of cleaning with his tongue. The force and speed of Sabrina's stomp ended everything that was Zach. She brought her hands down to her sides and looked forward. She gave her foot a few powerful twists, before walking away. Looking behind her, she could see that there was a trail of bloody bootprints that she was leaving. She smiled, and thought \"I think I'll leave all that there.\" She looked one more time at Zach, now nothing more than a small, liquid stain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think three at a time for the next one,\" she thought. She went the rest of the day with no interruptions. She decided to take a vacation and close the gym for a week. Of course, she would be spending most of that time with torturing and crushing people that she felt did wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she easily found people who had done similar things: Hurt people, cheated on multiple people, lied, etc. In total, she found two girls and a guy, all living lives of deceit and bad deeds. She went to each one individually, eventually having all three. She put them into separate houses for the fun of it, and waited for them to wake up. Like last time, she waited until they actually got out of the house. She already decided what she would do: Crush the guy under her foot, crush one girl under her bare butt, and eat the other girl. A door opening in a dollhouse catches her attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was enjoying this scientific venture far more than her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I heading there?\" Lulu asked, just outside the sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the way out. And I've got a way to get you to Tidus and Yunie in my lung!\" Rikku answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu allowed herself to be swallowed by the massive vortex that the sphincter created. After passing through it, Lulu had entered the small intestine. It was a gigantic tunnel. The walls were covered by a vast forrest of villi. Lulu continued along the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work Lu! Now you're in the middle of my intestinal tract.\" Rikku patted her belly. \"Now swim towards the walls, you can enter my bloodstream that way.\"</span></div></div>",

She attempted to stop and steer herself towards the wall of Rikku's small intestine but was caught in a mighty current and swept further along the enormous organ. Rikku spoke to her again. \"Lu, you're going the wrong way! Head to the wall, you're gonna get pulled into my large intestine!\" The Al Bhed was panicking now, watching the helpless Lulu drift deeper into her bowels via the scanner. \"Lu, turn around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu kicked and struggled, but to no avail. \"It's no use Rikku! I'm caught in a current, it's too strong!\" The microscopic black mage continued to float further and further down the massive tunnel of Rikku's gut. \"Lu! You've got to get out of it! You're heading towards my... um... Turn around!\" Lulu continued her struggle. \"I'm heading towards your what? Rikku where am I going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku shuffled nervously and spoke into the headset. \"Oh... poopie! It's too late...\" She watched Lulu get sucked into her large intestine and placed a hand to her lower tummy. \"Whoops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu landed with a thud on a firm fleshy surface after being squeezed rather unceremoniously through a sphincter. The accompanying noise wasn't very lady like either. Lulu stood up and took a look at her surroundings - an impossibly huge tunnel that dwarfed the previous one in size. The air was stale and a rancid odour hung in the air - a mist would occasionally steam up her visor, despite the incredibly dry atmosphere. The noise was incredible too, an almighty roaring sound that seemed to reverberate around the entire organ. Lulu addressed her host. \"Rikku... where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku was tampering away at the scanner, trying to find a solution. \"Rikku?\" \"Um... yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku knew Lulu was losing her patience. \"You're in my... bowels.\" she said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Rikku interjected. \"It doesn't look good... you've got only one way out and it's not gonna be pretty.\" She said, almost authoratively this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku. I'm going to kill you when I get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rikku decided to have some fun whilst she still had power over Lulu. \"Oh boy, I think that spicy desert food is repeating on me... I'm feeling a little gassy and bloated.\" she said, tormenting her miniscule friend. Grinning to herself, she continued. \"You'd better get moving if you don't want to get caught up in it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu sighed and began a brisk walk into her friend's bowel. \"Rikku... I hate you sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku's belly grumbled. \"Oh, it looks like something's disagreeing with me. Must be someone I ate!\" she joked.</span></div></div>",

The air was rank with the remains of the Al-Bhed girl's previous bowel movements, and Rikku's teasing over the com-radio was not helping matters. Eventually, Lulu reached a more roomier area of the intestines with a large muscular ring-like sphincter just some 10 feet ahead of her. And tried as she might with all her strength, she couldn't open it with her suit's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rikku, I can't go any further,\" Lulu said over the radio. \"There's some sort of fleshy ring that I can't get open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku, realizing where her tiny friend was inside her, grinned playfully. \"OOOOH! Looks like you just reached the \"end of the line\", Lu! You're in my rectum, and that's my anus you were trying to open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what?\", Lulu replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My butthole, silly!\" Rikku giggled. \"Tight little bugger, ain't it? God, I don't know why, but that feel soooo good when you were trying to pry it open.\" She then started sneaking her hand down her panties to her pussy in anticipation. \"Can you try that again? Maybe you'll get lucky this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku, please, this is not the time to be masturbating! I'm stuck in your butt and I wanna get out!\" Lulu yelled. She banged hard on the closed anal opening in desperation, but this only served to make Rikku even more horny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, YEAH! Keep doing that, Lulu! My butt feels so good right now!\" Rikku moaned in pleasure, rubbing her clitoris like mad. Back inside, Lulu could hear Rikku's heartbeat get louder and faster and the walls of the rectum around her get warmer due to Rikku's arousal. Finally, Rikku let out a defining cry of pleasure as she reached orgasm, much to Lulu's irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIKKU! Stop playing with yourself and GET ME OUT OR HERE RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rikku asked hazily, still recovering from her orgasmic high. \"Oh, right! I have a idea of how to get you out of me, but it's not gonna be pretty for you, Lu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", Lulu asked, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you wanna get out of my butt, you're gonna have to.....\"</span></div></div>",

It was incredibly foggy... that was Rikku's gas, lingering in the air and waiting to be released from her plump ass. A sudden rumbling shook the entire surrounding area and Lulu almost lost her balance as an ominous noise rang out around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku!

I'm sorry... but I can't hold it any longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu made a threat over the headset, but it was drowned out by an almighty explosion as Rikku let loose an enormous fart.

Rikku was slowly reduced to microscopic size as Lulu picked her up and threw her still shriking body into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku landed on Lulu's enormous wet tongue, still shrinking. The mouth closed and the flashlight in Rikku's helmet turned on, illuminating Rikku's sightline. She finally stopped shrinking upon reaching her microscopic target. She stood atop a single tastebud, that was to her, the size of an endlessly large field. The sound of Lulu's breathing constantly howled through the gigantic cave, almost as though some monster of unimaginable size resided within Lulu's throat. She looked around the unfathomable cavern and began walking. \"Cool...\" she said, her voice slightly muffled by her helmet. \"To the stomach!\"</span></div></div>",

Amy read aloud what Sonic was typing:\"Ernie and bert get brutal, Hmmm... this outa interesting.\" Sonic gets on the touchpad and crawls around and clicks on the link to the video.

He is SOOOOOOO cute!!!!!! Can I....\" Amy nods, and as soon as you know it, the two had their large (to Sonic) hands all over mini sonic, Sonic says \"Uhhhh...\" and Sonic and tails turn and look at each-other, Sonic then moves back and blushes brightly. \"anyways cream, me and sonic want to show you this really funny video on youtube\" amy opens up the laptop and plays and Tails and Cream fall on the floor laughing so hard. \"sonic picked it\" amy says trying very hard not to laugh in the middle of her sentence. \"Sonic might be small but he sure has a sense of humor\" Tails says. The video ends and everyone was still laughing. They wipe the tears from their eyes. Im gonna post a comment, she types ROFL and clicks post. Tails picks sonic up and sets him on the table and goes to the fridge, and grabs a plate of chili-dogs. \"Chilidogs anyone?\" Tails asks. Everybody except sonic gets them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of (the terrible entry of pkmnguy, which was sooooo bad I cannot acknowledge it) went through Sonic's mind as a fear stricken panic.  Sonic can't help but think <i>'surely if I go inside Amy's vagina, I will die!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe notices Amy has on a bracelet that seems to let her hand through the force field.  He tries to escape her grasp, but there isn't anywhere to run.  Amy holds him securely and pulls him out of his high tech prison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to consummate our love, my darling?  I know my nethers are ready for you.  Look, my special love cave is just drooling at the thought of having you inside it!\"<br>\r\nShe had lowered him until he saw the giant wet orifice that already sopping wet like a drooling maw waiting to devour it's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy come on; be reasonable!  You can't put me in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't try to talk me out of it Sonic darling.  I've waited a long time to put you inside me.  Sure I always pictured it'd be at full size, but when I think about it, this will be even <i>better</i> than I always dreamed!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic tried to shout for her to wait so he could talk her out of it, but his protests were cut off as his whole body was squished up against the moist, soft flesh of her entrance and muffled his words completely.  Amy began to rub his body around the outside for a time to get him nice and lubricated and then began to stick him inside head first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo easily had she fed him inside that before he could truly react, Sonic realized only his legs were free yet.  He moved them about as fast as he could as if trying to run in midair, but with more than half his body inside her constricting love tunnel Sonic was quite thoroughly stuck.  What's more, his struggles were already having the opposite effect of what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to moan as all his wiggling and attempted running sent waves of pleasure of her body and her pussy got even more excited.  It contracted around Sonic and pulled him in further until only his big feet were outside of her.  Amy of course remedied this by pressing on them with her finger to push her tiny lover all the way inside nice and deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YES SONIC!  Wiggle in all the juices of our love inside me!  MAKE ME CUM!\"  she was writhing on the floor in ecstacy and her hips were bucking as if she was trying to hump the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sonic, the experience was quite different.  It was pitch black, hot, wet, tight all around him, and wreaked of Amy's pheromones.  Any cries he made or attempts at speech were rewarded with a mouthful of pussy juices.  He could wiggle a bunch, but her vaginal walls held him too tightly for that to do anything.  If he could just turn around by curling into a ball, he might be able to run on the slick walls and get free.  All around his body, the flesh massaged him and felt lick multiple tongues licking his body all over.  What was worse in his mind is that it actually felt REALLY good!  Sonic couldn't help but be aroused at the situation and his member emerged and became fully erect.  This made the whole thing feel even better as his now erect member was being rubbed into the incredibly soft inner flesh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy could feel her lover being drawn deeper inside her and begins rubbing her clit and groping her pink breasts to further enjoy her lover's stimulation.  She continued to moan louder with everything Sonic did inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was becoming drunk with pleasure himself.  He didn't have enough movement to curl up and was now thrusting against her walls involuntarily as his body was being more honest about how this felt than his mind was.  He finally gave in and started licking the walls pressed against his face and the juices with each lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many minutes pass, perhaps tens of minutes even; both hedgehogs finally climax with a loud cry of pleasure from Amy.  Sonic's fluids are completely lost inside the river created by Amy's that rushes past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Is he pushed out of her, stuck, or does something happen in there?)</span></div></div>",

He was pressed tightly against her when she pulled her pants completely up. The smell made it a little hard to breathe for Sonic, but he couldn't help but get aroused by it. Amy sat down and started to read a magazine when Sonic shouted for help. His voice started to sound weird because the thoughts of his situation were gradually turning him on. It was really terrifying. Sonic was scared and aroused at the same time and he couldn't move because he was in a really narrow space between her and the panties. Amy just completely ignored him and readed the magazine, but inside she was laughing at the situation. \"He-he-eelp Amy lett me oouutt!\" Sonic shouted, but his voice was really dumb and his common sense was fading as he was getting horny. Amy put the magazine away and answered finally: \"What's wrong with your voice? It's difficult to figure out what you're saying.\" \"I-I ssaid lett me outtof herre!\" \"You sound pretty funny. What's wrong?\" \"It- itsh the smell...\" Sonic said unintentionally. \"Aww... I should've known my feminine scent was too much for you. Does little Sonic want to make love to me?\" Sonic didn't know what to say in this situation. He couldn't think clearly and he indeed was feeling like that right now. He couldn't figure out anything clever to say. Amy interrupted the silence. \"Don't you think I'm a little too much woman for you? You can't just stick it in. My thing is bigger than you and you're thingy must be smaller than... Well. Almost anything in me.\" Sonic was hetting even hornier from this kind of talking and he knew he couldn't do anything in his size. He paniced and started to struggle and squirm all he could. Amy felt the struggling and thought it was pretty good. \"So you do wanna have it even in this size\", Amy said smiling, since she knew he was struggling, \"Okay! Let's do it!\" Sonic's exitement faded completely as the shocking reality came to him. What had he done...</span></div></div>",

Are you ok?\" Blaze asks swimming towards her friend. \"Besides the fact that we got eaten and we're stuck here, yes I'm fine,\" Sonic says. \"I can't believe she ate us!!

Right now, we need to do is focus our way out of here.\" Blaze smiled a little and nods. Suddenly Amy's stomach growls loudly and her stomach starts wobbling a bit. \"Uh oh. I don't like the sound of that,\" Sonic said. Just then, Amy's stomach acids occured in her stomach and began its digestion process, starting by digesting our tiny heroes. \"Ah!

Amy grabs an handful of cheetos and throws them in her mouth as she starts chewing. Amy swallowed her cheetos as she licks her lips.

About 3 minutes of swimming of their lives, the cheetos stopped falling. \"That was close....\" Blaze said. \"And is that a giant-sized cheeto?\" Sonic added. \"This is bad,\" Blaze said as she and Sonic starts getting more pain from the acids, \"The food is actually making Amy's digestion system speed its digestion. We're done for Sonic......\" Sonic quickly grabbed Blaze's arm and said, \"No we're not.\" Sonic threw Blaze on top of a cheeto and joins her as he got up also. \"Aww man. Now we're covered in cheese,\" Blaze said as she tries to wipe some of it off of her coat. \"At least it's good for a raft,\" Sonic said as he and Blaze watch the remaining cheetos get digested. \"Yeah but you know that this cheeto won't last long right?\" Blaze asks. \"Yeah but at least we have some time to think of a plan....\" Sonic said.</span></div></div>",

She stretched herself out downward dog style, then the opposite. Once all her wake-up routines were done, she remembered the blue hedgehog she had lain in her maw but maybe two hours earlier. Sure enough, she felt her shrunken boyfriend, snoring and snuggling up to her moist and soft tongue. He was more then awake when that squishy pillow of his was exposed to a different air, rather then the fresh yet slightly fishy smelling one he had grown so accustomed to, and flung him out and onto Blaze's sexy and somewhat muscular stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Rise and shine blue boy \" teased Blaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Aw come on Blaze, I was having the most kick ass dream ever! \" Sonic whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Oh?

And we were both running, and eating, and, oh it was just great! \" This caused Blaze to role her eyes, but during this process, something caught her ear. Her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" He he, guess all that talk about eating made me a bit hungry. \"  \" So hungry that.... \" she said eying Sonic. This made Sonic sweat a bit. Then she burst out laughing, but indefinitely interrupted by her stomach. She WAS hungry, but eating her little blue boyfriend was out of the question. Just then, Amy came storming down the beach, cage in one hand, hammer in the other. Then the idea hit her, maybe she could kill two birds with one stone. but it sounded strange, even in her head. but she was so damn hungry! Well writers? Does Blaze decide to try he hand at chomping down on some edgie girl? Or wait to eat, and deal with Amy in a more civilized way?</span></div></div>",

I won't let her take you away.\" Feeling a bit better, Sonic smiles. \"She's getting closer Sonic,\" Blaze said looking down at Sonic one more time before she can focus on Amy, \"Hide.\" \"Uh ok....\" Sonic says looking around. The question is....WHERE can Sonic hide? He could just go into Blaze's bra and hide within her boobs....but it might make Sonic feel \"uneasy\". He could also try going down in Blaze's panties....but if Sonic moves around alot, it might end up tickling Blaze and Amy will eventually find out. Then....there's a way of hiding in Blaze's mouth. However it would be difficult. It could result Blaze unable to talk to Amy if she needs to or even worse, accidentally swallowing Sonic while talking to Amy. Not really great choices to hide, Sonic thinks. \"Hurry Sonic,\" Blaze whispers. Sonic quickly nodded and decided to go into Blaze's bra. As Sonic landed on top of Blaze's boob, he tries to find himself on a comfy spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Blaze,\" Amy said as she walks by to Blaze. \"Er hi Amy, what brings you here?\" Blaze asks trying to move a bit to find her own comfortable spot. \"I have to ask you a few questions,\" Amy said. \"Ok....\" Blaze said a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blaze moved around a bit, her boobs were also moving it bit as well. Suddenly the movement made Sonic fall off of Blaze's boob that he's sitting on and started falling. \"Ahhh!\" Sonic yelled. Quickly, Sonic grabbed onto Blaze's boob nibble before he would have fell even further. \"Whew that's close...\" Sonic said while grabbing the hold of her girlfriend's nibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Blaze said. Blaze felt an itch on her boobs and feels like rubbing it. \"Something wrong Blaze?\" Amy asks. \"Nothing is wrong, I just need to do something real quick,\" Blaze said as she placed her hand on her boobs and starts rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she started rubbing, Sonic suddenly felt the presser of Blaze's hand and he's suddenly got himself into Blaze's nibble. As soon as Blaze finished rubbing her boobs, Sonic looked around and became surprised. Blaze accidentally pushed Sonic into her boobs too far that Sonic's legs are now inside of her boob nibble. \"Ack! I got to break free!\" Sonic said as he tries to get his legs free. Suddenly Blaze's boob nibbles slowly...very slowly start to suck in Sonic closer to Blaze's boob. \"No! It's pulling me in!\" Sonic shouted now worried while continuing to try to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you saw Sonic, Blaze?\" Amy asks. \"I dunno,\" Blaze said shooking her head, \"I haven't even seen him since about a month.\" \"Are you sure? Because Sonic is suppose to be around when you came by for the egg last time,\" Amy added. \"I-I'm sure,\" Blaze lied, \"I just needed the egg and I didn't see Sonic anywhere. I'm sure he's alright Amy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic alright? Nope. What Blaze doesn't know is that her own boobs are sucking her tiny boyfriend deeper into her boobs. \"Blaze....help....me!\" Sonic yelled trying to call Blaze. Sonic's body is now sucked into Blaze's boob. It won't be long now before our blue hero is completely sucked into Blaze's sexy boobs.</span></div></div>",

Sonic nodded. Suddenly Blaze's stomach growls loudly again as she placed one of her hands on her belly. \"Still hungry,\" Blaze said now a bit embarrassed, \"But don't worry. We could go by a restaurant.\" \"Sounds good to me,\" Sonic says smiling. Blaze smiles back and puts the tiny hedgehog on the giant towel as she puts on her traditional princess clothes back on. \"Come on, let's go,\" Sonic said as he hopped onto Blaze's hand. \"Right,\" Blaze said as she puts Sonic on her shoulder and leaves the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, Blaze already ordered herself and Sonic's their dinner. \"So what is it that you like about chilidogs Sonic?\" Blaze asks smiling. \"Well they're SO good Blaze! You should try it out! It's the chili sauce, the barbecued weenie and the melted cheese that makes it delicious!\" Sonic says giving Blaze a thumbs up. \"Hmmmm.....maybe I'll just try one of your chilidogs then...\" Blaze said, \"But I'll be right back ok. Stay here.\" Sonic nodded and Blaze got up of her seat and left. \"I can't wait for the chili--\" Before Sonic can finish, the waiter already came in and brought a plate of 3 chilidogs. \"WOW!! I'm in heaven! And since I'm this small, I can eat as much as I want!\" Sonic says smiling as he starts to climb up to the giant chilidogs. Looking around being satisfied of these wonderful chilidogs, Sonic doesn't even know where to start. Finally, Sonic just decided to just start eating the chilidog that he's standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then comes back while holding her plate of her salad as she sits down. As she sits down, she can no longer see Sonic around. \"Sonic? Where are you?\" Blaze said looking around the table. \"Maybe he had to 'go',\" Blaze suggested. Before Blaze can pick up her fork and start eating her salad, she looks at the chilidogs that Sonic ordered. \"Hmmmm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sonic: \"Well they're SO good Blaze! You should try it out!\" )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....if he says that the chilidog is good...I guess I'll try it out then,\" Blaze says smiling a bit. Blaze then reaches out to the chilidog that's on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic is still eating the giant-sized chilidog, not even realizing that the chilidog that he's standing on is what Blaze actually grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze slowly opens her mouth and takes her first bite of the chilidog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sonic heard a loud thunder as the chilidog shook like an earthquake. \"Whoah!\" Sonic said as he got his balance barely. Looking up, he sees Blaze, chewing her first chilidog in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze slowly swallows the chilidog that she bite on and she licks her lips. \"Mmmmmmm that's actually pretty good!\" Blaze said smiling. She lifts the chilidog again and starts to bite it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Sonic yelled as Blaze chewed another piece of the chilidog. Sonic barely has another room for him to run around the chilidog. Once Blaze eats this piece of chilidog, Sonic is eaten. As soon as Blaze swallowed another piece of the chilidog, she lifts Sonic and the last piece with it to her mouth. \"Ahhh no wonder Sonic loves this stuff,\" Blaze said smiling, \"It's delicious.\" \"Blaze wait!\" Sonic yelled as Blaze opens her giantess mouth, getting ready to eat the remaining chilidog....with Sonic in it!  </span></div></div>",

Enough of that now, let's go to my place now.\" Before Sonic could say another word, Rouge quickly puts Sonic inside her bra, placing him in between her boobs, and flies away from Blaze's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Club Rouge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Rouge arrived at her place, she quickly drops Sonic into a jar and closes the lid to prevent Sonic from escaping. \"Let me out Rouge!\" Sonic yelled as he pounds the glass. \"Relax Sonic,\" Rouge began as she bends down to look at Sonic face to face, \"You're going to waste your energy trying to do that. You're too weak in the condition you're in.\" Sonic stopped pounding the jar and asks, \"What are you going to do to me Rouge?\" Rouge turns around and smirks. \"What I'm going to do is going to be amazing...for me anyways,\" Rouge said looking at Sonic again, \"I'm going to plan to eat you myself. Once you are digested in my stomach, you're energy will be transferred in my lovely body and with that....I'll be able to have your speed. Imagine it Sonic. With my sexy spy skills and YOUR speed, I'll be able to get all the jewelry all over the whole world!\" Sonic then got annoyed. \"Your plan won't work.\" \"It will and I will make it! And you're going to help me achieve it tiny boy,\" Rouge said, \"But first....I'm debating if I should just eat you now....Or I could have some \"fun\" with you.\"</span></div></div>",

I can't wait any longer,\" Rouge said lifting the tiny hedgehog to where her huge eyes are, \"I'll just grant my wish now.\" \"Don't!\" Sonic yelled trying to break free from the giantess' hand. Rouge ignored Sonic and lifts him higher to the sky as she opens her mouth. Sonic could see Rouge's giant mouth, just waiting to have a taste of Sonic as her giant tongue flicks a bit. Finally she drops Sonic as he yells in horror as he continues falling towards to Rouge's mouth. Sonic landed on her giant tongue and as soon as Rouge's tongue felt her prey, she immediately slam her mouth closed to avoid Sonic escaping. Yes, Rouge thinks as she smiles. Then Rouge started licking her tiny hedgehog snack around with her tongue as she started moaning and enjoying the delicious taste of the shrunken hero. \"Mmmmmmmmm.......yummy......\" Rouge said continuing to enjoy the taste of Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mouth of the sexy bat girl, Rouge's slimy tongue swirls around as it continues to taste and wrap around Sonic's tiny body. \"Ack! Cut that out!\" Sonic shouted trying to resist the giant tongue. Her tongue continues tasting Sonic anyways, ignoring Sonic's demands. Sonic can easily hear Rogue moaning in pleasure of his flavor. She must be enjoying tasting Sonic if she hadn't swallowed him yet. Suddenly her tongue lifts into the air and Sonic crashed into the roof of Rouge's mouth. \"Gah!\" Sonic yelled being crushed tightly to the roof of the mouth. The tongue falls to the floor of the mouth and Sonic falls as well as he lands on her tongue again. Sonic quickly jumps off of her tongue and grabs a hold of one of Rouge's tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" Rouge said as she notices not tasting Sonic anymore. Using her tongue, she began moving her tongue around in her mouth to search for Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic quickly notices that her tongue is already searching for him as it starts licking some of her tooth just to try to look for you. Sonic realizes that there wouldn't be escaping the tongue anyways. If he jumps off of his grip of Rouge's tooth, he'll land on her tongue and Rouge will easily taste him to notice him. But if he doesn't, the saliva-covered tongue is going to find our hero anyways eventually. It doesn't matter though as the tongue came and wraps around Sonic's leg and pulls him back onto the tongue again. Suddenly the tongue stopped moving after Sonic got on the tongue. \"She stopped?\" Sonic thinks. Suddenly the giant tongue that Sonic is standing on is starting to curl and push Sonic back, towards to the entrance to Rouge's throat and stomach. \"Oh no!\" Sonic yelled, \"I got to get out of here!\" Sonic tries to find a clear path from Rouge's tongue, but it's so massive that the paths are blocking the exit for Sonic. Finally, the tongue flicks Sonic one last time and then, the pink monster pushes Sonic off and Sonic falls down into Rouge's dark throat. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\" Sonic yelled as he fell into Rouge's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gulps down the tiny hedgehog at last as she smiles. She licks her lips one last time, tasting the remains of Sonic's juicy flavor. \"Ahhhhh delicious!\" Rouge said happily, \"That was SO worth eating him.\" Rouge looks down at her stomach and places her hand on her belly. \"Now all I need to do now is to wait as my stomach absorbs Sonic. Then I'll be able to get all the jewelry I want! Ha hahahahahaha!\" Rouge then lays on the couch and relaxes as she begins rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

As soon as I landed in some sort of \"pool\", I quickly started struggling for air as I quickly use some of my remaining speed to swim back up to the shore of the \"pool\". As I look around at this room, I already realize where I'm at. I'm inside Rouge's stomach, a part of her digestive track. Great. I then notice a strange platform floating around the pool and I then jump out of the pool and land on the platform. As I get dried up a bit, I realize that I'm pretty much trap in her stomach....at least until her digestive system absorbs me. But I won't let that happen! I can't let that happen! Blaze still needs help! But....how....? She's trap in her own closet locked. Without that key, she's trapped there. And Rouge ate the key too.....damn it. And I'm stuck--wait...the key! Rouge ate the key before she ate me! It must be around here somewhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End of Sonic's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looks around to see the whereabouts of the key but there seems to be no sign of the key. \"Where did the key go?\" Sonic asked. Sonic then thought of something and looks on the platform he's standing on. The key! That \"platform\" that Sonic was standing on is actually the key to Blaze's closet. \"Yes! There it is! The key to save Blaze,\" Sonic said smiling a bit. Just before he gets more thrilled in excitment, Sonic hears a loud growl coming from Rouge's stomach as the massive room started shaking a bit. \"I've got a bad feeling about this....\" Sonic said. Suddenly the stomach walls pours more of Rouge's digestive juices into her belly. The stomach acids starts digesting as it starts burning through any food, including the key that Sonic is standing on. \"Oh no! The digestive system has begun!\" Sonic said now worried. Then a drop of a stomach acid fell onto Sonic's shoulder and it started burning through Sonic's skin. \"Ahhhhhh!!\" Sonic yelled in pain. Suddenly Sonic started walking backwards and our blue hero accidentally falls into the pit of Rouge's stomach acids. As Sonic swam up to the surface, his whole body is starting to burn as the stomach acids started digesting Sonic. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!\" Sonic yelled again. Rouge's digestive stomach is really doing its job as Sonic struggles to manage through her acids. As Sonic starts swimming slowly towards where the giant key is at, the stomach juices continues to digest Sonic as it continues burning through Sonic's skin......</span></div></div>",

He looked at the ground he stood on - that wonderful life-saving key - and observed as the acid in Rouge's belly had no effect on it. It was clearly made of tougher stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed and relaxed a bit more. \"Phew. Good news is I'm still alive and the key's not digesting.\" Rouge's tummy growled. \"The bad news is, I'm inside Rouge and surrounded by deadly stomach acid.\" he remarked. \"Ugh... what to do, what to do...\" he muttered, tapping his foot as he thought.</span></div></div>",

Let's test that theory.\" First Rough dropped Sonic into an old hamster cage and put a lock over the door (which was on the ceiling of the cage) to prevent sonic from escaping. Then she proceded to close and cover every single door or potential escape route that someone of Sonic's size could escape from. Then she proceded to take off her boots and placed them next to Sonic's cage It was obvious that she's been wearing them for a LONG time as the smell hit Sonic like a ton of bricks. Finally she opened Sonic's cage reached down and grabbed him and placed him between her toes to hold him in place as she explained the rules. \"Let's review the rules. We're going to race to that wall over there.\" She pointed to a wall in the next room, \"First one there wins. If you win, I'll do something nice to you, If I win you have to do what I wan't.\" Sonic looked up at her and sopke, \"And what if I don't want to do this stupid race?\" Rouge giggled and replied, \"If you refuse OR if you step outside the boundaries of the race path, you better get used to the smell of those boots because that's where you'll be sleeping for the next week.\" Sonic gulped at the thought and agreed to race. \"Good boy.\" Rouge teased as she took her place and released Sonic from her toe's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark. get set, GO!\"</span></div></div>",

He almost jumped in, but decided to finish the game first.  He made it to her belly button and took a break.  Then he continued his climb.  He reached her breasts and was faced with a dilemma.  Between her breasts, over them, or around them.  Sonic decided to go between them.  When he was halfway through, Rouge smashed her breasts together, crushing him with her lovely tits.

Then she lifted her leg high, and STOMPED down on him again. She slammed her foot down on him again and again and again, soon Sonic passed out from the sheer pain of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic woke up, and looked around.

Then, a shadow came over him and he heard a Rouge's voice.<br>\r\n\"Confused, and dazed after his ordeal with the powerful and beautiful Rouge, Sonic notices a shadow overtaking him. What could it be? A cloud? An eclipse?\"<br>\r\nSonic turned around, looked up, and gasped as he saw a large object in tight black pants.<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Rouge declared, with evil happy vengence. \"It's Rouge's sexy sexy butt, about to decend upon his puny worthless body, and smash it into a hedgehog pancake!\"<br>\r\nSonic tried to run, but the butt came down to fast, and squashed him flat. Rouge laughed, and ground her butt into the couch, squashing the poor guy even more.<br>\r\n\"Ha! Pathetic really. You've stopped giant monsters in space, BUTT...\" Rouge shifted all her weight onto her right cheek, where Sonic was. \"of all the things, my cutey of a bootey is more powerful then you could ever hope to be!\"<br>\r\nRouge laughed began to bounce up and down on his body. Sonic felt her large, firm, and warm butt pound him more and more into the couch. Then suddenly when her butt lifted, this time no light came flooding in, and Sonic felt like he was rising with it. Rouge slammed her butt back down onto the couch, twice more, and then stood up. Rouge turned around, and grinned at the large crater her butt had made on the couch. Then she realized his body wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n\"Wha...? How could he have gone any where? I felt him being crushed this whole time, there's no way he could have gotten away that fast!\"<br>\r\nShe bent over to investigate, but rather then loosening sonic's plastered form from her ass, it actally stretched him out as her cheeks spread out. \"Where the hell is he?!\" Rouge exclaimed angrily, placing her hands on her hips. Then she looked over her shoulder and noticed her mirror. Then she saw Sonic's flat body. She stared for a moment then looked down at her butt.<br>\r\n\"AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! AH HA! AH HA! AH HAHAHAHAHA!\" Rouge was absolutely gasping for breath at the sheer hilarity of the situation. Sonic looked like he was hugging her ass.<br>\r\n\"Some one likes my booty- BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\nShe couldn't even stop laughing to taunt him.

Sonic then realizes where he is at. Sonic is actually on Blaze's massive (well to him anyways) boobs. Sonic started to blush a bit, being able to see a girl naked for the first time.....and actually seeing her breasts. Anyways, Sonic got it over with and realizes that this is his perfect chance to try to get Blaze's attention. If he can just climb a bit more, then he's going to make it. But first he needs to get pass through the giant mountains of Blaze's body first. After getting all ready and stuff, Sonic slowly starts climbing deeper into Blaze's boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze snaps her fingers and Gardon, her koala friend, comes in. \"Yes Princess Blaze?\" Gardon asks without looking at Blaze directly since she's naked. \"I'm a little hungry,\" Blaze said, \"Can you give some grapes?\" \"Yes,\" Gardon said as he left Blaze alone. When he left, Blaze looks at her boobs and places her hands on her boobs. \"I wish my breasts were a little bigger,\" Blaze said as she starts moving her boobs around, \"Then no one would tease me about my breast size.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in Blaze's boobs, Sonic is continuing to climb until he realizes that Blaze's body is moving. Her boobs start moving around pretty quick and it suddenly caught onto Sonic. \"Ahhh!\" Sonic yelled as get got on the side of Blaze's boobs and as it moves. Blaze's boobs are making Sonic move around alot as our blue hero keeps slamming his face into each boob. Then the boobs got too close to Sonic and is squishing Sonic. \"Ack.....!\" Sonic yelled weakly as her boobs are crushing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stopped moving her boobs and started to get relaxed again as she enjoys the refreshing tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually Sonic got his arms out of Blaze's boobs and then his legs. He is free. So now back to the mission.</span></div></div>",

That was close.\" Sonic looks around and sees giant green marble-like balls that surround him. \"Where am I anyways?\" Sonic asks himself as he looks around. Suddenly a dark shadow emerges over the area and Sonic looks up. \"What the?!\" Sonic says being surprised. A giant glove hand reaches into the area and snatches the green marbles, along with Sonic. \"Whoah! What's going on?!\" Sonic says as he and some of the grapes are trapped in someone's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lifted some of her precious grapes into the air as she licks her lips. She smiles as she opens her hand, revealing her grapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic realized that it's not dark anymore and has better view. Sonic suddenly looks up and sees a giant Blaze, who is still naked. Before Sonic can do anything, he quickly notices that Blaze's giant hand reaches and grabs 2 of the grapes and throws them into her mouth as she starts chewing. \"Holy cow! Where I'm standing at.....am I on her grapes??!!\" Sonic said now surprised as he watches Blaze eating her grapes as she gets satisfied. With a gulp, Blaze swallows her grapes as her food goes down her throat. \"And something is telling me that I'm part of the menu!\" Sonic says being a bit freaked out as Blaze's hand comes in again. Before Sonic as the chance to jump off, Blaze's giant hand grabs the grape that Sonic is standing on and lifts towards her giant mouth. As Sonic holds on tightly onto the grape, he can see in horror Blaze's mouth, just waiting to get another taste of its food as her tongue moves around as she licks up and down the grape, as well as Sonic. What Blaze doesn't realize though is that she's going to also have Sonic as a snack!</span></div></div>",

As you sit there and try to gather what's going on, you hear a familiar voice...sounds like the voice of a sadistic women, mumbling to herself about \"gifted slaves\" and \"S.I.N\" Sin....it reminds you of street fighter for some reason, but this is the least of your worries. You feel your world begin to shake for a moment, and PEW!! Light beams down on you harshly. You shield your eyes for a moment before they can adjust... and you nearly have a heart attack, falling to the ground, gasping for breath. As the first thing that comes into view is GIANT face! The face of a sexy woman...with tanned skin, and extravagant red hair. She began pulling off her shades, still staring down at you...you then remember once more, that you're naked.

Your world began shaking again, as the giant C. Viper plopped down on the comfy looking sofa across from you, looking quite devious. Alright...they said you'd do anything I'd tell you to, so we'll get this started. I've got a while before I pick up my daughter, but I don't like wasting time. Time...is money after all..\" You barley understood what she was saying, as everything was far too overwhelming for you at the moment. Your heart was still thumping loudly in your chest, you were unable to get a grip on reality...if you could even all it that. As of right now, you were probably about the size of a thumbtack head, if even that. You were naked, cold, and scared... BAM!! You felt yourself get abruptly knocked over by a harsh gust. You looked up to see C. Viper now with a disgusted look on her face. \"I told you to dance, slave. Can't you do anything right??\" Apparently, you were so caught up in your new environment, you missed that one. \"Hmph...fine them, I've had a long day. It's been pretty hard on my feet. If you're not going to move yours, your going to get to know mine.\" You start panicing, looking down through the glass table below you. The drop was way too far, you'd surly die. You couldn't really do anything but sit and wait, and C. Viper began to pull her big, black boots off... You tried to make the best of this, by admiring her massive breasts. Her tight button up shirt revealed a lot of cleavage, and cut off early to show her well toned stomach. Meanwhile..Crimson Viper had taken off her boots, you finally notice once that raunchy odor hits your nose. It feels like the smell could carry through the entire room.

You're flung back a bit, and feel dazed by the sudden blast of fowl air. Her foot stench was now much more potent since her feet  were within close proximity of you. her red painted toes wiggled in excitement as viper coo'ed at the cool, soothing feeling the table provided for her soles. This simply sent more waves of horrid stench your way, causing you to hold your nose. \"Before you start massaging these...I don't want to worry about you vomiting. Get used to my foot sweat by licking it up...\" Viper smirked as she slowly raised her soles, so that her heels rested against the coffee table, with both of her tanned, wrinkly, and sweaty soles facing right towards you. You fall to your knees, feeling dread overtake you..or maybe that was just more of her horrible cheesy foot odor. You looked ahead and saw that her feet had left a damp imprint that vaguely matched the shape of her soles, including lines for her thick, deep wrinkles. In any case, it seemed as if there weren't many options here. But regardless of which one you chose, you needed to choose fast. As not only Viper was getting impatient, her feet didn't seem to be getting any less sweaty, and this was merely wasted time, basking in the toxic stench radiating directly towards you.  </span></div></div>",

Your hands rest in a light light puddle of footsweat, that coats the ground below you. You stair down at it for a moment, feeling hesitant. C.Viper continues to rest her heels right infront of you, slowly wiggling her massive toes in anticipation. The wet squishing sound of her sweaty toes wiggling, along with that still present raunchy cheesy odor causes you to slip, landing face first in the foot sweat. You hurt yourself pretty bad, but your pride is hurt even worse, as the sweat seeps into your mouth, causing your toung to attempt to retreat,  but it's no use. The salty, vile sweat from her feet has gotten into you. Meanwhile, Viper is laughing uncontrollably from above. As you slowly get back to your knees, you see her feet slowly begin to lower over top of you. You panic for a moment as you think her soles are about to swallow you up, but she stops with her feet inches (by your perspective) from touching your body. \"It's too much, just get to massaging. Do it sincerely and I'll give you a break.. \" She giggled a bit more before finally stifling her laughter. You decide it's best to just listen, and maybe escape during your \"break\". You sit up and reach your hands up onto her massive tanned, smelly soles. Your hands sink deep into her soles, all the way up to your shoulders. You winny as you begin moving them around, softly massaging tiny portion of her massive reeking soles.  At this range, you can see into her wrinkles, which seem deep enough to consume you. It's an especially scary thought, considering the intense odor that comes from within them. As you continue to massage, your entire body is soon coated with her foot sweat, from having to practicably press your entire self into her titanic raunchy wrinkly soles just to give a decent massage. Though you soon hear something, and BAM, you're suddenly lifted, and your back ends up plastered to her massive finger. You cry out as you see yourself heading right for her sole. \"It's not enough...so you can just massage my feet this way... useless foot toy\" C.Viper presses her index finger into her sole, with you stuck to the end of it. Your face is forcefully mashed into hhose repulsive wrinkles from earlier. You try to hold down your lunch as her foot sweat completely consumes you, covoring every inch of your body as she slowly slides you up and down her massive sole. It was quite soft, so it was at the very least not painfull, but that smell made up for the lost pain. Your entire body at times would slide all the way into one of those wrinkles from before, overloading your senses with her feet. You could see massive stretches of tanned foot flesh, rubbing against you. It was wet, and squishy, and overall quite disgusting. The smell nearly caused you to black out, as it possessed you, making your body limp, and unable to fight back. The cheesy stench was like a curse, that followed you no matter where you went, slowly taking over your mind. All you could think about was feet, feet, her feet. Before you'd loose contiousness, you'd find your mouth suddenly stuffed with her grimy toejam, as she flossed between her big and second toe with your little body. \"Darn your small, I might loose you in my toejam in the end...you better hope that doesn't happen...\" Eventually, you would find yourself pressed firmly into one of her many wrinkles, and abandoned  by her massive finger...</span></div></div>",

Despite the nylon, her red nail polish still shone through quite visibly. Suddenly, you see her feet quickly coming down twards you! You dodge roll back, making yourself dizzy, and banging your head a bit against the table. Despite the poor maneuvering, you managed to avoid her soles from squashing you flat. She glances down at you and waggles her eyebrows playfully. \"Come on, I just want you to give them a smell. Get to know my scent. You'll thank me for it later\" You look down in horror as the table around where her soles planted down, was entirely fogged up. Her feet were so hot and sweaty, that they were literally steaming. The steam seemed to come strait towards you, assaulting your nose, forcing down a horrible raunchy odor, as if something had keeled over and died. The stench was seemingly a living entity, holding you down to the table, as her feet would rise again, preparing to squish you. In reality, the stench was simply so great, your body was practically paralyzed from getting the brunt of it. Before you knew it, her massive foot had come down on you, and you were pinned completely under the nylons like a wet blanket. A wet, sweaty, disgusting blanket. Her big toe and second toe were positioned on either side of your head, holding you in place. Once again, it was as if her foot stink was alive, and had it's own agenda. You felt yourself against your will, keeping your mouth shut, and inhaling massive wiffs of her stinky toes. It was the absolute worst experience of your life, as her cheesy foot stench continued to force it's way through your nostrils, burning your eyes, causing them to water. It was like a sauna of pure foot sweat and stink floating around in the air. You stair up at her massive toes, which are now wiggling, and playing with your body. Gripping it underneith all the toes. You're slowly squeezed by her toes, still under all the nylon, with air forcefully being pumped out of your body, and new, foot stink rushing in to consume you. If her footstink was truly possessing you, it was far too late for you to escape it now. It had completely taken over your body, and was making you it's bitch as you continued to inhale it over and over. </span></div></div>",

Chun Li knew she couldn't fight, let alone win if this persisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uh, Juri how about we call this a draw.... You know, put It on hold for now?\" She pleaded, her high pitched voice pleasing Juri greatly. Smaller and smaller the woman shrank until she stood at the tiny size of five inches.

Jin looked dumbfounded at the fact that she would ask such a strange question. \"Why would you wan't to know that?\" he replied, starting to get slightly worried. \"Oh, I just wanted to prove something to my friends and all that I'm pretty taller than most of them\" she claimed. \"Well, the way I see it, I'm probably the one that's bigger. Not only that, I weigh more and are way more stronger than you could ever be\". \"Oh, really? Why not stand up and prove it?\". \"Fine!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and manned up at his cousin and...noticed something strange. He was definately taller than the girl, but didn't seem a large as he had previously thought. \"Well...um...I think I've made my point\" worrying even further as he sat back down and attempted his favourite weight. \"Good luck\" the smug cousin said as he laid back. \"What's up with that? I've done this one plenty of times!\" the King of Iron Fist exclaimed. But what he soon realized was...he couldn't do it. After all the years he had been lifting it, he just didn't have it in him anymore. He attempted a few other but the end result would always be the female Kazama giggling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not let me try, eh?\" Asuka said, sniggering. \"Bu-But you'll never do it! You're too we-weak!\" an exhausted Jin cried. Asuka helped him up as Jin got the biggest scare of his life. Jin and Asuka Kazama were exactly the same height. Jin was wide-eyed and started to believe he was dreaming. Asuka got on the machine and, in around five seconds, grew biceps that rivaled those of King. Jin thought he was going to faint but kept his balance and watched as Asuka lifted the enourmous piece of stone with absolute ease. She put the weight down and looked at her cousin backing slowly away. Jin babbled and asked \"What have you done to me? What's going on??\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aawww, look at that, you're so impressed with me aren't you, LITTLE COUSIN\" she said, looking down at her now 3ft cousin.</span></div></div>",

Then she pulled off and put her foot right next to him. \"If you do't kiss it, I'll KO you!\" claimed Anna. Craig was never the one to get bullied but this was total domination.

Hawke asked pointing to herself ''Oh, I did it, just like you asked'' ''I did what!?'' ''We came home and you were wasted, you wanted me to shrink you and do 'things' your exact words were 'make me small babe, i want to be wholey within you, I want to feel your walls contract around my entire being as you come undone from me squirming deep inside you''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hawke gaped and blushed, she hadn't expected Merrill to find out about her fantasy like that ''Are you sure I didn't want you in ME?'' she asked already knowing the answer ''Nope I asked you last night, you said you didn't want more control you wanted no control for a little while'' ''Ok, well how about you unshrink me and we forget all about this incident...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suprisingly Hawke was grabbed roughly by Merrill, her fingers wrapped around her with her thumb pressed firmly on her breasts ''No! I've waited all night for this, all your touches as you shrunk, your little body so close to my face sleephumping our pillow. I had to resist your advances to protect you, but I wanted to badly to just take you! But I couldn't risk you shock sobering or waking up in an unfamilier place and though you know my body wonderfully, my vagina, ass and even my breasts are completely different at your size. You wanted less power my love, I'll take it all. So listen here Hawke, you aren't getting bigger until I say so, and I'm not going to even consider it until I have you inside me and you make me cum from your squirming'' Merrill ordered, smirking when she felt Hawke's juices dripping onto her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke couldn't help herself this was a dream come true, sure when they were still new to Kirkwall she'd imagined shrinking down and being swallowed up by Isabella's impressive cleavage but as she got to know and later love cute little Merril her fantasies had also moved to the beautiful elven mage; crawling inside her vagina, squirming feet first into her tight ass hole and sleeping contently between her unbeleivably soft, large breasts, even imagining Merrill putting her in her mouth and sucking on her from time to time. Plus seeing the usualy meek and inocent girl take charge was a major turn on for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What now?</span></div></div>",

He's always so serious about getting to avenge his father, Jeff Bogard and his brother Terry stayed in his home country, America and trained to fight Geese Howard. You sighed at this in confusion, Andy is easily confused on such situations with Mai.

The experiment was none other than a size ray, oddley shape like a toy gun. He wants to make the device so he and Brittany, the other Koppai, can be able to store as much food a possible once they reach the planet they were task to go to. He was almost ready, and good thing too, as they were nearing the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alph, come over here, you got to see this planet.\" Brittany spoke in the intercom as she lands the ship on the planet. Alph hears this and press a button nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Brittany, just finishing the size ray and will be there in a minute.\" Aplh says as he want to test something with the device first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up, and make sure you put your helmet on.\" Brittany says as she waste no time in running outside to see the world. Alph wanted to hurry as to not keep Brittany waiting. He looks around and sees a rubber duck. He points at the toy and pulls the trigger and watches as the device shrinks the toy. He sets the device down and walks towards where he saw the toy shrunk at. To his amazement, the toy was tiny, almost a grain of sand, to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it works. Can't wait to show this to Brittany.\" Alph says as he grabs the device and and heads out. He first rushes into his room to get his helmet first. However he doesn't know where he exaclty places it. He set the device on his desk and moves stuff around, not realizing he was tossing some stuff at the size ray. One small object he threw landed on the device and started to whin up. \"Here it is.\" Alph says as he found his helmet and puts it on. However, as soon as he turns around to get the size device, a bright flash blinds him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to regain his vision, he looks around and found himself in a unrecognizable place. He didn't see anything that seems familiar to him at first until he spots something that was absolutely massive to him, a cookie that he was eating this morning. \"Oh boy...\" Alph says to himself as he quickly realizes what exactly happened to him. He shrunk, and a lot. He compare himself to the cookie, or more specifcally a crumb of a cookie, and was shock to see that the crumb is the size of ____ to him</span></div></div>",

Maybe I could wait a little while longer.. Or a bit longer than that..\". A smile grew on her face. Hinata was a kind person, though. Neji was one of her worst enemies, and that's why she ended his life. She wouldn't go out looking for people to kill and destroying buildings. She could use her size, strength, and the doubling of her Chakra by hundreds to protect her friends and help people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she was more confident, as well. It was because of her size compared to everyone else's. She was walking towards the village. People stopped and just looked in awe. Some scurried away. Some had gone to the academy with her and knew that she wasn't a malicious person, but stood in awe, wondering how she got like that. Others were frozen in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata crouched and looked at a group of about 5 who were standing, all with their eyes wide in shock. \"U-Um..Hi..\" she said, smiling at the group. Three of the guys in the group just couldn't move or speak. Though, one raised a shaking arm and waved. The other responded \"H..Hello\" they said in an uneasy, but accepting voice. They could see by her gentle smile, her expression, and her tone that she wasn't planning to harm them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who had waved stepped up. \"How..How did you change sizes?\" They had seen her before. They didn't know much about her, except that she was the Hyuuga heiress. \"I.. I was j-just training and suddenly.. I tried out some..some type.. It was a j-jutsu..I didn't r-really mean to do it..\" she said, giggling. She found it funny because she was a bit frightened at first, but now she liked the state she was in, and planned on staying. \"What jutsu?!\" the guy shouted, intrigued. \"I.. d-don't.. I don't really remember it..\" She said. The guy looked disappointed, but still amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't as frightened now, and they approached her. She lowered her hand and let them come on. She brought them up to her shoulder. She didn't know these people at all, but the one thing that was bothering her was how people would treat her when she was like this. Would she be feared? She was a bit shy of these people, less so than if they were equal in size, but she was still a bit shy, but she really wanted to show the villagers that she wasn't there to go on a violent conquest, so she set them on her left shoulder. \"I can see the entire village!\" one of the previously silent ones exclaimed. Hinata giggled shyly and nodded. The two strands of hair that hung down blew gently in the wind, brushing against the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers were watching when she had let this group on, and they were relieved. Some thought that she was going to destroy the village. Seeing her and the villagers hanging out in peace was a nice sight. Most of the watchers were now watching from their homes, with their doors locked, in their basements, looking from the windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village's main areas where most people were now involved a huge crowd in one area, wanting to see her, hoping she meant no harm.. Someone had ran back and told the others what they had seen.  Naruto was still asleep. Shino and Kiba were hanging around the training area, waiting for her. They had no idea that anything was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata decided she would meet her friends at the training ground, where they had been waiting quite impatiently. Well, Kiba at least. He was shocked that Hinata wasn't around. She was usually the first one on the scene. Shino silently nodded as Kiba asked him questions, occasionally leaving a comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice talk with the people she had met, she headed for the training ground. The crowd would have to wait. When she arrived, she saw both Shino and Kiba waiting. They sensed someone and turned around. Kiba leaped back in utter shock, landing on the ground with his mouth hanging open as he looked at her, his eyes wide. Shino himself jumped of surprise and had a confused and shocked expression on his face. For once, he was surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked up at her. They knew better than the villagers that she wasn't going to harm them. Shino regained his poker face and adjusted his glasses. \"..Hinata..H-\" about to ask how she had changed sizes, Shino was interrupted by Kiba shouting at the top of his voice \"WHAT'S GOING ON, HINATA!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained everything. How she had been training, tried a jutsu that made her grow to this size, how she ate Neji, how she met villagers on the way, and how she had seen a crowd growing in the village. She also explained to him that she didn't think it was reversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean.. You will be in this form for the remainder of your life?\" said Shino, concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes..\" Hinata said, looking down. There were downsides, but she knew that her team would trust her. They were comrades and friends who had been teaching each other and going off on missions for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Kiba was still a bit horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ATE Neji?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um..Umm..\" Hinata stuttered. She had to give them details about eating Neji, Kiba really wanted to know about this, and as she told them about it, how she tortured him, showing her dominance by toying with him before she swallowed him, crushing him with her tongue, letting him struggle..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that, Kiba's eyes were wide, and he was standing behind Shino, as if using him as a shield if she decided to do the same to them. Shino saw the hurt look in her eyes. She didn't want them to be afraid of her. She wanted them to understand, even if everyone else in the village didn't, she thought she could count on them to understand. Shino gave Kiba a hard shove and spoke \"I'm sure Kiba means no harm. Shock, is all.\" he said, sounding very much like Hinata. She could see that Shino understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey helped Hinata find concealed area deep in a large forest where the trees were as big as skyscrapers. They helped her make a clearing and searched for areas that had food and water. \"If your current state is truly irreversible, then you will need to live and sleep somewhere. I will visit frequently, as I'm sure Kiba will.\" Shino said in a curt voice. They could all see that Hinata was still hurt about Kiba being afraid of her. Kiba was feeling quite guilty..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shino and Kiba were leaving, they took different paths, she lied on the ground and looked up at the sky. Shino and Kiba were right. If she had gone to the crowd, they would have been afraid of her and new Chuunin who were there might have acted rashly with kunais/jutsus first, questions later. A few of them wouldn't be a problem, but there was the likelihood that many Chuunin and Genin would act this way when faced with her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lying down and relaxed, slowly drifting off to sleep. For some reason, she had forgotten all about Naruto. What just happened in one day felt like it had been going on for three days. She didn't know why. All she knew was that she didn't want to make people fear her, especially not her best friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already fallen asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She giggled at the thought of how that hole was Neji's final destination. She got out a kunai and played with it, until she detected someone coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K..Kiba?\" she said, quietly. Kiba walked out of the mass of trees, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata! What's up?\" Kiba said, grinning as he  walked up and jumped onto her knee, silently asking for permission to go onto her shoulder. She accepted and picked him up, placing him there. He took a big book out of his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata.. I've been thinking about how I treated you last night, and.. I'm really sorry if I made you upset. I didn't mean to. I was just a little shocked. That's all.\" Kiba said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay, Kiba.. I forgive you.\" She said, smiling. She was glad.. she could see that Kiba was being sincere about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make it up to you, I made something for you..\" He opened up the book and flipped through the pages.

Then he jumped onto her shoulder. \"Alright, but let's get some sleep,\" said Tsunade. Naruto hopped off her shoulder and landed in the tree. He fell asleep instantly. Tsunade smiled.

They were surrounding Naruto. With a jolt, Naruto knew where he was. He looked up. Sure enough, there was Tsunade's giant head, sleeping. Naruto was between Tsunade's ginormous boobs! </span></div></div>",

I'm getting sick,\" he said. Tsunade was concerned, but said \"Look, we're here.\" \"Here\" meant a little lake and a bunch of trees with fruits in them. \"I found this little spot in my travels. Like it?\" asked Tsunade. \"It's cool!\" answered Naruto. \"Let's go for a swim!\" Tsunade thought that was a good idea. She started running toward the lake. \"Wait, let me get out of here first!\" screamed Naruto. Too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade jumped into the water, with Naruto still between her boobs. There was a giant splash and a tidal wave. Tsunade surfaced. The lake was shallow enough for her boobs to float at the top. \"ARE YOU F@#$ING NUTS?!\" screamed Naruto. Tsunade smiled playfully. She pulled Naruto from her cleavage and reinserted headfirst. His legs were kicking in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had her fun. She pulled Naruto out and held him in front of her eyes. \"Well Naruto, I have to stay here. I have no life in Konoha anymore, but you do.

Go back to the village and live out his life, or stay with a giant hottie at a wonderful oasis?</span></div></div>",

Ussop, Zoro, and Chopper could only look on confused by Sanji's exclamation, not to mention the mere thought of crediting Luffy with anything resembling intelligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see?\" Sanji continued, pointing out towards the see.  \"There's an island not too far from here.  She can eat whatever she wants over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what if it's got cities Love cook?\" Zoro asked cynically.  \"You don't think the Marines are going to notice the 1000 foot tall girl destroying the entire island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's them or us,\" Sanji answered, looking down at his own feet for mere seconds before turning to the deck.  \"NAMI-SWAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Sanji?\" Nami's booming voice asked.  \"Did you find something for me to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, we know there's an island not too far from here.  It should have all the food you need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what if she doesn't want to wait?\" Zoro asked.  Luffy nodded, unsure of how his navigator would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she sighed heavily, Nami began walking forward, seeing the island nearby out of the corner of her eye.  \"You sure there's food there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive!  Right guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the need to be cued, the others all began nodding in agreement.  Nami offered them a smile before continuing to push forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land ho captain!\"  Ussop shouted mere minutes later.</span></div></div>",

She stopped, where the boat came before to her bosom, it now came to just below her waist. Nami sighed and set the fish down beside the boat.

For the third time in three months, he had challenged Yugi Moto to a game of Duel Monsters in an attempt to reclaim his title as the best duelist in the world.  The only problem was that Yugi was simply a better player than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kaiba began to scheme.  Using a combination of technical ingenuity and some technology \"borrowed\" from his other archrival Pegasus, Kaiba rigged the dueling arena so that with the press of a button, a monster under Yugi's control would go haywire and attack him.  Kaiba would then grin and chalk it up to some new card, claiming victory.  Kaiba didn't fully understand the technology that Pegasus had, but he assumed that it was mostly harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he was losing to Yugi 1700-800 in the last moments of the duel, Kaiba readied his trap.  Facing both Yugi and his two monsters, the Mystic Elf and Dark Magician Girl, he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time Yugi, you're not going to defeat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not Kaiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple!  My new card, Brain Scramble!\"  Grinning to himself, Kaiba pressed a button he had hidden on his side of the dueling arena.  However, instead of the predicted action of Yugi's Dark Magician Girl attacking the Mystic Elf, the dueling arena gave off an odd buzzing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all the other monsters besides the Dark Magician Girl dissapeared as visible bolts of static erupted from the gaming grid.  Everyone, including Kaiba was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice card,\" commented Jou (Joey in the English dub) in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaiba!  What sort of weapon have you used?\" asked Yugi.  Kaiba could only shake his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A damn good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen three things happened.  The first was that the figure of the Dark Magician Girl began to expand, becoming larger and larger.  As this was happening, her skin, made of holograms and fancy optical illusions, took a distinct form that was indisinguisable from real human skin.  The fact that her incredibily large boots crushed the dueling table was proof that somehow, she had become real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was that Kaiba swore never to use anything he didn't understand again. Somewhere he could just see Pegasus laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the static bolts ceased, the smoke faded, and the form of a 200 foot tall flesh-and-blood Dark Magician Girl filled the room, with Yugi looking on in shock.  Grinning, the giantess turned to her former owner and looked down upon him.</span></div></div>",

Despite the oddity of the what just happened, it did seem that the giantess Dark Magician Girl would attack Yugi, technically resulting in a victory for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi on the other hand, felt nothing besides shock.  The Dark Magician Girl was one of his favorite cards, and here she, not it, was, towering above him with a playful smirk on her face, looking exactly like the hologram did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's friends all looked on at the giantess with a sense of dread.  Where did she come from and what would she do to Yugi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions were all quickly answered as the Dark Magician Girl reached down and picked up Yugi from the ground.  The crowd gasped, while Seto Kaiba simply grinned.  But nothing could have prepared them for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, the Dark Magician Girl hugged Yugi right to her ample bosom as if he was a plush toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi-kun!\" exclaimed the Dark Magician Girl as she continued to hug Yugi.  \"You look so cute tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough his words were muffled by the Dark Magician Girl's enormous breasts at first, the now normal Yugi was eventually able to say \"You know my name?\"  This caused the Dark Magician Girl to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know your name silly!  All those times we fought in duels together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  But now I'm real!\"  With another slight squeal, she hugged Yugi again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are you so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?  Whatever made me real must have made me a lot bigger too.  It's OK though,\" she added with a grin. \"I like being this size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill giggling, she put the diminutive form of Yugi on the floor as she turned to face Kaiba.  The champion duelist couldn't help but gulp in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a mean trick you were trying to pull, trying to use a circuit board to force me to attack Yugi!\"  Her smile gone, the Dark Magician Girl stepped towards Kaiba, her enormous boot landing in front of him.  The normally stoic Kaiba was shaking with fear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at the enormous blue boot in front of him, Kaiba began pondering his options.  He was losing a duel in front of a small crowd of onlookers, at his own facility, in front of a massive blond haired woman who thought his archrival Yugi was the cutest thing she'd ever seen.  And somehow, it was his doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could run.  But Kaiba knew that if he did that, he would never hear the end of the taunts of running away from a girl, no matter her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could apolo...wait, apologize?!  Yugi was there!  Like hell he was going to confess cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo only one option remained.  Lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know this looks awkward, but I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't what?\" asked the Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't cheat in the game.  What happened was that I used a brand new card and it maulfuncitioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brain scramble!\" quickly replied Kaiba.  \"It was supposed to make you, well, the game you attack Yugi.  They're must have been some faulty wiring or something!  That's the only reason I can think of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Magician Girl nodded and paused for a brief second, fumbling around with the magician's staff that somehow suddenly appeared in her hands.  After about half a minute, she faced Kaiba, the staff dissapearing from her hands.</span></div></div>",

I can tell if someone was cheating, and you, Seto Kaiba, are a little cheater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Kaiba began walking away.  \"Hah!  You have no proof!  Now I believe it's safe to say I won the match, so I'll be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Magician Girl didn't respond, but instead pointed her finger at Kaiba.  Instantly, he was binded by several ropes which formed around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, how did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magician Girl, remember?  As in, I can do magic.  Not to mention being bigger has made me a lot more powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have 2000 attack at normal size, at over 40 times my normal size, I'm 40 times more powerful.  I suppose I should thank you, cheater...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT A CHEATER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearby crowd could only watch as the giantess Dark Magician Girl used two fingers to pick up Kaiba by the ropes that bound him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a cheater!  You got tired of losing, so you cheated to hurt my Yugi-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you gonna do about it, Dark Magician Girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer playful grin returning to her face, the Dark Magician Girl hung Kaiba on a girder near the roof of his monstrous dome, a roof that was even higher up than the giantess was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to stay there and think about what you've done,\" she replied, sticking her tounge out at Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Kaiba's ranting and screaming, along with the crowd's gasping, the Dark Magician Girl turned down to Yugi, bending over him with one knee on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi was speechless at the entire spectacle.  When the giantess picked him up again, he still had nothing to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feelings were a completely different matter.  This seemed too good to be true.  The size difference didn't really matter since well, Yugi was used to looking up at people.  But giant Duel Monster girls don't just turn real, do they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  You're all mine!\"  Pausing to hug Yugi once more, she then pointed her hand near a wall.  Promptly the wall disintegrated, leaving an opening big enough for her to easily walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see the city!  Meet your friends!  Explore this new world!  Oh, and Yugi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mana.  Dark Magician Girl sounds so impersonal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slightly lovestruck look in his eyes, Yugi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Mana.\"</span></div></div>",

Oh, we're going to have so much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to comprehend exactly what was happening as Mana walked into the city, Yugi suddenly heard a voice in her head, easily recognizable as his Yami (Shadow) self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Mana, it's been so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSort of.  She was a magician's apprentice when I was Pharoah.  But she was dark skinned with black hair, not the blond.  Also, I think her breasts were smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly because I'm in the middle of them!  So, uh, what kind of a person was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a good friend, and a good student to her master, although as you can see, a bit on the ditzy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it is really your Mana...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seem to be extremely similar.  Still, you don't have anything to fear from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that wasn't the emotion I was getting from you either...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's conversation was quickly stopped as Mana gently nudged him, pointing to all the helicopters that were flying around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi!  You see those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The news choppers?  That means we're probably on TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TV?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have TV where you're from, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know OF TV from some of the mechanical monsters , but I've never seen one up close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the entire city knows about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  Happily, Mana began waving to the choppers as they circled overhead.  Sighing, Yugi waved as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;b&gt;News flash!  Attack of the 200 foot cosplayer!&lt;/b&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTV's all over the city began showing the urgent news bulletin.  A 200 foot tall girl dressed exactly like the Dark Magician Girl was walking through the city, waving at helicopters with a tiny spiky headed passenger squarely between her large breasts.  And back at Kaiba's dueling arena, the few remaining people there, Anzu (Tea) Jou, and Honda (Tristen) were watching the broadcast on a nearby TV in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she wasn't an illusion?\" asked Honda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not,\" replied Jou.  \"Damn Yugi's got all the luck.  I want a giant big-breasted blonde to suddenly appear and become my OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJou was promply hit over the head by Anzu, who's look was a combination of worry and anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you think of anything besides sex you pervert!  Yugi's in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems too ditzy to be dangerous,\" replied Honda.  \"Girl just wants to have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She vaporized the wall of the arena!

You know, make sure Yugi's OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the three ran outside, completely forgetting that Seto Kaiba was still trapped on the roof of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who's viewpoint do we take?</span></div></div>",

Nodding, Anzu and he continued to follow the footprints, leaving a dazed Jououchi to get up alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the city, Mana was busy taking in the sights, sounds, and signs of panic and confusion on the street.  Out of nowhere, a double-decker bus caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi-kun, that one looks different from the other vehicles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his vantage point in the middle of Mana's breasts, Yugi easily recognized the bus as belonging to a company that gave daily tours of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tour bus?  That's the bus that tourists take to learn about the city.  Usually it has a tour guide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he'd mind showing me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think you'd fit on the bus,\" hastily replied Yugi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK!  I'll carry them!\"  Wasting no time, Mana ran towards the double decker bus and scooped it up in one hand, holding it to her head.  The shocked tour guide, microphone still in hand, did his best to calm the audience down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm!  Yes this is the giant Dark Magician Girl that the news was talking about, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Mr. Tour Guide?\" interrupted Mana.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, it appears that the giantess is speaking to me,\" continued the tour guide, not intterupting his narriative.  \"I'm going to try to establish communication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!  Just well, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm new in town, and I was wondering if you'd give me a tour.  I know I'm too big to fit on your bus, but I could carry you guys around while you show everyone around?  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour guide was initially going to scream his lungs out.  But the fact that the gigantic cosplayer had asked for something he was being paid to do anyway, and trying to be nice about it, made him change his mind.  Besides, he realized that a nice giantess was far better for his health than an angry giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that Yugi-kun?\" happily asked Mana.    Yugi smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!  You know, when you live in area for too long, you tend to forget all the famous stuff around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  Let's get going!\"  Happily, Mana began walking around the tourist route, the bus firmly in her hands.  The passengers, more confused than horrified now, were taking photos not only of the local scenery, but also of the giantess Mana, who was giggling as she pointed out famous landmarks to Yugi, who would respond and tell her stories of his own experiences with the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, Mana had finished the designated tour, and had returned the bus to the tour center.  Placing it down by the center, Mana began walking away from the bus and several dozen passengers who were thourghly impressed by the new attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mana, where to now?  You know tour groups only  go over about half the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Mana replied \"Well, I was hoping to get something to eat.  I'm pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\"  That wasn't something Yugi had first thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, the size thing.

Mana, you should be more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fine, you little worrywart.  I won't scare the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi still sighed as Mana finally made it to the resturant.

So he waited, and finally, after a short perioid of time, he found the right angle and pressed the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept nothing happened.  Lifting the hatch, Kaiba began looking outside, only to see he was no longer in a tank, but on top of a bright red stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mana's hand was approaching it, the giantess giggling excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMM, candy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood drained from Kaiba's face as he stumbled off of the stone.

Got any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny normal person would have thrown in the towel and ran for their lives by now.

Well, I'm not from your world, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously,\" agreed Anzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world I come from is parallel to this one, a world of constant strife and battle, where ancient royailty would use our spirits to conduct the Yami or Shadow Games.  I remember the two realms were once connected, but they were sealed away a long time ago.  Until recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel Monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Pegasus repackaged the ancient games for the Pokemon generation, he reawakend the world of strife.  We were given a glimpse into your world, and learned about things, but for the most part, did what we did best.  Fight each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem mindless to me,\" interrupted Jou.  \"You knew about tanks and according to Yugi, TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not all Duel Monsters are mindless.  Occasionaly, a powerful soul finds its way into our realm and bonds with an otherwise souless monster.  Even what that happens, most of the time all Duel Monsters know or want to know is fighting.  They're happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you weren't?\" asked Honda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was at first.  But then I glimpsed into this world, and saw my Yugi-kun.  I don't know why, but I felt attached to him in a way I never felt, or maybe I did in a past life.  It was confusing.  All I knew was that I had to leave this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally this isn't possible.  The mortal relam is draining to the usually souless Duel Monsters, and the one gateway is guarded by two incredibly powerful monsters, the Envoys.  But then, when you were dueling Kaiba, he used something.  It was supposed to make me attack your monsters, but instead it ripped open a hole between the two worlds.  I still don't know how exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, this is all well and good,\" interrupted Anzu, \"but it still doesn't explain why you're so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that!\" replied Mana.  \"Anyway, I was caught in this opening, but for some reason, there was a tremendous amount of energy there as well.  Energy which fed me, and made me grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power in the Duel Monsters realmn is represented by size.  When someone is powered up, they get bigger.  As you can, I'm really, really powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the whole Duel Monsters weaking here thing?\" asked Honda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The soul feeds on this realm the same way the Duel Monsters feed on the negative energy of the other realm.  Instead of getting weaker, I'm getting stronger instead.  That's not bad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how you arrived?\" asked Yugi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part yes.\"  Turning to a nearby bush, she added, \"Although I bet that the city's reporters won't belive that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the bush, a few reporters and photographers emerged, shaking their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, tell the press that I'm a big tourist attraction, here to captialize on the popularity of Duel Monsters.  K?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, they all ran off.  Yugi and his friends looked up as Mana as she turned to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you still mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" began Honda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's expression didn't seem to change throughout the story.  \"Mana, I was never mad at you.  You just need to get used to this world.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others agreed, with Mana smiling on at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm just glad to hear that you all like me!

Any weapon.  There was a chair, several photos, and the katana sword he kept for decoration.  Of course there was the gun, but where he stood, it would be impossible to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have breached the plane between the realm of light and the realmn of darkness.  Worse, you let one of the creatures into your world, where her mortal soul makes her grow more powerful by the minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was near the sword.  If Kaiba went and grabbed it now, he could swing it quickly and fell the intruder in one strike.  So he quickly grabbed the sword, unsheathed it, and struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to see the top edge of the blade break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am talking!  If you will not listen, then I will make you listen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing his sword, the Black Luster Soldier attacked Kaiba, who despite his two years in a fencing class, was no match for him in sheer power.  The first blow shattered the blade completely.  The second would have cleaved Kaiba in two had he not jumped out of the way towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk.  That's where the gun was.  Wasting no time, Kaiba opened the drawer, pulled out the gun, and fired two shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like the sword swing, his opponent wasn't felled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mortal weapons will not work on an Envoy!  Now listen to me or die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove his point, a small flame engulfed the handgun, causing Kaiba to drop it and fall down onto the floor.  Approaching him, the Black Luster Soldier sliced the desk in half, standing over Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen very carefully to what I have to say.  You are going to repeat the experiment you did with the machinery to bring an ally of mine into this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My partner and I are both Envoys.  We are allowed to freely traverse the realms, however, this realmn weakens us slightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not the Dark Magician Girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her soul is feeding her.  It's making her stronger and stronger.  However, it is far from too late to stop her.  If you infuse my partner, the Chaos Emperor Dragon, with the same power you accidentaly gave the Dark Magician Girl, we can defeat her and return her to my world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I cannot return the Dark Magician Girl to our world, then I will make a new one, out of your soul.  Imagine Kaiba.  First your entire existence will be annhilated, along with anyone else in this buidling.  Then, I will take energy from the destruction, and make a new Dark Magician Girl to replace the one here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have 12 hours.  If the experiment isn't ready by then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the original arena was crushed!  I can't do it so soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.  12 hours, or your head.  Either one.\"</span></div></div>",

This thought wasn't lost on Yugi as Mana carried him away, however it didn't come to mind until after he agreed to go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they didn't go off to sleep right away.  Midway through her stroll in the city, Mana came across the sound of loud music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down from Mana's shoulder, Yugi immediately noticed they were downtown, by the club district.  Combined with the fact that it was almost midnight, and it was no surprise that the nightclubs were full of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're by a bunch of nightclubs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightclubs?  Never heard of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are places where people go during the weekend to have parties and enjoy themselves.  I think you're a bit big to fit in those buildings though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMana shrugged her shoulders and bent over, ripping the roof of one of the buildings.  Yugi winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna repair that, right?\" asked Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the party's over, sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the club, meanwhile, could only stare in awe at, what was according to the news, a gigantic tourist attraction.  The women were staring at her sheer size, while the men were staring at more specific things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, whether it was a combination of sheer curiosity, or maybe too much alcohol, the partygoers went out into the street where Mana began to observe them.  Soon enough, more people filled the streets and began dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  This looks like fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing Yugi down in the middle of the crowd, Mana began to observe the dancers, and eventually, attempted to imitate them.  While no one would mistake the giantess for an expert dancer, she did  do rather well seeing as it was her first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, three hours and several hundred cat calls later, the party had ended and Mana walked out of the city with a dazed Yugi in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're rather impuslive, aren't you?\" asked Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not really, it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the shy type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi nodded.  \"And then I see you doing all this stuff, it doesn't really seem normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for me it isn't normal, but you seem so carefree about it.  I can't help but wonder if you see me as a pet, what with the 'Yugi-kun' and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought it sounded cute.  How could I see you as a pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a lot bigger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?  Am I supposed to act some way because I'm bigger than you?  Should I treat you like dirt or be horrified of myself?  I just thought it made me more powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm just overthinking.  It is late after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need sleep then.  I'll take you somewhere where we can relax.\"</span></div></div>",

The area, wherever it was, was isolated, and probably far away from the city.  There didn't seem to be anything around except grass, trees, and a mountain in the distance.  As he continued his walk, he also noticed a large lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lake full of bubbles where Yugi could make out the form of Mana washing herself, completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow granted, Mana was submerged deep enough so that no one could see anything naughty, but the sight of an enormous giantess swinging her bare legs above the water as she washed them was enough to give anyone a nosebleed.  And that included Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of Yugi gasping, Mana turned around to see the champion duelist awake and doing his best to cover the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi-kun!  You're awake!  Finally.  I never saw anyone sleep so deeply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to wake you, so I decided to look for somewhere to freshen up.

One paticular instance came to mind, two weeks ago, when he was at an amusement park during his day off with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was simple enough.  A new roller coaster had opened, and everyone had gone on it.  Everyone except Yugi, who was scared of the sheer scale of the coaster.  He didn't see the big deal in not going on until the end of the day, when he was walking home with Jou and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kicked so much ass!  Yugi, why were you so scared of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Yugi,\" interrupted Honda.  \"Mr. Conservative.  Honestly, you need to take a few risks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risks?  I've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only do stuff when you're forced to.

Only stuff that's fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words echoed through Yugi's mind, his body began to move automatically.  He took off his jacket, and without hesistation jumped into the lake, with Mana looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five seconds later, Yugi began to finally settle down from his trance, and looked straight up, noticing Mana's titanic naked form in front of him as she relaxed.

Her long hair, almost always concealed by the traditional Dark Magician Girl cap, was free from its constraints and hanging to her back.  Her face wore the look of a content as her eyes were closed. Yugi, likewise, tried to relax, but he couldn't help but giggle at the sight in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that, well, if you stood up, I'm pretty sure you'd give a lot of people a real good peep show, especially at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis unexpected comment caused Mana to blush and sink into the lake for a few seconds.  She hadn't accounted for her increased size giving nearby people a better view of her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it occured to her that they were in the middle of nowhere, and Yugi's own motivations for saying such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yugi-kun you jealous little thing!\" she squealed as she hugged Yugi to her exposed bosom.  \"You want me all for yourself don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Yugi's turn to blush, as he frantically attempted to escape Mana's embrace.  When he did, Yugi found himself underwater, viewing the entirety of Mana's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, Mana could only see a small red spot in the water.  Staring at it for a few seconds, she saw Yugi emerge, nose bleeding, and mouth gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like what you saw?\"  Yugi nodded and quickly retreated to a side of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Yugi began to relax in the lake, geniunely enjoying the warm water and the company of Mana, who insisted on washing him clean, which Yugi agreed to.  This of course, led to another topic of confusion, Yugi's hair,  As she began to wash it, Mana noticed the odd combination of black and blonde spikes was standing as firm as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the natural color and shape.  Weird, I know.  What's wrong?  You don't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I really like it.  I've just never seen hair like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've never seen a giant up close before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" she replied as she ran her finger through the spikes, laughing at their shape.  Yugi couldn't help but chuckle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my hair is kinda weird.  But at least I'm not bald...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Yugi was cleaned, and despite his yearning to continue to stay in the river with Mana, he realized he had an appointment that needed to be attended to immediately.</span></div></div>",

Conversely, Anzu no longer felt scared of the Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down, and saw the mall, as well as her friends looking much smaller than before.

Yugi began pointing out all the little things that she did miss, so Mana wouldn't feel clueless.  Lying  back in Mana's ample cleavage, Yugi began to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't nearly as comftorable with Anzu however.  Enjoying her newfound scale and power, she began walking through the entire city, savoring every step and reaction from the crowd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJououchi and Honda were nowhere near as comftorable, however.  In addition to the embarassment of being placed in the now gargantuan breasts of their classmate, Jououchi's skirt was riding up on him, and the snug position he was in made it difficult for him to move his legs around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two girls managed to happen upon Kaibaland, which bought an odd view forward.  Honda was the first to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's in there.  Someone big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should take a look,\" replied Mana.  Nodding, Anzu and Mana walked into the building with their friends in tow.

Yugi was rather snugly caught between both their chests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your friend?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Anzu.  She's from this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" began Anzu.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Playing with my dolly.  Isn't he cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Seto Kaiba in clothes designed for children caused everyone to fall down with laughter.  Even Jououchi laughed, completely ignoring that he had a miniskirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba meanwhile was panicked.  The Black Magician Girl had returned along with a gigantic version of  one of Yugi's friends, and on top of that, it looked like they were all getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you bought dollies too?\" Shizuka asked.

Come on, I wanna play with Yugi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda, Shizuki, and the unwillingly domesticated Chaos Emperor Dragon could only look on as both girls continued to argue over who got to keep the spiky haired duelist for the moment.

Shizuki shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure if they want to hear what anyone wants to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, quit hogging him, OK?\" asked Mana.  \"I'm not asking much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been playing with him all day.  I just want a bit of time.  Or are you worried he likes me more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likes you more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi could only look on.  He was half-tempted to intervine, but he wasn't sure if the girls would even bother to listen.</span></div></div>",

I had a feeling it had something to do with what going on in this city, so I went and checked it out!<br>\r\nThere were hundred of weirdos in black robes gathering around a huge pillar... my brother was at the top of that pillar! Grabbed by some other weirdo with wires sticking out of his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wont ask you again,\" I heard him say to my brother, \"WHERE IS HE?!!\" Mokuba just looked him in the eye and said \"I'll never you my brother is!! And once he finds out what youre doing to me, he's gonna make you pay!\"<br>\r\nThe man just grinned, \"Oh... we got ways of making you talk, little boy!\"<br>\r\n\"...Dont bother,\" I saw a red-haired man speak up, \"It's obvious he wont cooperate. And if he's not good for spilling the beans... he's only good for one thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I saw the punk toss my brother into that bright light! I could hear his scream \"BIG BROOOOOTTTHHHEERRRR!!!\" echo in my head!<br>\r\n\"MOKUBA!!\" I shouted back.. but unfortunately, the weirdos in black spotted me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw that red-head point to my direction and shout, \"THERE! THERE HE IS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran... ran like a coward.. unable to save his only brother..\" Seto lowered his head in shame.

Like my own personal belief, he's just a coward unable to accept his role in life... ESPECIALLY when family's involved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi pats him on the back, \"Well, think about your brother. Would he just want you to roll over and die?\"<br>\r\n\"..Huh..?\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon Kaiba!\" Yugi tells him, \"Dont you even remember Duelist Kingdom?\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but-\"<br>\r\n\"That's the thing! Mokuba's got high faith in you! He knows youre not the type to just run away with your tail between your legs. Youre the type to look danger straight in the eye and kick it's ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto remains silent for a few moments as Yugi continues, \"You know these creeps dont deserve to get their way! Come with me, fellow Champion! Together we'll make 'em pay! So what do you say? Let's do it for your brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, that motivation is JUST Kaiba needs to lift his spirits!

He's arrogant, stubborn, pig-headed, cold-hearted, rude, bitter, absurd, a cheater, stupid, ugly... but no matter what, he is NO coward!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto, trying to retain his cool genre, quickly changes the sad expression on his face into an angry impatient glare! \"...What the hell are we doing standing around with thumbs up our asses?! We got a job to do, dont we?!\"<br>\r\nYugi smiles and nods his head, \"That we do, Seto! That we do...\"<br>\r\n\"...Who said you of all people have earned the right to call me by my birth-name?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh...ANYWAY, the two Champs followed by their monkey-friend march out of that building...</span></div></div>",

I've got to remedy this...but how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question that had been bothering him was, why hadn't Kaiba's machine worked? If he could fix its flaw, then he could enlist an ally to keep these girls under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the Kaibacorp lab, he looked over the settings Kaiba had created to open the rift between the worlds. Everything seemed in order...why hadn't the Dragon been able to emerge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a simple term check for any information on his beastly counterpart. There were several files, but one caught his eye: Banned/Forbidden List.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! The Chaos Emperor Dragon card was deemed too powerful by Industrial Illusions, and was banned from play in major tournaments. That's why it hadn't been summoned with Kaiba's machine: the arena wasn't allowed to let that creature on the field. The whole had been opened, though, and the Mystical Elf was able to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, all I need is to find a monster from this machine's memory files, and bring it to this world to aid me.

Mai realized this a minute later.  She was now 15 feet tall, her clothes grew with her. <br>\r\n        Mai got a wicked grin on her face.  She didn't knew how, but she was now a Goddess.  And she wasn't alone.  There were 4 other girls blessed with the power of a goddess.  Mai summoned back the teenager that had called her babe.  The teenager looked confused, then he noticed the 20-foot tall Mai.<br>\r\n        \"Hiya\" said the teenager nervously.<br>\r\n       \"Hi yourself\" said Mai.  \"how would you like to be my toy?\"<br>\r\n        \"Err..\" said the teenager.  <br>\r\n        Mai picked up the teenager and brought him to her beautiful face.<br>\r\n        \"It's not like you have a choice here\" said Mai.   </span></div></div>",

Honda, who thought he had it bad, was actually enjoying his night with the affectionate Shizkui, who had made sure both he and the Chaos Emperor Dragon were comftorable before kissing them goodnight.  Anzu was getting to know her new doll better, but although she liked him, he was no subsitute for Yugi.  As for Kaiba and Jououchi, well, the less said about them, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, day broke, and after washing up and eating a morning meal, the four girls met back at Kaibaland.

Not only had quite possibly their most powerful champion been defeated (indeed, the Dragon was more powerful than the entire group of Pharoah's guardians combined) but his nearly infinite power had fallen into the hands of three Duel Monsters and two mortals, whose power quite possibly outpaced that of not only the Guardians, but just about any other monster in existence.  Even the three Egyptian Gods worried that the living souls of the girls combined with the powers of the Five God Dragon possessed power exceeding their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fierce debate, the Guardians selected a champion to assess the threat.  The choice was a highly ironic one, as it was Mana's old teacher, the Dark Magician.  He was trusted with finding out just how powerful the girls were, and their intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far he didn't like his chances.  Although he had a soul, the Dark Magician's soul had been tainted by the dark when he became a guardian of the gateway.  His soul couldn't absorb essence the way the pure souls of the other girls could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even so, the power of the Five God Dragon themselves made the girls more than a match for even the Egyptian Gods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as powerful as they were, Mana's teacher had two advantages, stealth and cunning.  He cast a spell to wander the Earth undetected by their power, and was finishing his inital observations.  Although he didn't want to harm Mana, his obligations came first.  He could only hope that whatever they found could be used to defeat the girls.</span></div></div>",

Anyone with half a brain could tell that a fuming duelist couldn't compete with a calm and collected one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start by playing a face down trap card, Rite of Spirit,\" began Kaiba.  \"That will destroy effectively eliminating that expensive Mirror Wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll summon Enraged Battle Ox and combine him with Axe of Despair, creating a 2700 attack monster that can trample through your pathetic defense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako grimaced.  He knew where this was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Battle Ox, destroy his 7 Colored Fish while Blue Eyes attacks directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako braced himself, but it was no use.

He'd defeat the goddesses and win his freedom easily, and even settle things with Yugi if time allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako was far from conceding defeat, although low on Life Points.  Looking to his deck, he tried to see any card that would work.  Any magic would be delayed by one turn, so it was useless right away.  Plus there was the matter of his trampling monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand however, revealed no solution.  No matter what, on the next turn, he would be beaten.  Grumbing, he placed his hand on the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concede defeat Seto Kaiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a nice try,\" replied Kaiba.  \"Keep practicing, and you just might beat me...in a few years!\"</span></div></div>",

The circle continues...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you do not understand.  They will not guard the realm, and prevent the inevitable catastrophe!  The Egyptian Gods will kill me for my failure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does this have to do with us?\" asked Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disrupted the balance!  My original plan was to destroy you and shape a new Dragon to protect the realmns, but no...you wouldn't die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" shouted Yami.  \"You will not harm my friends, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My liege, my life is in your hands.  But I must advise against you leaving the girls alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill them and let me form a new Five God Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question!\" angrily snapped Yami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have sentenced all realms to death.\"</span></div></div>",

Now I use The Black Luster Soldier Ritual and sacrifice my two Dark Lords Of Dragons the summon the Black Luster Soldier!

He took the card: Polimerization, if he used it he would create the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon With Rider with a power of 5000, plus 1000 attack and defense points for eacha dragon he had in the cementery, and as his deck had more dragons than anyone could imagine his Dragon wuld have like 11000 attack and defense points!

The bad news from Gohan was that his mother, Chi Chi was forcing him to study more over the break, as usual from her aggressive, motherly attitude all because he was off saving the universe with his father, Goku. This would mean that Videl would have no time to be with Gohan since he was her boyfriend. Chi Chi was even thinking about having his little brother, Goten study as well and Gohan knows that Goten would do every way he can to not be like his big brother and hang out with Trunks. This morning, Videl got a letter from Trunks' mom and current owner of Capsule Corporation, Bulma Briefs and is offering her to test out an experiment with a crystal that she had found in the wild. Videl soon sets out once she accepted the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm, I wonder why Mrs.Briefs chose me to go to her place for the experiment? Well, I just have to wait and see to what turns up there.\" A few minutes later after using her Capsule hoverbike, she reached Capsule Corp. and there, waiting at the entrance is Bulma. \"Ahh, Videl! It's so good to see that you accepted my invitation.\" said Bulma, \"It's no problem Mrs.Briefs, at least it's something to do besides training with my dad, now that I'm already stronger than him and training by myself and even I need to relax from that.\" \"Well that's good Videl. Follow me.\" finished Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once they reached her lab, Bulma lead her to the crystal that is in a glass dome. \"Whoa, what is <i>that</i> Mrs.Briefs?\" asked Videl, \"I don't know really Videl, that is why I found it recently while I was out looking for one of the dragonballs. I did some research on it but nothing turned from it. And it seems that I have made a discovery! And from my data, it's holding a strange energy that I must tap into.\" \"How would you be able to do that?\" questioned Videl, then, Bulma walked over to a desk to pick up a gun, \"With this extractor gun that I created, it's still untested. That is why I'm going over to my dad's lab to get a few parts before it's actually completed, so I need you to watch over my lab while I'm gone and when I get back, I'll take the crystal's energy and I'll see what would happen if it's power affects a person.\" explained Bulma, \"Can you do that Videl?\" Videl felt unsure about this but agreed nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Bulma left the room, Videl was alone with the dome with the crystal inside. \"Huh, if Bulma says that there is a power inside this little thing, I wonder what it does? It would be awesome if it could suddenly make me stronger than Gohan!\" she giggled and as she got closer to the crystal, it glowed deeply and it made Videl jump in surprise and the crystal shot a beam at her and it knocked her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Videl! Videl, wake up!\" said a voice and soon Videl woke up to see Bulma's face, \"Ugh, what happened?\" \"The crystal! Look! It somehow lost it's power!\" said Bulma, \"What happened while I was gone? The next thing I knew was that you were on the floor!\" \"Uh, Bulma? The last thing I remembered was that the crystal was glowing fiercely and then, as you said, I was on the ground....I believe that....the energy might be on me right now...\" explained Videl, \"We need to get you checked out immediate-\" soon, Bulma backed up as Videl's eyes glowed blue and she started to clutch on the floor, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Videl soon feeling her body change because as of now, she was beginning to grow! From this growth, her clothes were beginning to give way as it was all tearing apart everything except her own fighting gloves. \"AHHH!!! HELP!!!\" screamed the growing girl, \"EVERYONE! LEAVE THE BUILDING!!!\" warned Bulma and soon everyone was out and Videl crashed through the building and stopped at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grow things?! This is so embarrassing!\" said Videl and attempted to cover herself with the Capsule Corp. building but it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This IS an amazing discovery! But yet a dangerous one indeed, especially in a social status...there can only be pervs around here. Good thing that I have Vegeta. I need to get to work on making a shrink ray to get you to normal. Just don't let the newscasters find you or they will be ALL OVER ME!\" said Bulma as she prepares to go into one of her father's labs. \"Oh...this sucks.\" said Videl and soon, her stomach begins to growl, meaning she was hungry. Probably because she didn't had any breakfast yet since she read the letter at home. With much nervousness, Videl stood up and floated up into air and attempts to leave West City with flight before anyone finds her but it was futile with her height as of now, everyone in the city can now see her and soon, news helicopters have now found her as she landed on the wastelands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh great. Just as Bulma told me to NOT attract attention, THEY find me anyway!\" thought Videl as she sees the copters. \"Holy crap! This is AMAZING! The daughter of the champion and hero of the world, Mr. Hercule Satan is a naked giant!\" said the cameraman who was filming, \"This is gonna be <i>PHENOMENAL</i> news!\" said the news reporter with a smile. \"Ah! Get away, you pervs!\" shouted Videl who was trying to swat away the flying vehicles and helicopters, she took some of them down but survived but some remain flying normal and swiftly. Soon, her stomach began to growl more and as she felt it, she gets an idea. As from the timing that Videl took, she quickly grabbed all of the flying vehicles and spoke, \"Say, if you wanted to see my bod so badly....why not take a look on the <i>inside</i>?\" said Videl as she now opens up her mouth and tongue and drops them all in, causing them all to become afraid and she soon closes her maw and takes a taste test. \"Say, they aren't half bad. They taste kinda good!\" said Videl as she finally swallows them whole, \"They will fill up for a while. Now for a nap behind a mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Little did she know was that there was a power level heading toward her direction but she didn't sense it because she was tired, so who was it?</span></div></div>",

I <i>really</i> don't want to study. OR I WILL BE LIKE GOHAN WHEN <i>HE</i> WAS A KID! Boring and nerdy! But he's still my awesome brother!\" responded Goten. Soon, Trunks stopped, \"Whoa! Goten hold up!\" and Goten did what he was told, \"Do you feel that?\" \"Yeah! It feels huge!\" \"Well, more like average but still higher than any person but it feels like a growth in size really. Let's find it!\" \"Alright!\" and the two boys went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After minutes of searching, the boys both stopped completely in their tracks from who they discovered and from what they sensed, it matched exactly. \"WHAT?! VIDEL??!\" both boys said in disbelief, \"Dude, she's huge! And with <i>no</i> clothes!\" said Trunks, \"I'm gonna tell my big bro!\" and before Goten was about to leave, he was grabbed by Trunks, \"Whoa, Goten! Where do you think you are going?!\" \"To Gohan.\" responded Goten, \"Don't you remember your mom?\" said Trunks, \"Oh...you're right...\" \"I've got an idea! How about we could mess with Videl for a bit?\" said Trunks mischievously, \"I don't know why you made that voice but count me in!\" agreed Goten. Soon, they both flew down to Videl's resting body and landed on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow! Her tummy is <i>big</i> compared to my dad's when he eats!\" said Goten, \"No duh, dummy! She's a giant! It's supposed to be that way!\" said Trunks. Soon, they both heard to what was like screaming and they both put their ears on her belly to hear people inside! \"What the?! She <i>ate</i> people?!\" said both kids, \"AWESOME!!\" soon, something caught Goten's eye and pointed, \"Look Trunks!\" \"What?\" and from where Goten was pointing at, it was Videl's huge breasts, \"What are those? Do you think those are the things that are on 18's, our moms, and Videl's chests?\" he continued curiously, \"Huh, I don't know. Let's check it out.\" said Trunks and they both went to the \"mountains\" but they split up to have their own breast.<br>\r\nGoten was jumping on the left breast while Trunks was inspecting the nipple on the right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woo! This thing is bouncy and soft! Like a dough ball when it's almost hard!\" said Goten, soon, Trunks reaches the top of her nipple and began to see a hanging liquid on the side of the flesh as he looked inside the hole, \"Whoa, what's this?\" said Trunks as he took it and gave it a taste, \"WOW! It's milk! Legit milk! Hey, Goten! Get over here!\" and Goten did so, \"What is it?\" \"Give this a taste!\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course I'm sure!\" Trunks responded with a smile, and Goten did so and his face lit up, \"That was delicious!\" said Goten, \"I think there is more in this hole! Maybe there is some from where you were before!\" continued Trunks, \"AWESOME!!\" said Goten and soon, the boys began to feel the breast shake and the next thing they see is Videl being to wake up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-huh? What the?! Trunks?! Goten?!\" said Videl in surprise and shock, \"Uh oh...\" said the boys, \"What do you think you two are doing on my body?!\" \"Uhhh....\" said Goten, \"EXPERIMENTING! Yeah, experimenting!\" replied Trunks, \"I don't believe you one bit Trunks.\" said Videl with a annoyed look, \"Oh man.\" said Trunks in defeat, \"You two are in so much trouble!\" shouted Videl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the two boys do for tactics? </span></div></div>",

Goten agreed with the plan and off they both went. Both Half-Saiyans flew around Videl at full speed and at the same time, attempted to hide their power, Videl could still see them flying and the next thing she knew, they weren't flying anymore. The plan worked for them, they got Videl confused and as well, they were in hiding. Where you ask? In her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cool! It worked!\" said Trunks, \"Yeah! So what do we do now?\" asked Goten, \"We keep on doing what we were doing, except that this time, we will go someplace specific. No more splitting up like the first time when we first arrived.\" Goten nodded and now both boys pondered on where to go. After minutes of pondering, Trunks got an idea, but it would have to be the most <i>perfect</i> opportunity. Soon, they heard Videl speak and listened closely, \"Oh! I almost had those little idiots! *sigh* Well, since they are out of my hair for the time being, I'm gonna go nap again.\" said Videl and she soon lies on the ground stomach-first and she rested her head on her arms, \"Oh, you have NO idea!\" said Trunks, \"Come on Goten! Follow me!\" and he soon left with Goten following suit, \"Where are we going, Trunks?\" \"Something that we both see every day with our moms and  usually we both kick it \"but\" this time...we <i>play</i>!\" \"Wah?! You mean..?!\" \"Yep! Her butt!\" declared Trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both boys went gliding down her neck and her back until they reached her huge cheeks, \"Whoa, it's big! No wonder Gohan has her for a girlfriend.\" said Trunks lewdly, as Goten heard that, his face turned red all over, \"If my mom discovered that I was doing this, I'm SO dead!\" he thought. Soon, they both went inside her cheeks and after a while of pushing flesh, they found her puckered butthole. Soon, Goten lifted an eyebrow and floated up to check on something, \"Hey Trunks? Can you come up here?\" \"Alright.\" and he soon does so. \"What is that pink skin over there?\" asked Goten, \"I don't know. Hey let's play rock, paper, scissors! Winner gets to go where to go next!\" \"Okay!\" \"If I win, we go in the butt, if you win Goten, we'll check it out over there.\" Soon they played and the winner was....</span></div></div>",

Trunks has won Rock, Paper, Scissors! \"Alright!

Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon, both boys landed above the blocked hole which is Videl's puckered asshole, \"Dude...I know that we go #2 here but I wonder what it's like on the inside? Especially with Videl. Come on Goten, you gotta admit you're curious too right?\" asked Trunks, and Goten slowly nods. \"Okay! Me first!\" said the excited Trunks as he jumps and dived into the clenched flesh and goes inside, Goten, not wanting to be alone, does the same like Trunks. As they went, they were marveled by everything. The flesh was clean, the air doesn't stink of crap or impulsive flatulence.

This is kinda fun!\" said Goten, \"Yeah! I'm glad I thought of this idea!\" responded Trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back outside, Videl woke up suddenly with a surprised look on her face as she got up and shifted her body in order to sit on her butt with her knees pointing forward on the ground, \"Uh....what is this....feeling...I'm having? M-My ass feels weird...yet....so <i>good</i>....whoever is doing that....is in....trouble...mmmm....\"  moaned Videl, not knowing about the two boys but focused on the sudden pleasure spike coming from her ass.

Must be your tiny size.\" The pink-haired girl giggles a bit as she opens her palm and indicates with her finger for him to hop on.

Sakura then brings him up to her face. \"You do look cute at that size, Naruto.\" she said while smiling at him. \"Great only at this size do you find me cute...\" pouts the blonde-haired ninja. Sakura laughs out loud this time as she notices his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I promise I'll help you the best I can.\" \"Thanks Sakura.\" this time it is Naruto who smiles at his long time \"crush\", which causes her to nod at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Sakura has finished painting her nails and placed the polish away, taking a moment to bring her headband down to where it's just over her eyes(exactly how Naruto wears his) she places the tiny ninja within the top of the headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, that should keep you safe.\" The young girl then puts on her shoes and makes her away out of her home.</span></div></div>",

Just don\u2019t kill me!\u201d Ino shrieked and ran off, not caring were she went as long as the outraged fish-girl didn\u2019t get her.

Sakura, I-I'm reeeealy sorry that i landed on....um..er....w-well....IM SORRY!\" Naruto tried to stop himself from sweating and blushing so much it seemed like he was about to explode! Saukura also got a zap into reality andd began to blush a little as well. She also began laugh a bit at Naruto's reaction (funny how just a small laugh can make the world shake.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry about it Naruto. Im just glad your safe. And it wasn't really your fault you landed on...well...um..\"there\". But at that moment, Sakura couldn't help but ask. She began to blush a little harder \"...but......is it well....um...nice....there?\" Naruto froze. He felt like saying \"HECK YEAH!!!!\" but he wanted to be a little more mature at his current situation...fearing whatever he says determines his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um......y-yeah. Actually it feels kinda great Sakura! I-It's feels w-warm and soft! Like a pillow! You should worry what other people say so m-much Sakura. I think your fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Sakura was always accused of being \"flat chested\", and Naruto just wanted to make her happy. He did always think the opposite, not that that was the only thing he saw in Sakura, because he always thought a guy should look more to what is on the inside than the outside of a girl. (Of course, that slightly changed when Jiraya came 0_o) Sakura was faltered by the compliment though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks Naruto- DONT GET USED TO IT!!!!!!!!!\" as the inner sakura said with a booming voice to remind the ant-sized Ninja to not get any ideas. Naruto, with his eardrums ringing and his eyes as little circles, could only reply with a small \"y-yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Sakura said playfully. \"Now we need to find you a cure. Joy time's over, so come of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......that's easier said then done Sakura, haha, I could get killed from this height!\" Naruto replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...well just climb into my hand then.\" Sakura then extended her extreeeemly big hand to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sakura's fingers being as tall as a building and her palm being the size of  two football field, Naruto was amazed at how small he was and how BIG Sakura was. It took him about 5 minutes to get to the middle of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow Sakura! I could jog back and forth and get tired instantly! It's kinda scary...but cool at the same time!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HaHa, really? It's kinda cool for me to. I have to squint really hard just so i can see your blonde hair Naruto!\" Both were amazed at the situation. Naruto then jogged a bit to see a clear view, as Sakura got up from the floor and dusted of her dress. Naruto looked between Sakura's fingers (about a yard in length) and looked down to see how far he was. And boy was it LONG. Naruto could barely see the bottom! He'd have to have been 600 - 1000 from the ground to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow Sakura. It's a good thing we're friends!\" Sakura giggled a bit and did her best to make Naruto feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Naruto. I would never harm you in any way, especially in this situation. You have my word! And besides, you do look kinda cute when your small like this. I don't kill cute things.\" Sakura said with a warm smile. Naruto felt relieved and happy by her words...especially Sakura saying that he looked cute. Suddenly thought, Naruto began to feel a sensation in his ears. They were slightly bleeding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh....\" Naruto said in a little pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto? Whats wrong?\" Sakura asked in deep concern. \"Oh....It must be your voice, Sakura. Its really loud, heh. But dont worry, I think I have some ear plugs in my Ninja tool bag!\" Naruto then cleaned his ears and put them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...much better\" Naruto said in comfort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...Sorry about that  Naruto. I'll try to lower my voice.\" Sakura softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went of to see help, they decided to see Tsunade for help. On their trip, Sakura decided to put Naruto on her shoulder so she could hear him better. Naruto also noticed again how small he was. Each step Sakura took made a loud \"BOOOOOM!\" noice and shook him. Lucky thing he had his ear plugs! (And Sakura's hair did make a good shade from the sun that could severely burn him at his size!) On there way, they told jokes and stories to pass the time. Naruto loved it. Even if he was small. They then noticed Sasuke on the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey Sasuke!\" Sakura said happily. Naruto could only grumble at the fact that the good time was over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sakura...hey.\" Sasuke said bluntly as natrual. \"Wait...why are you going this way? I though you were gonna  train with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...uh...about that\" Sakura then showed Naruto to Sasuke. Sasuke even had to use his sharingan to see clearly. When he saw Naruto, he could only crack a smile (Oh, he's laughing HARD on the inside)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh....you loser.You messed up the jutsu didn't you.\" Sasuke said in pride\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto answered in anger \"GRRR! Sasuke!! Wait until i get back to normal!!!!! I'll kill ya, I'll pulverize ya! I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys, guys calm down!\" (Even at this size, Naruto STILL picks a fight with Sasuke. Oh brother...) Sakura interrupted and thought in amazement. Team 7 then walked on to Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he reached the uvula, he extended his hand towards the outside of Sakura's mouth. He then said his prayers, and then accepted his faith. His only regret was that he never got to become Hokage. But even so, Naruto decided to end it with a smile on his face. He took one last glance of the outside world through Sakura's mouth. He remembered the times he had with his friends and Iruka sensei. He then let out one last \"Believe it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was then swallowed and died instantly. Years after people stopped looking for Naruto and stopped mourning. Then then moved on with Naruto's attitude. To this day, Nobody knew what ever happened to him. The Akatsuki  realized  Naruto died, and gave up. They all killled them selves. Hinata also killed her self to the fact that her beloved died. Konoha then made a memorial to Naruto for his bravery and determination.

Sakura couldn't help but laugh at Naruto predicament. In doing so it caused her to flex and wiggle her toes including the one inwhich Naruto was stuck to.<br>\r\nNaruto could only cry in agony as Sakura's goddess size toes were waving all over the place due to her laughter which sounded like a goddess that completely surrounded him.<br>\r\nWhen Sakura had finished laughing she finally send something to Naruto. \"Alright my little Naruto!!! Since your already stuck to my nail polish you might as well consider this your home. I'll feed your crumbs and you can drink my toe sweat so that way you can survive but its entirely up to me when you get your nutrient!.\" Sakura voiced echoed.<br>\r\nNaruto however still continued to struggle no hope of escape forever stuck to his goddess big toe stuck in the green nail polish prison.<br>\r\nNaruto considered falling asleep and just wait until Sakura had decided to calm down it wasn't like he was gonna be able to move anytime soon.<br>\r\nNaruto decided to...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't know why she lost her temper. Maybe she had thought that it was a dream, or something like that. She didn't know why her mind had only shown her bad memories of Naruto and not good ones as well. She waited for him to wake up.</span></div></div>",

It took a while to realise who he was and why he was in so much pain. Betrayal stabbed at his heart. First, Hinata confesses her love for him, then crushes him with her gigantic ass. Then, fear. He had barely survived one ass crush, what would it be like if she tried to kill him again? Suddenly he remembers why she wanted to kill him. He had made fun of her once. For being weak. He shivered at the irony, causing a titanic amount of pain to roll over his body once more. She probably would try to kill him again if he mispleased her. And at his size, it was certainly possible. Probable, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he had a brilliant idea. If he worked to please her every whim, she wouldn't kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took hours, maybe days, Naruto wasn't sure, for him to heal to a point where he could sit up. When he did, Hinata's intimidating form was looming over him. He didn't note the look of concern on her face. The memory of her evil-pure cheerfulness clouded over that. He nearly screeches in fear, and quickly remembers his plan of survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata-sama!\" It was bearly a squeak, even with the amplification jutsu that was still in effect. He quickly notices her frown. \"Hinata-sama. Thank you for showing mercy on this lowly being!\" He bows his head, wincing when he didn't get a reply.

Ichigo gets as close as he can to Rukia's face, which was about to her shoulder. He starts to climb up the fabric up Rukia's dress trying his best not to fall and kill himself. After several grueling minutes of climbing Ichigo finally reached the top of Rukia's shoulder and started to make his way toward Rukia's neck. However, when when he reached Rukia's neck and his goal was almost in site Rukia started to move in her sleep. Her movements sent Ichigo off balance and falling down the neck opening of Rukia's dress. Ichigo panicked and grabbed onto what ever he could to try and regain his balance, which felt soft and somehow firm at the same time. When he regained his footing Ichigo realized what he had grabbed onto was in fact Rukia's breast. At first he started to panic realizing Rukia would kill him if she ever found out, but at the same time is was dumbstruck out the two great mounds that stood before him. Ichigo then realized that Rukia wasn't wearing a bra and never pinned her for the being the type that wouldn't. He knew that Rukia didn't have large breasts like Matsumoto and Orihime, but to his size Rukia's breasts now looked massive. Ichigo thought about inspecting them further, but quickly pushed the thought to the back of his mind knowing he had to wake up Rukia as soon as possible, but before Ichigo could start climbing again Rukia suddenly started to move again, but this time she rolled completely from her back to her front. Before he could realize it Ichigo was suddenly pressed up against Rukia's chest in-between her two breasts. Luckily the force wasn't enough to kill him and Ichigo started to slowly crawl forward until he was out of Rukia's dress. Relieved that Rukia's face was now on the bed Ichigo rushed as quickly as he could toward it before Rukia moved again. Ichigo reached Rukia's face in deep sweat and started to think how he would go about waking Rukia up, but before he could think of a way Rukia again flipped over onto her back. Ichigo was about to be furious, but then he realized that he could scream into Rukia's ear to wake her up. Ichigo approached Rukia's ear and took hold of some of Rukia's hair just in case she moved again. Ichigo screamed as loud as he could \"RRRRRRRUUUUUKKKKKKKIIIIIIIAAAA\". At first Ichigo thought his attempts were unsuccessful and was ready to try again when Rukia started to wake up and quicker then he expected started to raise her head in a half awake state. \"Ichigo...\" Rukia said half awake attempting to locate where Ichigo was, but the force of her lifting her head proved to be stronger then the tiny ichigo expected and he was flung forward and lost grip of the strands of Rukia's hair. Ichigo started to fall back down towards Rukia's breasts while the half conscious Rukia attempted to find out where Ichigo was. Ichigo then fell again through the neck hole of Rukia's dress, but since Rukia was turning her body looking for Ichigo, Ichigo's path was changed from falling in-between Rukia's breast to falling on-top of Rukia's right breast. Ichigo bounced off Rukia's breast and started to fall again and grabbed onto something to stop his fall. What Ichigo hadn't realized was that he had mistakenly grabbed Rukia's nipple. Ichigo soon realized it himself and panicked, but quickly grabbed back on when he was about to fall. Ichigo suddenly started to notice that Rukia's nipple was getting bigger and harder and her breathing was getting faster and heavier making it harder to hang on. Rukia suddenly felt a wave of heat surge through her body. She reached into dress and found the source of the sensation was a tiny person more importantly was a tiny Ichigo, which surprised her at first, but she soon came to her senses and became angry for what Ichigo had done and thought of a suitable punishment for him. \"So there you are Ichigo... get a nice feel while you were down there?\" Rukia said to the small Ichigo she held in-between her fingers. \"Rukia!... I can explain, but first can you help me get back to nor.. SAVE IT!\" Rukia yelled, which scared Ichigo due to his size. \"Ichigo... because you already turned me on your going to help me get off\" Rukia almost purring at the end of the sentence. \"NO Way!\" Ichigo immedietyley responded to Rukia's statement. \"Sad to say, but you don't have a choice in the matter Ichigo\" Rukia said as she lowered Ichigo down to her crotch. She quickly pushed Ichigo against her white panties and began to move him up and down while her other hand massaged one of her breasts. Ichigo felt as Rukia's crotch started to get wet while her hand got faster and faster. Rukia could feel herself getting close to climaxing, but needed more stimulation. She  then brought Ichigo away from her crotch and removed her panties. Almost immediately Rukia plunged Ichigo deep inside her pussy as her feelings of pleasure increased with each thrust. Ichigo was barley able to stay conscious as he was being thrust in and out of Rukia's pussy and was eventually shoved in and kept in. Ichigo could now see the inside of Rukia's pussy that seemed like a damp cave except it was moving. Soon Rukia let out a loud moan and the walls of Rukia's pussy relaxed as a wave of come came towards Ichigo covering him all over. After the wave Ichigo was drenched and Rukia was breathing heavily, but slower. \"That... was.... great.... Ichigo\" Rukia said gasping. \"Your welcome!\" Ichigo said in a annoyed sarcastic tone \"Now can you help me get back to normal\" Ichigo almost yelled at Rukia. \"Sure... after we play some more Ichigo\" She said in a cynical tone. Ichigo's face suddenly went pale \"Its going to be a long night\" Ichigo thought to himself as Rukia started the process of pleasuring herself all over again.     </span></div></div>",

The smell increased 10 fold. \"Oh and by the way, the longer I wear my shoes, the worse it will smell. Meaning: the smell will increase with no limit for all of eternity.

And if an Anime Characters die, who do you think they'd run into? I'll tell you, either Soul Reapers or Hollows.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStart the chapter!<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia was about to kill the bug when a voice got both her and Ichigo's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw who it was, Ichigo moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOF ALL PEOPLE IT HAD TO BE HIM!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDren the Cyniclon, in his gigai. He was wearing a simple black shirt and jeans with sneakers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis short hair was black and his ears were human-looking, but his eyes, voice and skin tone were unchanged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia had met him after some gut called 'Deep Blue' killed him; Dren had been trying to become a hollow by messing with the hole in his ghost's chest so he could protect someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result would have been a half-Soul Reaper half-hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia had stopped him and it was true love at first sight for them both. But he was resurrected and Rukia couldn\u2019t see him because of her Soul Reaper duties until Ichigo had taken her powers and she came across him in their respective gigai bodies, they had almost had their first kiss with Ichigo had shouted to get a room if they were going to be making out at the two of them. After Rukia had introduced them, Dren had burst out laughing, just what he found funny was made in the brief conversation after he\u2019d calmed down, and it was something Ichigo would have struck a deal with Grand Fisher to wipe from his mind.<br>\r\n________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\nFlashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDren: That\u2019s your name? Ichigo? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo: Yeah (Ichigo starts walking away from Dren and Rukia)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDren: Doesn\u2019t that translate into the word \u201cStrawberry\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo(dismissively): Shut up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDren (grinning): OK, see ya later\u2026Strawberry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo (Edward-being-called-\u2018short\u2019-class temper): DON\u2019T CALL ME STRAWBERRY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Flashback<br>\r\n________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\nIchigo had been so mad he\u2019d attacked Dren, Dren knocked him out and Ichigo and woken up with Orihime wrapping his head in bandages. After that, Dren had always referred to Ichigo as \u201cStrawberry\u201d and pulled jokes like giving him putting strawberries in Ichigo\u2019s food and giving him strawberry-flavored things at lunch without Ichigo noticing, then when Ichigo had noticed the taste of strawberries (He always made a face like he\u2019d chugged ten gallons of sewer water when he realized he tasted strawberries), Dren would leap from his seat, point at Ichigo, and shout \u201cCANNIBLE!\u201d in a prankster\u2019s tone.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHE DROVE ICHIGO CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst parts were that Rukia was always inviting Dren over and The Soul Society expected him to help deal with hollows. Because of what he was doing when he met Rukia, Dren had gained a few powers that interested the Soul Society. So much so that the Soul Society had taken his real body and given him a gigai and would only give him his real body back if he joined the Soul Society permanently, instead of freelance hollow-fighting despite the fact that he ALWAYS showed up and fought the hollows whenever one showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first being his Hollow-sense, it worked so well He was already were the hollow was attacking before the Soul Society even knew a hollow was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was his Hollow-Threat Level detector. Depending on the Type of hollow (Single Identity-class, Menos-class, Gillian-class, Adjuchas-class, Vasto lorde-class) , an image appeared in Dren\u2019s mind that was as if one generated ripples on a pond without throwing a stone. One ripple was Single Identity-class, two ripples were Menos-class, three ripples were Gillian-class, four ripples were Adjuchas-class, and five ripples were Vasto lorde-class. Being able to tell how powerful the hollows were made him invaluable enough <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut lastly, and unluckily for Ichigo, Dren had the power to put Hollows into gigais of their monstrous forms so anyone could what a hollow was and the people screaming and running away made it easy as hell for  any Soul Reapers to find the hollow and kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Rukia, what are you doing?\u201d Dren asked. \u201cI\u2019m trying to kill this stupid bug.\u201d Rukia answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026if your busy, I could just come back\u2026but I was wondering\u2026if\u2026you know\u2026you\u2019d like to go out with me today Rukia.\u201d Dren said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that you want to take me out on a date?\u201d Rukia asked with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019d like. It\u2019ll be a relief to go with you without Strawberry fallowing us everywhere\u2026speaking of Strawberry, were is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t know, but I know he hates bugs, but maybe he won\u2019t notice it, like you said we could use a date without Ichigo spying on us or tagging along to ruin our time together.\u201d<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nIchigo couldn\u2019t believe this. But he COULD go with them and try to ruin the date until Rukia changed him back, unless of course, Rukia squashed him before going with Dren\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She dragged him up and down her butt cheeks, making sure that she got every spot. When she was clean, she dropped Luffy into the toilet and put her hand on the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that that's where you belong. If you ever misbehave you will only get more of the same.\" Nami pushed the handle and watched Luffy spin down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy finally mustered a weak cry. \"Nami!

Five minutes later Kagome opened the front door to leave for school. \"Wait honey\" Mrs. Higurashi says, appearing in the hallway. \"I made these just for you, I know you love baked beans\" she says, handing her a container. \"Thanks mom!\" Kagome says with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPRRRIIIMMMMPPP!

To make up for making ANOTHER anime and videogame story, I'm going to try my best to keep this one quality controlled. So hopefully anyone adding onto this will help by following some of the rules to make this story fun to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No quick/short chapters. As in, no 1-2 sentence chapters and random endings. Try to make at least a decent amount of writing per chapter, so the story can keep going on well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to keep the characters almost microscopic to the female characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Decent grammar and spelling. You don't have to do it well, I'm not the greatest at English either. But try at least not to type so you have to translate the text from engilsh to English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-On girls can become giants. For shrinking, girls can shrink, but its preferred that the guy shrinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nothing overly sexual. There can be some sexual things, but nothing extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No gay stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Characters can go out of character if you want. You can make good people go evil, and such. Just give the option to keep the character normal before you change the personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Over 52,000 views, please help to keep it growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks to everyone who has added.</td>",
