He was the school's deadpan snarker. But Connor also had a secret he kept from all: he had a fetish for pregnant women. It didn't matter how plain a girl looked- if she was pregnant, he wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while walking to first period, he spied a solid gold ring. Curious, he rubbed it. It seemed to do nothing, but a few seconds later, a voice inside his head made itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Put the ring in your pocket,' it commanded. Connor's mind was unsure, but his body had already decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You have obtained the Pregnancy Ring,' said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The what?' Connor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Pregnancy Ring allows you to create new pregnancies or edit existing ones, finetuning them to your preferences. However, only women who were on campus when you picked it up can come under the ring's influence.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That sounds perfect. When can I use it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor was excited, but he was unsure who to use the ring on first.</span></div></div>",

She had blonde hair with dark roots, frosted tips, mid-length hair.  Kind of a messy-chic that he saw from behind more often than not.  Curvy but not thicc, with soft features and a tendency to wear clothes just a little snug.  She wore too much makeup, and had a bit of a prissy attitude most of the time.  She didn't like him much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the very end of last year, it was rumored that she got pregnant by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, whom she dumped on the last day of school.  The notion captured his imagination all summer long, and he couldn't wait to see what truth came of it come September.  When school started and she <i>wasn't</i> showing, an entire summer of fantasy came to nought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His eyes moved to the left one, catching on another girl hard at work chewing on her pencil.  Cherie Fircrest.  She'd been a staple in his life since kindergarten, when she lived down the street in the apartments at the end of the block.  Her dad was the chief of police in town, a big African American man; her mother was reportedly part Shawnee.  This gave Cherie a look that stood out from the norm- features that marked her as different, but pretty.  He'd had an eye on her since as long as he could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She had been friends with him, back when they lived close together, until her parents moved into a house outside of town.  Overnight, she stopped talking to him, stopped looking at him.  It was as if her moving had made her a different person.  She was a very smart girl, always receiving top marks in class, and as Connor was at best a B-student, it was one more thing driving a wedge between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was here that Nicole Hulitzer, the twin sister of his best friend Nick Hulitzer, hit him in the back of the head with her ruler.  \"Hey Con<i>nerd</i>- you got some paper I can borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Connor frowned and turned towards her, \"You're out of paper already?  What the hell, Nicole... are you eating it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Choose one!</b></i> came the voice, more commanding this time.  He didn't really have time to think about a response- the name just popped into his head:</span></div></div>",

Nichole blinked in astonishment as she felt perfectly fine. She slowly stood up and wondered what had caused her sudden sickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>It is done</b>, the voice decreed. \u201cSo, Nichole is now pregnant?\u201d He asked leisurely walking to the restroom Nichole darted into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, a child grows within her</b>, the voice exclaimed in the same hokey tone. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, is she gonna have to give birth, that\u2019s painful right, I don\u2019t want her to be hurt, and who\u2019s the father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, Yes, Yes, and YOU ARE</b>, the voice answer with dramatic flair at Conner\u2019s new paternity.

Oh boy, the voice replied sarcastically amused by the ridiculous idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ll as you know I\u2019ve had trouble getting a boyfriend.\u201d Nichole explained as she whipped out her phone. \u201cNOO, really!\u201d Connor exclaimed sarcastically, which resulted in a light smack to his head by Nichole. \u201cI wonder why.\u201d He continued in the same tone as he rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, so I looked on the internet and found this.\u201d She told Connor as she showed him her phone. On her phone was a webpage for amateur witches that listed a collection of rituals. \u201cThe Lonely Teen\u2019s Guide to Witchcraft.\u201d He read out the name of the webpage with an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s really stupid but I thought what\u2019s the harm, so I may have done this.\u201d She said bringing up the ritual in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Ritual of the Longing Heart, this ritual will make you irresistible to your soul mate, and bring you to his attention.\u201d Connor read in utter confusion, he gave her a skeptical look and asked her. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know but look at me, how do you explain this, I must have done the ritual wrong or something and it cursed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor thought about her crazy idea and laughed at its absurdity until he thought about how he just happened upon the ring, was the ring sent because of her spell, was he actually her soul mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my gosh, have I merely been the tool of an even greater cosmic force, the voice in the ring exclaimed getting swept up in the crazy idea. \u201cWill you shut up.\u201d Connor quietly snarled, to which Nichole replied. \u201cWhat was that,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly Connor replied \u201cI was just thinking, maybe you aren\u2019t cursed, maybe this is irresistible to your soul mate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNichole looked at him with disgust and replied. \u201cOh please, who\u2019d find this gross gut attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared at her indifferently and said. \u201cAre you kidding there are tons of guys that like big bellies.\u201d Nichole looked at him in confusion before it dawned on her. \u201cOh yeah, like chubby chasers. So, my soul mate is one of those but who.\u201d She asked as she stroked her chin in contemplation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Connor walked up to her and said. \u201cWhile there might be plenty of chubby chasers at school, I happen to like pregnant women.\u201d He gave the dumbfounded Nichole\u2019s maternal bump a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you two what are you doing.\u201d The voice belonging to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
