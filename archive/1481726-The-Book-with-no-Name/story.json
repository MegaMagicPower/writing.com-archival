            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>10 years ago. That was when his life changed. He was spending the night with his best friend Lily. They had known each other since they were babies, their parents knew each other and lived next to each other long before they were born. It was a terrible thunderstorm. His parents wanted the night to themselves. They never came back. A drunk driver hit them, killing them instantly. He had no living relatives, so Lily's parents took him in. 10 years later, and they are still living together and are in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started on a Friday night. School had ended and he had just finished up his homework. Leaving his weekend free. He heads downstairs and goes to the kitchen, looking for something to eat. He then notices a box by the stairs. Putting a hand to his head, \"right! I totally forgot. Lily's mom asked me to take that to the attic. I guess I'll do this first\". He lifts it up, \"heavier that it looks!\", he says and heads back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the string, the stairs drop down. \"This isn't going to be easy.....\". After a couple of attempts, including him falling once. He somehow manages to get the box into the attic. Finding a place for the box, he heads back to the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA section of the floor suddenly gives way, sending him into it. \"What just happened?\", he says, a bit dazed. He seems to be in some secret storage area that was just underneath the attic. A lone chest is the only thing here. \"That's odd. No one said anything about this place\". He picks up the chest and takes it out of the secret area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing it back on the ground, he blows on it, and a lot of dust blows into the air. \"Must of been in there for a very long time\". There wasn't a lock on it. He carefully opens it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, on a red pillow, was a dark black book that was covered in odd markings and symbols. \"What?\", he says surprised. Reaching down, he picks up the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee First Page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops the book, the voice had surprised him. Looking around and seeing that no one was there, he picks it back up. \"No way.....but where did that voice come from?\". He notices a folded piece of paper inside the chest as well. Carefully, he picks up and unfolds the old paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCONGRATULATIONS ON FINDING THIS BOOK. I NO LONGER HAD ANY INTEREST IN USING IT, SO I DECIDED TO HIDE IT. I USED IT TO FULFILL ALL OF MY DESIRES, ONE OF WHICH WAS BUILDING THIS HOUSE. I HAD THIS SECRET AREA MADE JUST FOR THE BOOK. GOOD LUCK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE PREVIOUS MASTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis persuades him even more, the note looked authentic. So what was the harm in trying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls up the ladder and locks himself in the attic. Sitting down, he pulls out the pen he had on him, he forgot to put it away after completing his homework, and opens up to a random page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the pen onto the paper, he knew what to try first. REPAIR THE HOLE IN THE ATTIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns towards the hole and sees if it works. \"I knew it, there is...no..w..\", he stops short as some small bright lights start to appear and float around the hole. It suddenly starts to repair itself. His eyes widen, \"oh my\", is all he is able to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly realizes what he is holding, and can't stop himself from smiling. He quickly opens the stairs and heads back down. He starts to head towards his room, but something stops him. He hears laughter....</span></div></div>",

Using the time limit, he stashes the book in his room and gets back into position, waiting to see if the book will really make her smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another laugh, she is still sitting on the couch when a short tingling sensation hit her. She doesn't give it a second thought as she continues to watch her show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she doesn't notice herself shrinking and her clothes bagging up around her. She gets up for a second, and her skirt falls to her feet. Blushing, she quickly pulls it up and sits back down. \"How did that happen? I thought this fit me perfectly\". Looking at her shirt, she finally notices. She sees that her shirt is bigger than it should be. Grabbing the sleeve, she can plainly see her hand getting smaller and the shirt getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, she has no idea what is going on. The book finishes shrinking her as she vanishes into her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring in disbelief, It takes about a minute forl Jason to snap out of it before he heads over to the pile of clothing on the couch. The first thing he does is just stare at it, still a little bit in shock in seeing his childhood friend shrink before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees a moving bulge in her clothes. He figures that she is trying to get out. Deciding that he should help her, he starts to carefully remove the clothes until he finds her. She is sitting there, naked, surprised, and trying to cover herself. \"Jason? What happened to me? Don't look at me!\". He sees how upset she is and decides to try something. Gently picking up the frightened Lily, he does his best to keep her covered as he carries her upstairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her on the bed, he goes through his own clothes until he finds and pulls out a red bandanna. \"Use this to cover yourself\", he tells her. She thanks him and wraps it around herself as he sits down next to her.....</span></div></div>",

She grabs his thumb at well, her heart beating faster and faster. He wasn't done. His 3 free fingers start to tickle her left side.

Even more embarassed, she wants to cover herself, but Jason doesn't stop and this continues for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops, and she is still on his hand and on her stomach, now covered in sweat and breathing heavily. \".....Uh, maybe I should of stopped a little earlier than I did. Oh well\". He grabs the bandanna and takes it, the book, and her upstairs. Opening the door to the upstairs bathroom, he shuts the door and places what he brought with him by the sink.

He undresses, then gently picks her back up and sits down in the tub, placing her on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe manages to sit up and looks at him. She blushes again and both looks down and covers her chest. He places a hand on her and she looks back up at him only to get another surprise, he is grinning at her, and has a bar of soap and a towel in his other hand. Several minutes pass as he takes his time washing her. \"Does this really feel that good Lily? You look like your enjoying this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually get out and Jason dries her off and wraps her in a small towel.

The girls stare at it for a while, after it had stopped glowing. Lily makes the first move. She inches towards it and picks it up. \"Oh my god....It looks brand new!\". Heather and Jackie then scoot over to Lily and look it over as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not over yet\", Jason says, interrupting Lily before she says anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow resumes, with the tiger in Lily's hands. She drops it, and it starts to grow until it was larger than Lily. \"And now it's done. Your old tiger doll is now a human sized tiger chair\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust staring at it for a bit, she suddenly tackles it. \"This is amazing! Thank you! It's so soft\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Jason in the eyes, Jackie starts to talk to him. \"I still don't believe it, but that's pretty hard to ignore. You found a book that is able to do anything that only you write in it\". \"Uh, I guess so. Yes\". \"...So, the only to ask is this. What are you going to do with it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes his eyes and thinks thinks this over for a few minutes.

I guess I'll just do the same\". \"Your just going to do whatever you want?\", Jackie says. \"Basically, yes. Though I wouldn't be so closed minded on letting you girls make a few....suggestions\".

She nods. \"Alright\". He opens the book and speaks out what he was writing. SHRINK HEATHER DOWN TO THE SIZE OF A DOLL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\", she suddenly says as a tingling sensation spreads throughout her body. She then starts to glow as her body starts to shrink and disappear into her clothes. Surprised by this, Lily was the first one to move as she starts to go through the pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally finds the tiny, 6 inch tall naked Heather. \"It really worked! This is unreal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarring at her, he realizes that she is naked and quickly turns away. \"Sorry about that. I didn't think that your close wouldn't shrink\". \"I-I didn't either. It's fine\". \"I'll fix it, just give me a second\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAKE HER CLOTHES FIT HER CURRENT SIZE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer close shrink and she gets dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need a better place to sit\". Jason makes a circular table and 4 chairs appear. Lily picks up Heather and places her on the table as they sit down. They all stare at her, still a bit shocked that it actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily can't contain her curiosity anymore. \"Tell me! What's it like being so small?\". \"I don't really know. But I like it so far\". They talk for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason, could you make me that small too?\". Lily shyly asks. \"Fine, if that's what you want\", saying as he places the book on the table and opens it. He pauses, \"I'll make sure your clothes shrink with you\". He looks at Jackie, \"what about you? You want me to shrink you down too?\". With a sigh, \"what the hell, why not?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHRINK LILY AND JACKIE DOWN THE THE SIZE OF DOLLS ALONG WITH THEIR CLOTHES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same tingling sensation rushes through their bodies as they start to glow, just like Heather did. The only difference was that their clothes shrank with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather runs up to them as both her and Lily are strangely excited by this. Jackie, however, just looked herself over. \"Why did I do this? Well now what?\", saying this as she looks up at the giant Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot certain of what to do, he just shrugs. His stomach suddenly growls. He had completely forgotten that he was hungry. \"I wonder\", he says, getting ready to write in it again. \"What are you doing Jason?\". Lily asks, noticing he was going to write something. \"Huh? Oh, I'm hungry, so I was going to see if the book could get me some food\". \"Can you make enough for the rest of us? We were just about to get something before you came in\". \"Fine. Come over here though, I'm going to make it appear on the table and don't want you 3 caught up in it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey move over and sit down next to his arm. The air around the table starts to glow and is filled with small balls of light as all kinds of food appears. From fruit to sandwiches to cakes, there was more than enough for the 4 of them. He had also made a normal sized plate and silverware, along with 3 smaller sets for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girls pick up their plates and start to walk amongst the towering food. \"Amazing! I've never seen so much food!\". They spend the next half hour taking their time exploring the giant food and eventually eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith full stomachs. They lay down on the table and Jason has the food vanish. \"That was so much fun!\", Lily says with a sigh. \"What should we do next? I could change you 3 back, or maybe you girls want to stay that small for a little while\".</span></div></div>",

Jason gets an idea. \"I got it. How about swimsuits?\". \"I guess that's fine... yes, it'll work\", Jackie says. \"I'll turn around, but I need you 3 to undress\". \"What!?\", the 3 of them says, surprised. \"I'm going to have them appear on you girls. You don't want the clothes your wearing to tear?\". \"Your right, but don't peek!\". They start to strip and he turns around. They tell him their ready and he starts to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAVE SWIMSUITS APPEAR ON LILY, JACKIE, AND HEATHER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly their torsos start to glow as Lily gets a green one piece swimsuit, Jackie gets a blue bikini, and Heather gets a white bikini.

He looks down at her, \"you want to clean up, and I think I just though of something you girls will like\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table itself starts to glow. A large section of the table, starting from the middle, changes to a clear white color. The edges suddenly start to rise out of the table. He had made a large section of the table transform into a giant aquarium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girls examine the massive tank. \"Whoa. We're going in there?\", Heather asks, looking at hem. \"Yep, I figured it would be both safer and easier if we use something like this\". \"That's true, not a bad idea\", Jackie says. The tank is already filled up. He had also made some ladders appear on the sides and a diving board on one of the sides of the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the ladders, and a little help from Jason, the 3 girls enter the water. \"If you need anything, just ask\", Jason says, watching them swim around.

This is fun!\". \"You know what, I think I will\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the book, and writes not just to shrink him down in a swimming suit, but gives himself a few surprises for later.</span></div></div>",

You are now the Master since the previous master-owner has ceased being human, and within a couple more hours shall be then a buck goat, thinking he was always a buck goat. Ah, ignorance is bliss, similar to your present day understanding of the general public about political affairs, government information leaks, and worse a foolhardy government fighting each the other while the world smolders, ready to blow up in the face of all free people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf, you authorize then that Jason continues his lifetime being a buck goat, the ownership and Master status is yours to enjoy. You being still as mostly human and in parts a doe goat, allows you to retain Master status. Yet, let your animal physique arouse in you your animal lusts, being a Satyr female could progress your goat self to where you become more a doe goat than human, you would lose any and all control of the Book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fair example of what I mean when speaking of animal lusts taking control of a satyr female, note there Lily as she has allowed Jason to mount her. See how his male member he works it, thrusting, sliding in and out of her vagina. He is huffing as he thrusts, and Lily, her eyes bugged wide, is about to have her orgasm, they each know from their feelings that Jason is about to mate with her sexually. Buck goats tend to spit out small droppings when excited, as is Jason acting like a real-born buck goat!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may do her thrill with him two times and not feel any ill affects. However, if she were to let Jason mate her a third time, she shall begin her transition from satyr female to becoming as then a doe goat. A second such transforming by here shall make her physical animal form as quite a permanent feature, she doomed then to remain as is, being a nanny goat used for breeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do as is Jackie there, she fingering deeply inside her vaginal passage, is arousing her body to having an orgasmic response. Satyr female masturbating is equally dangerous, and can have a similar response transition ending her being satyr self to become a doe goat. Instruct Jackie to limit her sexual delights to male humans and then never to do the same man three times, or her form shall begin changing toward her being more goat her bodily form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI award you my respect for not following the ways of your satyr sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering human and goat mentalities working together, the very likelihood of Lily and Jackie regaining their human bodies as women in not a good prospect. History is quite bland as to recorded stories of what you say is yourself, a Satyress, as nearly all let sex rule their bodies and changed them permanently to being as doe goats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWagering wise, what Jason did to your sisters and you by extending the elapsed time you were to remain as satyr females, equals 2000 to 1 chances of ever being completely again as a human female.\"</span></b> The Book spirit as much said, it warning the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"><b>\"Wow</b>,\"</span>said Heather, as it was about then that Lily screamed when Jason spewed his first might load of goat semen into a horny Satyress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cplum\">\"Was it worth the experience,\"</span></b> Heather asked of Lily, to which she while having Jason still inside her body, he thrusting for round two, she nodded her head, eyes closed, and wanting of her buck friend to do it all again.

I am not without the same sensual seeking desires that you feel and were until a moment ago, were delving into, causing soon enough your becoming wholly as goat animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the worst of this is that we who are as female satyrs, if we slack from lusts and sexual fornicating, we can resume being our real selves in a week for today. Jason has gone too far into being what he wished in his wet dream to become, and maybe it is best for us that we take him and leave him to live at and mingle with the Killingsworth farm goat herd.\"</span></b> Heather siad and first Jackie agreed, as did then Lily agree, she looking down at Jason the buck goat doing his best job of licking his mate clean of his sticky residue.</span></div></div>",

Its lucky for us that the Book I am lugging with me has with it the written desire by Jason to limit our being as animal-Satyress for little more time than a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember dear Lilith girl, your desire to arouse men for wanting you and their sexual mating with you a Satyress, you did not spellbind either Json or now too Bob, but you have cursed them to become as being beastly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason does not care to listen to us and what he tell him he should do as try to keep in mind, he is almost as much a dumb beast as he is a common farm animal and goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was that touching display of you rushing to French kissing of inquisitive friend Bob. You aroused him by pushing both your fuzzy hands down the front of his pants and caressing, fondling his manliness; and all the while poisoning him by an exchange of oral fluids with that eager long tongue of a Satyress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Bob arrives to his parents home, his grown fur goatee beard shall have begun the sprouting spread of growing goat-like body fur over his entire body. His one time pleasured kiss from you a damning Satyress was enough to cause his being physically bewitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't now shake your head as if to deny what I have said Lily. The Book does-did inform me, we are mentally in continuous contact now that I have become as its Master and the owner. Although Bob will cut off and shave his bearded chin before going to bed, he shall have dreams of you and what he was kissed by, enjoying wispy scenes of you with him fornicating. His dreams will add inspiration to you infection of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Book Spirit tells me how Bob shall come the morning when he awakens, his face, from forehead to chin, cheeks and ears too shall have grown on him the fur like a goat being the same color as his human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you listening to me, Lily what are you doing? Do you know what your doing right now? As we are walking you have your right hand finger fondling your right breast titty nipple and using your left hand to finger-thrusting up inside your sloppy-wet goat puss. I can hear your fingers making wet suction sounds, beware dear, as you are arousing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we get closer to the farm and the scent of goats becomes a hefty smell, it will be you dear Lilith who shall race then Jason to the goat pasture gate. As then, when I open the gate will you enter and begin to mingle, while your wet pussy will be wafting a spicey scent for some horny buck to mount, mate, and cause you your increased change from a female satyr, to becoming more as is a doe goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you delight becoming a doe goat, you constantly horny, losing your mental identity of self, as then be but a four-legged farm animal? None of such is my wish for becoming as common sexual fodder for any a buck goat to mount, mate, and breed me pregnant. I want more than that, as I want a man who smells good, and not like goat piss and goat manure!       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook there, now Jason has noticed your state of arousal and he is sniffing and wanting to lick at your sloppy wet puss.\" Jackie said, she arguing with Lily, trying to coax and keep her thinking, remembering, and wanting to again be a human female.</span></div></div>",

Lily and Jackie standing half again taller than did Jason, their eyes or pupils remained rounded, able to focus, allowed them to see things at a distance. There ahead, as in the early hours of a new morning the girls saw the red barns of the Killingsworth family farm. The numbers of security lights placed around the farm buildings tended to shower the property with a golden glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie knew John killingsworth junior quite well, they had dated several times, but though they were good friends, John held a close friendship with his near neighbor friend Jared. Jared and John were known for their being adventurous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jared who became a missing person for more than a year, and never did offer his reasons for running away from home.

As Lily failed to offer any response of a verbal answer, Jackie felt sure her friend was deciding to become a doe goat, if just for the freedom of having lots of sex from horny males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the red barns of what might be home for Jason and Lily loomed so large there at the farm, Jackie had a thought. She sat down on the green grass, folding her legs Indian style, as she laid open the Book across her furry lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie began paging through the Book while she spoke, asking then the Book's spirit a question it might know of a way to answer. <b><span class=\"cplum\">\"I have a friend, he being the son of the owner to this farm. He had a friend by the name of Jared who disappeared for a year, going to where nobody knew where, I wish to know as what happened?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"My Master Mistress, you need not write your question in the book, as I can offer the answer to your wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis young man named Jared, when he was but in his early teenage years did discover a lucky silver pony size horse shoe he found hidden by the road sand beside the highway out front  of this very farm. The silver shoe had a brand of luck similar to this Book and its having a guiding spirit. The word luck comes with varied meanings, as what is lucky to the ideas of an individual is anything but lucky to the delights of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared was impetuous, he residing there at his farther's farm, where were bred draft horses used for sale to bolster the family earnings. Jared came home late one afternoon and herd his name as called by an angry parent, warning him he was in trouble for being late for dinner. He wanted to hide, but got caught and was sent to bed early and without his supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger was a common thing about that household, and Jared laid awake to very late, he lying on his bed, did grumble about how his parents treated him. It so happened that during the night Jared awoke from his slumbering, he hearing there in his bedroom a low tone humming sound. As he sat up and began looking around for what was making the annoying sound, he saw the silver show lying on his dresser, it glowing and humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared got off his bed and retrieved his found treasure. As he held it the thing hummed and vibrated, because it knew there was a question in the mind of its newest owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdventures and storybook fantasies were much of what Jared liked to think were, or could be as real. He having read many myths, and being angry what made him feel then horny, he rubbing his pretty penis with a hand, as his other hand held the silver pony shoe. He verbally voiced a foolish wish, having recently watched on television the motion picture titled as <b>\"Atlantis the Lost Continent.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a special effects scene, Jared watched as a scientist type man, did his work for transforming a young man to facially resemble a young bull. He then hypnotised the youth to drink poison, the brew causing then the youth to change and become strong, strong, as stronger until he became a bull animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared often fantasized about that scene, he thinking that the body and lifestyle of a sex-beast bull would be great fun. He did then speak his mind making a wish what the magical silver pony shoe accepted as a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jared laid there on his bed, during that warm, humid, summer night, he felt the waves of physical change engulfing his body. During an hour of real time, Jared the human became as Jared the Black-Angus yearling bull animal. As much he looked like a born black fur Angus breed yearling size bull, his human mind and intellect remained alive and aware of his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny like a young bull animal, Jared made a mess of his bedroom, he masturbating, spewed forth puddles of spent semen onto the hardwood parquet bedroom floor. His cloven hooves made such a clattering sound, he awoke his father who came to find in his son's bedroom a yearling bull ambling about as if struggling to find some manner of escaping that very room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the father opened the bedroom door, Jared the bull scrambled past his dad, ran along the upstairs hallway, down then the carpeted stairs to the living room, ran through the kitchen, as due to his muscular bulk bull body self he busted the rear service door and ran off into the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared forgot his magical pony shoe, it laid then on his bed, acting like a lucky trinket. The newly formed young bull ran toward where his best friend lived, that being John at the Killingsworth farm/ranch. He failed to get to and meet his friend, but was wrangled into a cattle pasture and there he mingled with real born cows. Jared was a yearling bull, he mingling joined the herd, and ate his way to be a herd-sire mature bull.\" </span>The Book Spirit so told Jackie her answer to an old bothersome question.</span></div></div>",

The house is mostly on one upper level while the basement is in part as a two car garage and a third of that lower level was a family entertainment, plus exercising room, as well another room was the bedroom used by Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob chased down the stair step to his bedroom, where there he removed all his clothes, his shoes, socks and underwear. When he had gotten fully naked, Bob walked with a stately manner out from his bedroom, as along the hallway leading to the stairs. He felt excited about the prospect of being left home alone for a couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still bothered by meeting Lily and Jackie wandering the back road, they wearing some horny goat costumes, and dragging with them a goat almost the size of a pony. As he topped the stairs his nose caught the smell of his mother's flowering plants she kept on a five level metal stand, it set near to the house front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob stopped and leaning over forward he did sniff at the plants.

He thought his pronunciation of the two words and all a mess, but after three good chews, he swallowed, and then realized he for some weird reason had just bitten off and chewing, ate his Mother's houseplants as if they were food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck, Bob you are going nuts, what is wrong with you?\" Bob said, as talking to himself with utter disbelief that he had for some odd reason eaten his mother's houseplants and flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking then toward the main level bathroom with the shower stall, Bob was about to flick on the hallway light switch as he had the thought of seeing Lilly in her sexy, goaty, costume. \"Damn it, but those girls looked as horny as they made me feel. Ha, if it was all real, I would love to be for them as a randy, horny, satyr too, and have them stay here with me for two days of wild sex and an orgy!\" Bob said, as he continued then walking the hallway, he stock naked but not feeling in the least as being cold.</span></div></div>",

As he withdrew his hand and arm there seemed something that was a bother, but he could not decide as to what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shower stall filled with steam and the steam brought on to Bob a chilled sensation, he felt the need to urinate before entering the shower stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom mirrors were by then a murky fogged over drippy mess, so Bob did not see or notice how we was looking very different. He knowing that he was naked, did turn to face the toilet bowl, as nipped two fingers to holding the base of his penis, he had thought it as aimed down into the bowl. Yet, and to his surprise, Bob noticed his urine shooting upward, it arching forward, splashing on the wall above and as behind the toilet reservoir tank.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stupid,\" Bob yelled as to his mistaken aim, his stinking urine splattering on and trailing down the bathroom wall to puddle on the floor. That was when Bob really took a noticed look as to his maleness. He remembered then about how after having met and kissed queer looking Lily, he had grown a burly thick goatee, Bob noted how his penis had so changed, it equally queer, like Lily and Jackie were odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld between his meaty big fingers hung an arching forward penis the size girth of his penis, but having a length of some 12 to 16 inches. Odd and as weird was that the circumcision done to him just after his birth had somehow changed, his penis head being then wholly uncircumcised, was the shape of an upside down Acorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color of his longer and very different penis body was then a deep reddish-brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther physical examination to his maleness as he saw his testes being enlarged, they similar of size to a pair of fuzzy Avocado fruits. Suddenly Bob felt extra horny, his hands encircling his much elongated beastly shaped cock, and he began stroking his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, more please more I want to become furry, goaty, if then to please Lily or Jackie!\" Bob said, he moaning as his hands stroked the new length of his highly sensual changed penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob stood there with his eyes closed he enthused as he was masturbating his maleness. A minute later and Bob groaned, he feeling his bigger fuzzy balls ache as from them roared along, as out the open round hole of his cock came a literal river of semen. His semen shooting not at the wall, or into the toilet, it spewed into the bathroom sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, ahh, ahh, oh wow,\" Bob moaning and groaning did so say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob looking down noticed the bathroom sink bowl was almost filled to half-full from the wealth of his ejaculated semen. He felt oddly proud of his sexual accomplishment, and laughed as he continued to stroking, milk the last dribbles of semen from out his very erect cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in his mind made Bob want then to sniff at as then licking, lap at the bowl partially filled with semen. One quick lick went on to a long tonguing lapping up of the spent semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goats, goats, goats, my penis is now that like a buck goat!\" Bob remarking did say, he turning and walking, stepped up as into the showering stall. A quick remembered urgent change to the shower water temperature, he turned his back toward the showering water flow, and stood there enjoying then the warming feeling to his body. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nReaching for his favored golden colored Glycerin soap, Bob began working up a lather what coated his body in suds. As his fingers worked like large combs to lathering his body, he slowly began to take note that his smooth skin was covered with a grown layer of thick fur. He continued raking his fingers through the wet and soaped fur, while letting the showerhead pour soft feeling sprinkles of water to clean his furry self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob began to feel extremely relaxed and sitting back he sat down on the shower stall corner seat, letting the showering water pour down, it drenching his furry self with warmth and comfort.</span></div></div>",

Bob gazed downward, seeing what he had seen go so wrong, being so aroused, and spewing out more semen from his male self as to nearly fill the bathroom sink to halfway full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur, thick fur was grown on his arms, across his shoulders, as down the length of his torso, enveloping his groin, buttocks, thighs, and legs. He reached a hand down to touch of and feel at what were his heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heels were the real crux to a building suspicion as to what Bob was, was not his true persona. The mere touching of both hands to what were human heels added to the idea that his person, his body was changing. As what he felt of had changed, his heels were hocks, the hind joints to not human legs, but as part to Jack type animal legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hands slid down along what he knew were not human feet, when they met with fetlock joints and then not human toes, he let out a sad sort of moaning sound. His hands then cupped over and finger tips sliding under what he could not see but knew were cloven hoofs. The feelings of furred legs, hind hocks, narrowed feet, and his having grown cloven hooves was enough to remind Bob of his seeing Lily and what she did, her French kiss, she had infected his body with some weird disease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly did Bob reach up and over his shoulder to behind him as with his hand he shut off the flow of warm showering water. He withdrew his hand and arm to then hang down alone his side, letting the water soaked fur let drip away the pent water from his furry self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an hour was but several minutes, Bob very slowly rose to a standing position. As he looked then over the shower door glass, he realized he had grown taller. His legs being Jack type and from his feet growing longer, by standing on hooves Bob realized more as to how he had and was still changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bob pushed open the shower door, he had need to duck his head low to step past the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first real stepped stride using Jack type legs and walking on cloven hooves came the a sudden realization. Hoofs walking on shiny smooth bathroom tile floor did not have firm footing, but were very slippery, making an unsteady feeling Robert, to slip and nearly fall face down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops...,\" yelled Robert, he grabbing hold to the bathroom countertop, his strong fingers latching at the sink-bowl edge to help steady again his stance. It was from there that Bob first saw what his face looked like after the host of bodily changes he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top 3/4 of the bathroom mirror was fogged over from shower-water steam. The lower 1/4 of the mirror had remained clear of condensed steam, allowing a kneeling then Bob to look at his reflected face in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow,\" Robert said as he saw his fuzzy to furred face there in the bathroom mirror. The then grabbing of a bathroom hand towel hung beside the sink on the wall there, Bob grabbed and used to wipe clean the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily, what in heaven did you do to me,\" Bob exclaimed, as for the first time he saw what he had become due to having his tongue tickled by the tongue of Lily. There, looking back at Robert was not the young athletic male human he was just the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the mirror stood the reflection of a furry creature, it part goat from the navel and down to those cloven hooves, as from above the navel he, Bob his body was furry like a goat. His face, the nose and his mouth had merged making a short muzzle. Bob reached up both of his hands to touch and feel at hois changed ears. What were his ears protruded horizontally out from his head, they being fuzzy to furry, and came to a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob moved his hands to begin feeling about what had become his face. His hearing had improved, but his eyesight was a fixed focus making him nearsighted. Everything behind Bob, that was ten feet away or more had become a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaning, said, \"God help me!\" His ability to speak quite clearly surprised Bob. His mouth and lips having become similar to that of a goat suggested to his mindset that he should be slurring his words. As Bob then tried to grin a smile at his reflection, he saw how his teeth had re-aligned. He had changed oral wise, his teeth he had for most of his lifetime kept them spotlessly cleaned, brushing them three times each day. As such his teeth then had a gap between the front biting incisors and the rear chewing moulders. He opening his mouth as wide as then possible stuck out his tongue to better view how his teeth had aligned. Bob noted then his tongue was narrowed to better fit his changed mouth, and had grown longer, being somewhat pointed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bob stood there studying his changed facial features, he drew a deep inhaled breath. His hands sprang up, as each went to touch the twin black points of goat horns protruding past the thick fur gracing his head. He touching the horns and pinching them between ever stronger fingers, he tried to wiggle them but found hem as firmly rooted to his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a satyr...,\" Bob said, as then he changed his attitude to decide, \"No, not a satyr, too much fur!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not deny there was a growing sense of lust for want of sexual delights, and added a horny feeling, Bob wanting to masturbate his changed, bigger, longer, extra sensual buck-goat cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob knew what was happening, his changing species, and knew nothing as to why he was changing or how to stop it. The word \"Irreversible\" bothered him, as Bob feared his becoming more like a beast, an animal, a male goat. He knew his bodily changes would not stop, and his deep seeded want for masturbating, might well cause his body to change more, even at a quicker rate, his situation seemed as hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started again his hands at stroking the length of his goaty size cock. Masturbating came on quick from the sensation of fuzzy hands stroking the highly sensual goat cock skin. His big Avocado size testes began to churn, driving him to lust, and in turn bringing on the want for some relief, he wishing that either Jackie or especially Lily were there to offer him some added satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands flying back and forth, out the end as down the length of his goat cock, Bob groaning, he moaning, cried aloud, \"God, oh God I am damned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost then to the point of spewing his load, pre dribbling out the round hole of his cock, Bob began to yell, \"Please God, I want to become more like a goat! <br>\r\nGod please, let me become a beast, a male goat, to enjoy then my sexuality!<br>\r\nOh, ah, oh, oh yes, thank you, thank you...!\" Bob cried as from his cock spurt such a stream of semen, the volume and density he had never in his lifetime seen, or imagined he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis masturbating seemed to relieve his anxious desire for wanting Lily. He swooned as his feeling spent felt ever so nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spewing semen trailed off to just a dribbling that well known feeling began anew, arousing his goaty cock to being rock hard. Bob moaned as his level of wanton lust reoccurred, this time doubling, becoming more a pain in his big balls. His need made Bob groan and weep tears as his guts began to know the changes of him becoming a bovine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the gut pains subsided, Bob was working his cock again into the fifth ejaculating thrill. His arms were showing change to being soon as forelegs, wrists changing to knees, hands and fingers slowly configuring until one at a time merged, changed, and became as cloven hoofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the afternoon of his first full day of being left alone at home, and Robert had lost his physical connection to being a member of his family, the one son of his loving parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upstairs bathroom was an ungodly mess of spewed semen and unnoticed goat turds lying everywhere about the floor. Bob wanted to find Lily, or Jackie, he felt a dire need to breed, mating like a buck goat, sex and his cock were the driving forces then in his life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For as much of what remained as remembering who he was, Bob held a great respect for his parents and never wished to be a disappointment to them, even in his present physical state. The one place where he had made a real mess was the bathroom, the mirror there and the sink, it by then was half full of congealing semen and the clearer separated volume of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn as much he did not want his dear mother returning home to find her primary lavatory and toilet coated in goat semen and drooled goat saliva. Although his hands had merged already, the wrists and metacarpal bones became as fetlocks, while what were his fingers were small ovals of dark colored keratin, being cloven hoofs. He was by then a fully form ungulate, a four legged male goat with an overactive set of hormone producing glands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was worried about what his mother would find, and he had but one idea as how best to clean up his mighty mess, he would lick it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob began his duty by licking at the almost dried as crustated globs of his spent semen lying between the shower stall door and the toilet bowl. He had the will power and luckily the time enough to do the job of tongue mopping the bathroom tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four hours of tongue work the floor and even the grout between the tiles was licked clean as how mother had left it when his parents went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difficult mouth and lip grab at the flush handle of the toilet finally let flow what was floating in the bowl water to go down the drain. This move had an additional use, it offered a hearty buck goat a place to get a mouth refreshing drink to help swallow his tummy full of crusty to milky ejaculated semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs from his different height and stance, Bob gawked up at a bathroom mirror as equally plastered with drying spurts of his more goaty semen, The goat semen had a yellow cast coloration, and was a bit more starch in it what made his semen stick to where it got spewed. He would be the first to admit that goat semen tasted rather bland ad unlike what he was told by some of his gay friends, some semen flavors were quite salty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe needed nuzzling of his goat muzzle to the toilet seat lid got it to flop down to where he could leap up on it, and make then the easier jump to where he could stand on the counter top around the sink and in front of the caked mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bob saw the mess he had made of the counter top, it was a gooey as more than the bathroom floor. He began again his task of licking clean the semen from off the counter, as this took him the better of three hours of licking, swallowing, and regurgitate to chew his semen glob-cud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished lickng the end and corners of the counter top clean Bob happen to gaze at the sink and its plentiful volume of pre and semen. A stepping down with both forelegs into the semen slime filled sink, and Bob began to slurp-drink the upper thin layer of goat pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes of nearly constant drinking made Bob have a need to urinate, but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where he stood the best place to let go his bladder was in the shower stall and his rear quarters centered over the shower stall drain. It might have worked to his success if not for the fact his maleness and moved, his sheath adjacent to being hung just below his navel. The urination did not for a goat require the arousal or the erecting of his pencil size, foot long male member to come out from its furry home. As the flow began, Bob peering down saw his stream as splattering about the tile floor where he had his fore-hoofs standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome grumbled groans and bleats about summed up the disdain from that situation. That business done, and Bob did a goat leap out the shower stall and up on the toilet bowl lid, as next to the counter top, only to see a sink bowl being 1/3 filled with congealing goat semen for him to eat and ingest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurp, bite, chew and swallow, the thickened goat semen Bob ate, until he needed to lick the bowl clean. As again his guts and what all they held were feeling full or about to start backing up for a second cud chewing delight. Where to go, as this time there as a greater need for more space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping down from the counter top to the toilet bowl lid, to the tile floor and Bob almost lost his loads. He ran from the bathroom at a fast trot, as through the house to the kitchen door, where he stopped by the screen door leading to the garage and from there out the service door to the back lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis problem was that if he went out, the screen door would close and effectively lock him outside the house with still the bathroom mirror to get licked clean. The doggy water bowl for the house pet Sally the Siberian Bob made use of and using his lips and front teeth, he wangled the dog bowl between the screen door and the door jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog bowl in place and Bob stopped, he wondering as to where was Sally, she being a canine and him a bovine, they might not know or like either of what they were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob made his wild dash to the back lawn and there relieved the problem of his bloated gut. That job done and Bob returned to the house, going through the blocked open screen door and then at a fast trot again he raced to the bathroom, with plans of finishing his duties by cleaning the caked mirror.</span></div></div>",

He felt no need of worry about how he could live if suck in that new self, as being a herbivore the area, the region, that state, there was an abundance for a goat to forage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe marvelled some at how much of his mentality and learned intellect had remained being part of him, considering the much decreased size of his brain. As well was that sense of determination that was a family traite, going along with the old slogan, \"A job worth doing is worth doing it well!\" His job was the cleaning then of the bathroom where he had succumbed to his changing. The job at hand was nothing to boast of later about because of nastiness, but did not want his mother to need deal with what he done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob in his mind did chuckle because of his finding the becoming a goat was seemingly so natural, as he felt no drastic loss from ceasing being as human. As he re-entered the house with his plan to finish his job he had to step over the dog bowl he used to hold open the screen door their by the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, she the homebound pet was a fourteen year old Siberian dog, and friendly to everyone, even to people coming there to visit. Yet Bob tended to fear her, she being by nature a carnivore and he then being as such an animal as his physical self, if when she would see him, would she know him as her master or as a lunch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDogs and especially old dogs like was Sally slept the day away as if she were again her puppy self, sleeping 10 to 18 hours during any a day and night. Even as Bob trotted across the kitchen linoleum floor walking on hard hooves, the drumming sounds of his large weighty goat bodily seemed enough to awaken a sleeping dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bob entered then the dining room the floor there and the hallway leading to the bathroom and bedrooms was nicely softer, as covered with carpet what dulled all sounds made by his hooves. Bob stopped for a moment to look around there in the house, as he felt somewhat sad for needing to take leave of the warm and friendly family home and household. Although he had almost fully accepted the fact he was a hearty male goat as his physical self, Bob realized well that his delights from becoming  as an animal and male goat was due to the aspirations he felt for wanting of sexual gratifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf goats could or would ever feeling the want to sigh, but Bob stood there and sighed before returning to his plan and duty to clean as best he could the bathroom mirror from all what he had ejaculated at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo real need though to hurry since his parents were not scheduled to return again to home for two more days, as Bob strode slowly toward the bathroom. As he came closer to the bathroom door, he found it as closed, and he knew that in his urgent rush to exit the house he did not think it a necessity to close it even partway as closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Bob strode close to the partially ajar bathroom door, he feeling the need to being cautious. As he did quietly nudge the door open enough for him to poke his goat head to where he could see into the bathroom, he heard the huffing breaths of Sally doing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering ever so quietly Bob  looked in as about the bathroom. As to his surprise he saw that big mama dog doing her best at lick cleaning the mirror from the salty flavored slime. Sally was acting like a female dog cleaning her den, as the scent of the semen had drawn her there, and she knowing what should or was allowed there by her masters, she took to doing the needed cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob knew from past times when something got spilled on the floor that Sally came and was diligent to her task of cleaning the family den. As he stood there gawking up at Sally standing on the bathroom countertop, she was just about finished with lick-cleaning of the splattered mirror. In that moment of appreciation by Bob of and for Sally doing her best for him, a silly fool turned into a goat thought to commend his pet with him saying \"Good dog there Sally.\" Bob forgot for that surprising moment that he was not human and or instead of him speaking words of praise, he bleated like would a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of a goat bleating his appreciation, Sally the canine whirled around from her work of love to see there an invader to the family home. She returned the bleating with her own big as alarmed \"Woofs,\" and leaped from off the countertop as to attack and subdue or kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob bolted backwards to get his head from outside the bathroom and he wheeling on nimble legs and cloven hoofs he did take to run along the hallway and heading toward the kitchen as planning to go out the service door and escape a fight. He stopped when he heard the bathroom door as slammed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" bleating did Bob stop and say, as Sally would never think to close any door she passed. What he did hear was a frantic dog, his Sally, as caught, held captive, she stuck behind the bathroom door. Bob turned again to walk cautiously along the hallway and then right up to facing the firmly closed and latched bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob bleated his kindly thoughts to his dear old pet standing and barking at the opposite side of the door. As the barking and dog-paw scratching at the door intensified from Sally hearing Bob bleating, he realised what in his saving favor must have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally in her aged bulk self was often clumsy and when she leaped from off the counter top with thought to attack ad defend her domain from a strange intruder, she unexpectedly did body slam the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Bob the companion of Sally felt a concern that she was trapped, and with his parents expecting him to be there as tending to her daily needs, she then stuck inside the bathroom had nothing worthwhile to eat, although she could and often did get a drink from the toilet bowl. Then Bob bleated, he wishing to tell Sally she would be as OK, but the sounds made by a goat were as foreign to her as it was to Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleat bleat,\" Bob cried, he recalling that he had closed the toilet bowl lid to use its tops to climb the distance for him to stand on the countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Bob remembered his having seen Sally finding her extra water source as closed, lid down, she would nose it up and get her desired drink. Bob with that thought had him satisfied for Sally as she could exist until his parents returned home on Monday. Bob knowing he was a goat and of the mess he made in the bathroom when changing, the mess his parents would find from Sally being stuck captive in the bathroom for two days and nights would cover his tracks, they, his parents might never know what became of their son! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his job as satisfied, Bob turned his furry flat butt toward the bathroom experience and he happily trotting, left the family dwelling for the wilds of rural America.</span></div></div>",

Bob knew what it is to become a animal, he a goat, and from his sexual transforming experience, his sexuality was what he treasured most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrancing along and not paying close attention to what or who was nearby, Bob was thinking more about if he stayed as he was, as where he could go to live a safe lifestyle. He wanted to find as join a goat ranch and there utilize his new and sensually sensitive maleness, knowing as to the sheer volume of semen his big balls could produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob felt relieved from the burdens of being human, was becoming elated about being a buck goat, imagining as well of how it would feel with his cock sheath deep inside a horny doe goat. In his dreamy excited state he would as thoughts turned to sex and mating made him bleat for his excitement. He was too much inside himself and never noticed that his shrill bleating sounds might well be heard by other dogs, and those being loose, able to lay chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was more than a mile from what he knew as home when the scent of freshly cut grass, cut by a lawn mowing machine did tickle his nose. The smell aroused in him a sense of appetite, and green grass was a real allurement to a goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping along with renewed haste to find as begin munching on the fresh cut lawn, Bob found himself not thinking so much, but reacting as to instinct. As from some sort of knowing, Bob began to compare his having human intelligence and instinct like that in animals, and he wondered which mentality would win over him to live then being a buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne limitation was his physical height, making things set at a distance as hard to see, he with his rectangle shaped pupils saw things from being nearsighted.

As Bob got closer to where came that lovely smell of cut grasses, he saw and then recognized the fellow mowing the lawn, he being a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob became excited by seeing a friend and he began running, he bleating, looking and sounding like a wild, crazy goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale Bales heard the sounds of a bleating animal even over the usual noise made by the hand-mower. He stopped his mowing as saw coming toward him a large goat. He only knew it was an animal and being a goat had horns, as could possibly do him an injury, so he stopped the mower and turned around, he ran for the safety of his parents house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgreen\">\"Dale, Dale,\"</span></i> was what Bob seeing his friend thought he was saying, but being a goat he was in fact bleating cries as if he were crazy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dale had no way of understanding what the goat seemed intent upon seemingly wanting from him, Dale did not own any animals, no pets, not even a goldfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, get,\" Dale yelled at the excited goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob wanted Dale to know that the goat he was, was a friend, pal, buddy, and wished for someone to learn what had happened to him. So he ceased his excited bleating cries and first sat down on his furred flat butt, looking up at Dale, as Bob did his best to try and offer a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe then very calm acting goat worked to lure Dale to step outside the house and he then to sit on the front steps, as reached his right hand to try and give a petting of the goat's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob did nothing to stop his friend from trying to pet him like he was a dog. He lowered his muzzle and offered a different angle for Dale to do his petting, as he felt at and fingering, fondled with the two black as ribbed hard goat horns what were sprouted from the peak of his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from?\" Dale asked, he speaking with a soft tone as trying to quell and comfort the almost pony size buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head petting and some soft as friendly words was doing something to Bob, he feeling a great want to tell his friend of who he was coupled with the sensations of his being petted. Slowly the sensations grew to stirring a coming arousal, as it was Bob feeling his goat cock stirring, while Dale, from where he sat, notice the pointed, pink colored head of a goat cock emerging from the furred sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings piled on top of animalistic sensations driving Bob to grow a full-on erection of his buck goat cock, the thing having extended out some sixteen inches, as it stood rigid, and beginning to dribble some pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale sat there watching the goat getting its erection, as he with wide eyes felt allured to touch the cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you got there big boy?\" Dale said, as Bob knew what his friend might do, as he did, Dale reached a hand to touch and stroke the stiff male member of this large goat. At the same time Dale noted the large size of the scrotum setting between the seated hind legs and with his other hand he reached down to touch them, as feel the weightiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale was leaning forward to reach his hands to touching the erect cock and big furred balls of the horny goat, when Bob being mostly an animal saw his chance to bring Dale into his herd. A sudden leap by Bob and from the manner Dale was sitting, as the goat jumped up, as leaped forward, he drove the pointed end of his cock in past the lips on Dale's face, pushing the length of cock as into his friend's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leap and sudden wet warmth of a mouth felt similar to what Bob recalled from his having kissed Lily, and of what he hoped for, as expected was the sensation of mating with a doe goat, he immediately ejaculated a healthy big load of infecting semen into his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dale found himself with his face jammed into the furry groin of the large goat. He had the cock of the goat both in his mouth and tickling the uvula in the far back of his mouth. The hot spew of goat semen shooting down his throat was as much a weird thing as it was a discomfort, he choking to swallow the creamy substance. Bob and Dale could feel the sensations coming from those big furred balls on Bob as they continued their pumping of more semen than Bob recalled he had done previously while in the bathroom at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale laid there as if stunned, his arms and hands grappling at trying to yank the big goat as off from how it had come to lay covering him, buried by the shaggy goat fur. As then the streams of goat semen slowed to a trickle, Bob rose up to standing with his goat torso stretched long. He had his hind legs lengthened to where even with his forelegs standing upright, held his erect cock shoved into the mouth of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob rolled his head to the left to better cast a yellow eye to gawk down at his infected friend. What he saw was a friend lying there with eyes wide and goat semen tribbling out the corners of his mouth. \"Baa,\" Bob bleated his greeting to a friend who like Bob, would within twenty-four hours be just like what became of Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as Bob did what he had done to Dale down deep in his thoughts he knew it to being the wrong thing to do to a good friend, but he wanted companionship. Bob having become an animal, a herbivore, a goat, he felt a sense of great fear from all around him. His beast instincts spoke to him, reminding Bob, there was safety and strength by adding numbers and the creating of a herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob told Dale about the lurid nighttime meeting of seeing Jackie and Lily as they were walking a big buck goat along Hanson Road. He told too, of him seeing Lily first and then Jackie, the two of them being naked, both as female type satyrs. Bob mentioned of Lily and how she came close to him, her strange ability to mesmerize him, she then French kissing him, did infect him, and during the hours later, he changed into being a large, as stout, sexy buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale was just as mesmerized as he sat there and listening to Bob bleating, gained a mutual understanding of what Bob wished to convey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You telling me then that from your semen I swallowed, that me and you, we will be as buck goats?\" Dale asked, as Bob stood there nodding his goat head to specify in the affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How soon, when will I be looking then like a brother to you?\" Dale asked of Bob, as Bob in their manner of communicating, he informed his friend he had but twenty-four hours, although his body was already showing early signs of his coming transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, where on me is the first signs of me becoming like you?\" Dale asked, he as much feeling and acting as nervous as he was infatuated at the fun fantasy of becoming an animal, even as being a buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd itchy sensation Dale felt about his chin had him reach up his right hand and scratch then the irritation, finding he had the sprouting hairs of a goatee beard forming below his chin. \"Oh wow, wow this is coming onto me really fast!\"</span></div></div>",

He figured that with the passing of time and from his animalistic lifestyle he would become mentally more as an animal, a goat and a buck goat; losing his ideals and values he knew when a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, Bob was beyond caring about the manner he would or could infect, degrade, and doom a friend to becoming as he was and then lose all. He was living then for as rank the sensations he with his furry, four legged self with a set of genitals that he let govern his lifestyle. Indeed, Bob thought mostly of how he could gain as sensual of male feelings from what he had become endowed with and as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was never when a person to stay by a friend while feeling pain, and Dale would very soon begin knowing that to change of body to become first like a satyr as then become all a buck goat came with varied levels of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob watched as Dale removed his clothes with want to seeing his fun fantasy come upon him, changing his body, making him a satyr. His growth of a goatee beard was but the easy beginning to how his body was to know change. His maleness was next, as from it and the testosterone released into his bloodstream that aided the coming transforming, the sensual drive for desire of even greater sensations drove a mind to accept as want to lose all for becoming in part as akin to a animal, in this case a buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob stood in the doorway to the bedroom where Dale ended up lying naked on his bed, he waiting for what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob turned then and wandered away, leaving Dale to his situation, as the goat in Bob was suggesting the want to go and graze outside the house, as on the green lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale did not pay any attention to what Bob was doing or that his infectious friend had walked on out from the house. As Dale laid there the tingling sensations from changing, growing testees was flooding his body with new and radical hormones, the kinds that bring change. After several wonderful minutes of growth and sensations, Dale reached both his hands to cup as hold onto his by then fuzzy with goat fur, changing balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs yet then unseen and not noticed had begun the changing of human skin into the thicker, soon tough hide like that of a goat. Where the skin had toughened there sprouted fur. First there were patches of fur, as on thighs, encircling the navel, and sprouting thickly along and covering over the spine, from tailbone to the base of the skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale was like most of whom were infected by creatures similar to what Bob had become, he took to lying and waiting for the beast to take and change its prey. Something what Dale did not expect began as his human male member did not grow longer, but seemed to dwindle of size and girth until it was literally sucked up inside his groin. His feeling, roving, fondling hands alerted Dale to the loss of his male member, making his wonder if Bob somehow was wanting his friend to become a doe goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about as the fears of changing and becoming a female, the ugly pains began asserting about his groin, moving up, entering the lower abdominal region. He began to groan from the pains he felt. Moaning, Dale began to cuss, as curse Bob for what he had inflicted upon a good friend. The worming feeling of some snake like thing wriggling under his skin, meandering through his gut, trailing a burning sensation from the groin and along the path the whatever was following-going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it struck as skin split, and blood seeped out from his body, as pierced skin ruptured, making a hole in his gut about two inches below his very furred navel. His two hands were there feeling where it hurt the worst. As the pains passed away the hole produced began to protrude with a tough feeling ring of flesh, it just as furry as was his lower belly area. Dale tried several times to rise to a sitting position but the level of pan tended to increase, so he remained lying stretched out flat on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong when the gut pain had subsided to a more tolerable level, Dale took to noticing the nerve shock pains happening at the base of his spine. He shoved under his lower back his right hand to begin feeling at what hurt the worst. What Dale discovered was he had the first few links to a sprouted, as growing tailbone, soon to become for him as his satyr-goaty tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization that he, Dale was growing a tail worked to re-enthuse him about his ultimately becoming a satyr as later then maybe a full of form buck goat like was Bob. He became all antsy and wiggling as he laid there on his bed. Maybe from his wiggling, moving a changing spine brought on fiery feeling pain spike raking down the spine, fanning out from it to engulf the whole torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs new pains ensued to agonized Dale, making him wonder if his becoming a satyr was to his delighted better, or as a curse he would need to live with, his roving hands gave him notice that his pelvic bone, with thighs were changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and panting his every breath taken, Dale relished the odd sensations as his legs were changing, conforming to be as Jack type animal hind legs. While the bones and joints were changing, so too was the sweeping growth of thick fur covering his thighs, and butt. He happened to get the feel of his by then fully grown goat tail and touching it, made the tail like to wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensations of change was working to enthuse Dale that as he laid on his bed he pushed down hard with his head, arching his back and forcing from his new belly mounted sheath what until then had set waiting for its time to begin an erection, the like of, and kind what Dale had longed to see, feel, and enjoy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jackie lifts up her right hand and points, \"your head! Something just appeared on your head!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather reaches up and feels 2 large half circle shapes on her head. The odd thing is that she can feel them, like they were attached to her! Lily hands her a mirror, they look like mouse ears. \"How did these get here?!\", and they start to panic. She suddenly feels, something just above her ass. It feels like something is trying to come out. Placing a hand back there, she can feel a bump, and it;s moving. It suddenly shoots out and expands, turning into a long slender tail. She screams, and they really start to freak out. She then feels a sudden shift, she sees her friends are shocked, again, as they get taller? She is shrinking, and her clothes eventually swallow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily and Jackie immediately go through the clothes and find their shrunken friend. Lily lifts up the scared, shaking, little mouse girl in the palms of her hands. \"Heather? Oh my god. What happened? Are you alright?\". She slowly looks up at her giant friend and nods, trying to keep herself covered at the same time. They take her over to Lily's bed and place her in the middle, both of them sitting down next to her, trying to comfort her. Lily manages to find a white handkerchief and gives it to Heather, who quickly covers herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

One of them is good though. The winning slot, whichever one of you lands on it, wins\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches up and pulls as hard as she can. It finally starts to slow down.....DOUBLE HEIGHT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! And theres the first one!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie: \"What does it mean?\". A similar sensation, just like what she felt when she shrank, hits her. \"A-again?\". Her body starts to expand and her previous height of about 3 inches increases to 6. \"Nnngghh.....t-that actually felt pretty good\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to head back to her seat, but Jason's hand comes from behind and grabs her. \"W-what are you doing?\", she says, as he lifts her up off of the bed. Saying, while examining her, \"it worked, I set it up so that I wouldn't need to use the book whenever one of you took a turn, heh, your like the perfect size right now\". He continues for another minute, with her squirming in his hand, before he puts her down by her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, she then looks over at Heather and then walks over to her smaller friend as if she was drawn to her. Heather: \"Is something wrong?\", she nervously asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiles, \"no\", grabs her and lifts her out of her desk. \"P-put me down!\", she pleads, as Jackie does the same thing to Heather that Jason just did to her. While playing with her, she says, \"I see why you did this, it's so much fun!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually releases Heather and walks over to her desk which had grown to match her new size; and the entire time, Lily just watched, unable to take her eyes off of what she just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather: \"I-I guess it's my turn\". She gets out of chair, still a little flustered, and spins the wheel.....</span></div></div>",

It was similar to what she felt when he had shrunk but she didn't feel it everywhere. The warmest spots were on her head and a small area of her lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a small moan. A strange look came over her face. Two new ears emerged from the top of her skull. They were vaguely triangular covered in a brown fur that matched her hair almost perfectly. The feeling in her tail bone ceased as she also grow an actual tail. The fur was the same color as her ears. It was a little over three feet long. It waved slightly behind and she turned her head to stare at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's hand came down and he stroked the tail with a single finger. Heather gasped in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's soft\" He said. He took his finger a way and barely heard Heather's small voice asking him not to stop. Jason smirked and shook his head. Heather blushed and walked back to her desk. Jackie took advantage of her increased size and reached over to give her ears a quick scratch. Heather shuddered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was right they are soft\" Jackie said. Lily walked over to the wheel to take her turn.

Karen goes downstairs and looks through the window by the door. No ones there. She carefully opens the door and looks around, nothing. Shes about to go back inside when her foot hits something. She looks down and sees a box, its not that big and its made of cardboard. She kneels down and picks it up, inspecting it closely, there is only one thing written on the box, KAREN, her name. She closes the door and goes up to her room, carrying the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts it down onto her bed and just stares at it. \"Someone delivered a box this late at night with only my name written on it.....\" she thinks to herself. She takes the knife she brought with her and dangles it above the box....\"should I open it.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing the knife into the side of the box, she begins to open it, finally making her choice. After getting the tap off, she opens it, and there, sitting in front of her was a dark black book with weird symbols and markings on it. She picks it up and it starts glowing. (SEE THE FIRST PAGE!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the book, with a stunned look on her face she says, \"wha-whose there\" looking around the room, with no response and not seeing anyone there, she refocuses back onto the book. Is this real? could this book really do what it said? or is this just a joke. Some more time passes.....she moves the box it came in and notices something else in the box, a letter, she pics it up and starts reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Karen, by now you have already touched the book and it has accepted you as its new master, I no longer have any need of the book and decided it needed a new master, and I picked you, this is no joke, this book does have the power to grant any wish or desire that you have. With that I leave it in your care, good luck and do whatever you feel like. The previous master of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the letter down, she goes back to her school bag and pulls out a pencil. she opens the book up to one of its pure white pages, and starts thinking of what to try first, if this is truly real.....</span></div></div>",

After some time of walking, and a fair distance from her house she stops. \"This is far enough, lets see if it works. She starts concentrating, and suddenly, a big glowing orange ball of energy appears in front of her, and with a flash, it is replaced by the book, floating in front of her. \"Yes! it works\", she said, \"now I don't have to lug that book everywhere I go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continues to walk along the right side of the street, she pauses for a moment, \"I thought I heard something?\" she says, then she hears it again, \"I knew it, its coming from that alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully approaching it, she slowly leans around the corner and gets a surprise. It is three pretty large guys about to rape a girl. She gets a closer look at the girl and recognizes her, she is from her school and is a member of the basketball team, just like Karen is. \"Damn, now I have to help, though I can't let Claire see me\".... With a silent sound of inspiration, she carefully backs away and writes something down, as the something begins to materialize in front of her, she gets ready to face them......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the alley, \"come on girl, its just a little bit of fun,\" guy 1 said, \"yeah, don't be so scared\" agreed guy 2 as guy 3 was holding her up. \"No, please just leave me alone\", Clair says, as the 2 other guys start getting closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP RIGHT THERE SCUM!\" a voice says out of nowhere. \"Who's there!\" guy 1 yells as the 3 of them look in the direction the voice came from, and standing there was Karen, wearing a black mask over her face, holding the book in her left and a pencil in her right. All 4 of them, including Clair, are just starting at her, with a weird look on their faces. \"Heh, who's this, does she think she can stop us, you, (guy 2), go get her, we will use her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs guy 2 starts walking over to her he says, \"well isn't this a surprise, 2 for 1\", with an evil smile on his face. Karen just simply opens the book and says, \"oh, the one who will be having fun is me,\" as she writes in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 of them suddenly recieve a slight shock, \"what the hell was that?\" guy 1 says. \"Uh boss,\" says guy 2, \"what is it,\" guy 1 says back at him, \"I-I can't move\". What Karen had written down was MAKE THESE 3 UNABLE TO MOVE FROM WHERE THEY ARE STANDING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to us you bitch,\" guy 1 said screaming at the masked Karen. \"Oh, its nothing compared to what I will do to you three,\" Karen said putting the pencil just above the book.</span></div></div>",

With a evil smile of her own, she says, \"I finally decide what I will do to you 3......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished what she was writing, she closes the book and gets ready to watch. Suddenly, there is another glowing ball of energy in front of Karen, the 3 rapists start panicking, and out of the ball came a box of popcorn. She simply grabs the popcorn and says, \"hey, I was hungry, and popcorn is perfect for when your watching something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch, I swear I.......\", guy one was interrupted by another shock, just as the other 2 were getting as well. \"What is this,\" he says as he notices his voice getting lighter. Starting to freak out, he realized whats happening, as he watches his chest grow out and hair get longer, he was turning into a girl. \"What are you doing,\" he says in his feminine voice. Karen does not answer and just watches as she eats her popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, and there transformation is complete. \"You wanted to know what I was doing,\" Karen asks the three girls, \"well, I may have stopped you this time, but who knows how many women you raped, so I decided to give you all a taste of your own medicine, oh and if you haven't figured it out yet, this was part 1, part 2 if you count the popcorn\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part 1,\" girl 1 says with a terrified voice.She was interrupted from continuing by something crawling up her leg, looking down, she is terrified by what she sees. A tentacle is coming out of the ground and was wrapping around her leg, the same thing was happening to girl 2 and 3. Suddenly with a loud explosion and 3 loud screams, dozens of tentacles burst out of the ground and head there way towards the 3 of them, lifting them up into the air, allowing them to struggle once more, in vain though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly stripping them of there loosely hanging clothes, the tentacles make quick work of entering each hole. Karen just watches as the 3 rapists get what they deserve, watching as one tentacle finished filling up a hole then being replaced by another, as the last tentacles finish up, the 3 are simply dumped onto the floor, covered in tentacle cum. With a quick laugh Karen simply says, \"maybe now you will think twice before you rape someone, though that won't be for quite some time............\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sirens blazing, 2 police cars stop just outside the alley, \"is this the place\" a voice says, \"yes, this is where they are,\" replies a female voice. A couple of policemen enter the alleyway, and are surprised by what they see, 3 men unconscious (fully clothed and clean) and tied up together. One  of the officers turns to the girl who happens to be Clair and says, \"are these the men who tried to rape you\", \"yes, though I don' see the girl who helped me.....\". \"Well whoever she was, the policeman said, \"she has our thanks, these 3 fit the description of 3 men who have been raping women and committing crimes for a while......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from the distance as the 3 men were being put into the police cars was Karen, with a giant smile on her face,\"HAHAHAHAHA, that was great, oh the power I have, what will I do next, there isn't anything that I can not do!

She let's go, causing the 2 of them to fall back. \"Damn it! A fish just made a fool out of me!\", the girl says. She looks at her brother and sees that he is upset. \"Uh, look, that one doesn't count. Just try again\", she looks at the lake. \"But, seriously, what the hell was that? It took both of us to start to real it in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watches the 2 of them start to get up and prepare for him to try again. \"That was fun!\", she says. But then she starts to think. With a sigh, she looks around and finds what she was looking for. Back on shore, the boy had just finished readying the rod for another go. A large splash, followed by a foot long fish exiting the water and flying at them interrupts them. It smacks the girl in the face, she lets out a surprised scream as it falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look at the fish, \"what just happened? Was this the fish on the line?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After my little prank, I though I'd do something nice. You don't have to thank me\". They quickly turn around and see Karen, smiling at them.</span></div></div>",

An old man and a young girl are being harassed by 4 men. \"Come on, give us all the money you have, or we wont hurt the girl,\" \"fine, fine just take it!,\" the old man says pulling out his wallet.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the \"leader\" says, or so she guesses. \"We need to make up for losing those 3 last night to that chick,\" says another. \"Shut up, no ones suppose to know that,\" snaps the leader to him. \"....\"friends\" of those from last night, heh,\" Karen says as the book appears in front of her, \"time for some more \"fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren writes in the book once more and the mask from last night appears once again. Dawning the mask once more she steps out of hiding and confronts them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO! you scum are friends with those from last night....\" Karen says as she leaves her hiding place. Quickly turning around, the 4 robbers are staring at the masked Karen. After a moment of silence, the leader starts to speak, \"so, I take it you are the from last night\". \"Yes, I am\", she replies. \"Good, this means that we don't have to look for you\". \"Get her,\" he says and the other three run at her. Karen however, does not move.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground starts shaking, causing the 3 men to stop moving. \"What is this, an earthquake?\" one of them says. Unfortunately for them, it wasn't, Karen had planned ahead and wrote in the book. WHEN THEY COME AFTER ME TRAP THEM IN THE DIRT, and since they went after her, the book did as was written in it. The ground where the men were standing started to soften, they noticed this as there feet were starting to get sucked into it. They tried to escape, but it was too late, with one loud sucking noise, all four of them were trapped up to there waist. \"Damn it, what the hell are you,\" the leader says to Karen. \"It doesn't matter what I am, just know that you will end up like your friends,\" she says with an evil smile at him, she focuses on the old man and young girls now, \"you 2, get out of here now while you have the chance\". Doing as she says, they leave, though the young girl does thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with just the 5 of them, and no one else around, she whips out the book and gets ready to \"punish them\".</span></div></div>",

The girl began bending closer to the flower until her nose touched it.  Suddenly the head of the flower grew and began sucking the girl's body into it, leaving her clothes behind.  The flower expanded rapidly and grew to about two feet in height.  When the transformation was finished, there were two large leaves where arms would be, and the girl's face was in the center of the flower, surrounded by petals.  Chelsea gave a squeal of delight.  \"She's so cute!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but now I wonder what to do with her.\"</span></div></div>",

It's not like anyone can see you besides me, anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, all right.\"  Chelsea reluctantly stripped bare and Karen began writing.  First, a large pot appeared in front of her.  Next, Chelsea's head flattened and her body became extremely skinny.  \"Sorry, I realized I needed a shovel, so you'll have to do.\"  Chelsea found that she couldn't respond as her mouth was now made of metal.  Her arms stuck to her sides and her legs stuck together with her feet morphing to form the handle.  She kept her coloration, however, making her appear to be a very lewd shovel.  Karen carefully dug out the little girl-flower, being careful not to cut her roots, and placed her into the pot.  Karen began writing again, and the hole filled back up and Chelsea became human again, dirt clinging to her hair and face.  Karen wrote the dirt away.<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to turn me into a shovel like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Did it hurt?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but I don't just want to be transformed on a whim!\"<br>\r\n\"You seemed to be okay with me doing that to the little girl.

I'm not so sure I want to go through with this...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you're already committed.  Right now, I only plan on adding her memories to yours, but if need be I'll erase your own.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine.  Just do it.\"  Chelsea felt herself begin to shrink.  Her teenage form began regressing to that of a seven-year-old.  Memories flooded into her mind of what this girl's life was like.  When the magic stopped, she looked like an exact duplicate of the girl that was now part flower.  She hurriedly put the girl's clothes on, and Karen returned time to normal, simultaneously vanishing into her secret base carrying the pot in one hand and Chelsea's old clothes in the other.</span></div></div>",

She didn't seem to be in any pain, Karen noted.  In fact, she seemed to be enjoying it.  \"Good-bye!\" she called as finally Chelsea's head was transformed.  Suddenly, Chelsea's clothes crumbled off of her.  Karen grumbled under her breath.  Of course, clothes were to thin to be turned to stone on their own.  The city wouldn't want an anatomically correct statue...  Writing in her book, Chelsea's privates vanished and water began flowing out of her mouth.  Satisfied, Karen restarted time and decided it was time to head home.</span></div></div>",

Karen set Chelsea down (returning her to her usual weight) and she crawled into the water.<br>\r\n\"Much better!  Now, about some covering?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"  Karen looked around.  Three ten-year-old girls wearing tattered clothes were standing on the dock, frozen in time like everything else.  Karen recognized these girls as homeless orphaned triplets who often stole from the local stores.  They were quite the menace despite their age, and the foster homes refused to take them anymore.  No one would miss them, Karen rationed.  One more city favor under her belt.  She began writing, and the girls began to change, their tattered dresses sliding off of them.  The girl in the middle began to stretch in height, her arms fusing to her sides and her legs fusing together.  The other two began expanding outward and becoming flat.  The middle girl then flipped horizonally and bent around behind them, her head fusing with the hand of one and her feet fusing with the hand of another.  The two flat girls slowly turned into shells as the long one completed her change into a strap.  The three (now fused as one) then shrank down to bra size.  Thankfully for Karen, Chelsea hadn't been watching.  \"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!  It looks so natural!  Wherever did you find it?\"<br>\r\n\"Consider it a donation from the foster care.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  Chelsea slipped it on, oblivious to its origins.<br>\r\n\"Now for you.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\nKaren flipped open her book and began writing.  \"Just making sure no scientist tried to poach you for research.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, goo--\"  Chelsea suddenly found that she couldn't speak.  She was happy, though.  Happier than she ever had been.  She took off swimming as fast as she could go, forgetting about the girl on the beach.  Karen watched with contentment.  She had written that Chelsea be protected from harm or removal from the lake, but had also wished her mute and constantly happy so that she could not tell of her origins or miss them.  Restarting time, she vanished amongst the crowd, satisfied about her good deeds to the city, believing that what she did was for the greater good.</span></div></div>",

A bathroom, bedroom, large TV, large computer, sofa and kitchen area, everything she needed, for now.

She is actually enjoying this a bit, she can tell that she is scared, but there is also a slight bit of amazement in Chelsea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Karen thought, Chelsea is enjoying this a bit, from her point of view, the sky shattered and this place appeared, who wouldn't enjoy this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on the fountain, continuing to stare into the vast bluish light. Though her gaze is finally interrupted when she sees something else. A blackish figure is starting to materialize in front of her, she is staring at Karen in her disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust staring, it suddenly hits her. \"Ah!, you must be her, the girl that appeared in the alley and at the park in the city!\" Chelsea says standing up with a surprised look at her face and pointing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was me\" masked Karen replies back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's face, changing from a surprised look to a happy one says, \"so, all those things that are being said, those \"tricks\" that you do, they are real, thats the only way you could have possibly made this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, all of it is real, if you know exactly what I did,\" Karen says. Karen decides to change the subject, \"though I am surprised, you actually seem to be enjoying this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who wouldn't!\" she quickly says back,\"this is amazing, you can do so many things! anyone who wouldn't like this is weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your the one that's weird\" Karen thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why me? why did you trap me in here?\" Chelsea asks curiously and excited at the same time. \"Well, I was going to practice with your uh, \"help\", but now I am not so sure\"....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Karen gets the exact opposite reaction that she was expecting. \"Really! oh please do what you were going to! oh I am so excited! I can't believe that I get to see this stuff up close!\" she says with both hands together and near her head with a look of pure excitement on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, just give me a second, oh, and I promise, this will not hurt, if anything, you will experience only pleasure\".....</span></div></div>",

All this did was make Chelsea even more excited,\"oh, what is that? is that how you do your, uh, tricks?\" she asks not knowing what to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, partially,\" Karen says back,\"and you can call it what you want, though magic is probable the best thing to call it\" she says opening the book and pulling out a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you are actually willing to help me, may I ask that you do exactly as I say?\" Karen asks her. \"Of course, I can't wait! I will do whatever it is that you want me to do!\" Chelsea happily responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Karen only left the fountain when she made this area, she had an idea in mind, and now was the time to try it.<br>\r\nThe fountain itself was pretty simple, it was in the shape of a circle with a single water jet coming out the middle, though there was no longer any water in it.When she had made this area though, she had gotten rid of that single jet only leaving the base with the trench surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I need you to go stand in the middle of the fountain,\" Karen says to Chelsea. With a puzzled look she does what she was told to do, \"ok, i'm here, now what? Why am I standing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you just wait and you will see why in a second,\" Karen says as she started to write in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to know why you are standing there, well its quite simple,\" she says with a slight grin, \"you are going to be the new centerpiece of the fountain\". \"Wait, wha-\" Chelsea started to say as a pleasant tingle shot through her body, \"ahhh, what was that? that felt great\" she managed to say as she looked at her feet. With a quick sound of shock, she could not believe what she was seeing. Her feet had turned to solid stone! \"Like I said, you are becoming part of the fountain, I suggest you strike a good pose,\" Karen says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a second, Chelsea finally managed to say something that once again surprised Karen. \"This is amazing! And if feels so good, you were right about the pleasure thing! Ok, how about this,\" Chelsea says as she puts her right hand on her hip and her left in the air pointing upwards, and leaning forward, she would have moved her feet, if they weren't already turned to stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren can just watch in disbelief, she is actually enjoying this, \"oh well, if she likes it, she likes it, at least I now know I can do this with the book\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea tries to maintain her \"pose\" as the sensation continues to climb up her body, increasing the sensation as it goes, by now, the petrification has reached just below her breasts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and the only thing left is her neck and head, \"this was great,\" Chelsea says, \"If you want any practice PLEASE use me again\". \"Uh, alright\" Karen says shocked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they both get a confused look on their faces, they hear cracking, and with a sudden large breaking sound, Chelsea's clothes shatter, leaving her completely naked. \"Ok, I wasn't expecting that,\" Karen says as the last bit of Chelsea is petrified.</span></div></div>",

It was pretty late now, as she sits in her base, looking at her massive computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping away, she is testing out the surveillance mode she had the book put into her computer. It basically lets her computer put up 4 different screens at once of whatever she wants to see. Whether its somewhere on the planet, in space, or anything that is on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the computer put up multiple parts of the city, she spots something. A little convenience store that is near her house and that she has been to multiple times. There is something going on there, putting it on the full screen and zooming in, she sees what is happening. There were 2 men, in black ski masks robbing the place and holding Mr. Heath, (he is a neighbor of hers and she knows him pretty well), at gunpoint. \"Oh, NO you don't,\" she says as she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the right of the computer, she enters the teleporter she made that sends her to her room. With a bright blue flash she disappears and reappears in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the book, she writes something down and closes it. Opening her window, she carefully looks outside, all clear. Placing her arms on the sides of the window, she steps up onto it, and with one final look around to make sure it was all clear, does one big leap out the window, soars across the street and onto the roof of the building on the other side. She had given her self the ability to jump long distances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoving her new ability, she is leaping from rooftop to rooftop on the way to the close by store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving and overlooking the store, the scene had changed. The police and some news crews were outside as the 2 masked people inside were now using the people inside as hostages. \"Well great, this is going to be annoying,\" she says from her rooftop perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to watch a bit until she figures out what to do, she sees that the police are trying to negotiate, the news people are reporting what is going on, and as for the people in the store, the windows were protected by some metal pull down sheets meant for protection, leaving the entrance as the only way in or out. \"He had to put that extra security in,\" Karen says as she still tries to think of what to do.....</span></div></div>",

Writing in the book again, she is covered in a bright blue light and vanishes. Reappearing, she ducks down just to make sure she ended up where she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she is exactly where she wanted to be, the restroom inside the store. Writing in the book, a screen appears in front of her showing what is going on in the main part of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your average little convenience store, with aisle after aisle of various things with the restroom in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man was holding a pistol at the group of hostages on the floor while the other emptied the register. \"We were so close!\" the guy holding the gun at the hostages said. Looking back at Mr. Heath, \"if only this asshole didn't trip the alarm, oh well at least we got these guys to bargain with\". \"Will you just shut up! Stop complaining already! God dammit well be fine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches her eye, having the screen move in, she is looking at the pocket of the guy with the gun. In his pocket was a note, and on the part she could see said, clear as day, \"Queen's Forest\". \"Really!? More of these guys? They are everywhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I will take some more precautions this time\" she says as she writes some more in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the book vanishes and goes back to her base, she steps out of the bathroom and walks down the hall to where they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the main area, she stands there, waiting for them to notice her. The first to notice her was the one with the gun, \"Who the fuck are you!\" he shouts pointing the gun at her. This causes the others to look at her, and once again there is a brief pause as they realize she is wearing a disguise. Snapping out of it, the one at the cash register realizes who she is, \"oh shit! its her, the one that has been in the news!\" \"What!, your telling me that SHE is the one that has been stopping our guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Karen says, \"I am the one that stopped those other guys\". \"You bitch!\" he screams as he fires his pistol at her. The hostages scream as the bullet screeches through the air. Hitting her square in the chest, she does not even flinch as the bullet flattens as it hits her and falls to the floor. Dropping his gun, he stumbles backwards, \"Wh-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy, at the register cant believe what he is seeing, he leaves the register and pulls out his own gun, aiming it he unloads on her. As round after round leave the gun and strike her, its the same effect, the bullets simply bounce off of her. She had made sure that guns did not work on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps forward, she gives the guy that just shot her a slight push with her right hand, sending him flying backwards colliding with the other guy and sending them both flying into a wall. Raising her right foot, she smashes both guns with her feet. Looking over at the hostages, she says \"well, what are you waiting for? go now!\" These words snapped them out of the trance that they were in and ran out of the store. Leaving her and the 2 robbers alone.</span></div></div>",

Just like the others, a quick jolt runs throughout their bodies. Their hair gets longer, breasts and butt expands and stomach shrinks as they become women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, lightning shoots throughout the entire area for a second, followed by ripples appearing all over the place. Flower buds start to appear out of these ripples, the robbers are now surrounded by hundreds of these greenish blue buds. Fear completely takes over, they start thrashing around and calling for help as they try to get free of the rope that is binding them. One after another, they start to open, revealing a blood red inside as they start to shoot out hundreds of spores each onto them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes start to melt upon contact with said spores as they are covered with them. The ropes melt along with their clothes leaving them free to move once again, naked, but free. They seize this chance and try to run away, but it was too late, around 3-4 tentacles burst out of the ripples around each bud and head for them, with hundreds of tentacles coming at them from all sides, it doesn't take long for them to be captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are quickly lifted into the air by the numerous tentacles as each one glides around their bodies trying to find a way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing up, they are dropped into a pile, covered in cum and exhausted and panting as the tentacles and buds retreat and the ripples disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Karen isn't finished with them, she known Mr.Heath for years and this was personal for her. Multiple large gates of light appear out of nowhere around the 2 girls as they watch in horror as about a dozen large minotaur like creatures emerge from these gateways and make their way towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey surround them and 2 of these creatures grab a girl each. Their clearly visable dicks enlarge as the robbers realize what is going to happen. For the next couple of minutes, each minotaur creature cums a few times and switches with another as they try all types of positions on them. From them holding their heads down to lifting them in the air and forcing them back and forth on thier dicks with their hands to having multiple of the creatures on one girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they collapse as they finish up and the creatures vanish back through the gates of light.

She starts to turn away, but something catches her attention at the last second. She notices 2 guys watching her as well, and suddenly they entered the park as well. \"Hmmm, this may not be good,\" Karen says as she follows the 2 guys following her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome ways from the entrance and Claire finally stops, she goes over to a water fountain and takes a quick drink. The 2 guys use this chance, there is no one else around and it is still pretty early in the morning. One of them puts his hand in front of her mouth and grabs her, while the other guy grabs her by her legs and together they drag her into a more isolated part of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Claire, Karen was watching from the sidelines, \"again? I better go help her, again,\" she says as her book and costume materialize in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey end up taking her to an old metal building deeper into the park. Taking Claire inside, they shut and lock all the door and turn on the light. \"There, all alone now,\" one of them says looking at Claire. \"Why? Why again? I just went through something like this! I don't want to be raped!\" she thinks as they come back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggle and yells as best as she can, but they are too strong for her, they rip off her clothes leaving her naked in the middle of the small building. With a look of fear on her face, she can only watch as one of them spreads her legs after taking his pants off. With his member fully erect he says, \"I'm going to enjoy this,\" as the other guy holds her down. She still tries though, screaming and struggling, just praying that she can somehow get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popular, aren't we?\" a voice says echoing throughout the building as the lights go out. Both of them get off of her and pull out a pistol each. \"Show yourself! Or we kill her!\" one of them says holding a gun to Claire's head. Both rapists look at her as she materializes in front of them in a black haze. \"Good girl,\" the other one says as he walks over to Karen and puts his gun to her head. \"We finally got ya, this is for all the trouble you've caused us,\" he says as he pulls the trigger. Claire screams as the loud gunshot echoes throughout the building. The look of victory on his face quickly changes to that of fear as Karen grabs the gun with her left hand and smashes it. \"Sorry, but that won't work on me,\" she says as she punches him in the gut sending him flying across the room, smashing into some boxes on the other side. She then starts walking to the other guy. \"S-STAY BACK!\" he screams, unloading his weapon on her as the bullets bounce harmlessly off of her. He then threatens to kill the girl again if she comes any closer, she pauses, and says, while starting to walk towards them again, \"too late, your out of ammo,\" as he pulls the trigger, and nothing happens. \"FUCK!\" he says trying to reload it. Too late though, she grabs him by the neck and lifts him up. \"You lose,\" she says as she tosses him in the same direction as the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren walks over to Claire and offers her a hand, \"are you alright?\" she asks. Taking her hand, \"y-yes I'm fine, um, thanks again for saving me\". \"Alright,\" she says letting go of her hand. She then tries to leave, but Claire stops her, \"W-Wait!,\" she says as Karen was opening the door, she turns towards her, \"yes? What is it?\" \"Are you leaving me like this? I um mean, my clothes....there gone....\" she says as she looks at the ground. \"Right, well lets see, I guess I can't leave you here, naked, give me a second,\" she says as she leaves the building. A few seconds later and a look of surprise crosses her face as her torn clothes start mending themselves and being put back on her. Claire then rushes outside and sees her just about to leave, \"Um, thanks again, you've saved me twice now and fixed my clothes\". Karen then turns to her again and says, \"It's fine, and don't forget to call the police,\" with that said, Karen then vanishes in a flash of blue light.</span></div></div>",

This causes them all to shut up as they clearly are scared. One of the men looks at Karen and walks over to her, \"what are you looking at?

All 12 guys are unconscious and tied up, and Shade was putting the last guy against the wall with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices them waking up and walks over to them. \"Are any of you hurt?\" she asks, a moment of silence, \"well?\" she says, trying to snap them out of it, and it does.

You really do have powers!\" \"Hey what's your name? You must have some sort of name picked out for yourself!\". She tries her best to answer these questions, until Sarah asks one of her own. \"What about Karen? What happened to her outside?\" This made the other girls stop talking, as they remembered how he dragged her out of the gym. \"Oh, her? I stopped him from doing anything, don't worry, I also told her to run and get the police, who should be arriving any second now,\" and just like she said, sirens could be heard in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade then jumps out of the crowd and lands a bit from them. \"Well, there's my cue,\" she says, \"time for me to go, oh, and you can call me Shade,\" as she starts to vanish in a black light, but not without the coach and the girls thanking her for saving them one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was gone, they all kept talking about what had just happened until the police got there.

Karen<br>\r\nfigures Chelsea would probably get a kick out of seeing just how big she<br>\r\ncan make her boobs grow. Karen didn't phrase things the best way and<br>\r\nonce Chelsea realizes what she can now do she does some things that<br>\r\nsurprises Karen with their audacity. Next, Karen gives Chelsea the power<br>\r\nof total mobility. By turning Chelsea into the world's greatest contortionist<br>\r\nshe will be able to turn part or all of Chelsea into several different balloon<br>\r\nanimals. Again, Chelsea will discover very inventive uses for her mobility<br>\r\nwhile still being able to inflate various parts of herself. A couple of those<br>\r\nwill even involve Karen's own body. Third, Karen gives Chelsea the ability<br>\r\nto recombine her body from the hundreds or thousands of pieces she will<br>\r\nbecome should she pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Chelsea can't contain herself anymore and she asks Karen<br>\r\nwhat she has been writing in the book. Karen just says that Chelsea will<br>\r\nlike it better finding out on her own. Hearing that, Chelsea then says that<br>\r\nshe feels like its Christmas Day and she can't wait for tomorrow morning<br>\r\nto open her presents. Karen then asks Chelsea to pick a number from<br>\r\none to nine and Karen will tell Chelsea which change Karen will activate.<br>\r\nInstead of choosing a number, Chelsea asks Karen if she'll write in the<br>\r\nbook something that Chelsea wants done to her body. Karen agrees and<br>\r\nasks Chelsea want change does she want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chelsea was a girl her parents once took her to a traveling circus.<br>\r\nThere was a clown who took several solid colored balloons and somehow<br>\r\nmade them into one multicolored balloon. As a little girl Chelsea knew<br>\r\nit had to be magic somehow. He gave her one of those \"rainbow balloons\"<br>\r\nand she still has it deflated in her dresser at home. The balloon looked to<br>\r\nbe both separate and one piece at the same time. Chelsea wants to have<br>\r\nher skin and hair color change to the same as what that balloon is. Karen<br>\r\nis intrigued to see just what Chelsea would look like as a rainbow colored<br>\r\nballoon so she agrees to give Chelsea her early Christmas present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then writes in the book that Chelsea is to now become identical to<br>\r\nthe balloon both in type and color to the one she has just described while<br>\r\na balloon. She will stay at her current level of inflation until Karen inflates<br>\r\nher some more. Chelsea will stay multicolored even after she is no longer<br>\r\ninflated. {Writing it this way, Karen has made an incredible error that is<br>\r\nnot a problem for Chelsea. In fact she delirious with joy once she learns<br>\r\nwhat Karen has accidentally done with her body!} As her skin and hair is<br>\r\ntransforming into the 7 colors of the rainbow Chelsea's face turns into a<br>\r\npicture of pure bliss. She passes out from the intense sensations going<br>\r\nthrough her body. They're beyond description and by themselves Chelsea<br>\r\nis totally grateful for having met Karen in the first place. While Chelsea<br>\r\nis still unconscious Karen decides to make some balloon animals using<br>\r\nvarious parts of Chelsea's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver three hours later, Chelsea finally wakes up and is surprised to see<br>\r\nboth of her arms and legs are now balloon animals. Karen has patiently<br>\r\nwaited for Chelsea to wake up. Chelsea bets Karen that Karen can't pop<br>\r\nher in less than 10 minutes. Karen takes the bet asking what happens<br>\r\nif she (Karen) loses. Chelsea just says that it'll be my turn. Perplexed<br>\r\nby Chelsea's answer, Karen takes the bet and starts blowing as hard as<br>\r\nshe can into Chelsea's mouth. Karen wants to see what will happen to<br>\r\nChelsea if Karen can pop her. Before starting Karen writes in the book<br>\r\nthat Karen can never run out of breath. She figures this is the only way<br>\r\nthat she'll have a chance of popping Chelsea and win the bet. Chelsea<br>\r\nfigures that for her this is a no-lose situation. Either she pops and has<br>\r\na new sensation or she gets her turn at Karen. As she gets grows larger<br>\r\nfrom Karen blowing her up Chelsea starts wishing that she doesn't pop!<br>\r\nMore and more she wants to get her turn with Karen. After 9 1/2 minutes<br>\r\nChelsea has pretty much filled up Karen's entire base and she's begun<br>\r\nsqueaking very loudly. It is now only a matter of seconds before Chelsea<br>\r\npops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Chelsea pop before the 10 minute time limit expires? </span></div></div>",

The girls all agree that that's a good idea so they start<br>\r\nthinking about what each one wants to now be named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they're doing that, Karen decides to ask the book why Chelsea became<br>\r\n7 identical girls and to learn if there will be any long-term consequences for<br>\r\nany or all of the Chelsea's whether good or bad.<br>\r\n                                                                                                       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: It would be preferable if all of the girls were not immediately named.<br>\r\nIn the next couple of installments only 2 or 3 need to be named.

Karen picked her up and popped her into her mouth.  She rolled Chelsea over and over with her tongue, relishing the taste and the slight squirm as Chelsea changed position.  After about a minute, she spit Chelsea out.  The sucking had reduced her size, and she was basically a featureless girl-shaped mint.  Her face had been wiped away, and only small mounds on her chest indicated that she was feminine.  Fingers and toes were non-existent, and her arms and legs were very brittle, so brittle in fact that when Chelsea moved, she accidentally snapped off her own left arm.  Karen had an idea.  Maybe she could cause the arm to grow back into Chelsea once she finished the rest of her.  Setting the arm to the side, Karen popped the mint back into her mouth and sucked away until nothing was left except a pleasant odor on Karen's breath.</span></div></div>",

Karen wondered why her clothes had crumbled, but realized that the stone was so detailed that the clothes had been turned to rock separately, but as rock they were too thin to stay in one piece.  Karen contemplated what she should do.  Obviously she couldn't leave Chelsea naked and literally stoned for anyone to see, since she was supposed to be a justice fighter of some sort.  Besides, Chelsea had offered her help.  Turning those who are willing to help into fountains usually didn't help one's conscience.  However, Chelsea had seemed to enjoy the sensation of becoming a fountain, so theoretically she would enjoy being the fountain.  It wouldn't hurt to keep her happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea began writing.  She told the book to have the fountain reappear in the real world, and Chelsea's mouth would become the water spout.  She also smoothed out Chelsea's crotch and nipples just in case any teenage boys got some lewd ideas.  Finally, she wrote that the fountain would return to this \"magic world\" after one hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren returned to her base, occasionally glancing at the screen to make sure Chelsea was all right.  Some people walking by were surprised by the statue that had magically appeared, and one old lady grumbled about \"modern art being nothing but nude women\", but no one even touched the statue.  When she wasn't watching the screen, Karen was thinking about the possibilities with Chelsea.  She resolved to ask for Chelsea's consent before carrying out any of her experiments, and if Chelsea refused she would be free to leave, although her memory would be wiped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour ended, and Karen returned to the strange blue world where the statue was waiting.</span></div></div>",

Instead of starting with her feet, the transformation started with her head.  Slowly the unforgiving granite turned into squishy flesh as Chelsea came back to life.  As soon as her mouth returned to normal, she was extremely chatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the most amazing time ever!  The water flowing out of my mouth was amazing!  Did you see those cardinals land on my hand?  They were so pretty!  Oh, look, I can move my arms!  And that old woman!  It wasn't like I chose to be naked, it just happened!  Thanks for covering me up, by the way!  It felt really funny when you did it, but it was probably a good thing given how those two boys looked at me.  I've never had a boy look at me like that before.  Of course, I've never been nude in public before, either.  Nor have I been a statue before!  It was so much fun!  You should try it sometime!  Oh, there goes my hips!  This feels so weird to be halfway in-between!  It's weird being a statue, too!  It's like I can't move, but I don't get stiff or anything!  I can tell that I'm colder than when I'm human, but I don't feel cold!  I feel so comfortable!  Oops, there go my feet!\"  She lost her balance and fell flat on her face, giving Karen a reprieve from the constant flow of words.  Of course, once she got up, she was back in full flow again.  Finally, Karen took out her book.  Chelsea's mouth suddenly vanished.  Now the only sounds to be heard was their breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's the deal.  First of all, my name is Blackpen, on account of my black clothes and my powerful book.  Secondly, you are welcome to stay if you like and be my test subject, since you enjoyed it so much.  I am willing to let you pick something reasonable for me to write for every five experiments I put you through.  You are also welcome to leave, but I will have to erase any memories from the point you became a statue onwards for my safety.  I'm going to let you keep the statue memory as a keepsake and because I didn't do anything to compromise myself.  However, I do ask one thing.  I'm okay with conversation, but for the love of the pen, take it easy or I'll make the erasing of your mouth permanent!\"  With that, Karen restored Chelsea's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!  I promise I'll stay!  But what about my parents?\"<br>\r\n\"I can temporarily write you out of their lives.  I can also send you home on occasion, but your memory will be altered until you return.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome!  When do we start?

I'm ready when you are!\"<br>\r\n\"I'd recommend lying down, since your legs more than likely will disappear, although I don't know for sure how this will work.\"  Chelsea laid down and Karen started writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Chelsea's legs and arms seemed to roll up inside of her.  Then her skin appeared to become silky.  \"This feels a lot different than when I was a statue!  I feel more smooth, like water!\"  Her body below her neck suddenly deflated and hollowed out, leaving holes where her arms and legs were.  \"Ooh, that felt weird!  I feel weightless!\"  Her voice became muffled as her head also deflated and her murmurs were silenced entirely as her head was sucked into the swimsuit, leaving the last hole.  Karen picked up the one-piece suit.  Normally, she wore a bikini, but she didn't want to risk it.  She studied the swimsuit with interest.  It was a little too small for her, as Chelsea was shorter than she was.  It had also kept Chelsea's skin colors, meaning that if Karen wore the suit, she might as well be swimming naked.  A couple of scribbles and the suit stretched slightly and turned blue.  Karen stripped out of her Blackpen outfit and slid the suit on.  A thought struck her.  She could use the book to allow a telepathic communication with Chelsea, so her observations wouldn't have to be remembered the whole time they were gone.  However, Chelsea was awfully chatty, so she might be distracting.</span></div></div>",

I'm going to try different things on you, such as how you're able to breathe.\"  Karen scribbled something, and a large pool appeared inside the base.  Chelsea's legs snapped together and began fusing.  Her feet flattened out to become fins, causing her to lose her balance.  She landed on her back next to the pool.  \"What color do you want your tail to be?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...blue's fine!\"  A tingling sensation shot from the tip of her new tail to her waist, and she broke out in vivid blue scales.  \"Amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"You're able to breathe fine?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"<br>\r\nKaren noticed that Chelsea's face was turning red.  \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, um, between the water flowing through me and the pool next to me, I've had to go to the bathroom for some time, but I didn't want to interrupt.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.  Well, that could be a little difficult given your current state.\"<br>\r\n\"How <i>would</i> mermaids do it?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess that, despite not having a human female groin, they must have <i>something</i>.  Um, hold on.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm holding, in more ways than one.\"  Chelsea felt a strange sensation below her navel.  She saw that a small slit had appeared on her tail where her genitals would have been when she was human.<br>\r\n\"There.  Now you have urinary and reproductive parts.  Incidentally, you are asexual and lay eggs.\"<br>\r\n\"That's cool, but was the reproduction necessary?\"<br>\r\n\"Eh.  Assuming your period isn't soon...\"<br>\r\n\"It isn't.\"<br>\r\n\"...it shouldn't be an issue.  I just thought it might be useful later on.  Who knows when an army of mermaids would come in handy?  Anyway, I suppose mermaids just 'go' in a lake or something, but I want that pool to be kept clean.  So...\"  Karen picked up Chelsea (since she was unable to walk) and walked into the bathroom.  At first, Chelsea tried sitting, but realized that wouldn't work with the placement of her privates.  So she called Karen back into the room (she had left after seating Chelsea; she had no desire to observe the mermaid's bathroom habits) and Karen had to lay her across the seat face down before leaving again.  Once Chelsea was finished, Karen carried her back and dropped her into the pool with a splash.  \"Note to self: It is a lot less effort to change the subject back to human in times like this...\"<br>\r\n\"I hear you there.  That seat was cold on my tail!\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's see if you can breathe underwater or if I need to adjust that.\"</span></div></div>",

The water coming out of my mouth was a nice touch!\"<br>\r\nKaren stared at Chelsea.

You can do stuff like that?  I suppose it's a good thing, since I didn't really cover myself up.

Thinking about all that water running through me, you know, and since I won't have the parts to do so when you do that...\"<br>\r\nKaren nodded.  \"Sure.  Um, hold on...\"  A latrine appeared out of nowhere.  Chelsea did her business and came back out.  \"Strike your pose.\"  Chelsea posed as a ballerina.  \"By the way, you were wondering about my name.  I am the Blackpen.\"  The transformation started again.  Chelsea moaned with the sensation as her body was turned to stone from the feet up, blurring necessary parts as it went.<br>\r\n\"How long will I be the statue this time?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think until you become a news sensation.  Then mysteriously you will disappear.\"<br>\r\n\"So I won't be home for dinner, I take it?\" The stone reached Chelsea's hips.<br>\r\n\"Do you need to be?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents will worry, but this is so worth it!\"<br>\r\n\"If you insist.  I can make sure they don't worry, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n\"That would be great!  Could you even tell them that I'm the magical statue?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"  Further conversation was cut off as Chelsea's face turned to stone, leaving an expression of utter delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the statue was a plaque that read \"Beware to criminals/For the Blackpen is watching/And it is up to her/Whether you have the delight of this statue/Or the pain of those that cross her/For she can rewrite your lives\"  With a flick of the pen, Chelsea the fountain returned to the real world.</span></div></div>",

About 30 minutes or so after you became a statue some thugs came along. Reading the inscription she left, they had put two and two together and had realized that the statue was no ordinary statue. They gathered supplies and as the sun set they removed Chelsea from the fountain and looked over to Karen. From what there fellow gang members had described, this statue was of the person who seemed to cross them at every turn. Then they saw the book, which unfortunately for Karen, she had dropped while transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang had it all. While they couldn't use it, they knew how everything was done, and that the bitch was right in front of them and that they didn't have long to act before she could do something about it. Quickly Karen and Chelsea were placed in a truck and carried off to god knows where. Both girls were well aware of the situation and were equally scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Karen felt something else. She felt guilt. She had put Chelsea in this situation. She had thrown caution to the wind and taken on a crime fighting life that she wasn't ready for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced across the room from each other in what looked like a rather fancy office building. It looked like something out of a comic book. On the one side of the room was the statue of Chelsea and the book. Several men were there next to her, all holding drills and hammers. They could tear her apart at any moment. Would she be dead? Why were they not doing it? Maybe they wanted to make Karen suffer. Maybe it was a good thing that they didn't know Karen was aware of what was happening or Chelsea might be dead already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the stone Karen felt a drill on her neck. A gun was next to her as well. Looking around as much as she could, she could tell that she was being held up with every firearm she could think of. \"Where did they get all of these?\" Karen wondered. Time was up now.

The book had appeared and floats down onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale faced man panics as he sees that she has the book again, \"What!? How did she.....What are you idiots waiting for!? Kill her!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPistol and machine gun fire harmlessly bounce off of her and the drill that was placed at her neck snaps. Karen stands up and smiles at the boss. \"What? You look surprised! Its not that hard to figure out, at least, when you know how the book works. You see, the book only works for me, you know that. However, the only one that can use and mess with the book is me. You said you put white out on it. You simply covered up the wishes, you did not destroy them. See?\". She holds open the book to a page with a wish on it. On a patch of whiteout, glowing words start to emerge from underneath it as the spell reappears. \"Nice try though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at a book and placing a hand on it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Thank god I was right.....But I knew it! There is no way that simply covering the wishes of a master would stop it. This book is old, I probably couldn't even guess how old it is. The creator or one of the masters of the past must have put in fail safes like that. Good thing I REALIZED that. At lest thats what I think, I mean from what the voice told me and what I read in the note that came with it, I am suppose to use this book however I want and without  having to worry about the consequences, well thats what I want to believe. Now.....for MY revenge).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at the pale faced man and gives him a serious look, \"So you think you can take my friend hostage and threaten her, myself, and my friends and family? Hell no! And do yo honestly think that I believed that you would simply let us go? Please! I'm not so naive! The question you should be asking yourself now is this, \"how bad will I get it?\".

Those jeans were getting uncomfortably tight around her midsection, as her hips and ass grew as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted, though, by the fact that her tanned and freckled skin was darkening to an even golden bronze color. It was unblemished -- a few acne spots she\u2019d had on her forehead had disappeared entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face seemed to be changing subtly, too -- a smaller nose, fuller lips, higher cheekbones -- but she lost interest when she felt her bra tighten uncomfortably around her chest. She looked down to see two larger-than-usual mounds pressing against her chest. As quickly as she could, working through her shirt, she undid the Velcro that was holding the A-cup bra closed and wriggled out of the shoulder straps. The bra fell, emerging out of the bottom of her shirt, getting stuck below the waist on her more voluptuous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Karen looked up again, she saw that her eyes had changed from brown to a sparkling blue, and her reddish eyebrows were now slim, rounded, and black. The short red hair on her head suddenly darkened to black, but then it lightened again and began growing out as it further changed hue, becoming thick, wavy, and a platinum blonde color that was almost white. By the time it stopped, it was lush, full, and stretched down to her ass. She reached up to feel it, but recoiled when she grazed her scalp with an unexpectedly long fingernail. She looked down at her hands to see perfectly manicured nails, about an inch long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the clothes she\u2019d been wearing just disappeared. She looked into the mirror again and gasped at the unrecognizable figure she saw: her tanned, tall, curvy body, her beautiful face, and her platinum blonde hair with dark roots made her look like she\u2019d stepped out of a Playboy centerfold photo shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakeup faded onto her face. Her eyelids were a bright blue, her cheeks blushed red, her lips a glossy pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge gold hoop earrings popped into existence dangling from her earlobes, along with a gold stud in the left side of her nose. Rings appeared on a couple of her fingers, along with several gold bracelets on each arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud whirled around her briefly, and then she had on her school\u2019s cheerleading outfit: the gold-and-black sweater, skirt, and sneakers, plus white socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts pushed the \u201cR\u201d on the sweater further forward than they did on any of the other cheerleaders, she realized. She probably could have figured that she\u2019d end up like this: looking like all the other girls Brad dated, just a bit more extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. This probably wasn\u2019t worth it. Why waste the book\u2019s power on some shallow jock\u2019s idea of the perfect girl? She felt she had to get back to the book to make some more changes.</span></div></div>",

One faded into existence on the back of her closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the book open lying on her bed as she stood in front of the mirror and judged herself critically. She was short, barely 5\u20199\u201d. She was flat-chested, her breasts barely the size of a pair of cantaloupes. Her hair only went down to her ass; she was jealous of the girls whose hair extended to their knees or ankles, but hers just didn\u2019t want to grow any longer. She wore boring, out-of-style clothes, including the track team outfit she currently had on: tight gold-and-black long-sleeved sweater, skirt that came down to mid-thigh, sneakers, and white socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren hadn\u2019t realized the extent of the book\u2019s powers, and hadn\u2019t quite been specific enough; her command \u201cI have my normal body\u201d had kept her as the blonde bombshell of Brad Rogers\u2019s dreams, but had caused reality itself to change, even in her mind. Two minutes ago, the world would have considered her beautiful and jaw-droppingly sexy, but now she was just a nondescript 16-year-old who wouldn\u2019t get a second glance from a guy on the street. Even women\u2019s clothing styles were different, with what had been a high school cheerleading uniform becoming a normal high school girls\u2019 track team uniform, causing a chain reaction in what was considered acceptable attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back over to her bed and closed the book, moving it to her desk, deciding she\u2019d wait until the morning for any further changes. Sitting down on the bed, she kicked off her shoes and pulled off her socks, pulled her sweater off over her thick platinum blonde hair, and wriggled out of her skirt. She unhooked her 36DD bra to free what she believed to be her small breasts, and finally took off her thong. She tossed everything in the laundry hamper and got a look at her nude self in the newly created mirror. \u201cUgh,\u201d she thought, rummaging through her dresser drawers to find the least revealing sleepwear she had, a black midriff-baring camisole with matching French cut panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid into bed and turned out the light.</span></div></div>",

She looked in horror at the Mohawk she now had, sticking up proudly nearly a foot.  She reached up to touch her hairless sides of her head, but recoiled when she grazed herself with an unexpectedly long fingernail.

Her eyelids were painted in several different shades, her cheeks blushed maroon, her lips a glossy black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plethora of silver jewelry popped into existence, much of it piercing her flesh.  She now had a hoop through the outer edge of her left eyebrow, one through each nostril, one through each nipple, and a couple through her labia, not to mention a charm dangling from her navel.  Her earlobes were stretched by metal grommets that had wide-gauge silver hoops in them; much smaller hoops circled the outer edge of each ear.  She also had a couple of silver necklaces -- one with a pentagram pendant nestled just above her breasts -- and a small silver ring on each finger, plus the thumbs.  She could feel, from her tongue against the roof of her mouth, that it had something through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral colorful tattoos appeared:  a '50s pinup girl on her upper left arm, a mermaid on her upper right arm, a stars-and-crescent-moon design that would have been hidden by her pubic hair if she'd had any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud whirled around her briefly, and then she had on an outfit completely different from anything she'd ever worn before.  A black vinyl corset-style top pushed her copious breasts upward and ended in garters at the bottom that were attached to black fishnet stockings.  There was a matching vinyl bikini-style panty bottom and black platform shoes with stiletto heels that were forcing Karyn up onto her tiptoes -- but, she realized, it didn't seem uncomfortable at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black choker appeared around her neck, with silver letters on it:  they were backwards in the mirror, but Karen could still read it as saying \"SLUT.\"  She reached up to touch the letters, noting that she now had on fingerless fishnet gloves, and that her fingernails were painted a glossy black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like something out of the fantasies of someone with a serious fetish for Gothic and punk women.  At that moment, she felt a little sorry for Brad -- she figured Brad dated cheerleaders, rather than the few Goth girls at their school, so that his social standing wouldn't be affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, <i>her</i> social standing would definitely be affected, the way she looked now.  She'd stand out, and not necessarily in a positive way.  She couldn't be on the track and field team like this; large breasts aside, the piercings would either make her horny or rub the holes raw as she ran.  She felt she had to get back to the book to make some more changes.</span></div></div>",

Even the books on her bookshelf were gone, replaced by fetish and pornographic DVDs and magazines. The pink-and-white wallpaper disappeared from her walls, now painted black. Her Venetian blinds became thick curtains, appropriate for someone who\u2019d rather sleep during the day. Her princess canopy bed with its pink sheets turned into a contemporary-styled king-size model, the sheets a silvery satin underneath a comforter with a black-and-white tiger-stripe print. The chair in front of the computer desk was now a bizarre hybrid of an office chair and a throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked around, impressed, until her gaze fell on the closet. She\u2019d left the door open, and the contents hadn\u2019t changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, altering that only took another sentence in the book: MY WARDROBE IS ALSO THE WAY I WANT IT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCotton and denim became latex and vinyl; jeans and T-shirts became short skirts and cleavage-revealing tops; colors faded to black. The number of shoes on the closet floor doubled, then doubled again, becoming styles ranging from thigh-high boots to sandals, all with very high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren opened a dresser drawer to verify the contents -- yes, her underwear was now in the form of skimpy silk and lace bras and panties, mostly black, of course. She opened the next drawer up, and her eyes lit up. It was full of sex toys, from dildos and vibrators in a variety of sizes to nipple clamps, ben-wa balls, and a few items she actually didn\u2019t know the purpose of. Apparently the book had considered this part of her d\u00e9cor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the clock next to the bed. 11:45. That was of course early for her now, so she could go out with the book for some fun, but the contents of that drawer were looking mighty tempting right now.</span></div></div>",

The pleated skirt had come down to mid-thigh, but now it was short enough that it just barely covered Vanessa\u2019s ass. The bottom hem of the sweater had shortened so that it revealed Vanessa\u2019s taut midriff. And normal footwear with the outfit would have been blue-and-white athletic shoes and white socks, but Vanessa wore a pair of white vinyl boots that came up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Karen. \u201cJust one other change I want to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren wrote in the book, and Vanessa felt herself growing taller -- although she quickly realized it was because the boots now had platforms and high heels. She looked back up at the beautiful, voluptuous Goth. \u201cI can\u2019t do the routines dressed like this,\u201d she protested, although it sounded a bit ridiculous in the high-pitched chipmunk voice Karen had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but that\u2019s what I want to do -- break people <i>out</i> of their routines,\u201d Karen said with a smile on her black lips. She looked back at what she\u2019d just written, VANESSA\u2019S BOOTS ARE PLATFORM STYLE WITH HIGH HEELS, and then she added, VANESSA\u2019S BODY IS COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE IN HIGH HEELED SHOES. ANY SHOES SHE PUTS ON WILL TRANSFORM INTO A HIGH HEELED STYLE IF THEY\u2019RE NOT ALREADY. SHE IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITHOUT SHOES ON.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing obvious changed, although Karen had to take a quick breath at the thought of Vanessa being magically forced to wear sexy shoes at all times. That gave her inspiration for the next item. She wrote, ANY CLOTHES VANESSA PUTS ON WILL TRANSFORM TO BE REVEALING AND SEXY IF THEY\u2019RE NOT ALREADY. She tapped her pen and added, SHE WILL BE COMFORTABLE NO MATTER WHAT THE TEMPERATURE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you writing now?\u201d asked Vanessa a bit meekly. Her uniform hadn\u2019t changed further, since it was obviously revealing and sexy already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you later,\u201d said Karen, and then commanded, \u201cStrip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d replied Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, come on,\u201d protested Brad, a bit feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren narrowed her eyes and glared at him. He raised his hands to chest level, palms facing her, as if surrendering. Vanessa rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it,\u201d said Karen. \u201cI could <i>make</i> you do it.\u201d She wiggled the pen in her hand for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa sighed and slid the sweater up over her head, then pulled the skirt down, revealing a lacy black bra and matching panties that were not much bigger than a thong -- quite a change from the white \u201cgranny panties\u201d that usually went with the cheerleading uniform. She reached down to unzip the boots, but Karen said, \u201cLeave them on,\u201d not wanting to reveal the footwear curse yet. Vanessa glared briefly at her, then as defiantly as possible, she removed her bra and dropped it to the floor, then pulled the panties down and stepped out of them. She crossed her arms below her C-cup breasts, then dropped her arms to her sides again, realizing how that action had pushed her assets upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad tried to look nonchalant. Karen frowned. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of tan lines.\u201d Vanessa had obviously been wearing a bikini to lay out in the sun. \u201cFortunately, I can fix that,\u201d Karen continued, and wrote, VANESSA\u2019S SKIN IS EVENLY TANNED, PERMANENTLY. The triangular-shaped portions of Vanessa\u2019s skin that were lighter than the rest quickly darkened to a matching golden brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond of all,\u201d said Karen, \u201cit\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re a natural blonde, but I prefer the smooth look.\u201d She wrote, VANESSA HAS NO BODY HAIR in the book, then looked up to see that the neatly-trimmed triangle of blonde hair between Vanessa\u2019s thighs appeared to be receding into the skin. Karen briefly worried about the book\u2019s interpretation, but Vanessa\u2019s eyebrows, eyelashes, and the mid-back-length blonde hair on her scalp all remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd third of all,\u201d said Karen...</span></div></div>",

Karen could also see a barbell through her clit.

I don\u2019t even have one of those,\u201d Karen pointed out with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Vanessa dropped the navel jewelry and instead found the ring in her lower lip with her fingers. \u201cI-I\u2019m a <i>freak,\u201d</i> she wailed. \u201cThis is gonna get in the way and -- wait, do I have one on my <i>tongue,</i> too?\u201d She stuck her tongue out and felt the stud that had been implanted in it. \u201cYou stupid bitch!

And while I\u2019m at it...\u201d She wrote, VANESSA\u2019S FACE WILL MAGICALLY ALWAYS APPEAR TO BE MADE UP IN A SLUTTY STYLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren watched, delighted, as the colors that the cheerleader\u2019s face was painted with became more bright and vivid, her lips glossy, her eyelashes longer and darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I might as well give you a permanent manicure to go with that,\u201d said Karen, writing the appropriate command in the book. Vanessa\u2019s nails grew out, becoming shapely and even longer than Karen\u2019s, with the white tips of a French manicure. Vanessa looked down at her hands and tried to imagine living with these talons, long enough that they were starting to curl a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I think I should do something for that \u2018bitch\u2019 comment, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Karen rhetorically. \u201cMaybe I should ask Brad.\u201d She wrote, BRAD ROGERS WILL ALWAYS ANSWER ME TRUTHFULLY, and asked, \u201cWhat one more thing do you want me to do to Vanessa right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad answered -- with a weird expression on his face, as if he hadn\u2019t fully expected these words to come out of his mouth...</span></div></div>",

Vanessa dropped to her knees on the floor. \u201cOh, God, what did you do to me?!\u201d She obviously tried to avoid touching herself, but quickly moved one hand between her legs and the other hand to massage a nipple.

Well, maybe you do.\u201d She quickly wrote something in the magical book, then slammed it shut and got to her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had sat down in Karen\u2019s desk chair and was taking shallow breaths. The voluptuous Goth looked his way and warned, \u201cOnce the blood stops rushing to your midsection, you might get the idea to try writing in that book while I'm, uh, <i>distracted.</i> Well, I\u2019m warning you now, its magic won\u2019t let you do that -- and I just booby-trapped it to twist whatever you try to write anyway. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, but the glazed expression on his face -- and the obvious bulge in his pants -- made it obvious that his brain was entirely occupied anticipating the lesbian sex between his dream girl and an enhanced version of the girl who had been his date for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren began by leaning forward off the bed, reaching down to take Vanessa\u2019s face in her hands, and giving the cheerleader the most sensual French kiss she\u2019d ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suddenly had a sticky mess in his underwear.</span></div></div>",

Both girls were stunned as slutty makeup appeared on their faces, their fingernails grew out into manicured talons, and piercings popped into existence in a number of new locations.

She sat down on the toilet lid and masturbated, enjoying the sensations of playing with the rings that now pierced her labia until she came with an orgasm much bigger than she ever had before -- and then collapsing back into bed, assuming the whole thing had been a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most didn\u2019t discover their changes until they awoke Saturday morning to find themselves wearing high-heeled shoes, and different clothing than they\u2019d gone to bed in; finding their faces painted with makeup that couldn\u2019t be washed off; finding no more freckles, no more acne, no more frizzy hair; finding that they desperately needed sexual release, and that their thoughts of such seemed evenly divided between guys and gals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren slept past noon, but for now...</span></div></div>",

Outside, the giantess is rubbing her clit too... A few minutes later, they both orgasm, and Karen shoots all her juices in the giant woman's stomach... the giantess then sprays her non-existant juices all over the town...<br>\r\nKaren never wants this to end... she starts to take a nap inside the giant woman's belly...<br>\r\nA few hours later, Karen wakes up, and she's dripping wet. Still pretty cool, she thinks. Sadly, Karen has to end this sooner or later.<br>\r\n\"Pickle.\" says Karen, disappointed. The giantess disappears, and Karen floats back to her room. No one saw what just happened to Karen, or the giantess. They just carry on with their lives, not knowing of this wish-granting book. Karen thinks about being swallowed, and starts rubbing her clit again. After a session of that, she goes back to the book, happy with the erotic vore session she just had. What else to write, she thinks.</span></div></div>",

Before she knew it, she was sucking a penis. Her male clone's penis. She pushed the penis out of her mouth and told Katie: \"Katie, start licking my pussy.\" Katie did what Karen told her. Karen had just experienced getting vored, and now she's sucking a penis and having her pussy licked. She's in sex heaven. She started bobbing up and down on Keith's penis while she moaned from Katie's licking. She knew what was coming next. She was going to ejaculate all over her clone's face.

They had roomed together in college.  Chris had majored in filmmaking, and was hoping to make his big break into the film industry.  The problem was that he had a limited budget.  Percy had a sudden thought.  \"Hey, Chris, you'll never believe what I found!\"  Percy proceeded to explain about his magic book.<br>\r\nChris was skeptical.  \"And have you seen this thing actually work?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, well, no...\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\nPercy was not about to be dissuaded.  \"Tell you what.  We'll get Jessica in on this.\"  Jessica was Percy's close friend.  They had tried romance in the past, but it hadn't worked out for them.  Now they're just really close friends with no intention of trying romance again.  Jessica was also unemployed after college with a business degree.  The two walked to her apartment and Percy gave his spiel on the book again.  Jessica laughed and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Percy, for being a science major, you sure are wandering into the realm of dreams!\"<br>\r\nPercy frowned.  \"So you won't mind being the test subject of this?\"<br>\r\nJessica laughed.  \"Write away!  I'm not afraid of a book.\"<br>\r\nPercy picked up a pen and began to write.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, she realized that her legs had turned hard and gray, like stone!  The sensation continued upwards with Percy and Chris watching in amazement as Jessica was turned entirely to stone, freezing her look of shock as it finished with her face.  Her clothes remained normal, causing quite the contrast between their bright colors and Jessica's stony gray.  Chris turned to Percy.  \"Okay, now I believe you.  Can you change her back?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait...  I have an idea.  You know how my favorite movies have cool magical special effects, but I can't afford to put too many CGI effects into my movies?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"  Percy had a vague idea where this was going.<br>\r\n\"The three of us should go into business together!  We hire girls and you transform them with your book.  You can study the biological effects or something, I can use them in my movies as transformed actors so I don't have to use expensive special effects, and Jessica can be in charge of the business side of things!  It fits all of our degrees!\"<br>\r\nPercy thought about it.  \"I like it.  Let's see what Jessica thinks.\"  He scribbled in his book and she returned to normal.

Chris spent the next three weeks building a set and coming up with a script for his first movie, Jessica advertised and hired girls to work for them, offering slightly higher wages and more flexible hours than the local college workstudy program, and Percy sat around writing ideas on scratch paper that he wanted to try.  At the end of three weeks, they had hired fifty girls (they were counting on Chris making a fair penny off of his movies to pay them).  Most of the girls were only able to come for a couple hours a week, but they had a few that were there almost all day during business hours.  Chris was ready to get rolling with the filming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their first day of business, all fifty girls were there for a meeting.  They knew what the job entailed, but they hadn't actually seen this \"magic\" happen yet.  Most were quite skeptical and were just there for the money, but a few were genuinely curious.  Jessica began by making sure all of their paperwork was in order (they were a legitimate business, after all, and had to follow federal regulations).  Once this was taken care of, Percy took the floor.  \"As you are aware, this business specializes in transforming females physically.  Now, a few ground rules.  One, no complaints about sexism.  It's not our fault that the book only allows females to be transformed.\"  Percy knew he was stretching the truth a little, but he couldn't really undo that action.  \"Two, before you leave this building, you must be transformed back to your current state.  So no requests to be transformed into the greatest model ever or anything and then leave.  We aren't a fashion boutique.  Three, you will comply with any transformation requested of you unless you have an ethical reason against it.  That's what you're paid for.  Four, you will be required to be unclothed before most transformations.\"  Some of the girls began muttering about this.  \"This is not because we're male pigs, but because many of the transformations would wind up destroying your outfits.  All three of us went through special anti-harassment training in regards to your privacy, touching, etc. last week, which was run by the state.  This building has one-way glass, so you can see out but no one can see in.  You may find it convenient to be nude all of the time while you are here, as you don't know when you will be called upon to transform.  Five, there is a large private lounge on the south side of the building designed for your relaxation, as well as lockers to store your clothes.  The only time any of us will go into that lounge is to call one of you for business.  It is up to you to keep it clean.  Any questions or complaints shall be directed to our business manager, Jessica.  Now Chris will explain our first topic.\"<br>\r\nChris stepped forward.  \"All right, how many of you would like to be in a movie?\"  Several girls cheered.  \"Great, because that's our first project!

His story was about mermaid triplets who had the magical ability to shed their tails for legs whenever they pleased.  However, this would lead to trouble with other mermaids when they spend more time out of the water than in it.  Still no transformations or nudity had taken place aside from Jessica's becoming a statue weeks ago, so the girls that weren't being auditioned at the time got to relax in the lounge and get to know one another.  During business hours, there were usually ten to twenty of them on the clock at a time.  Finally, Chris was ready to began filming.  He wanted to start with the scenes of the mermaids out of the water first, as they would be less complicated.<br>\r\n\"Amber, we're going to film your scene first!\"  Amber came out of the lounge and found Percy, Chris, and Jessica standing on a fake beach leading into a pool.  \"We're going to start with your solo scene, where you're staring at the water and talking to yourself about whether you should give up your tail for good or not.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!  What will my costume be?\"<br>\r\nChris looked at Percy.  \"I knew we forgot something!  I don't have the budget for costumes!\"<br>\r\nAmber looked confused.  \"What kind of a movie company is this?\"<br>\r\n\"A new one,\" replied Jessica.  \"We're still working some problems.\"<br>\r\nPercy looked at her.  \"I've got it!\"  He quickly scribbled something in his book.  Jessica gave a yelp as her arms were sucked into her body.  She then fell over as her legs did the same, and her clothes seemed to deflate as her head was pulled in.  Percy rifled through her clothes and pulled out a bright red swimsuit.  \"We're paying all these girls to be here; let's use them!\"<br>\r\nAmber was shocked at the transformation.  She hadn't seen one before.  \"You want me to WEAR another girl?\"<br>\r\nPercy shrugged.  \"The alternative is to change your skin coloration.  Of course, you'd still be nude, and the only way around that is to totally eliminate all unmentionable parts, which could be really problematic come bathroom breaks.  Plus, you'd be limited to skin-tight outfits.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.  I suppose I can do that, especially as you just transformed your complaint department.\"<br>\r\nPercy grinned, embarrassed.  \"Oh, right.  I suppose we should use one of the employees, not the one who signs the paychecks.\"  He scribbled some more and laid the swimsuit on the ground.  It suddenly inflated and Jessica's head popped out, followed by her legs and arms.  Finally, the red cloth turned to peachy skin as her torso became human again.  She quickly got dressed and turned to Percy.<br>\r\n\"Could you give me some warning next time?  And like you said, we do have test subjects!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I was just testing it to see if it worked.  Chris, could you go fetch a potential swimsuit candidate, please?\"  Chris departed and came back with one of the girls, Jamie, who had already undressed.  \"Excellent.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you need me for?\"  Jamie looked quite nervous, but a little excited as well.<br>\r\n\"Well, we need you to become a swimsuit for Amber here.\"<br>\r\n\"A swimsuit?  How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n\"Easy.\"  Percy began scribbling.

We were wondering if you could come up with something else for us to do.\"<br>\r\nPercy glanced out the window.  It was a nice day, and they weren't that far from the beach.  \"How about a beach party?  You'll still be on the clock, of course, but right now we don't have much for you.  It won't be for another week that we'll begin filming the intense stuff.  Chris is just getting warmed up.\"<br>\r\n\"A beach party sounds great!

Come to me when you've got it figured out.\"  Chelsea ran back excitedly, and soon returned to tell Percy that they were divided up.  Percy walked over to the group of girls, who were standing outside of the lounge.  \"All right, so Chelsea tells me you girls would enjoy a beach party, but you don't have beach supplies.  There are four days until you're needed, so I had you divide into four groups.  Each group will get one day to go to the beach as you are.  The other three groups will spend the trip transformed.  This will help you get used to the feeling, as often you will be called upon to become various things, some of which may become inanimate.  So, Group 1, each of you may pick three girls not in your group to be your belongings.  Chelsea, why don't you go first?\"<br>\r\nOnce Groups 2, 3, and 4 had gone back into the lounge to undress, Chelsea picked out three girls, Ashley, Laura, and Kylee, and brought them over to Percy.  \"I want a one-piece swimsuit, a towel, and sunscreen.\"<br>\r\nThe girls looked slightly startled, as did Percy.  \"I'm not sure about sunscreen...  I don't know how well that would work.  I suppose we can try it, though.\"<br>\r\nAshley spoke up.  \"Wait.  You mean we'll actually become those things?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.

As Laura's arms and legs were sucked into her body, Ashley became flat.  Laura's head was sucked in next and Ashley became fuzzy, and finally Laura hollowed out as Ashley became rectangular.  Kylee's eyes were quite large as Chelsea undressed and slipped on Laura and flung Ashley over her shoulder.  Percy turned to Kylee.  \"I'm not sure how this will work, but here goes.\"</span></div></div>",

About half a minute after Percy<br>\r\nfinished writing in the book for Jessica to turn into a beach ball her bikini body<br>\r\nbegan reverting to its original form. Seeing that Chris comments, \"Well, I guess<br>\r\nthis is another limitation that we've discovered.\" So since they both walk away<br>\r\ndisappointed they don't see the full effect on Jessica. Phrasing is all important.<br>\r\nPercy had written that Jessica's bikini body was to transform into an inflatable<br>\r\nbeach ball. It was supposed to be filled with 50% air and also 50% Helium. It<br>\r\nwas to be inflatable to 6 feet in diameter, two feet per minute. He thought that<br>\r\nJessica would appreciate being blown up slowly. He added the Helium to the<br>\r\nmix so that she would be extremely buoyant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat actually occurred is after Jessica returned to her original body, her bust<br>\r\nwhich had been the bikini top started inflating rapidly with air and Helium! Then<br>\r\nwithin seconds of realizing her new predicament she called out to the boys. By<br>\r\nnow however her voice was very high pitched and getting higher from the Helium<br>\r\ninflating her. So no one heard her screams. By the time she had finished inflating<br>\r\nshe was pinned to the ceiling of the warehouse. She stays trapped there all night<br>\r\nextremely frustrated. In the morning when the lights come back on she removes<br>\r\none of her shoes to throw at the first person she sees. Unfortunately, her aim is<br>\r\na little too good and she knocks Percy out with her shoe. As others enter and<br>\r\nsee him unconscious no one looks in Jessica's direction. Chris asks a couple<br>\r\nof the girls to help him get Percy to a Doctor and he sends the rest of the girls<br>\r\nhome for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are now 3 questions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) How does Jessica get down from the ceiling?<br>\r\n2) Will Percy be alright and able to properly<br>\r\n    return Jessica to her original shape?<br>\r\n3) Does Jessica really want to return to her original<br>\r\n    shape or will she prefer staying an inflatable girl?</span></div></div>",

But he was starting to feel like he was in a rut. Just going through the motions every single day. School, Work, Sleep.. and then repeat each day. But one day he got an email saying that he had something in his school mailbox, which was weird because it wasn\u2019t the usual time for his parents to send a gift package, so he wondered who it could be from. He walker over to the mailroom and picked up the package. It was a medium sized box and he carried back over to his dorm. He finally got back to his dorm and began to open the package. It was a lot of filler paper and at the bottom was this really old-looking book with no words on the cover. He opened up the book and still couldn\u2019t find a name for it but it did have some writing in the cover. \u201cWhatever your heart desires, put the pen to the page, and it will come true\u201d. Steve thought to himself that this probably was some stupid motivational diary book that people write their feelings and life wishes into. He thought it probably was something that one of his family members sent him to cheer him up. He sat down and turned on the tv. It was some celebrity gossip news show and they were talking about the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. That\u2019s when Steve got a brilliant idea. He would write in the book some out of left field wish involving Meghan Markle and him swapping bodies because he thought to himself, \u201cWhy Not, There\u2019s no way that this would come true in a million years. So he put the book down on his desk and he pulled up a chair and sat at the desk. He grabbed a pen and opened up the book to one of the many blank pages and began to write, \u201cI wish that I would swap bodies and lives with Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. And after this swap has occurred I want the book to appear on the desk wherever my new body is at\u201d He thought this is going to be hilarious when I look back on this and this doesn\u2019t come true. Well how wrong he was as he began to feel an enormous wave of energy come over him. It hit him like a ton of bricks and he started to drift in and out of consciousness and finally blacked out. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tHe finally came to and when he woke up he was in a very fancy master bed room. \u201cThis is very weird, this looks nothing like my dorm room.\u201d He then felt a heavy weight on his chest and stomach and he pulled off the covers and he found something he would never have expected. He sees two DD cup breasts and he sees a rather large pregnant belly. He also notices that he has now Carmel colored skin as it seems that he is now mixed. \u201cThis is extremely weird, What is going on!!??\u201d He thought to himself. He decided to then get up and it was a struggle for him with all the new weight in the front of his now feminine body. He had to waddle now due to this rather large boulder now attached to his front. He found a master bathroom and it was covered in luxurious things and looked way too nice to be a normal person\u2019s bathroom. He turns on the light and gets another shock. His wish. It came true. What he saw in the mirror was the reflection of the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. [URL=https://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/2.40923392_zpso pygcgos.jpg.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/2.40923392_zpsopygcgos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r62...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\nThis was crazy, there was no way that he could have become a pregnant princess all because of what he wrote down in that strange book. THE BOOK!! He just realized that another part of his \u201cwish\u201d was that the book would appear in the room of his new body and him being in a new body, he now had to find the book that granted this wish. He waddled around the room and looked and found a book shelf and began to look through every single book to see if he could find the book that did this to him. He finally got to the very last book on the shelf and looked closely at it and recognized it as the one and only book he was looking for. He opened the book but had to take a second and place a hand on his now rather large belly in order to calm the passenger that was now strapped to his abdomen. He waddled over to the bed with the book and carefully sat down and began to open the book. He looked through the pages and found the page that he wrote on. The ink was turned into permanent print as the wish was completed. He then realized that he could undo this entire wish with just a pen and some writing. But he was contemplating whether or not to give this life a chance. He always wondered what it would be like to be apart of the royal family and what pregnancy might be like and this was his chance to experience all of that\u2026. Decisions decisions.</span></div></div>",

I want to do this by myself,\u201d Sarah responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Isabella said, completely unconvinced and shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral seconds later, there was a tremendous roar, the snapping of bones, the tearing of flesh, all overlaid with a horrible screaming that strangled off after several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Sarah shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Isabella heard the familiar clatter and crash of Sarah throwing her headset into her lap. With a sigh, Isabella directed her character to grab all of Sarah\u2019s dropped loot before skirting around the trap that had killed her partner\u2019s character and continuing down the dark and creepy corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have told me about that, you know,\u201d Sarah said glumly after putting her headset back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was trying to help you, but you said you wanted to do it on your own though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella heard a grumble from the other end of the line, but not the words beneath the breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Sarah spoke loudly enough to be understood, \u201cFine, it works out, I was going to have be getting off anyways. We still meeting up tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Isabella replied as she dodged around a revenant trying to remove her character\u2019s head before returning the favor. That cleared the path so that she could finally reach a safe spot. \u201cI\u2019ll be there around seven; that cool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, see ya then,\u201d Sarah said before signing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella shut down the game herself and groaned as she stretched her arms straight up, thankful to be able to get out of her seat finally. A clatter downstairs briefly diverted her attention, and a quick look at the clock confirmed that it was just the mail arriving. Grabbing her soda, she drained the last lukewarm swallow before wandering out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman was glad that high school was finally over, even though college was just around the corner relatively speaking. She was looking forward to getting out on her own to be sure, but she couldn\u2019t deny the knot in her stomach as well. Reaching the door, she shoved her thoughts aside as she picked up the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, bill, Publishers Clearing House, congratulations card from Uncle Ted,\u201d she muttered to herself as she sorted through the stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the bottom though, she furrowed her brow at the brown-paper wrapped package. The handwritten address attached to the front didn\u2019t have a return address, and it was made out for her, but included the fact that she lived in the third room on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair on the back of her neck rose as she tossed the rest of the mail on the table before retreating to her room, never taking her eyes off of the package. Once in her room, she considered getting rid of whatever it was, as well as maybe leaving it alone and waiting for her parents to get back home. Instead, she carefully split the paper and eased the package open. Dropping onto her bed was a leather bound book with weird symbols and markings on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, she picked up the book and thought she felt a tingle travel up her arm, but dismissed it as just nerves. A suddenly glow seemed to radiate from the odd book, but that was absurd, almost as absurd as the book being addressed to her specific room in her family home. Flipping it open randomly, she saw that the pages were all blank, every last one of them as she flipped through. That was until she came to the first page. Suddenly dark ink started to appear, tracing out letters and then words and a voice seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE NEXT MASTER HAS BEEN FOUND, BEGINNING EXPLANATION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE BOOK YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING DOES NOT HAVE A TRUE NAME, THOUGH IT HAS BEEN CALLED A LOT IN THE PAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS THE CURRENT MASTER, ALL YOUR DESIRES, DREAMS, ANYTHING YOU WANT WILL BE GRANTED, AS LONG AS YOU WRITE IT DOWN IN THIS BOOK. ONLY THE MASTER CAN WRITE IN THE BOOK. THE BOOK CAN NOT BE PERMANENTLY DESTROYED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE CURRENT MASTER. THE BOOK WILL ONLY SWITCH MASTERS UPON THE MASTERS WISH OR HIS/HER DEATH.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella yelped and dropped the book as she jumped backwards in fright. After several seconds of nothing else happening, she edged closer to where the book had fallen to the floor. She poked it with her toe before jumping back again. She repeated that again before slowly reaching down and touching the warm cover and finally picking it up again. No more mysterious text appeared and no more voice came from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze, is this someone\u2019s idea of a prank? Did Sarah do this to me just so she can have a laugh?\u201d she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she thought about it, the more she felt like this had to be a prank. Sarah had been to her house and her room, so that was an explanation for that part, the handwriting didn\u2019t match her friend\u2019s but that could be easily explained as her having someone else write it for her. The text that suddenly appeared was probably just some type of invisible ink that appeared after the book was opened, and the voice\u2026well, she couldn\u2019t find the speaker, but there had to be one here somewhere\u2026right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if there really was a magical book that could fulfill her every desire. She laughed as told herself that, before sitting down on the bed. <i>I\u2019ll just jot something in here and show it to Sarah. She\u2019ll have a great big laugh and we can get on with the night</i> she thought to herself as she reached for a pencil in her bedside table. Turning to the first blank page, she set to writing.</span></div></div>",

The drawing depicted an anthro cow woman lounging before what was perhaps a beachside sunset; she hadn\u2019t quite decided on the background completely. Looking back down at the supposed wishing book, Isabella let out another laugh as she wrote down the sentence \u201cI am an anthro cow.\u201d Sarah knew all about Isabella\u2019s furry art, so they would both have a laugh and they could be done with this freaky book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I can ask her about how she did that voice too</i> Isabella mused as nothing happened as she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was setting the pencil back down where there was a sudden blinding flash. Blinking several times to clear her vision, she then furrowed her brow as she tried to make sense of what she was seeing. Her gaze was frozen on her hand still holding the pencil\u2026but it wasn\u2019t her hand, not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack and white fur covered her hand, as well as the arm above it. In an instant, the pencil was dropped and the book was tossed aside as Isabella rushed across the hall to the bathroom. Flicking on the light, she again froze as she saw herself in the mirror, or at least the self that she had become. Her naturally curvy figure had been turned up to eleven. Her breasts, hips, and rump had all expanded dramatically, making the young woman look almost exactly as she had envisioned for her drawing, but not quite had the nerve to actually put onto paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a hand to touch the top of her head, Isabella saw her reflection do the same, as well as feeling one of the horns peeking through her hair. Sticking out her tongue, doing jazz hands, and even balancing on one leg, all her motions were repeated by what could only be her reflection. But there wasn\u2019t any possible way for this to happen; she was a human girl, not an anthro cow. Pinching and even slapping herself did nothing to dispel what couldn\u2019t be true. But there it was, staring her in the face: her new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could that book really have worked?</i> she wondered while staring wide eyed at her bovine reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the mirror and shutting off the light, she dashed back to her room.</span></div></div>",

There was her mom and dad smiling towards the camera and between them should have been Isabella. And she supposed it was, but rather than a rather average teenage girl as it should have been and had been as of a couple of minutes ago, there was an anthro cow that looked like a younger version of how she looked now. In the photo, she was even still wearing the shirt that read \u201cHelp me, I\u2019m on a family vacation\u201d that her mom had gotten here while there. She still remembered how she had to fake a smile when her mom presented that gift to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella thought that perhaps she should write in the book again and change back, but the more she thought about it, the more right it felt. She wasn\u2019t quite sure that she would have chosen this body if she had known that it would really have worked. Now that she had it though, she was actually starting to enjoy it. So she instead picked up the book, and closed it before placing it on her nightstand. Then she sped downstairs, made herself a quick lunch, and returned to her room to start up a single player game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later, her mother returned home from work. Isabella had been half expecting it, but it was still a bit surprising that her still human mother didn\u2019t react at all to what should have been quite a big change in her daughter. Instead, she just wanted to know if Isabella was heading out to meet her friend again tonight. After confirming that, Isabella returned to her game till it was almost time for her to meet Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into a tight fitting t-shirt and jeans, Isabella hopped in her car and headed off across the city. She parked her car and then headed through the doors into the mall. She was only marginally surprised that no one around her batted an eye at the anthro cow walking along like nothing out of the ordinary. She was more than a little shocked at Sarah\u2019s reaction when she told her about the change though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really, I wasn\u2019t like this earlier today. It all happened after we stopped playing co-op,\u201d Isabella stressed yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rotund friend scoffed as she had all the previous times, \u201cGive it up, Izzy. No matter how many times you say that, it just isn\u2019t true.\u201d As she scanned through the shelf of games, she continued, \u201cYou\u2019re the same girl that I\u2019ve known since the first grade, and that is that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella was getting a bit fed up with this, but then a thought occurred to her. \u201cFine, you don\u2019t think that weird book really changed me? How about I prove it by changing you too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finally looked up and shrugged her shoulders before returning her attention to the shelf before her. Isabella then pulled out the book from her back pocket, flipped to the page where she had made her first wish and started writing, \u201cSarah is\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Isabella finished, there was another blinding flash of light. As she tried to clear the spots from her eyes again, she wondered if there might be any risk of permanent damage from being blinded by the book like that too many times. When she could see again, she saw that the book had indeed worked its magic yet again. Isabella had thought that maybe if Sarah was the one undergoing the change, maybe she would be aware of it too. That idea had been proven false though as Sarah was still looking through the rack of games, the small claws on her fingers tracing across the cases and the scales on her hand and arm completely obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking the new Sarah over, Isabella realized that she must have been thinking of that time when Sarah had Isabella sketch her as an anthro dragoness. They had a laugh after they were finished, but Isabella never told her friend of the second one she made later that night. While the first one that Sarah knew about had been pretty close to her plump shape, Isabella drew her much larger in the second case. Judging from how big Sarah was now, Isabella had definitely been thinking of the second sketch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine\u2019s eyes traced up over the much thicker thighs, rounder rump, swollen stomach, and the blimp-like breasts the other now possessed. Sarah\u2019s new body put even that secret drawing to shame. There were curves in all the right places and all topped off with glittering red scales that were each like a ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, trying to see if your \u2018magic\u2019 book actually did anything?\u201d Sarah asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Isabella didn\u2019t respond, Sarah turned around to check out a different shelf of games. Her thick tail caught on a rack of games as she turned though, knocking the whole set to the floor with a clatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up front, Isabella heard the manager say, \u201cWas that you again, Sarah?\u201d When she confirmed it, he groaned. Then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep your tail under control, you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the scales, Isabella could tell Sarah was blushing as she bent down and started to pick up the mess. Her size and weight was obviously making the task a bit challenging, so Isabella slipped the book way again and helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after they left the store with their purchases, Isabella\u2019s mind grappled with the idea that she had the power to change reality all because of that strange book. Shaking her head, she realized that she had been idly staring at the shifting hills of Sarah\u2019s butt. Bobbing up and down, they were rather hypnotic. Tearing her gaze away, she mused that Sarah carried the extra weight well. The fact that the much heavier young woman was a dragoness now too just made it even better for Isabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in her tracks as a thought occurred to her. She had wanted to be more than just friends with Sarah for years, but had never acted on the desire and hidden it away in fear of messing up their friendship. With the book in her hand however, she wouldn\u2019t have to fear something like that. In fact, she could bring an aspect to their relationship that she had wanted but would never have done before. Pulling out the book and pencil again, she started to write.</span></div></div>",

THIS BOOK WILL GRANT WHATEVER YOU DESIRE. USE IT HOWEVER YOU SEE FIT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Some kind of joke? Like some silly book can grant any wish\". He decides to pick it up to examine it. (See first page!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is a bit surprised by this, but he doesn't drop the book. Spending the next several minutes examining the room, he can find no explanation to the voice that had seemed to appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening to a random page, he pulls out a pen, his scientific curiosity getting the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm in testing this, but what to try, it should be something so complex or unexpected that there is no way someone can fool me into believing that this is real..... I got it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing a space on the metal table, he begins to write. HAVE A VERY SMALL SUN APPEAR JUST ABOVE THE CLEARED AREA I MADE. \"Now this will prove that this is a hoax!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall orange and red balls of light start to gather as the entire area above the table starts to glow. He watches in surprise and fascination as a mini sun materializes in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, this can't be real, but there is no other way to explain this!\". He makes sure that the sun can't cause any damage to himself or the area around him, he then does a few tests to make sure it's real, and it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huge grin, \"there is no way that anyone could make a sun, this has to be real. So much power, but what to do with it?\".</span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes and starting to concentrate, his feet slowly lifts off of the ground. Immediately looking down, he sees that he really is floating in midair.

It suddenly vanishes and he flies closer to it. The island suddenly reappears, he had made it cloaked from a certain distance. A river flows down form a mountain to a lake in the center and then out to the sea and the entire rest of the new island is covered in a dense forest. There is a large mansion by the lake, where he plans on living. He had decided to leave his old life, wanting to continue his experiments here.</span></div></div>",

It gives a low hiss and leaves through a large door and back into the forest. \"That's enough for today\", saying out loud, heading back into the main building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lays down on the couch, stretches, and turns on a giant TV. Flipping through the channels, something makes him stop at a particular channel. \"Ah!\", he says, \"it's my old school!\". The very high school that he was given the book in was on a new's channel, but something was wrong. There were police cars surrounding the school. He immediately turns up the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little while ago, a bank was robbed, the police soon responded and a high speed chase ensued. The 3 armed men then took refuge in the school behind me. The entire school has been evacuated, except for one room which the men have taken the teacher and his students as hostages\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera zooms in, and it was one of Zack's classes. They focus on the people that could be seen and he recognizes them, his old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great.......sigh. I guess I can't leave them like that\". The book suddenly appears. He grabs it and gets to his feet. \"But how should I do this? I probably shouldn't show myself, a disguise maybe?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is focused on the room.

Some police man started giving orders to him, trying to get him to go towards them, who he is, things like that. Zack doesn't give them a second thought, instead, he says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Estilth, show yourself\". A giant ball of fire appears in front of him, revealing a girl as it dies down. She is short and has average breasts with short red hair and blue eyes. \"What do ya want?\", she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to make sure no one follows me inside\". \"Roger!\", she says, giving him a salute while floating slightly off the ground. Opening the door, \"don't hurt anyone\", he says, going inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight outside the room, he hears the men talking. They are mad, trying to figure out what to do and how to use the hostages. Fortunately, they don't realize hes there, yet. And he is watching them, waiting for a good opportunity to stop them. Sure, he could use the book, but he doesn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets his chance, one of the men walks past the door. His right hand immediately goes through and grabs him by the back of his neck and is pulled through, the door easily giving away. Some of the people inside scream, surprised by a hand grabbing someone through a door. The remaining 2 are trying to get them to shut up as one of them draws his weapon and goes to see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down the hallway to the left, he sees something that surprises him, he immediately starts unloading his weapon, but it's no good. Something grabs hold of him and pulls him into the hall. More screams, and the last robber presses his back against the back wall, forcing a few people in front of him, his gun pointing at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it can't be helped\", he says. He reveals himself, stepping into the room through the open door. \"S-so you took out the other 2\", the man nervously says. \"Yeah, what of it\", Kyle says back. This upsets the man even more and he points the gun at him. \"I want you to stay there, or I'll kill them!\". Kyle isn't deterred by this and takes a few steps forward. The man fires at him, followed by screams from the hostages. The bullets harmlessly bounce off of him. The man runs out of ammo. Kyle uses this chance and tells the other hostages, the one the man isn't threatening, to run for it, and they do. The man now only has 1 girl as his hostage. And she happens to be an old childhood friend of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name is Faith, a girl with long blond hair, blue eyes, and a killer body. The man had dropped his gun and now has a knife at her throat. He keeps threatening him and telling him to stay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts thinking. \"Now what......There is a lot I can do.....but what to choose.....Hm?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand comes out of the wall directly behind them and grabs the man by his shoulder. They both let out a surprised yell as another hand appears and grabs the knife from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Estilth, she is emerging from the wall that the man and Faith are against. \"Hello!\", she says, latching onto him. This frees Faith and she quickly puts some distance between her and her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though you were guarding the entrance Estilth\". She smiles at him, \"well, I was, but with the sudden shooting and screaming, followed by those people running out of the building, I couldn't keep guarding the entrance without guaranteeing that someone wasn't going to get hurt. So, I decided to come help you\". \"....I see, that was probably the best choice. Good work\". Her smile gets even bigger. Kyle looks at Faith, \"are you alright?\", he asks. She nervously nods. \"Good\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle opens the book and writes something in it, a long white rope appears out of nowhere and wraps around the man. Estilth lets go, completely separates herself from the wall and floats on over to his side. \"Let's go home\", he tells her. Still smiling, she nods, \"alright, lets go Ky------I mean master\".</span></div></div>",

So, he asks the book to brink a real demon in front of him, and hear I am\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Ok, but why are you still here? And I though you were suppose to have a tail, you look like a normal girl\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, the tail, I do have a black tail and black wings, but I can hide them, and I'm still here because I want to, he did offer to send me back, but I'm enjoying it here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is still hard to believe, but I guss with what's happened, I have to. Anyway, it's nice to meet you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, but I do have one last thing to tell you, it has been a month since he made this place, the stories I could tell you. This mansion, the entire island is filled with his tests and experiments, it isn't dangerous here, but I can't even begin to tell you some of the strange things that has happened to me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to spoil the surprise, you'll find out, eventually\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Looking around, trying to find it's source, her eyes eventually come to rest on Estilth, who is rubbing her stomach. It happens again, and she realizes the noise is coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm hungry. That's right, Zack called on me when I was hunting, I haven't eaten anything today\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I guess we should go to the kitchen?\", Faith nervously asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstilth looks up, \"....I guess.... Forget it, I know what I want to eat, ant I'm staring at it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But you can't eat me! Aren't we friends?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but your forgetting 2 things. 1st you won't die, and 2nd..... I'm a DEMON!\", and she lunges at Faith, who lets out a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can react, Estilth grabs her and lifts her into the air. Faith struggles in vain, \"you can't escape! I'm far stronger than you humans!'. She then shovers Faith's head in her mouth. Faith easily slides down her throught and into the demon's belly. Once she was in deep enough, Estilth grabs her ass and shoves her in deeper, with the last obstacle out of the way, she easily slurps down Faith's lets and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her stomach and letting out a small burp, \"Ah! You humans always taste so good!\". Getting back into the bath and laying back, she lets out a yawn, \"I always get so tired after a large meal! I guess I'll take a quick nap\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to curl up in the small space of Estilth's stomach, Faith can feel herself being digested. But, it doesn't hurt, it's actually the opposite! It feels amazing! Watching more and more of herself dissolve and join the liquid puddle, she can only guess that it was because of Zack and the book.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely liquefied, she is surprised to find herself still conscience. But she doesn't stay in her gut for long, she suddenly finds herself being pulled into her intestines. Felling herself getting smaller as she continues her journey, she feels only pleasure. Slowing down, she feels herself hardening and being compacted as whats left of her reaches it's final destination. All she can do now is wait for Estilth to wake from her nap.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, Estilth scratches her head and gets to her feet. She then remembers what happened. \"that's right\", she says, looking at her once again flat stomach. \".....Looks like its time to let her out\", saying out loud, feeling Faith pushing against her backdoor. Opening the door to the toilet, she sits down and releases her friend. \"You were great, both in and out, I am definately going to eat you again, well, cya in a bit!', and she flushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Faith sees before blacking out was Estilth staring down at her as she spins and gets sucked into the toilet.....</span></div></div>",

I-is the liquid dangerous?<br>\r\nEstilth: Oh no, it just melts whatever it touches.<br>\r\nFaith: !!!!! M-melt!? I don't want to melt! Why didn't you say anything!?<br>\r\nEstilth: I did. I did warn you about Zack's experiments and tests out here. And your forgetting, I'm a demon. I'm not so kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange sensation overtakes Faith as she starts to stumble. Estilth looks on, grinning, and with an evil laugh, \"it's starting! This should be interesting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith stumbles to the ground as the demon walks over to her and pulls at her arm. It stretches a bit, the first sign that Faith's body will soon be a liquid. Her face then lights up. \"I just got a great idea!

She then just stares at her, completely concentrating and waiting for whatever it is that she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, and Estilth places her hands over Faith, \"it's time, your body should be soft enough now\".<br>\r\nFaith: W-wha-what are y-yo-you goi-ing to d-do?<br>\r\nEstilth: You'll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, the sky seems to turn darker and a deep, blood red glow surrounds Estilth. She begins to chant in some unknown language and then proceed to zap Faith with the red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith just lays there, panting, the light giving indescribable pleasure. She just looks at Estilth who begins to explain what she just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstilth: You want to know what I just did to you, don't ya? It's actually pretty simple. Using my awesome demon magic, I stopped you from melting; however, I did not undo what the liquid already did to you.Your body has been softened, to just the right point so that I can have a few cheap laughs and some fun at your expense. I'm such a demon, aren't I? So the question now is, what will I turn you into first?\".</span></div></div>",

Its over there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fairly large tree was sitting in the corner of her room, but it doesnt look like any tree that she has ever seen.<br>\r\n\"Ya see, Zack made that for me, but, its kind of hard to take care of. I dont have to do it that often, but every now and then I have to give it a special fertilizer that I made, its the only way to keep it alive outside of letting it stay on the island\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you need my help for that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you seem, well, actually, give me a second\". The girl walks over to a closet and wheels out a small container. \"This is it, but its missing the crucial ingredient\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\", was all she could say before the girl was on her. Stronger than she looks, she holds Faith down. \"I know I look like a child, but I'm far older than you\". She flips Faith over, and then, after opening her mouth impossibly wide, puts her, ass first, into her mouth and swallows. Faith melts upon contact with the girl's digestive juices. The girl burps, and the only visible trace of Faith is the small bulge in her gut. \"Aahhh! I hope you have a nice trip through me!\". Sitting on her bed, \"now then, gotta do this carefully.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, and theres a knock at her door. Zack and Estilth enter. \"Hey there Lily, have you seen a girl with blond hair and blue eyes come by?\".<br>\r\n\"Nope, no one like that. I'll tell you if I see her\".<br>\r\n\"Alright\", and they leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 2 hours pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! Ah~! Its time!\". Getting up, she slowly struts over to the plant. Taking a small shovel, she digs a small hole by the base of the tree and then tosses it aside. Sliding down her panties, she flips her skirt and points her ass at a wall mirror. \"You want out?\", she says, giving her ass a shake. She then squats down above the hole she dug and starts to push. Lily effortlessly expels Faith from her butt, she turns around, \"you were amazing\", she starts, \"we should do this again, oh, and thanks for your help!\". She fills in the hole and then puts the rest of her special fertilizer around the tree. \"Good. Now he'll be ok for a while.....\".</span></div></div>",

After his head fell down on the desk for the third time, he noticed a strange book in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary grabbed it and slowly brought it up to his desk, trying to keep anyone else, especially the teacher, from seeing it. As soon as it touched the desk, the book flung itself open to a blank page. Gary was a bit surprised by this, but it was so unusual that he wasn't sure if he had accidentally let it slip from his hand or something. That idea went out the window when the book started writing in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE WISH YOU WRITE SHALL BE GRANTED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary became a little nervous seeing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\" He whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWRITE YOUR DESIRES<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid that he would anger the strange book if he did nothing, Gary quickly took out a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANYTHING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around room. Mr. Penton was busy writing something at the black board. Gary didn't like him much, he always scolded him about not trying hard enough and not paying attention in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want Mr. Penton to be more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than it was written, Mr.Penton started changing. He first became much, much thinner, so much so that only his face was recognizable. But that would not last long, as his thin layer of gray hair suddenly started to come alive and shoot out in short pulses, gaining a faint golden color with every growth. As this happened, his face and body began to change more. In the beginning, it was only his loss of height that was noticeable, but soon Gary could see that Mr. Penton was getting younger too, but that wasn't all, his face was starting to look really strange. By this time, his voice was also completely different, it was much higher, and his inflections were sounded out differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the transformation really took off. The no longer old teacher's hair went through two more spurts of growth that were much larger than before, and finally came to rest halfway down his back. His body took on a hourglass shape, especially as his chest expanded into two noticeable mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all over, there was no longer a Mr. Penton in front of the class, but a young girl with glasses and a ponytail, younger than most of her students even, dressed in a dark sweater over a light colored shirt, short skirt, and very long striped stockings.</span></div></div>",

He was apparently the only one who thought that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that it worked! This book is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned as he thought of all the things he could do with it, though he couldn't decide where to start, at least not until his eyes happened to land on Robert. He was, in short, a jerk and constantly went out of his way to bully people for no reason. Gary was a constant victim, and right now nothing was more attractive them reversing their roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary decided to \"accidentally\" bump into Robert after class to get his attention, but when the bell rang, Robert made the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy.\" Gary chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need math homework, I know you got it, so give it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way for a servant to act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert began to look angry, he was impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look freak, math is in two periods. I don't have time to stand around, but if you don't give it to me, you'll regret it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary laughed. \"Maybe if I didn't have this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary held up the book, with a newly written wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROBERT WILL BE MY OBEDIENT MAID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden gust of wind blew across the classroom, but only Gary and Robert seemed to notice. The swirling air merely passed over Gary, it was much more interested in Robert, who was being wrapped by the wind. The air looked more like some kind of fabric or web as it bound itself to Robert's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? Get this stuff away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert began to run around desperately trying to escape the magic wind, but it was impossible. He ended up tripping over a chair and fell to the ground. After a few seconds, the wind broke away from him and disappeared. Robert was left panting on the floor, though there was something different about him, to say the least. He was a tall maid wearing a white apron over a black dress. When Robert caught his breath, he looked down at himself and screamed, his voice of course unrecognizable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what did you do to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his long hair in disbelief before bringing his shaky petite hands down to cup his newly acquired breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was distracted by his new body, Gary confidently strode up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's very real, \"Roberta\". You are finally going to make up for being a thorn in my side, after all this time. From now until I get bored of you, you will work for me and do everything I say. Now, get up, at attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stood straight up quickly with his hands folded in front of him.</span></div></div>",

One reason is his 8 1/2 months pregnant teacher Mrs. Alvarez. Ever aince she got pregnant, she started getting moody because of her hormones. She has graded his work very precisely like he is supposed to have professional work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the book<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn decides to try and use the book to get a better grade. He thinks the only way is to swap bodies with the teacher. He pulls out the book and begins to write,\"I wish that I could swap lives and bodies with Mrs. Alvarez...,\" He pauses. The book suddenly begins to write words itself.\"for the the rest of our lives.\" It finishes since John was not specific about the time of length his wish was. John sees this and suddenly blacks out after a huge power came before him like he has never felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly opens his eyes. He notices he is sitting in a much more comfortable chair and is now behind Mrs. Alvarez desk. Long brown hair falls in front of his eyes. No one is in the classroom right now, presumably for lunch. He looks down and sees two DD cup breasts, swollen and filled with milk, hanging off his chest and laying on top of a big pregnant belly.  This all starts to hit John, he was now Mrs. Alvarez, pregnant and all. He has trouble getting on his swollen feet because of the new weight. He finally pulled himself up, yet almost fell over because of all the weight in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddles down the hall, to the bathroom. He looks in the mirror and sees his former photography teacher.

He sat down behind Mrs. Alvarez desk when all of her memories suddenly began to infiltrate his mind. Being 36 weeks pregnant. Teaching. Getting married and living in a family house. Having twin brothers. All of her memories. Including the password in order to get in the database to change grades. He added all As to his classes. He began to stroke his new pregnant belly. A weird voice in his head said \" Have fun in your new life. You are stuck like this forever since you thought it was a good idea to cheat in order to get ahead. You are trapped in her life and body forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next for John</span></div></div>",

Now, as the voice had already told him, he could never go back to his normal life. He was stuck as his 32 year old, 34 weeks pregnant, art teacher at his crummy school. He was a senior in high school and about to go to a very prestigious college. He could have been anything his heart desired, though he already had decided on bio engineering as a perfect study for himself. He rubbed his now big pregnant belly while sitting at his new teachers desk. \"At least I only have to wait 6 more weeks before I have to give birth. And I get 3 months paid leave for having a baby. Ohh crap I am gonna have to give birth to this thing inside my new gigantic belly.\" He thought to himself. The lunch bell rang, and students from 1st lunch were about to start filing into the classroom. She searched all over the big desk for a lesson plan, when all of the memories of teaching begin filling her head. \"Wow, this is weird all of this art stuff.\" She thought. She struggled to stand up again as she was still not used to being a pregnant woman. She was finally able to pull her new big body up and put some papers filed away where she remembered when out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a snot nose kid's phone camera pointed directly at her. She remembered that the kid always seemed to point his camera at her almost every day throughout her pregnancy since school had started. She pretended not to notice and the kid put his phone away pretty quickly after snapping that picture of the pregnant teacher. <br>\r\n[URL=http://s1175.photobucket.com/user/bfine2525/media/Pregnant/20160122_123 218_zpsndhlfhfj.jpg.html][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/20160122_123218_zpsndhlfhfj.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to \"John\" Next?</span></div></div>",

His plan was to have Sarah stay after school to help select art pieces for the school art show. He would use the alone time with Sarah as sort of girl talk time and learn more about her interests. So with that plan the day was about to start. Mrs. Alvarez\u2019s memories of teaching kicked in and he was able to come up with a lesson plan for the day. The final morning bell rang and he got up carefully from his teachers desk and rested a hand on his enlarged belly and waddled to the front of the class. \u201cHello class, how is everyone doing this morning?\u201d He said with Sandra\u2019s voice. The usual high school moans and groans of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201calright\u201d followed suit, and using Mrs. Alvarez\u2019s memories, he remembered that this class was working on a project and was continuing working on it today, \u201c So you guys are going to continue to work on your project and if you guys have any questions I will be at my desk, so you guys can get started and get to work.\u201d He announced to the class. He waddled back over to the teachers desk and again carefully sat down as to not hurt the baby. He placed a hand on his belly to soothe the flurry of kicks coming and started to do some teacher work on his computer. Fortunately not a single kid had a question about art the entire class period. The class period flew by and before Sarah left, he called her over to his desk.  <br>\r\n\u201cHey Mrs. Alvarez, what\u2019s up?\u201d She said. <br>\r\n\u201cUmm well you seem to be doing really well in my class and I was wondering if you could help me select art projects for the art show in a month. Is there any way you could stay after school for like an hour or so to help?\u201d He asks her. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure Mrs. Alvarez, I would love to help out, also how are you doing with the baby?\u201d Sarah says to him <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great and I am doing really well actually, this girl might be a soccer star in the future cause she is kicking up a storm in her momma\u2019s belly. Do you want to feel it?\u201d He said. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s so cool.\u201d She says as she walks over and puts a hand on his pregnant belly. She even got to feel a kick, which they both looked at each other and smiled. <br>\r\n\u201cHere I will right you a pass so you are not late to your next class.\u201d He says to her. </span></div></div>",

She winces as the sensation hits her, but then vanishes a second later. She doesn't give it a second thought, that is until someone screamed.

It continues to get larger and larger, but she doesn't gain any weight. Instead, she starts to lift up off of the ground, only stopping when she hit the ceiling.....</span></div></div>",

Writing in the book, EXPLAIN WHAT JUST HAPPENED? Underneath his question the book wrote, ONLY WHAT THE MASTER WRITES WILL BE HONORED BY THIS BOOK. ALL OTHER ATTEMPTS WILL BE ERASED WITHOUT MERCY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consulting the book some more, Kevin learns that others can make the book work, one time only, with the MASTERS permission. However, there is a small catch that Kevin decides Tina really doesn't need to know about. In the hands of another, the book works under the principle [that what's good for the goose is doubly good for the gander]. Whichever way the genders work. So with a little smirk on his face, Kevin happily hands the book back to Tina. \"What's so funny?\" she asked. Kevin replied, \"Oh, nothing much. You'll see soon enough.\" His demeanor and statement unsettles Tina for a few seconds but she goes ahead with her plan anyways.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nStanding there looking at Kevin, Tina decides to have have some fun with him. For the first time in her life, Tina has taken a real hard look at Kevin and she has noticed that he's a pretty cute looking guy. So she decides while she's at it, to get a little something for herself. Writing in the book, FOR SAMANTHA, HEATHER AND MYSELF, MAKE KEVIN'S PECTORAL MUSCLES INFLATE AS UNPOPPABLE BALLOONS FOR ONE MINUTE. FROM THEN ON, WHENEVER ANY OF US TOUCHES BOTH SIDES OF HIS CHEST WITH BARE HANDS, HE FLOATS COMPLETELY OFF THE GROUND. AFTER THAT, KEVIN'S BODY WILL BE UNABLE TO TOUCH THE GROUND AGAIN UNTIL HE'S KISSED. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there looking at Kevin while he inflates, Tina really starts warming up inside. She now realizes that she chose the wrong part of Kevin to make bigger. Thinking to herself, {Well that shouldn't be to difficult to fix.} Tina looks for the book to write some more in it, but it has seemingly disappeared. By now, the minute has finished and his shirt is now in tatters. Which really makes it easy for Tina to touch his chest just as she wrote in the book. Looking at Kevin, Tina is quite annoyed to see him enjoying his newly muscled body WAY too much. So Tina decides it's time for him to start floating like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo sending Kevin off into the wild blue yonder, gives Tina a chill all the way down her back which surprises her by just how much she really, really likes the feeling. Then again, Tina has absolutely no idea that very soon, she'll join Kevin floating in the air. Tina will learn soon enough about the book's real \"wicked\" sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing no one near by, I opened it, hearing its long proclamation and seeing the words appear on the blank page. I was frozen in shock, glad that no one around me could hear it. Considering that I was hearing this random voice, I thought something as up and just brought what I had to class and left my things in my locker. Once I got into class, I sat in my desk near the back, realizing all I had with me was my empty book bag and a pen. I looked around, deciding to test this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly wrote in, THE SUPPLIES I WAS GOING TO GET FROM MY LOCKER ARE IN MY BOOK BAG! I then saw my book bag bulge out, now filled with stuff. I thought that this was impossible, but as I opened the bag, it was possible. I got my stuff out, wondering what this meant. I thought that this meant I could do almost anything! Not sure of what to do, I opened the book, staring at the once again empty page. I thought on what to do.</span></div></div>",

How awesome is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I looked around the classroom and wondered who I could change. I saw one of my friends, a nerdy and geeky guy named Kevin, sitting just two chairs to my right. He was skinny to the bone with glasses and suspenders. He was super smart, but he always got teased and bullied by all the jocks. Of course, what an easy target! But he always helped me with math so I could use the book to help him out. I could make Kevin muscle up and grow a little bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, how about Suzy, that cute girl with long, red hair, sitting just two rows in front of me? She's nice and petite but she has freckles and because of her short stature and red hair and freckles she just has a hard time getting guys to like her and to ask her out. Maybe I can use my cool magic book to make her more attractive? Give her bigger boobs? Make her a little taller and cuter and sexier-looking? That would be so sweet! Then she would be so grateful and she would want to go out with me for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what would I do first? Help out my geeky friend? Or help out the girl?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, he looked down and started writing in his own notebook, using that same pencil. Darn, the kid was so smart. In a way, I really liked the guy. He was brilliant! He scribbled a bunch of notes before he stopped and looked my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! Did you get all the notes? And the problem on the board?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... No... Not really... I'm a little confused...\" I admitted, although I was more interested in my magical book with no name than the math class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, dude! You can copy my notes after class!\" Kevin whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn! What a pal! This dude is worth his weight in gold! I couldn't wait to try out the book on him! So, I looked down, as I pulled out the book, which was hiding on my desk, under my math notebook. I opened it up to the first page, which had the instructions on it. Then, I took my pen and I decided to write something there, under the instructions in cursive letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAKE MY FRIEND KEVIN GAIN THIRTY POUNDS OF SOLID MUSCLE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER HIS BODY. MAKE HIS CLOTHES GROW WITH HIS BODY. LET THE GROWTH TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT THIRTY SECONDS STARTING NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I heard a soft moan coming from... Kevin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look his way, to see what was happening. Indeed, his body was changing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's eyes were closed and his head was tilted back a bit. He was moaning as he was feeling overwhelmed by the sudden feeling of the increase in muscular strength! And, no wonder! I saw his biceps grow by two inches! His legs bulked up as his quads thickened and his calves grew into big, bulging footballs! His chest started to push outwards and sideways, forcing him to move the chair a little further away from the desk. I could tell, by the expanding t-shirt and shorts, that every muscle that was hiding under his clothes, had increased as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhnnn....\" he moaned again, as he finally opened his eyes and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he made a fist and flexed his arm. A mighty bicep popped up on his arm. It was a big, round ball of muscle which wasn't there a minute before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" he whispered. \"Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared at him with a grin. The book worked. Now, you just had to decide what to do with him next. Luckily the bell was about to ring, sgnaling the start of the 30-minute recess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make her face attractive without any use of makeup. She is an athlete--almost an All-State track star (but no superhero). With some coaching, she will be All-State or even All-American. She eat healthy and train well. She has a perfect figure, perfect 20/20 Vision, and never can get fat or sick. And she likes me a lot and will seriously consider dating me. and yes, she likes Kevin fairy well too. Kevin can easily tutor her and me in Math. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whirring sound was heard and Suzy was changing into fitness model...not too much muscles but still fit. But mainly she was attractive now. Her hair was perfectly styled. Her perfume had the smell of apple but was tastefully applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Suzy went by Jake's desk and sweetly asked Jake ' Hi Jake, my friend.

She meets up with, Linda, the only person she knows that has the same lunch period as her, and they head to their usual spot outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like normal, they first stop by Linda's locker. They then make their way towards Alison's before they head outside. Though today was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts in her combination and opens her locker. \"Huh?\", she says, staring at a black book with strange markings. She checks, yes, this is her locker. \"How did this get in here?\", she says. \"What?\", Linda asks\". \"This book, that wasn't here when I last checked my locker. And how did they know my combination?\". She then notices a note on top of it. Reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is your lucky day. I have decided that you are to be the next master of this book. Once you touch it, it will be yours and only you will be able to write in it. It can make any wish come true, just simply write it down. It served me well so many years, may it do the same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of joke is this?\", Linda says. \"Who would fall for this? Just put the thing in the lost and found and let's go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison however, can't help but think that this is real.....SEE FIRST PAGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't drop it. But both of them are shocked. \"Alright! We'll deal with this later. Let's just get to our spot first\", Alison says, trying to keep them both calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir spot is a bit behind the school, most other students eat in the cafeteria or the front of the school, meaning that very few people come here at this time. They sit down. The book in Alison's hands with her staring at it, and Linda trying to convince herself this isn't real, that someone is messing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens it and pulls a pencil out of her pocket. \"What are you doing?\", Linda asks. \"I'm going to try it\", she responds. \"You can't be serious! This is a trick! That book can't possibly grant whatever is written in it!\". Alison looks at her, \"we'll there is only one way to be sure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready with an idea in mind, she puts the pencil to the page. HAVE TIME FREEZE FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT MYSELF AND LINDA. She stops writing and gets up, seeing if it worked. \"Wh-what did you write?\", Lind says, with a worried look. Alison doesn't hear her, she is focused on seeing if what she had written really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\", she says out loud. She realizes that there was nothing there that would be frozen, so she decides to look around. She doesn't have to walk far. Turning a corner, she is face to face with a female student, though she isn't moving. Waving her hand in front of her face, prodding and poking her, she doesn't move. Linda catches up, and noticing the not moving girl, \"why isn't she moving? ! Did you do this?\". \"Yes. What I wrote was to freeze time for everyone but the 2 of us, and it seemed to have worked\". Linda then examines the girl herself. \"I still can't believe this. How can something like that exist?\". \"I don't know, but for whatever reason, it's mine now\".</span></div></div>",

They find people in all sorts of positions. They come across their baseball team practicing. The batter had just swung at the ball and he was going to miss. \"I wonder\", she says, grabbing the ball. She puts it even with the ball, and it floats their, in it's new position. Them both staring at it, Alison gives Linda a big smile, \"I think that I am going to enjoy this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pass by many people, changing things around for when she unfreezes time, both of them laughing at what they think will happen. Finally heading into the school, they pass by the girl's locker room and enter. There are girls changing and taking showers in here. They notice something, one of the girls that are taking a shower, is Becky. \"Well what do we have here?\", Alison says. \"This is perfect. She thinks she is so superior to everyone just because her father is rich. Bullying and making fun of a lot of people, including you Linda. What say we get a little payback?\". She walks to the far side of Becky and tells Linda to come help. Both of them carry her out of the building, naked, and to where the sports teams practice. Placing her in the middle of the football field, they walk away far enough to watch what is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the book, Alison unfreezes time. The batter hits the ball, and it's a home run. Their cheer is quick to pass, as all eyes are on the naked Becky that has appeared in the middle of the football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she has somehow appeared outside, naked, she lets out a huge scream and dashes for a place to hide while trying to cover herself. The boys can't help but stare, as Alison and Linda fall down laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was great! What could we possibly do next?\".</span></div></div>",

After opening the door and going around a corner, she witnessed two of the cheerleaders barechested, several girls undressing themselves, some in their underwear and a few completely naked. Some of them tried to hide themselves shyly, while others were proud of their bodies and had no problem with other girls staring. One cheerleader was standing completely naked in the middle of the room, talking to an already dressed schoolmate and not bothered by the fact that the lesson starts in a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Earth to Alexis!\" Lauren snaps you out of the viewing pleasure by waving her hand in front of you. \"You only have a week to go as a girl, sure, but you have to stay focused on the school at the same time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of you made your way in and you started undressing. Earlier you saw a couple of girls being shy about it, so you tried to do it that way. Seems like nobody finds your presence weird, nobody bats an eye this entire time. As you took off your blouse and bra and started removing skirt, two hands suddenly reached from behind you and groped you forcefully, forcing an adorable yelp out of you.<br>\r\n\"Aww, someone doesn't like to get their breasts groped I see?\" Lauren teases you, playing with your breasts a little.<br>\r\nYou can't lie, this kind of feels good. But at the same time, it was too unexpected, and done in front of all the girls. You hear them giggling at the two of you. \"C-cut it out!\" you shouted at her back.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just didn't want to waste an opportunity.\" She returns to dressing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you're done with dressing yourself. It feels uncomfortable - the way it's stretched all over your body, the pressure it makes on your ample breasts, the way it pulls on your crotch...<br>\r\nLauren notices your worried expression. \"Aww, what's the matter? I thought you'd love this.\"<br>\r\n\"It just... feels strange overall. I don't like this body.\"<br>\r\nLauren gasped loudly. \"Really?\" she starts talking loudly as the two of you become the center of attention. \"Alexis, you're really beautiful, how can you be not okay with your body?\"<br>\r\n\"Is that true?\" one of the other girls asks in disbelief, loud enough for you to hear. \"Alexis, I'd wish to be as pretty as you!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Did you notice all the boys on the halls checking you out? If only I could get as many stares as you do!\" this makes you a bit more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Alexis, I envy you how much stuff you have in your life. You are pretty, you are smart, you've definitely got at least ten or twenty boys with crush on you. Seriously, what more do you want?\"<br>\r\nOne of the girls you know steps out. Triss. You used to be taller from her, but that's changed ever since you became a girl. She combs her raven black hair back with her fingers and pushes her bosom up for you to see. \"Alexis, if I was a boy, I would definitely hook up with you, the first chance I had.\" Lauren giggles as she looks at the two of you with a satisfied smile. Tris lays her arms around your neck and pushes herself against you. \"You are perfect. In. Every. Way.\" All the girls wooed at the scene going on.<br>\r\n\"I-I-I, uhh... I find you perfect too.\" You answered her awkwardly. Lauren is giggling more, you're sure you're blushing at this point.<br>\r\n\"... kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, ...\" Some girls started chanting.

All the girls start screaming in joy, but you slowly zone out, as you close your eyes and start enjoying all the experiences you have for once - the feeling of girl's lips against yours, her long black hair brushing against your soft hands, which hold her flawless cheeks, your breasts pushing against hers and hers against yours. As you pull yourself closer to her, she tears away. \"I gotta draw the line though, sorry. You've definitely enjoyed it far too much for a girl.\" All the girls laugh for a bit, as the bell rings and they leave, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren quickly joins you. \"Sooo... how'd it feel?\" She's overflowing with joy.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, I kissed a girl. And I... liked it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not like that's the first time something like this happened in our locker room.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a lot of girls seem to have body issues nowadays. We gotta support each other in the moments like these. And I'm not talking just about the breasts this time.\" The two of you share a small laugh.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to enjoy this...\" you finally say, taking a good look at your body. Your breasts are slightly larger than Lauren's, and your stomach is really flat. \"I'm starting to like this body.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wait for all the boys and how are they gonna oogle you all the lesson.\" Lauren pats you on your back as the two of you walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimming lesson goes by really fast. At first, it felt weird swimming with breasts on your chest and wearing a speedo dragged over your body, but you started to like it eventually. However, at all times you felt like some of the boys were staring at you. Sometimes you caught them, other times they started looking away as you turned to them. Several times, you caught a glimpse of Triss, and when her sight met yours, she either smiled at you seductively or waved you, both of which started giggling between the girls everytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that felt awesome.\" Lauren said after the lesson, walking by your side back to the dressing room with you. \"I could really use more morning swimming lessons. Maybe I could get that book to do that for me...\"<br>\r\nYour mind suddenly goes wild with the ideas of wishes you could do with that book. For the beginning, you really could turn back into your old self. Then you could maybe get a revenge on the Lauren. You could get A's in all the subjects- no, you wouldn't have to go to school at all! You could be a super-popular billionaire, living on your own island. You could-<br>\r\n\"Hello, Alexiiis!\" Lauren starts waving a hand in front of your face.<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n\"You seem to be zoning out so often. Anyway, I was asking you if you'd like to shower with me.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, that's just what we do. How do you think we reach our backs when we are this exhausted?\" Hmm, she makes a good point, and overall seems friendly. You don't think she has any bad motives behind this... even if she was the one whi began this all.<br>\r\n\"Ohh... uhhh, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" She grabs a bunch ot bottles and leads you to the showers. The two of you get into one of the stalls and she turns on the water, then fiddles with the temperature until it's pleasantly warm. She puts down all the flasks and starts undressing in front of you.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"What? That's normal. How do you expect to get all the nasty chlorine off your body when the swimsuit's on? I guess boys have it different, wearing shorts and all that...\"<br>\r\nShe's right. You undress yourself as she looks at your body. \"Hmm, I can definitely see why all those boys find you so hot. And some girls too.\"<br>\r\nYou cover your breasts and crotch as best as you can, and try not to look embarrased. \"Can we just, like, get on with the shower, please?\"<br>\r\n\"Mhm, sure.\" She gets some body gel into her hand and starts slowly rubbing her whole body, seemingly not minding your presence. You must admit to yourself thst you fell in love with her and with the way she looks. Her slender legs and waist, her nice breasts you got a hold of, her hazel brown hair, her long fingers and elegant stature overall. Just then, you remember that you need a shower too, so you squeeze some of her shower gel into your hand and start washing yourself.<br>\r\n\"So, this Triss girl... do you really like her?\" She asks you, still minding her own body.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah. I'd wish more girls would make the first move nowadays. It's just that I don't like it when they play... unreachable.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I mean... do you like her looks? Her personality?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... she's hot.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can agree with that.\" Lauren nods in agreement.<br>\r\n\"And she's direct. But at the same time, this felt... too direct.\"<br>\r\nLauren turns back to you. \"I think she just wanted you to feel better, she wasn't really serious with it.\" As she speaks, she reaches for her shampoo and washes her hair.<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay, I see.\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, that's how we girls really are - not like in all those stories on the internet, badly written by twelve year olds, where all the cheerleaders think you are ugly because they're jealous. In reality, they'll flatter you while in your presence, but as soon as you turn your back to them, all the rumors start going on around. And as far as I know, this is totally a reality, and not some story on the internet, poorly written by a 12 year old.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" You're almost finished, when she turns around and asks you to wash her back. As you do so, sh moans lightly.<br>\r\n\"But... would you, like, get together with Triss if you were a boy?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I would love to, but thing is just that I'd likely be too awkward to talk to her, and to hang out with her and stuff.\" As you get lower and lower, you start thinking about how funny it would be if you grabbed Lauren by her butt. You can't tear your eyes away from it, it's as perfect as a peach. You finally decide to go for it, as Lauren gasps breathlessly and turns to you.<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"What? Isn't that something girls do?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess... yes it is, but you're not a girl!\"<br>\r\nYou hold your breasts up and ask her mischeviously \"Oh really?\"<br>\r\nShe gets a bit irritated, but then she quips \"Should I just turn you into a pair of panties? Or maybe another week of being a girl is going to help you correct your behaviour.\" She motions you to turn around, preparing to wash your back.<br>\r\nAs she starts working it, you find it to be a really pleasant feeling. \"How did you find out about me anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"The book told me. Literally, after the instructions were said, it went like 'OH, BU THE WAY, PREVIOUS OWNER HAS BECOME YOUR BRA. SEE YA!' Kind of guessed it was you, seeing how you check me out all the time.\" Suddenly, you feel a forcefull slap against your wet butt. A pleasant kind of pain, that made you turn around. Lauren looks at you and starts laughing. \"Why do you blush all the time? This is so hilarious!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe because I'm turned into an attractive girl while being into girls, with a girl in the shower, both of us stark naked, and because the other naked girl just slapped me on my butt!\"<br>\r\n\"So? What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd be so hard if I was a boy right now.\"<br>\r\nLauren giggles again. \"I could make you hard even while you'd be a girl if you wished to...\"<br>\r\n\"NO THANKS!\" you shout at her, as she giggles mischeviously and turns her back to you, slightly rising her posterior at you. \"Uuh, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to get even with me. Slap me. Go on, I know you want to.\"<br>\r\nYou do so, and two of you follow that by having some more fun and drying a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lesson's next?</span></div></div>",

Realizing the risk that would accompany her going to school naked, he also added that no one would try to get her to wear clothes nor would they attempt to touch her in any way.  He aldo wrote that Lauren would make no mention of the day's activities.  Exhaustion hit him, and he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day in class, Lauren sat down in front of him, buck naked.  Lots of people kept looking her way, and she attempted to cover herself up as best as she could without interrupting her schoolwork, thanks to the book.  She shot a dirty glare at Alex, but found that she couldn't speak of the previous day.  Alex found that after a while staring at her bare back was pretty boring, especially as he had felt a lot more the previous day, so he quietly got out the book and began writing.</span></div></div>",

Glancing in the wall mirror, he saw that he had turned into a female version of himself.  His outfit retained its designs, but also became feminine.<br>\r\n\"Is that really necessary?\"<br>\r\n\"No, but it's fun!  It will wear off once you leave.  Now for the tricky part.

Lauren reached in and pulled out the one-piece red swimsuit that was hanging up and tossed it into the trash.  \"Hold the book.  All right, here goes!\"  She closed her eyes and her body crumpled to the floor.<br>\r\nAlex, book in hand, stared at the heap of clothes in disbelief.  For one thing, he had expected her clothes to change with her.  For another, he had never watched a transformation, and was shocked that his new friend had just crumpled like that.  He rifled through her clothes and pulled out some clear fabric.  He hung it up on the hook and slammed the door just as Kelly came in.  \"Who are you and what are you doing over here?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm in another class.  I just remembered that the teacher said that we needed to have semi-formal wear, and this T-shirt wouldn't cut it.  Luckily, I have a change of clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Kelly began to strip, and Alex awkwardly began to do the same.  Thankful that his female form was about the same size as Lauren and that semi-formal clothes had appeared on her, he pulled on her white blouse and red low-cut shirt, then pulled on her knee-length skirt.  Kelly pulled on Lauren, not noticing that \"Alexis\" could see right through her swimsuit.  Kelly stuffed her clothes in her locker and Alex did the same in a nearby unlocked locker, hoping that Kelly would leave soon so that he could change back.</span></div></div>",

Things would have worked out a whole lot better for Kate had he spent a couple minutes thinking through exactly what he wrote before he did it. Alex wrote, I WISH THAT LAUREN THE SWIMSUIT GAINS THE MOBILITY THAT KATE HAS RIGHT NOW. So when the book immediately complied with what he wrote, Alex heard Kate scream. Alex turned to look at Kate and saw her clothes being taken off her by invisible hands. In less than a minute she's again buck naked. Lauren ,the still transparent swimsuit, starts creeping towards Kate. Crotch first, the swimsuit leaps onto Kate's head. Slowly sliding all the way down Kate's body when it's completely on her the crotch snap, snaps. Seconds later Kate is horrified to discover that the snap WON\"T open and the Lauren seems to be staying on her, whether or not she wants it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Kate, her torso was nearly 4 inches longer than Lauren and her bust was 5 inches and more than a full cup size larger. Consequently, Lauren the still very transparent swimsuit was an extremely tight fit on Kate. Which she immediately starts complaining about to Alex. When she finally settles down enough to say something decent, the first thing Kate said was, \"Come on Alex, is getting me naked the only thing on your mind today?\" He replied, \"While I do like the present view, I really don't understand why this happened.\" When he shows her what he wrote, Kate notices his grammatical error and starts giving Alex another earful. She then says, \"Alex give me the book, I can't do any worse trying to fix this problem than you.\" He refuses saying, \"No way, Kate. I think part of the problem is there are already more masters than there should be using the book.\" So while trying to shut Kate up, Alex compounds his problems with both girls when he then writes in the book, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly turning to look at Kate he sees that her body, along with the Lauren swimsuit she's still wearing are changing. Kate's skin has started changing its color to the same shade of electric pink she had been earlier that day as a full-sized one piece swimsuit. Also both girls bodies have begun slowly splitting into two bodies like an amoeba does. Nearly fainting from the totally unexpected scene he's witnessing, Alex just stands there stunned. A quarter of an hour later, the 2 girls bodies finally finish splitting apart with a very sexy, moaning pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that FOUR electric pink swim-bodysuits are lying on the bed Alex doesn't know what to do next. By now he feels that NO matter what he might write in the book to try fixing this problem, things will only get even worse than they are. He doesn't have a clue what would happen to girls and he absolutely does not want to find out. Taking a close look at those swimsuits, Alex realizes that they are now clearly 2 pair of differently sized bodysuits with head, feet and hair(!) fully attached. Figuring that he really doesn't have anything else left to lose, so to speak, Alex then asks, \"Kate, How do you feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's startled when one of each pair of swimsuit rises up and says in stereo \"Wonderful Alex, whatever you wrote in that book was fabulous. I bet if you asked Lauren she would say that she enjoyed it just as much as I did.\" Surprised by Kate's statement Alex involuntarily said aloud, Lauren. The other two bodysuits jump up and start hugging him. Which causes the 2 Kate suits to say (again in stereo) \"Hey, watch it Lauren, he's my boy-friend and I get to hug him first.\" Alex then asks Lauren, if she can now speak. Lauren says (also in stereo), \"Yes finally. Say Alex, do you know why things didn't go as I had planned for with Kelly?\" Alex replied, \"Yes I do and boy, have I got a story for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex takes his time telling Lauren everything that has occurred to everyone since they (Alex and Lauren) went into the girls locker room that morning. Even though she's still not sure why everything occurred as it did, Lauren is satisfied that she now knows what has happened to her and everyone else. Both Lauren suits sit down on Alex's desk while they ponder what to do next. It has been a fairly hot day so Kate mentions that she's getting thirsty and Lauren seconds the thought. Alex gallantly offers to get each of them a soda. They both loudly say (now in double stereo), \"Yuuuuck, we don't want any of that sticky stuff on us, Alex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren then suggests to Kate, why don't we go swimming in Alex's backyard pool. Alex is about to say, \"What backyard pool?\" when he sees one of the Lauren suits pick up a pencil and start writing in the book. Teasingly Alex says, \"Hey, no fair. I still have to put my swimsuit on.\" Lauren then volunteers,\"Don't you worry Alex, I can fix that problem REAL quick.\" \"That's alright.\" he tells her. He then remembers about his sister the almost pornographic potato and asks Lauren for the book and any suggestions. She comes up with a real winner, so Alex writes in the book that his sister, Lisa, transform into a swimsuit that's my current or any future size and identical in every other way, except for the head and hair, to Lauren &amp; Kate. She even remembers to make Lisa fall asleep and writes that she won't remember ANYTHING that happens to her when she returns to her human form, unless Alex tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next to the now THREE electric pink full-body sized [5 1/2 feet and taller] swimsuits when the now newly twinned girls jump into Alex's brand new swimming pool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Diving into Alex(is) brand new Olympic sized pool was a grave error by the girls. What no-one realized at the time, is that when Alex(is) wrote in the book what Lauren had suggested he accidentally changed all of the girls physical structure. Instead of their bodies becoming swimsuits their skin had transformed into an infinitely stretchable version of Lycra. So once they entered the swimming pool, water rapidly started flowing into them through their pores. Consequently all 5 of them quickly became extremely water-logged. Alex(is) was able to slip out of his sisterly swimsuit before being dragged to the bottom but the others had no such chance for escape. Running as fast as he could to the far side of the swimming pool, Alex(is) opened up the drain to empty the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by the time he did so it didn't do the girls a whole lot of good, because their bodies had already absorbed nearly ALL of the water in the pool. So Alex(is) is now looking at all 5 girls, who are now easily much larger AND heavier than a full-grown female blue whale. He figures, at this point, writing in the book again can't possibly make the girls problems any bigger. Boy, is he ever wrong. Writing in the book, FIX Lauren, Kate and Lisa BY CHANGING THEM BACK TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE. The book immediately changes them back. Alex(is) in his haste to help the girls, only manages to literally put them through the wringer. Looking in the swimming pool that's now empty of water, Alex(is) sees that their bodies are now slowly being compressed by an invisible wringer. The torrents of water being squeezed out of their bodies flows down the drain.Through it all, none of the girls complain about the treatment they receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's well over an hour later when there are finally 5 somewhat larger than human-sized, shocking pink swimsuits lying at the bottom of that pool. Alex(is) then starts climbing down a ladder to pick up the swimsuits. He thinks that they're finally fully wrung out. Alex(is) is only halfway down the ladder when the SMALLER of the two Kate swimsuit sneaks up on him. It quickly and efficiently pulls him inside of itself. Because his female body was a fair amount larger, Alex(is) gets squeezed even tighter than the swimsuit does. Accepting his(her) \"punishment\" Alex(is) doesn't say a word and doesn't let on to the girls about just how hot and sexually excited his body gets from the squeezing. Finally a couple of minutes after they are all finally wrung dry, Kate asks Alex(is), \"Well, girlfriend any ideas about what to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of the swimming pool, Alex walks over and gets the book. He has finally learned his lesson and asks [fancy that] the book why things aren't working out the way they (Alex and Lauren) intended. Getting no reply and figuring that none of them have anything else to lose he then writes, RETURN ALL FOUR OF US TO NORMAL ONE AT A TIME, WITH ME FIRST. The book now replies, {CAN NOW REPLY, BUT ONLY IF YOU REALLY WANT IT DONE}. Now incensed, Alex(is) writes, \"Of course I want it done right now, [sarcastically] if you don't mind.\" The book ominously replies, \"alright, but don't complain to me about how everything turns out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex still wearing his sister, the extremely shocking pink and now very tall and even more voluptuous swimsuit, transforms back to his original size and sex. Now quite embarrassed, he strips his sister off just as fast as he possibly can. However when the 3 girls one-by-one 'return to normal' it's not what they expected. None of the girls returns to WHAT they WERE, when they woke up that morning. Without having to use the book when he wakes her up much later, Alex convinces Lisa that she grew into her suddenly new size while still in High school. Unfortunately for Kris's immediate safety, Lauren and Kate appear on his bed, naked and very, very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out from the opening rolled a half centimeter tall Lisa. He could barely make her out as she stood up and tried to hide her nudity. She looked up and a series of wild squeaking began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear what you're saying but I figure you want to know whats going on\" Alex began \"As I was trying to tell you, I'm your brother Alex.

Additionally, while still new to the concept of people transforming into something inanimate, Kate was thoroughly enjoying Alex's far greater than normal enthusiasm. In fact, Alex got so wrapped up into things, so to speak, their sex session lasted way longer than half an hour. In fact, it was 3 times longer than usual. And as a final [BONUS] for Kate when Alex thrust into her for the final time, she passed out from the sheer intensity of the first truly exploding orgasm in her young life. Seeing Kate now unconscious and convulsing, Alex panics. So without even trying to revive Kate, Alex proceeds to immediately return Lauren to her human form. He doesn't notice that Lauren's body is now about 3 inches taller and in every way more voluptuous. Before she even sees what has happened to Kate, Lauren lustily screams at the top of her lungs, \"Kate, that's an experience you JUST HAVE to experience. So she grabs the book and excitedly writes, ONE MINUTE AFTER I TOUCH KATE, SHE WILL INSTANTLY TRANSFORM INTO A CONDOM. IT WILL EXACTLY MATCH HER NATURAL HAIR COLOR. KATE'S EXPERIENCE AS A CONDOM WHILE BEING USED BY ALEX, WILL DUPLICATE MINE IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE WAY. AFTER ALEX HAS FINALLY FINISHED USING HER, SHE'LL THEN RETURN TO HER HUMAN SHAPE AFTER I'VE AGAIN TOUCHED HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the book down, Lauren finally turns around and sees sheer terror on Alex's face over Kate's situation. When Lauren turns her body back towards the book to ask, \"what has happened to Kate?\" she doesn't notice her right hand graze Kate's body. Alex finishes his explanation seconds after Kate transforms into an absolutely perfect Alex-sized condom. Now quite concerned about Kate, Lauren seeing that Kate has now transformed into a condom says, \"Oops.\" Alex asks her, \"Oops?\" Lauren then points at Kate's new form saying, \"read the book\". He does and yells at her, \"You've got to be kidding. We don't even know yet what's happened to my girlfriend and now I have to use her like I did you. What were you thinking!!\" After half a minute of silence between them, Lauren now in tears pleads with Alex to just do it. He refuses to and then picks the book up to write something to fix this mess. They're both thoroughly shocked when they soon discover that the book won't let EITHER of them make any changes to what Lauren had already written. With extreme reluctance and seeing no other way out of this terrible mess he starts taking his clothes off, telling Lauren to do likewise. It's at this point that Alex FINALLY notices that Lauren seems bigger than before. She passes it off as his over-active imagination. Since all of her clothing grew larger when her body did, none of it's tighter on Lauren than before. In recognition of the current circumstances, neither of them WANTS this to last any longer than absolutely necessary. So they are both utterly mystified when Alex CAN NOT stop himself after 5 minutes of activity causes him to explode deeper into Lauren than she thought humanly possible. Alex now continues pumping into Lauren twice as fast as he had earlier that morning with Kate. Their sex session WILL last twice as long as Alex's had earlier with Kate. Lauren becomes terrified when she realizes that every thrust into her by Alex is deeper than the one before. Which can only mean to her that every minute they continue, Alex is growing even bigger. Lauren now fears that before Alex CAN STOP, he'll grow so big that she'll split in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A fourth girl floated up, lost her clothes, and began hovering over the ice cream.  She turned a smooth rich brown and landed with a splat on top of the banana split, coating the bowl's with chocolate fudge.  Finally, a fifth girl floated up and was stripped like the others.  Her body turned fluffy and white while her head turned red as she turned into the whipped cream and cherry, completing the banana split.  Kelly tried to squirm, but the weight of the ice cream was too much for her and she could only mutter expletives at the two.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being a little playful with Lauren, during lunch Alex decided that he would return Lauren to being human right after school let out. He justified it to himself thinking that she would've probably enjoyed having a break from school for a day. So Alex wrote in the book, tomorrow when Lauren enters each classroom she will instantly know everything that was said the previous day and all homework that was due would instantly appear in her note book, all ready to turn in. He figured this way she couldn't complain about missing any school-work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of subtlety to using the book that Alex AND Lauren still had to learn. Especially how terribly important it was to be absolutely clear about what was written. Without a totally un-ambiguous statement the book took things very literally. Because Alex had been Lauren's bra he knew her EXACT size. So to cheer her up he decided when he started molding Lauren into a pot, Alex chose the shape of a nude female torso. So even-though 'technically' Lauren was now a clay pot she had actually been made into a vase. That's the reason why Alex had been praised by the teacher for his work. [The teacher had never in her 35 years of teaching had any student who had shown such fine DETAIL in their work.]  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex also thought Lauren wouldn't mind if he made her 32C bust just a \"little bit\" bigger. He did it by reducing her then current 28-inch waist. At least that had been his intention when Alex wrote, EXACTLY 5 HOURS AFTER I FINISHED MOLDING LAUREN, HER BODY WILL TAKE 1 MINUTE RETURNING TO HER FORMER SHAPE. THEN FOR 1 HOUR SHE WILL STEADILY INCREASE IN SIZE AS 5 INCHES ARE REDUCED FROM HER WAIST. THE MASS WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO HER BUST WHILE IT BECOMES SEMI-SPHERICAL AS LAUREN GROWS 5 INCHES BIGGER AND 1 FULL CUP SIZE LARGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour before Lauren was to start transforming back, Alex re-entered the art room. He pulled off half her feet and quickly molded them into a miniature replica of Lauren's vase shape. He then wrote in the book for the miniature vase to become an exact duplicate of Lauren as she currently was. Still having several minutes to spare when he finished, Alex took a couple dozen pictures of Lauren from ALL angles with his brand-new 12 mega-pixel digital camera. [courtesy of the book, of course.] He then filmed Lauren as she reverted to her human sized body. Which was what Alex had thought would happen. For although Lauren's body had started to slowly enlarge (and changing in ways that Alex hadn't anticipated occurring) she only LOOKED to be the same 5 foot 6 inch girl she was when she woke up that morning. Which REALLY wasn't the case in ways that neither Master of the Book expected, but would quickly learn about an hour later when Lauren finished growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he had been molding Lauren's body she felt the most exquisite caressing throughout her entire body. So although she's not about to tell Alex about it, Lauren decides to just let bygones be bygones. Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, Alex quickly gathers up everything so that they can start off for home. Which they would have except for ONE small problem. For some unknown reason Lauren can't move her legs, or any other part of her body except her mouth. She had no compunction about yelling at him for this latest problem. Asking Alex to show her the book, Lauren instantly saw what the problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had only written that Lauren would return to her former shape. He had neglected to write that she regain any mobility OR a human body. Since clay statues are totally incapable of movement, Lauren is stuck right where she's standing. Not wanting to take any more chances that Alex would innocently goof up again, Lauren insists that everything Alex writes in the book be exactly what she tells him and nothing else! So following Lauren's explicit instructions Alex then wrote, EVERY PART OF LAUREN'S BODY NOW HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE IN ABSOLUTELY ANY DIRECTION THAT LAUREN DECIDES. And boy IT sure does so now, because when Lauren started walking home, she quickly realized that her body has a WHOLE lot more BOUNCE in it than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Alex had said he would meet her at her house in an hour, Lauren decides to not tell Alex about how flexible and bouncy her body has become when he arrives. She wants to spend a lot of time by herself learning just WHAT her body can now do. Only taking her 5 minutes to walk home [the weather that day was very pleasant] Lauren decided to spend some quality time lounging in her parent's jacuzzi. When Alex arrives at her house right on time, Lauren was still enjoying herself in the jacuzzi. From the jacuzzi Lauren told Alex to just make himself comfortable on the living room sofa for a few minutes. Dashing upstairs to quickly change into something very relaxed and comfortable, Lauren is surprised and annoyed to discover that absolutely NONE of her regular clothes seems to fit her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only blouse and bra that fits Lauren's new size is the one she had bought for last fall's Junior-Senior Halloween party. The bra had been SO big on Lauren she had needed to use half a cantaloupe to fill each cup. It also won her 1st prize for \"Most imaginative use of fruit\". Seeing Lauren in that costume had also been what originally peaked Alex's interest in Lauren. Because she had spent nearly the last hour bathing, Lauren hadn't noticed her body's continual expansion. [The jacuzzi easily held 6 adults without any crowding.] Now realizing that something was still very wrong with her body Lauren loudly yelled at Alex to, \"Get your sorry ass up here, RIGHT NOW!\" Knowing that the jig was up and really, REALLY wanting to see Lauren's enlarged bust, Alex sprinted up the stairs 2 at a time. Bursting into her bedroom, Alex immediately fainted when he saw just how BIG Lauren had grown in the past hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was out cold for nearly an hour and a half because he had hit his head on Lauren's dresser when he fainted. Long before he woke, Lauren had easily carried Alex's unconscious body downstairs and laid him out on the sofa. Fortunately for Alex it was 6 1/2 feet long, so his 6 foot 1/2-inch frame easily fit there. When he wakes up, the first thing Alex sees was a still VERY ANGRY-looking Lauren standing right over him. All she says is, \"Alright Alex where's the book?\" Smiling very meekly he replied, \"Since I didn't think you would want to use it right away, I left it home when I walked over here.\" \"Oh, I wouldn't\" Lauren then boomed. When he stood up Alex immediately realized Lauren was now several inches TALLER than him. So conceding defeat Alex said, \"Alright Lauren, we'll go over to my place right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alex had lain unconscious on her sofa Lauren had spent most of the time exploring her new body's capabilities. So while she was still very annoyed about HOW it had happened, and not yet knowing WHY, or even just what her new size WAS, Lauren was extremely pleased with her very early birthday present. {She would turn 19 in about a month}. She sure didn't want Alex knowing just how thrilled she was with her new body. That evening, Lauren's performance in hiding her happiness from Alex was worthy of being nominated for an Oscar. Only thing is Lauren was mystified when she read the book. It just didn't make sense to her how come she had grown as big as she had. But she decided to think about it some more the following morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren heartily ate nearly FIVE times her normal dinner when they ate a short time later. Laughing about it Lauren said, \"Boy Alex, growing up sure gives a girl a healthy appetite.\" Stunned at what had happened to Lauren and not wanting to anger the almost 6 foot 5-inch [nearly 2-meter] tall co-ed, Alex wisely kept quiet. So before Alex could sense her growing joy from growing up and OUT and UP even more, Lauren left for home where there was a very BIG surprise waiting for her when she opened the door. At least when she got over THAT shock, Lauren FINALLY understood WHY her body had grown to the size it currently was. She also learned about some other unexpected aspects of Alex's goof. So next morning at school after she had slept on it, how DOES Lauren decide to pay Alex back for what he accidentally did to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile back in the art room at school:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there all ALONE drying on the rack was extremely boring for Lauren. Making things even worse for her, without paying any attention to it Alex had placed her vase-shaped body with her boobs facing the clock. So she could \"see\" it and EVERY SINGLE SECOND tick off. By the time classes were finished for the day Lauren was ready to kill Alex. When Alex had taken off half of Lauren's feet to make a substitute (duplicate) vase for his assignment he didn't give it a seconds thought. For several hundred years ALL the women in Lauren's family have had unusually large feet. When Alex had returned Lauren to 'normal' her feet weren't the part of Lauren's anatomy that had Alex's interest. Since Lauren had had mobility problems AND then walked home bare-foot she hadn't realized her feet were half (!) their normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo seeing him return cheered her up. Mind you she was quite impatient to get her revenge on Alex. Lauren was quite baffled when Alex had made an exact duplicate of her. She was even more mystified when just before he left Alex said, \"I'll meet you at your place in an hour.\" Lauren was still sitting on the drying rack waiting to be returned to her normal body. Nearly 5 hours later Lauren FINALLY felt her body resume it's previous shape and mobility. Since Alex had made her go to school naked she had no clothes to wear home lying near her. Fortunately for Lauren the woman teacher's black painting smock was hung on a nearby hook. She was herself nearly 6 foot tall so it turned out to be JUST long enough on Lauren's newly enlarged body to cover everything she had that needed to be covered for modesty's sake. Since it was now fairly dark outside, Lauren had no difficulty quickly sneaking home unseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was descending the main staircase wearing her favorite bikini which had mysteriously become uncomfortably very, very tight (Lauren had decided to treat herself to soaking in the jacuzzi for a fairly long time) when the front door started to open. Knowing that no other family member was expected to be home that night, Lauren prepares to ambush the intruder(s) right after they securely close the front door. She's halfway through her swing with her brand new baseball bat when she sees the intruder looks JUST like her. For about a minute and a half both Lauren's were standing in the front hallway speechless. Then simultaneously, they scream, \"Wait till I get my hands on Alex tomorrow !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lauren who had just arrived home then remembers SHE had brought the book home with her. [When Alex had been out of the room the 1st Lauren had written in the book] \"ALEX WILL NOT NOTICE ME CARRYING THE BOOK WHEN I LEAVE HIS HOME. HE WILL CONTINUE EXPECTING IT TO BE WHERE HE LAST SET IT DOWN. HE WILL NOT THINK ABOUT USING THE BOOK UNTIL I RETURN IT TO HIS HOME.\" Showing the book to her twin Lauren #1 triumphantly says, \"Why wait until tomorrow sister, let's do some brainstorming right now\" So for the next couple of hours they vigorously discuss what to do about Alex. The only problem they have is deciding which one of the half dozen good ideas they came up with to use on him first. Just then the home phone rings. Before either Lauren gets to the phone the answering machine picks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's her younger step-sister (by one day) calling. Late last night she caught her fiancee literally in bed with TWO other girls from school. She then told Lauren that before running out of there she had grabbed both girls clothes and purses. Storming out of her EX-fiancee's apartment she's been driving 16 hours straight through and she's now dead tired. Telling Lauren that she's just turned down the cul-de-sac, Noreen finishes her call saying, \"I'll sack out on the living room floor in my sleeping bag, Sis. We can talk all about this in the morning after I've gotten enough sleep. I ABSOLUTELY don't need any MORE surprises today.\" They're both still standing at the bottom of the landing when Noreen opened the front door. Seeing TWO copies of a now 6' 4 1/2\" (195 cm) tall step-sister standing there Noreen collapses in the front hallway. Lauren now doesn't know if it's from exhaustion or seeing 2 Lauren's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they're waiting for Noreen to wake up, the 2 Lauren's carefully re-read everything Alex had written and they FINALLY figured out why Lauren was now literally beside herself. Chuckling to themselves about how things had ultimately turned out, the Lauren's learn something totally unexpected and highly useful about their new situation. After a short discussion they then agree that, at least for now, and only between themselves [and Alex when they show him the error of his ways]  that the second Lauren should be called Randy. It's really appropriate considering how she's feeling about EVERYTHING! Lauren and Randy however can't agree on whether to tell others about this new split in Lauren's life. Especially the boy who's really sweet on her and his mysterious girl cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing Noreen faint at the front door both girls rush to catch her. Up to that time Lauren and Randy hadn't physically touched each other. Lunging to catch Noreen before she hits the floor their arms accidentally touch each other. The girls were instantly mystified when against their desire OR will their bodies started merging together. Having caught their collapsing step-sister the girls are now terrified about what had just happened to them. Carefully and very slowly walking together to the book, Lauren opens it to the most recently written pages. It wasn't long before Randy realized why they're bodies are now partially merged. When Lauren had told Alex what to write in the book, she had ALSO neglected to change her body back to human. So both girls bodies were actually still 100% CLAY! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow understanding the situation they were in, Lauren concentrated on slowly separating HER half of the now very large clay blob from Randy. An hour and a quarter later they were again TWO separate bodies standing a couple of feet apart. For although the sensation that had FLOWED through their entire bodies while they were joining together was extremely pleasant neither girl wanted to go through separation again so soon. Those sensations were extremely exhausting but unexpectedly quite erotic. Upon separating they had agreed that for now staying separate would be easier on both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Noreen had been sleeping so peacefully on the floor they decided she had collapsed from exhaustion. Which they agreed was good for them. It was now well past midnight and Lauren mentioned not being the least bit tired to Randy. She concurred and they soon started planning what to do about Noreen. Since it seemed likely that she would still be sleeping for quite some time, they weren't rushing into any decisions. Since she had accidentally been transformed into an entirely new form of animate life Lauren wanted to find out what she could about her and Randy's new capabilities. So carefully booting up her home computer Lauren had decided they BOTH had to learn everything they could about clay's physical properties. Hours later they finished their studies about clay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly before sunrise when Lauren realized the true range of what the girls could now DO with their bodies, or so she thought. Since clay is malleable and has many molecular configurations, Lauren correctly hypothesized that they SHOULD be able to change their shape and probably also their size at will. While Lauren quickly learned HOW to do incredible things now with her body, for some unknown reason Randy was stuck with just the same body she had originally grown into the previous night. Now mind you being nearly 6 1/2 foot tall and so stacked that Jayne Mansfield would've looked like a 12-year old girl in comparison is nothing to sneeze at. Randy was quite unhappy that she couldn't make ANY changes to her body like Lauren could now. If she could choose one thing, Randy decided she could have a whole lot of fun making her hands and fingers any size or length she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren decided hours before she discovered her bodies new malleability, she was going to come clean with Noreen about everything. So only Lauren was in the living room when Noreen woke up about 14 hours after she had arrived home. The first words out of here mouth were, \"Hi. Lauren. How long did I sleep? Boy, did I need it. When I opened the door I would've sworn I saw 2 of you much bigger than you are now, [Lauren had decided it might be a lot easier on Noreen if she saw Lauren at her previous size] standing at the foot of the staircase.\" Nervously laughing Lauren asked Noreen, \"Would you mind having another step-sister?\" Noreen now getting her senses together some replied, \"Oh come on now Lauren, quit teasing me about THAT. You know that I'm a test-tube baby and that Daddy had a vasectomy years before I was born.\" And since your parents are both dead THAT'S never going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then sat their on the sofa in silence for several minutes. Noreen then wistfully said, \"I suppose it would've be fun to really have a big sister growing up.\" But since THAT can't happen I don't want to talk about it again. Lauren then decides to force the issue. Going into the kitchen Lauren asks Noreen what she wants. Noreen replied, \"For some reason I don't feel hungry Lauren, so nothing much. Some fruit will do. Are there any oranges in the kitchen?\" Peaking far enough into the living room for Noreen to see her [having inflated her bust to a very plump orange size] Lauren asked, \"No, but how about some cantaloupe?\" Having just seen Lauren much bigger than she ever had before, Noreen was at a loss for words. She figured her eyes were still playing tricks on her. Still she was getting hungrier by the minute so she asked Lauren, \"How BIG is it?\" [Having now inflated her boobs to a generous and firm cantaloupe size] Lauren returned to the living room saying, \"This size.\" Now assuming that Lauren was playing a prank on her Noreen decides to call her bluff saying, \"No Lauren, I've decided that I'm really in the mood for some nice, juicy watermelon.\" (pretending to now really dread it) Lauren said, \"Alright Noreen, watermelon it is.\" Standing right in front of Noreen's face Lauren slowly starts inflating her bust to watermelon size. Within seconds Noreen has passed out from seeing Lauren's bust starting to inflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Noreen woke up a short while later, Lauren boobs are now nearly as tall and round as her. Knowing that it HAS to be some kind of trick, Noreen backs out of the living room saying, \"I'll be right back Lauren. I just thought of something I need to get.\" Mystified by Noreen's behavior Lauren starts wondering if she's gone a LITTLE to far with her joke. A couple of minutes later Noreen reappears hiding a fairly long hat pin up her blouse sleeve. She plans to POP Lauren's obviously fake boobs. Pretending like nothing is amiss, Noreen approaches Lauren with her arms out for a hug. Just before she gets into range, Randy yells from the closet where she has been hiding all along, \"Watch out Lauren, she's going to POP you.\" Although startled hearing her sister's voice behind her, Noreen plunges ahead with her plan. When she pokes Lauren with the pin Noreen's stunned when Lauren's head pops, instead of her right breast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen then started wailing hysterically. She thought she had just killed her step-sister and was dreading what was going to happen to her. Once she realized the distress Noreen was feeling Lauren rapidly deflated her body and recalled all of her exploded head to her shoulders. Grabbing Noreen wit both arms, Lauren gently raised Noreen's head so that she could see Lauren was alright. Half an hour later after Noreen has fully calmed down she asks Noreen, \"Do you want to be able to do what I did a little ago? I'm sure you could come up with something to get back at your fiancee.\" Noreen surprised her saying, \"No Lauren, I'd rather go after his bed-warmers first. So yes, show me where you bought those balloons.\" Realizing Noreen hadn't correctly understood her question Lauren repeated it and Noreen replied the same. Out of exasperation Lauren asked Noreen point blank, \"Well Sis, do you know WHERE to find them? And when you DO find them, what's your plan to deal with those girls?\" Noreen quietly said, \"Lauren please show me how you inflated yourself this morning. I'll use THAT against them, and I promise not to talk about your new trick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is now at a crossroads. She's unsure if she should tell Noreen anything more about what's happened to her or not. AND if she decides to hold some of it back at least for now what should that be? Also, although she seemed to LIKE the idea of having another sister, Lauren still hasn't decided whether or not to tell Noreen about her brand new step-sister Randy. So now at the end of the most momentous 24 hours of her still young life, what does Lauren decide to tell Noreen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren was quite a bit surprised when she saw him try to write himself some clothes into existence and the book denied him, it was quite a bit to take in that because of his perverted little blunder, she was now the sole owner of a completely genuine and reality rewriting book of power. She would need to consider her moves very carefully from that point on, if magic books were real, what else could be out there just under everyone's nose after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren being the older daughter of two girls in her household and her father having passed away only a few small years back, meant that even though she had a pretty urgent need to take care of the naked boy standing in her room, awkwardly covering his crotch. She didn't really have any clothes for men to give him. Of course, that was also an opportunity to test the book, something easy enough to take care of with its powers. She began by tossing him a towel from her computer chair, she had used it for her shower the night before, but she didn't expect him to complain when the alternative was to continue standing there stupidly awkward and nude. Then she slid the chair back and began to sit down, waving lightly for him to give it back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, slide it back over here\" *She began, tapping on her desk lightly with the palm of her hand* \"Let's try and figure this out, so you don't have to stand there naked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the slightest bit of hesitation as he was asked to give such a powerful tool away, but at the same time, what was he supposed to do if the book no longer answered his command. There was that look in his eyes, as if he was debating asking her to give the title back to him. But he chose not to say it and slid the book on the wooden surface of the desk, as evidently painful as missing out on such potent magic was, he seemed to decide that it was useless to ask at that time and that if their roles were reversed, he knew that he wouldn't give it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was about to simply write that his clothes would appear in her room, so that he could dress himself and be on his way and out of her hair, but with him standing there fully nude and herself being still topless, a small blush coming to her cheeks. All the emotions of the incredibly perverted and stupid move he had done to her, only seem to bubble out at once and she find herself hesitating. Instead of fixing things, she is quite tempted to get even and get some payback on him. She take out a pencil and began to scribble out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alex find himself beginning to calm down from his misadventures, with the two of us mostly naked and him having spent half the day hanging to my breasts, he will also begin to feel more at ease around me. Even if he's currently standing in a girl's room, he begins to feel at ease enough to sit down on the bed and have a little heart to heart chat with me. Alex won't notice anything wrong with being honest with me, he won't get overly embarrassed or shocked that he's answering honestly and won't notice anything amiss with doing so, since we've grown quite close today. Alex will also notice nothing wrong with me writing in the book and not giving him his clothes back expediently.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly she paused from writing it all down and looked back up toward him subtly after a moment, as she observed him, she could see him looking around the room a bit, having wrapped the towel around his hips, how his hands loosened on their hold of it was the first thing she noticed. He let go with one hand and slowly rubbed the back of his head, he seemed to be unsure what to do with himself while she was doing whatever it was she was doing, not that it really bothered him, so long as she'd help him out. Eventually, not quite looking bored, but still looking a bit unsure what to do beside standing there, he slowly move and then sit down on her bed. So far so good she think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it...?\" She ask lightly and subtly, testing out the book for making him open and honest to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was what?\" He answer with, a slight look of unease registering for a moment, before he slowly sighed and relaxed a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holding my breasts, silly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That....\" He pauses lightly, possibly looking for the right words to try and not offend her. \"...it was...interesting.... but it lost its luster pretty quickly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lightly thought on his words, taking it in and trying to figure out how to ask him for more details. \"What was interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed a fair bit, but, he stayed honest. \"Being wrapped around your torso and cupping your breasts was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you enjoyed cupping and being filled by my breasts?\" She point to, trying not to tease too much as she tapped her pencil on the book a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... yes. They are quite lovely. But like I said, it wasn't all amazing and lost its luster quickly, being unable to communicate, move or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you were a bra, an object\" he simply nods to that. \"Was holding a girl's breasts everything you were hoping? Because that's what you were thinking about when you accidentally turned yourself into my bra.... Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, well, I was...I...\" He fluster heavily despite what she wrote in the book, which she finds interesting. But he doesn't bolt out despite the red face and try and calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was thinking about holding your breasts yes.\" He admits after a moment. \"I'm a guy and you girls have.. such a sway on us, I can't really help that I'm interested in them.. Nice, big, bouncy and soft... They're so appealing...\" He adds, a bit more quiet and subdued as he's honest about his interest in girls like he's never been with one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it everything you had hoped for?\" She ask again. \"...yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...\" she pause, somewhere between wondering if she dares or if she can't be that teasing. \"Always fantasizing about holding girls breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?! N-no! I mean, it happens! I'm a teenager, th-there's hormones and all! B-but not always?!\" He defends stammering, she's amazed at the book for mostly containing how embarrassed that seems to have made him, watching him calm down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... often fantasize about.... my breasts?\" She ask softly, a bit sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you... wear those thin shirts often.... I see your strap in your back and... I'm just a teenage guy you know, I... dunno, not all the time.... but maybe often?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seems to make her pause a bit, thinking a bit before asking the next one. \"If someone else had been sitting in front of you, would you have been day dreaming about another girl's breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that depends on who... probably?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the breasts of which girl in the class you day dream the most often about?\" She find herself asking lightly. An eyebrow lightly cocked in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's... most likely Cindy, she's got the biggest rack in the class and she's always flaunting them with tops that have low neckline...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... rank do you think of my breasts in our class...?\" She ask almost in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah.. I'd say... uhm, fourth?\" He answer softly, rubbing the back of his head lightly. \"B-but that's exclusively for the breasts, you know!\" He add quickly, seeing her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe don't really know how his answers make her feel, she felt like she had been pretty up there and had worked hard the last two years to be approachable. But she still hadn't had a boyfriend yet. While she knew for a fact that Cindy was at her third just from the start of this year alone, and the other girls with bigger breasts then her, has had their share too. She start scribbling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My breasts grow out to a generous E-cup size, almost up to F-cups and unbeknownst to Alex, his time as my bra has had a bit of an effect on him and he finds himself craving to touch them again, the thoughts of all their weight, their firm softness pressing in his cups still lingering. And to him they had already been this new size before I got the book.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peek again at him and his expression, starting to change as he a little bit more openly staring at them. She lightly gasp as she feel their growth spurt, going from not quite a D and all the way to exactly what she wrote down. She can feel the shifting of their weight and how much they tug her down. Making her quickly add in a caveat that she has a slightly stronger back, used to carrying around those big breasts. Making her sigh in relief a bit. She lightly shift the position she's sitting in, just to show them off more, pushing them out a bit to see his eyes almost bugging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to touch them again?\" She says softly, eyes dead set on him, pencil slightly tapping the paper. As she thinks on exactly what she want to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. I...I definitively would love that\" He admits, looking nervously from her serious eyes and down to her large bust several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be willing to let you have at them....\" She begins, laying down the trap. \"If you accept my condition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pause a bit, leering at her large bust quite a bit before swallowing a bit \"Condition?...\"</span></div></div>",

Then out of nowhere, tackles him and they land on the opposite side of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms wrap around him as her body rubs against his. She calms down after a while, and is now just laying on him, a small smile on her face, saying her first words, \"master\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew pulls her off of him and she is now sitting across from him. She just stares at him, still smiling at him. \"Uh.....ok.....You can talk, good. That means the book did exactly what I wanted\", he pauses, \"still, to be able to actually create a living person like this.....Just how powerful is it?\", she is still staring at him. \".....Right! You need a name! But what to call you?...................Maxine. Yes. Your name is Maxine. That's close enough to my name and is still different enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Maxine.....\", she says to herself. Her smile gets bigger again and she jumps on him once more. \"I-I guess you like it, huh?\". \"Yes!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and after removing her from himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks her over, \"guess you can't stay naked forever\", he says outloud, opening the book. A pair of panties, a bra, shirt, skirt, socks, and shoes appear next to her. \"Get dressed\", he tells her. She puts on everything, except the socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a name and some clothes.....Just a few more things.....but those can wait.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....I have a question....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"? Of course, and you don't have to be so reserved about it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.

Matthew just sighs, knowing he can't get out of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt is now sitting on a couch, with Maxine next to him with Alison and Katelyn sitting across from them. Katelyn looks amused, Alison is confused, and Maxine is just smiling. \".....Guess I can't hide it. I'll be right back\". He then run upstairs to get the book. He grabs it, then thinks about erasing their memories, but stops himself. \"I'm not going to do that\", then heads back downstairs and sits back down. \"This is how\", he says, giving Katelyn the book.Katelyn takes a sip of her beer, \"then this is some kind of magic book\", she says, while looking it over. \"Y-yes\". She passes it Alison, \"alright, now, tell me everything.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tells them how he got and everything that has happened since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another sip, \"so, in other words, I now have a little sister\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thats one way to look at it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.....You know, I thought you were crossdressing for a second there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....What?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you went to answer the door, I went back to watching TV.

I tell ya, I was surprised. But then I saw something, walked over to her, and lifted up her shirt.....That was when I knew she wasn't you\", she then takes another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison is still a little upset, hands the book back to him. \"What are you going to do now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, I am going to giver her a story, just haven't done it yet\". Katelyn then slaps her knees and they all look at her as she gets up. \"Enough of this!\", she says, \"your all so serious!\". She leaves and comes back with another beer. \"Maxine, was it? And you 2 Alison, come with me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: \"Where are you taking them?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else! What better way to get to know someone than to bathe together?\", she then drags Alison to their biggest bathroom with Maxine trailing behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison: \"Why am I going?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn: \"To get to know her, and besides, she is his twin. By doing this, you'll get an idea of what he looks like naked!\" Alison blushes and Katelyn locks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk, wash, and get to know each other.

I wouldn't exist without him!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn: \"Alright, let's go\", she says, getting up, followed by Alison and Maxine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: \"Where are you going?\".

Matt: \"I could just have them appear\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn: \"There is more to shopping than just buying stuff, let's go, cya later Matt\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start to leave, then Matt stops them. \"Max! Wait! Here, write exactly what I just did\", he tells her, handing her the book and pen. They look at what he wrote. I CAN USE THE BOOK NO MATTER WHAT AND IT WILL COME TO ME WHENEVER I WISH IT. MAKE ME ABLE TO COMMUNICAT WITH MAXINE THROUGH THOUGHTS. Matt: \"this way, if something happens, we'll be covered\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes it and does what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn: \"Aww, what a caring older brother!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt: \".....Of course.

He grabs the book then leaves. \"Maybe I can find something else to use it on out here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he finds himself at a table surrounded by stores and restauraunts. The book in front of him, he looks out at the various people sitting around him, going in and out of the buildings, and the few that are just passing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Time to have a little fun), he thinks, looking for his first target. He spots her. A girl sitting with a few friends at another table. He looks her over, and sees that she has the smallest breasts amongst them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl and her friends are talking to each other when her breasts start to vibrate. She looks down, as does her friends, then, to their surprise, they start to inflate. They all just stare, wide-eyed, as they grow until they are biggest ones at the table. She grabs them, and one of the girls next to her pokes them, to see if this was some trick. The girl than looks down her shirt, and they were indeed real. She faints, and her friends jump to their feet and go to her.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slightly chuckles at this, then looks away, hoping to find someone else to test his book on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spots his next target. By a candy store, some guy was hitting on this girl and her friend; who were clearly not interested and trying to walk away. (How about a little time on the other side)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continues to harass them, but then the girls notice something. His hair was growing! And not just that, his clothes seemed to be getting looser as his voice was getting lighter. 2 mounds started to stick through his shirt and were getting bigger and rounder. The girls are staring at him, just stunned. Seeing the weird looks on their faces, he looks down and sees what is happening to him. Her loose pants then fall down. She picks them back up, screams, then runs away, the 2 girls laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling the pen in his fingers, (You can spend some time like this), he then finds his 3rd target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt another table, in between him and the girl with bigger breasts, there sat a young girl, her mom, and a puppy. There is a pet store here, and it looks like her mom just got it for her. He sees how well they get along, then gets an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table, was some pet supplies. But, right next to these supplies, a portion of the table started to glow. They stare at it, then the light vanishes and some clothes are now lying there. The mother cautioulsy examines these clothes, then part 2 happens. A thin blue light envelops the dog. The mom immediately grabs her daughter and backs away from it. It slowly starts to grow. It's back legs become feet as it's front become hands. It's fur receeds and stops at it's head which then lengthens as hair. The glow fades and a young girl, about the age of her owner, with dog ears, tail, and a collar is sitting there, looking up at them. The first girl runs over to her former dog and hugs her. She starts happily shouting at her mom, who snaps out of it, and she then walks over to the 2 of them. The mom dresses the new girl and they eventually leave. (I will check up on them later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the area, he doesn't see anything truly interesting. (Guess that's it.....It has been a while.....I wonder where they are)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find his new sister, his older sister, and his lifelong friend, he pulls out a regular sheet of paper, then writes in his book. TURN THIS PIECE OF PAPER INTO A HELICOPTER AND GIVE ME A CONTROLLER FOR IT. MAKE IT SO I CAN SEE WHERE IT IS AND WHAT IT'S LOOKING AT IN THIS BOOK. AND POINT ME IN THEIR GENERAL DIRECTION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheet of paper begins to fold itself into a shape of a helicopter as a controller appears next to it. Picking up the controller, he turns it on and the helicopter slowly lifts up off of the ground. The page next to his wishes then shows what is directly below the helicopter as it flies up and over the plaza. Matt gets up, the book in one hand and the controller in the other as he follows the arrow leading towards them above the picture in the book and gets an aerial view with his paper helicopter.</span></div></div>",

Your thighs follow suit, stretching your pants until they rip apart, then meeting. Your calves lose definition and get a little pudgy as well, and you see your abs disappear under a layer of fat- but these things are eclipsed by your huge ass. Your arms then start to tingle, and you grab at them as you feel your muscles shrink, and then your arms swell up a bit again with feminine fat. Your face goes a bit numb, and though you can't see it, your quite sure its softened up some as well, losing its masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you're an out of shape feminine man,\" says Ms. Dunn, \"I removed your breasts because they sort of clash with the image I'm going for- tootles! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Dunn begins to leave you, but you exclaim, \"What, what do I wear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tosses you a pair of stretchy pink sweat pants that you had no idea she had, \"Use these for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop down on your chair, which your ass fills out quite well now and think about what you've gotten yourself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Ms. Dunn, \"Remember, the company 5k run is tomorrow, assistance is mandatory!\"</span></div></div>",

In this body he was sweating from the walk into work and it was only in the low 80's.  His competitive spirit getting the best of him as he thinks that he can at least do better than some of the girls in the office, not realizing that he's about the same size as the biggest of them.   The gun goes off and he almost reaches a slow jog, finding himself slowing down to a fast, jiggling walk almost a half a kilometer into the race.  He's soon at the bottom of the pack, slipping behind more an more of the racers.  Deluding himself he thinks he'll just keep this pace up and then sprint towards the finish line.  With one kilometer left he tries to run towards the finish line.  Slowly passing a few of his co-workers, but he's breathing is very winded and although the finish line is in sight he has to slow down and start a slow fatigued walk as he tries to catch his remaining breath.  He gets a pat on the back from one of his fellow co-workers as she passes him and shoots him a big grin.  He soon finishes the race among a pack of stragglers, many in their 50s and 60s, none who he recognized.  He sees his co-workers waiting for him, he'd hoped they left, but now there's no place for him to sneak away towards.</span></div></div>",

He knew the girls found him \"cute\" and he was ok with that, he was popular and smart, the only thing he wished for was to be more athletic, better at sports and things like that. He has always wished this, he was the first in his family to not excel at sports, everyone in his family was better at sports than him, even his little brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he got home, like usual, he goes for a jog at a local park, trying to make himself stronger, but he doesn't last long, his body tires easily, he just isn't the type for this kind of thing. \"Damn, why do I have this weak body!\" he yells out loud. He takes a quick breather and leans against a tree. 10 minutes pass and gets ready to run some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he leaves the tree, one of his feet hits something. Looking down, he sees something shiny covered in dirt. He bends over and cleans it off, it looked like a plaque. \"What the hell? What is something like this doing here?\" he sees as he tries to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......DESIRE.....DIG BENE.....PLAQUE. He could tell that it had been there for a long time, most of the words were worn off, though because he was so smart, he easily figured out most of what it was saying. \"Hmmm....something like, if you desire power, dig beneath this plaque? At least that is my guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assumes it's fake, but what the hell, its not like someone just planted this, its too old. So he quickly runs home and gets a small shovel and heads back to the plaque and starts to dig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has dug pretty deep by now, and just when he was about to give up, the shovel hits something with a clanging sound. He drops the shovel and uses his hands to carefully pull out what was buried there. It was a trunk, a very old trunk. He slowly opens it, and there was a book, a pure black book with strange writings and symbols all over it. He pulls it out and notices a letter with it. He picks it up and reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIF YOU HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK, THEN YOU HAVE SOME DEEP DESIRE THAT YOU DESPERATELY WANT TO COME TRUE. THIS BOOK CAN MAKE THAT AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU DESIRE COME TRUE. JUST SIMPLY WRITE DOWN IN ITS INFINITE PAGES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing as smart as he is, he is pretty sure that this is some joke, \"anything I desire huh, yeah right,....hmmm.\" though as smart as he is, he can't help but second guess this, \"ok, there can't be any harm in just testing this?\" he says as he picks up the book. SEE FIRST PAGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops it, and looks around, no one. This only makes him want to try even more. He pulls out a pencil he keeps on him and prepares to write down his first wish.....</span></div></div>",

Did you write that?\" he nods his head, \"why would you write something like that?\" \"I'll show you why,\" he replies back as he motions for her to give it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls out the same pencil and flips the book to the same page as his first wish.

Chris tells Amy<br>\r\nto crawl into her skirt to cover herself. So then Amy thinks that Chris is going to<br>\r\nmake her skirt as small as she currently is. She is quite displeased with that,<br>\r\nbecause she thinks that he's planning to return her to her original size but leave<br>\r\nher boobs uncovered. So she is mystified to see him collect up the rest of her<br>\r\nclothing, separating her lingerie from the rest of it. He then writes in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALL OF AMY'S UNDERWEAR WILL FIT HER <br>\r\nNO MATTER WHAT SIZE OR SHAPE SHE IS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees him again writing in the book and expecting to grow back to her old<br>\r\nsize, Amy is surprised when she doesn't feel anything happening to her. When<br>\r\nshe asks him what he wrote Chris just smiles and says, \"Amy I think that you<br>\r\nwill like this one better.\" Further asking him, \"Why do you think that?\" He says,<br>\r\n\"It's all done now.\" Lifting up her lingerie and showing them to her, he tells Amy,<br>\r\n\"Here I think you could use these. I'll go into the kitchen and wait for you to call<br>\r\nme when you're more presentable.\" Amy's opinion of Chris has now improved.<br>\r\nOnce Amy puts on her bra and panties she quickly runs over to look at the book<br>\r\nto see what Chris had written in it. (He had left it open on the table). At first, she<br>\r\nthinks that he was sweet to write that. At least, now she will stay covered when<br>\r\nhe changes her size again. She then notices that he wrote in the same sentence<br>\r\n'SHAPE'. That makes her a little nervous. When she calls him to return she is<br>\r\nstanding on the couch in her lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris asks her, \"How does it fit?\" She replies, \"It feels molded to my body, but<br>\r\nwhy didn't you just return me to my normal height?\" Instead of answering Amy's<br>\r\nquestion, he went to gently pick her up. He asks her which doll was her favorite<br>\r\nwhen she was younger and where it is now? She tells him which one it is and<br>\r\nthat it is still in her bedroom. So he carries her to her bedroom. Setting her down<br>\r\non her four poster bed Chris gets out Amy's favorite doll sitting it down next to<br>\r\nher. Amy then says that she wants to change out of her present underwear into<br>\r\nsomething a little sexier because it would go better with her doll. It was one of<br>\r\nthose dolls with an overly large bust and hips with a ridiculously narrow waist.<br>\r\nSo Amy asks Chris to carry her over to her lingerie drawer. She intends showing<br>\r\nhim which outfit she wants to put on. She assumes that all of her other lingerie<br>\r\nis still normal sized. Chris opens the drawer. Looking in he says, \"Whoops.\"<br>\r\nHe doesn't have Amy in his hand so she can't see that ALL of her panties and<br>\r\nbras are now sized for Amy's current height of nearly 9 inches. He tells he<br>\r\nabout her now shrunken underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she is a bit angry with him, but then starts laughing. Before he can ask<br>\r\nAmy why she's laughing she tells him, \"Boy, I wonder if your sister was wearing<br>\r\nthe swimsuit she borrowed from me last week. I bet she was really embarrassed<br>\r\nwhen it suddenly shrunk and popped off of her body.\" When he looks at her with<br>\r\na quizzical look, Amy explains to Chris, all bikini's are considered lingerie now.<br>\r\nAfter pondering on that for a few seconds, Chris also starts laughing and says,<br>\r\n\"Man, I would have liked seeing the expression on her face when your bikini did<br>\r\nstart shrinking Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris carries Amy over to her lingerie drawer and carefully puts her inside. But<br>\r\nbefore she picks out what she wants Amy asks Chris what's he planning to do<br>\r\nwith her and why he wanted to know which was her favorite doll? He says, that<br>\r\nhe wants to keep it a surprise, but he thinks that Amy will like it. If she doesn't<br>\r\nhe'll quickly reverse things like he did with the dog earlier today. She accepts<br>\r\nhis explanation and chooses her lingerie. Quickly, he slides the drawer closed<br>\r\nso that she can change in private. Boy, she starts thinking, I bet my body must<br>\r\nreally be embarrassing him. Just about any other boy would insist I change out<br>\r\nof my lingerie in front of them. Amy's feelings about Chris are growing warmer.<br>\r\nAfter changing Amy knocks on the side of the drawer so that Chris can open it<br>\r\nand he returns her to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then asks Amy which of her dolls clothes does she like the most. She<br>\r\ntells him, He gets it out of the doll case and hands it to her after placing both<br>\r\nof them in her bathroom. Amy thinks that Chris won't do anything bad to her<br>\r\nbut she is getting worried about all this cloak &amp; dagger. Amy's doll is shorter<br>\r\nthan her so she starts wondering if Chris is planning to shrink her even smaller<br>\r\nso that she can fit into her doll's slinky dress. Especially after Chris asks Amy<br>\r\nto put the dress on even-though it may be a little small. When Chris asks Amy, <br>\r\nif she's ready she replies, \"Yes\" and so Amy's surprised when her body starts<br>\r\ngrowing larger and not smaller. In the book Chris wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAMY WILL SLOWLY BECOME THE SAME SHAPE AS THE DOLL THAT I'VE<br>\r\nJUST PLACED IN THE BATHROOM WITH HER. WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING<br>\r\nSHE WILL DOUBLE IN HEIGHT EACH MINUTE UNTIL SHE IS EXACTLY TEN<br>\r\nTIMES AS TALL AS THE DOLL CURRENTLY IS. THE CLOTHES WILL GROW<br>\r\nWITH HER AND BE SKINTIGHT WHEN SHE FINISHES GROWING. IN EVERY<br>\r\nPOSSIBLE WAY SHE WILL BE THE DOLL'S ABSOLUTE DUPLICATE. AMY<br>\r\nWILL 'IN FACT' BE A TRUE LIVING DOLL UNTIL I WRITE OTHERWISE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Amy around a minute and a half before she realizes that her body shape<br>\r\nis changing as she grows. She assumes that Chris is growing her back to her<br>\r\nnormal height of 5 foot 9 inches (175 cm). Which was his intention, unfortunately<br>\r\nhe had underestimated Amy's dolls height, so she will end up being a little over<br>\r\n6 1/2 feet tall (2 meters exactly). Because the dolls hair went all the way down<br>\r\nto its knees, Amy's hair will too along with changing color to becoming fiery red.<br>\r\nBecause that was the only hair on the doll by the time Amy's growth ends she<br>\r\nwill have no other hair on her body except for her dolls very long eyelashes and<br>\r\neyebrows. Amy was lucky that she chose one of those new anatomically correct<br>\r\ndolls otherwise Chris's wish would have eliminated all of her genitalia other than<br>\r\nthe over-sized nipples and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growing stops Amy turns to look at her body in the full length mirror<br>\r\nin her bathroom. She's startled by all of the changes that've occurred. Also, Amy<br>\r\nis grateful to Chris and desires to immediately reward him. When Amy calls out<br>\r\ntelling Chris that the changes have stopped she's stunned by how sexy her voice<br>\r\nnow sounds. Hearing her voice, Chris faints with a loud thud. Hearing that Amy<br>\r\nopens the door to see him passed out on her bedroom's hardwood floor. Since<br>\r\nChris is out cold and won't object Amy reads what he had written in the book. <br>\r\nShe is totally perplexed about why he wrote what he did. Mind you, she's not<br>\r\ncomplaining one bit about how things turned out. She's just wondering did he<br>\r\ntruly intend all of this for her. Particularly, now that the doll is as tall as Amy.<br>\r\nShe also hasn't realized that they both now weigh around 30 pounds (14 kg.).</span></div></div>",

After shaking him for several minutes trying to revive him without<br>\r\nsuccess, Amy decides to throw some water in his face. That also fails and Amy is<br>\r\nnow starting to worry about Chris. She decides to call Isis, Chris's step-sister who<br>\r\nhad borrowed Amy's bikini that must have shrunk when Amy's lingerie did earlier that<br>\r\nday. Isis didn't answer her mobile. Seeing her car still in front of her house she thinks<br>\r\nthat Isis might be in the shower and so doesn't hear it. However, seconds after she<br>\r\nhung up Amy's phone rang and it was Isis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly getting over her surprise Amy asks Isis if they have any smelling salts. Isis<br>\r\nreplies that she thinks so. Telling Amy to hold the phone Isis looks and in 3 minutes<br>\r\nfinds a bottle of smelling salts and tells Amy to come over and get it. Amy reluctant<br>\r\nto go outside in her 'new enhanced body' asks Isis to bring it over. Isis says that she<br>\r\nis not herself right now, so Amy agrees to go over to pick up the bottle. Isis's voice<br>\r\non the phone was much deeper than usual so Amy figures that she must be coming<br>\r\ndown with a cold. Maybe she got a chill while swimming at Rosie's pool party today.<br>\r\nSince she will only be a minute or two Amy decides to leave her front door unlocked<br>\r\nwhile she dashes over to Chris &amp; Isis's house. Being skin tight, Amy's dress really<br>\r\nemphasizes her curves so she hopes not of the neighborhood gossips see her while<br>\r\nshe is outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinging the door bell Amy hears Isis yell from the top of the stairs, \"It's unlocked the<br>\r\nbottle is on the front hall table.\" Although she does want to get back to help Chris,<br>\r\nAmy is curious about why Isis's voice is so deep and strong. She thanks Isis for the<br>\r\nbottle and then pretends to leave closing the front door loudly. Amy then hears very<br>\r\nloud footsteps descending the stairs and Isis saying out loud to herself, \"Thank God,<br>\r\nAmy didn't see me like this. What am I going to do about this?\" Turning the corner<br>\r\ninto the living room Amy asks, \"About what Isis?\" As soon as Isis sees Amy's new<br>\r\nbody she exclaims, \"Wow Amy, its happened to you too.\" Amy on the other hand is<br>\r\nnow speechless. She is standing there looking at her former 5' 2\" blue eyed blonde<br>\r\ncheer-leader captain and good friend now several inches taller than Amy is now with<br>\r\neven more curves than Amy. It's more than 30 seconds before Isis claps her hands<br>\r\nin Amy's face which snaps her out of her trance. Isis then asks Amy, \"what did she<br>\r\nneed the smelling salts for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy now remembers about Chris still passed out on her bedroom floor. Telling Isis<br>\r\nto come with her the two girls dash back to Amy's house. Once they get upstairs<br>\r\nAmy tells Isis that she better stay in the hallway. Chris hasn't seen Amy's new body<br>\r\nand so she's doesn't know how he'll react. Once she starts coming around at first<br>\r\nChris doesn't realize that Amy is now nearly 10 inches taller. She asks him, \"Did<br>\r\nyou mean to do this to me?\" Looking closely at Amy and still not noticing her new<br>\r\nheight Chris replies, \"Gee Amy, you're more beautiful than Miss Universe. I'd think<br>\r\nyou would like your new body.\" She's really taken by his comment so Amy blushes<br>\r\nalmost as red as her hair. She says, \"It's not my shape that I'm unhappy with, it's<br>\r\nmy new size.\" \"What new size, Amy? I wrote that you were to return to being 5 foot<br>\r\n9 inches tall.\" Chris said. Stand up Chris, Amy says. Once he stand Chris finally<br>\r\nrealizes that Amy is now well over half a foot taller than him. \"Oops.\" he says. \"Now<br>\r\nhow did this happen? Man, this book is even trickier to use than I thought.\" \"What<br>\r\nbook?\" Chris hears behind him coming from the hallway in another very deep and<br>\r\nsexy voice. When he turns around Chris only sees most of Isis standing in the door<br>\r\nway (She is now taller than the door.) he again faints. Fortunately, they have enough<br>\r\nsmelling salts to revive him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he again wakes up Chris goes over and picks up the book to try to figure out<br>\r\nwhy the two girls he's closest to have become so large and beautiful. Amy was much<br>\r\neasier to figure out. Apparently, writing that Amy would grow 10 times taller would've<br>\r\nonly worked had the doll been 1/10 of Amy's original height. \"It must have been taller<br>\r\nthan 6.9 inches.\" Chris says. Now Isis makes no sense at all. He hasn't written one<br>\r\nword about her in the book. While Chris was rereading the book, Amy told Isis some<br>\r\nabout the book and its magical abilities. So Chris asks Isis to tell him everything that<br>\r\nhas happened to her today. She talks for awhile and finally gets to down to when she<br>\r\nhad just put her sundress on over Amy's swim suit. She felt this incredible rushing<br>\r\nfeeling all inside of her while she was on the phone to Rosie. She was sitting on her<br>\r\nbed at the time and didn't notice that she was shrinking until the feeling stopped.<br>\r\nAha! he exclaims. For some strange reason, because you happened to be wearing<br>\r\nsome of Amy's lingerie when it was affected by the book you were similarly changed.<br>\r\nThat also explains why you grew so tall. Since your normal height is 5 foot 2, when<br>\r\nI wrote that Amy should grow 10 times taller it multiplied the difference in you 2 girls<br>\r\nheights to grow you to be over 7 foot tall now, I guess. Chris then wonders out loud,<br>\r\n\"I wonder if either of you girls was changed in any other way by the book?\"</span></div></div>",

Amy had neglected to lock it when<br>\r\nIsis and her had returned from Isis's house. It's Amy's mother and she is angry<br>\r\nthat the door was unlocked. Yelling at Amy to immediately come downstairs<br>\r\nshe panics. Amy asks Chris, \"How am I going to hide my wonderful body from<br>\r\nmy mother?\" Thinking on it for over a minute Chris suddenly realizes that HIDE<br>\r\nis the key word. He writes something in the book without showing it to the girls<br>\r\nand tells Amy that its alright for her to go downstairs. She does and is pleasantly<br>\r\nsurprised that her mother only berates about the front door being unlocked again.<br>\r\nOnce her mother finishes her lecture Amy goes back upstairs to find out what<br>\r\nChris had done this time.    He had written:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nONLY AMY, ISIS AND MYSELF WILL BE ABLE TO SEE ANY CHANGES <br>\r\nTO THEIR BODIES. ALL OTHERS WILL SEE THEIR BODIES THE SAME<br>\r\nSIZE AND SHAPE THAT THEY WERE WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WOKE<br>\r\nUP THIS MORNING.

Isis is a little worried<br>\r\nabout that. Since Chris has not had really good luck with the book so far she<br>\r\nwonders how things will backfire this time. Oh well, she figures they'll find out<br>\r\nsoon enough. Isis then has a BIG question for Chris. She just really loves her<br>\r\nnew body. However, how on Earth is she going to be able to do all of the tricks<br>\r\nwith the cheer leading team at next Friday's football game. After all, at her new<br>\r\nsize nothing will work as they've been practicing. She also asks him about the<br>\r\ngymnastics practice she has to go to in a little while. Gymnasts are not 7 foot<br>\r\nwhatever. He asks her how long until she needs to leave and she replies about<br>\r\n20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then tells Isis that while he thinks about her situation she should change<br>\r\nout of Amy's swimsuit in the bathroom while she's here. He says, \"I'm sure Amy<br>\r\nhas some lingerie that will fit you. Sarcastically Amy replies, \" Thanks brother<br>\r\nfor the information.\" So Isis goes to change into something better to wear and<br>\r\nlearns something new. The second she unclasps Amy's top her bust starts to<br>\r\nshrink back to her normal size. Quickly she rehooks it and her bust starts filling<br>\r\nit up again. Quietly, so as not to disturb Chris while he's thinking about how to<br>\r\nfix things Isis calls Amy into the bathroom. Throwing modesty aside Isis shows<br>\r\nAmy her inflating boob trick. Amy then wonders if the bottoms work the same<br>\r\nway. Isis says, \"Let's find out.\" Taking the bikini bottom off did not reduce Isis<br>\r\nin any way. Amy tells Isis that they should not tell Chris about this right now.<br>\r\n\"He might decide to try to fix it and things would probably get worse. At least<br>\r\nwe now know something he doesn't. We should keep it this way. It might prove<br>\r\nuseful in the future.\" Isis agrees, and is not surprised that when she hooks one<br>\r\nof Amy's other bras her bust reinflates to the same size that Amy currently is.<br>\r\nTo buy some time, Chris suggests that Isis call the school and say that she's<br>\r\ncome down with a cold or something. It should give them a couple of days to<br>\r\ncome up with a more permanent solution to this problem. Chris realizes that if<br>\r\nat all possible Isis and Amy both want to keep their current killer bodies.</span></div></div>",

After all,<br>\r\naren't big brother's supposed to help out their \"little sisters\". Dashing out<br>\r\na very long entry Chris doesn't think about how many people this will hit.<br>\r\nIn the book he wrote the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANY GIRL WHO BETWEEN HER 14th &amp; 19th BIRTHDAY HAS BEEN ON<br>\r\nEASTLAND HIGH SCHOOL GROUNDS WILL BECOME PREGNANT THE<br>\r\nNEXT TIME HER PARTNER GETS TO SECOND BASE. AT THAT POINT<br>\r\nTHEY WILL BOTH BE UNABLE TO STOP UNTIL THEY'VE GONE ALL THE<br>\r\nWAY HAVING SEX. THIS INCLUDES ANYONE IN THE PAST OR FUTURE<br>\r\nTHAT FULFILLS THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THE SCHOOL OPENED 14<br>\r\nYEARS AGO. ALL PREGNANCIES WILL LAST 40 WEEKS WITH BOTH<br>\r\nTHE MOTHER AND BABY HAVING NO MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MOTHER<br>\r\nWILL, OF COURSE, HAVE MORNING SICKNESS FOR AS MANY WEEKS<br>\r\nAS SHE HAS HAD SEX PARTNERS STARTING IN THE 4th WEEK OF<br>\r\nHER PREGNANCY. AT THAT TIME SHE DECIDES TO SEE A DOCTOR<br>\r\nAND AFTER DOING SOME ROUTINE TESTS THE DOCTOR WILL CALL<br>\r\nBOTH OF HER PARENTS (IF STILL ALIVE) TO COME DOWN TO THAT<br>\r\nOFFICE FOR SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT INVOLVING THEIR<br>\r\nDAUGHTER. ONCE THEY ARE ALL TOLD ABOUT THE PREGNANCY AT<br>\r\nTHE SAME TIME SHOULD EITHER OR BOTH PARENTS ASK WHOSE<br>\r\nBABY IT IS, THAT GIRL WILL WITHOUT HESITATION ANSWER THEM<br>\r\n(EVEN IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWER BEFORE BEING ASKED).<br>\r\nSHE'LL GIVE UP THE NAME, ADDRESS AND TELEPHONE NUMBER.<br>\r\nALL GIRLS GETTING PREGNANT BEFORE GRADUATING WILL NOT BE<br>\r\nIN THEIR GRADUATION BECAUSE THEY WILL GRADUATE LATER, IF <br>\r\nAT ALL. A GIRL HAVING 2 OR MORE BABIES WILL NEVER GRADUATE<br>\r\nHIGH SCHOOL OR GET A GED EQUIVALENT. THIS WILL CONTINUE AT<br>\r\nEASTLAND HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS. AT THAT POINT<br>\r\nTHESE PREGNANCIES CAN STOP IF I'VE WRITTEN FOR IT TO STOP,<br>\r\nOTHERWISE THEY WILL CONTINUE UNTIL I DO WRITE FOR IT TO STOP.<br>\r\nEASTLAND HIGH SCHOOL WILL NEVER CLOSE AND ITS ATTENDANCE<br>\r\nBOUNDARIES CAN NEVER BE REDUCED. THE SCHOOL GROUNDS<br>\r\nWILL TRIPLE IN ACREAGE DURING THE NEXT 5 YEARS SO THAT IT<br>\r\nCAN ACCOMMODATE A LARGER STUDENT BODY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Chris wrote something so aggressive was because Isis had told<br>\r\nhim about the younger sister of one of her friends. She had caught that girl in<br>\r\nbed with her boyfriend. She was so humiliated, she had gone home and then<br>\r\nkilled herself that same day leaving a note why. The girl didn't get punished<br>\r\nat all, but the boyfriend was then prosecuted for statutory rape. The girl was<br>\r\nthen only 15. The only reason she hasn't been kicked out of school is her<br>\r\ngrades are among the highest in the graduating class and she's going to an<br>\r\nIvy League school next fall. The school administration is afraid of her father<br>\r\nsuing the District if they say anything bad about his pride and joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris has no idea the mess he has just created. Since he graduates in June<br>\r\nwith Amy &amp; Isis they'll all be away at college when the student body really<br>\r\nbegins growing next fall. The book is really having a good laugh over what is<br>\r\nto begin very soon. Since Chris had written a definite length for all of these<br>\r\npregnancies to last, none of the girls wanting abortions will be successful.</span></div></div>",

The giant doll had shrunk back down to its original height.  Then he looked at where Amy had sat.  In her place was a plastic doll that looked very similar to Amy wearing exactly what Amy had been wearing when he had first come inside.  He looked back at his writing and realized his mistake: He had called Amy a doll.  Muttering at his own stupidity, he wrote \"Turn Amy human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt her senses rush back to her.  She looked around...and jumped a mile high.  Actually, it was only about a millimeter, but for her is was quite the jump.  She was still tiny (although clothed for once)!<br>\r\n\"Oops.\"<br>\r\n\"Oops is right!

So I am.\"  Chris realized that with the mermaid instincts he had given her, the mermaids that the book referenced must not wear clothes and thus she thought nothing of it.  She usually stayed underwater, so he couldn't really see anything anyway, he reasoned.  \"Come on, Chris!  The water's great!\"<br>\r\nChris hesitated.  Did he really want to transform himself?  Ah, heck, she seemed happy enough.  Remembering the clothes issue this time, he stripped bare, then wrote \"Me too.\"</span></div></div>",

She wiped her forehead relatively clean of sweat with a sleeve, and dug her shovel in again, only to stop as she hit something besides dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t feel like rock \u2013 it was too smooth. She cleared away the dirt on top of it, and picked it up. It was a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of person would just bury a book like that? Olivia had no idea, but decided to take a rest as she perused its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWouldn\u2019t you know it? The pages were all blank. Olivia sighed, when a voice echoed, \u201cSee first page.\u201d \u201cHello?\u201d Olivia yelled. \u201cWho said that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said what, Olivia?\u201d asked a passerby. Olivia was something of a celebrity in her neighborhood for being a digging freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 nothing,\u201d Olivia said. It probably wasn\u2019t worth pursuing anyway. She took a look at the first page, and saw these words: \u201cCongratulations on becoming the master of this book! Anything the master writes in these pages becomes reality. ONLY the master can write in this book \u2013 any other writers will have their ink sucked into the page unless the master specifically writes their permission into the same page. This book cannot be destroyed except by its current master. It cannot leave the master unless the master dies or relinquishes mastership. Have fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was at a loss for words. This book\u2026 this book was capable of altering reality? She just couldn\u2019t believe it. It was worth a test\u2026 but she didn\u2019t have anything to write with on hand. She quickly climbed up the hole with the book in her arms, went home, and borrowed a pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holed up in her room, sucking on the eraser of the pencil and wondering what to write\u2026</span></div></div>",

This was probably natural, because she was sitting down. She stood up, and was amazed at how light her body felt. She felt great... no, she felt super. She felt like she could dig any distance, no problem... which she probably could. Of course, she'd have to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, et cetera...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia grinned at the idea she had. She wrote, \"I do not need to eat, sleep, breathe, or go to the bathroom.

This time, it lasted a lot longer, and she could also feel it inside her. The feeling made her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, as she remembered that you could die from internal bleeding. She wrote, \"My body automatically reverses all internal injuries it receives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the ideas were flooding her mind. She decided to write, \"I do not forget anything\" in the book. She then wrote, \"I do not get the 'bends' from diving too deep. My nervous system is completely indestructible. My thought speed is ten times faster than a supercomputer.\" She couldn't write fast enough to get all the ideas on paper, especially after that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her pencil broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked dumbly at the broken stump.

Carl ran into the other room and grabbed 2 cans of Pepsi for them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive wondered quickly on what to write before he returned. She was not sure if Carl could handle being strong. So she quickly wrote down 'Carl is my cousin and he will <b>always</b> be very polite, very friendly, and very respectful to everyone.'  There was a whirring sound as she placed the crayon in the desk drawer. Carll then returned to the room with two chilled Pepsi for them. He handed one to Olive. Then they started to color together. In fact, both of them had a good time coloring and chatting. Then they both realized that they were coloring for 25 minutes. Carl realized this and sincerely apologized. But Olive patted him on the head saying that she had a great time coloring with him. With a smile, Carl left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Olive grabbed the crayon back out and wrote down...I will find 4 pencils and 4 pens in my desk to use...There was a whirring sound and the 4 pens and pencils appeared.

Quite a bit...!\" said her aunt as her uncle was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't your father say you would get a breast reduction?\" said her uncle with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Well they aren't bothersome so why should I and its expensive.\" Silver said scratching her head. \" So what brings you guys here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know its a family reunion for 3 days starting tomorrow but for adults only. So we were hoping you could watch over our kids. Hope it isn't too much.\" said her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get payed.\" said her Uncle Bismark, rubbing the head of their son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! I'd love to! Like I have anything else better to do for the long weekend!\" Silver said smiling as she looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Timmy and this is Thea.\" said her aunt as they waved hello to her. Her uncle carried their bags inside her house. Silver quite startled by the sudden event that had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look after these two as well... They're from you Aunt Delilah. There only two but I think you can handle them!\" said her Aunt Lorraine. \"Their names are Zach and Sheila! Don't worry we'll be back soon. Take care! Bye!\" as the parents kissed their kids and nephew and niece as Silver saw a taxi waiting outside. She sighed once more as she took the kids to the living room to watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys hungry?\" Silver asked but they just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already ate!\" said Zach who seemed to be the hyper out of the four. He had his hair spiky while his younger sister Sheila had pig tails. They were both brown haired. What Silver thought would be a simple babysitting job soon turned out to be a nightmare. The three (Sheila, Zach and Timmy) were running all around while Thea seemed to hide next to her. Sheila would always poke at her breasts while Zach and Timmy made a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dang it! These three are annoying... There has to be a way to calm them down.</i>\" Silver thought as she saw the book with no name in sights. She began to think otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder what I could do with you.</i>\" thought Silver as the three were running around screaming while Thea hung around her left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver wrote a few things in the \"book with no name\". The ability to eat people, a stretchable jaw, a belly that can stretch, the ability to control her stomach whether to digest or not, whoever would be in her stomach can breath normally,and she can puke them out with minimal effort. Then she closed the book, put it on a high shelf and decided to think how to get them into her stomach. Thinking as Thea had fallen asleep on the coach, then an idea came to mind. Giggling she got up and made her announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys! Let's play hide and seek. You three hide and I go seek. The one I find gets punished for getting caught by me! I'll count to 20.\" said Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! Like your going to catch me!\" said Timmy as Silver began counting to 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the best at this!\" said Sheila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm getting caught!\" said Zach as all three began hiding in their hiding places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"17,18,19,20! Ready or not here I come.\" said Silver as she licked her lips. She looked in the bedrooms but to no avail. She thought this would be the easiest place to find them but guess not. Then she heard a giggle, it was coming from the large laundry basket. Smiling she approached it with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This has to be Sheila.</i>\" said Silver as she opened the lid to reveal the brown haired girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You caught me! They must of told ya!\" said Sheila pouting in the laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Rules are rules and you are going to get punished by me.\" said Silver \"This is for hitting me breasts.\" as she bent over, mouth wide open as the the startled little girl couldn't scream as she was gobbled up quickly by Silver. It caused her t-shirt to rip a bit in the middle revealing her cleavage as Silver rolled on her back. Patting her belly as she watched Sheila struggle about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's your prison for tonight. Don't worry you won't digest and you'll have prisonmates in a bit.\" said Silver as she slowly got up and walked to her room to put on a large thin yellow sweater. It covered her belly nicely and she's sure it she hole 2 more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where could the other 2 be.\" as Silver walked down the stairs to check on Thea who was still sound asleep. Silver moaned a bit by the kick that Sheila made inside of her resulting her in rubbing it. Looking like she was pregnant near full term. Soon enough she found Timmy hiding in the laundry room. Just like Sheila, gobbled him up quickly. Feeling her belly stretch with its new prisoner, she leaned on the dryer. Patting her belly, Silver was surprised to see Zach looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate Timmy?!?\" he said shocked, looking at Silver's belly as it moved and squirmed about. It wasn't loud enough but you can hear muffled voices inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and they feel good inside of me. Wanna touch it?\" said Silver showing her large belly where movement could be seen. Zach came up and but his hand on it feeling someone push it right back. He seemed curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nice and warm inside. Beats the heater and you'll feel safe and sound.\" said Silver as she looked at Zach with warm and kind eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!?\" he said as Silver nodded. \"Let me in!\" he said jumping. Silver having problems bending over, 1. Due to her large belly and 2. her large breasts. So the only thing she could do was bend on her knees. Helping Zach a bit by lifting him, Zach did what looked like a diving pose as Silver opened her mouth and swallowed him whole. She hit her butt on the floor, as she rubbed her belly. It covered her knees by half as it wobbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels really good.\" said Silver as she rubbed her belly. Slowly getting up once more, she carried her belly over to the coach where Thea was resting and sat down. Thea woke up as Silver brushed her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry for waking you. Didn't mean to scare you Thea!\" said Silver as she saw her looking at her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you pregnant?\" said Thea as she went near the belly. Rubbing it as well as Silver smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but your cousins and older brother are in here.\" Silver said patting her belly. Her eyes went wide as Silver started to worry what she would do or say then Thea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your unfair I got left out!\" she said punching Silver on the arm as Silver rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go in?\" said Silver a bit confused as she thought Thea would be scared but she's angry cause she's not inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a prison. You still wanna go in?\" said Silver as Thea was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay. No need to cry. Here you go.\" said Silver as Silver opened her mouth wide and Thea crawled in. She didn't make that much of a bulge but Silver could feel her belly stretch a bit. Silver finally had some peace and quiet until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her belly as she loved this new sensation of having a full belly. It clearly stood out of her breasts as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to be asleep.\" Silver smiled stroking her belly. Just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DING DONG!\" the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Who could that be? and a this hour?\" as Silver struggled to get up from the couch. Her belly bouncing a bit as well as her large breasts. She looked at the peep hole to see another mid-thirties couple standing outside. Puzzled she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Silver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Your Silver Potts? We were hoping you can do a favor for us.\" said the male. They had a taxi waiting outside and looks like they were going on a trip as well. She fully opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi! I'm Levy Volt and this is my husband Derrick Volt. We were hoping you could watch our kids for the long weekend as well.The twins names are Kasey and Candy, the boy is Chris.\" said Mrs. Volt a long blonde haired woman with her equally short blond haired husband. Their kids standing out in front. Mostly dirty blonde, twin girls and a boy as the boy looked to be the eldest of the 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you received our message. But you seem to be in some kind of predicament.\" said Mr. Volt looking at her large belly. Silver giggled and waved with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is just an experiment.\" said Silver as she patted it. It sloshed and wiggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its looks like a real belly and feels like one but its filled with water.\" said Silver trying to get her alibi by them. They awed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry. I thought you were pregnant. Your parents said you were well endowed but with that belly, it would be impossible.\" said Mr. Volt as they laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll babysit them. Same time as my aunt, uncle and my parents right?\" Silver said as the Mr. Volt carried their kids clothes to their room. Coming back down..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the kids you are babysitting?\" he asked a bit puzzled. Silver panicking once more and blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... There asleep in my room for the time being.\" Silver said pointing to her room upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Okay. Take good care of the kids. You guys be good to Ms. Potts.\" said Mr. Volt to their kids as they kissed goodbye. And the taxi sped off. Silver sighed in relief as she sat with the the three Volts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Whew that was a close one.</i>\" thought Silver as she wiped some sweat off her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is you belly really filled with water?\" said Chris as he pushed down on it. Silver moaned in pleasure as her belly started to squirm a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You disturbed their sleep. Shhhhh...Its okay.\" said Silver as she caressed her belly. The three could clearly see movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are having babies! I saw movement!\" said Kasey and Candy in sync. Silver was able to calm her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied! You said you weren't pregnant!\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you felt my belly. It was soft and hard but firm like a real one.\" Silver said placing both hands on top of her belly. Her sweater doing a god job covering her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna know a secret? Promise me you won't tell anyone!\" whispered Silver to them. Seeing if she could get them with the other four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its a promise! What is it?\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The four that I'm babysitting aren't sleeping in my room but in me!\" Silver said to them. Caressing her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so not true! Its impossible to eat a person! That what my dad said!\" said Chris. The twins looked at Silver's belly as it really showed movement. It sloshed around as it was audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it!\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to try?\" said Silver as she pointed to her mouth. \"Don't worry you won't be digested.\" she smiled as the twins leapt foward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!! Me!!!\" said the twins in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey! One at a time. I'm sure it is going to get a bit crowded but you'll fit in there. Its nice and warm.\" said Silver as Kasey and Candy did rock-paper- scissors with Candy winning the bet. Candy slowly climbed into the widen, waiting mouth of Silver as Silver swallowed her whole quickly. Her belly stretched some more to occupy a 3 year old. Kasey didn't waste time as she forcibly went into Silver's mouth. Silver struggled with the excitement of Candy but quickly swallowed her as well causing her belly to stretch even more. It now looked to cover 3/4ths of her legs, wider than her hips and legs pressed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Feels good to add more.\" said Silver patting her belly. Letting out a moan as her belly tossed about due to her new occupants. Caressing the best she could she looked at Chris who was stunned at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think, Chris? Believer now? Wanna join the party?\" said Silver as she opened her mouth. Chris quickly dashed in recklessly as Silver flailed to ensure that Chris didn't hit any of her teeth. In a quick gulp, her belly stretched even farther as she grasped whatever she could of her now inhumanly belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels better the more and more I eat them.\" said Silver patting her belly as the commotion of belly settled down. She yawned as she struggled to get up. Grasping her belly as she marched up to her room and lay there. Her prisoners still a slumber in the confines of her belly. Bed creaking from the weight, she seemed to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since they were hyperactive, they ran out of energy quite quickly and soon enough were in their pajamas. It didn't take long for them to be fast asleep as Silver coaxed a plan. She changed into her light blue pajamas as she carried the book with no name in her left hand. As the four slept, she smiled evilly as she began to write something in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I want my body to be able to stretch to accommodate whatever I put inside.

It quivered as she got up ad realized that her belly was bare for all to see. She blushed a bit as she took out her purple sweater and wore it. It covered her belly nicely as she walked downstairs. Her belly bounced as did her large breasts till she finally reached the door. Peeking through the peephole, she saw a couple that seemed to be in their early 40s. The two seemed to be carrying two boys aout 3-5 years old while the one on the male side was about 7, a girl and on the female side a boy who seemed to be the eldest who looked at least 8 or 9 years of age. Silver recognized the couple from across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Mr. and Mrs. Lough. The two that they're carrying are theirs but the other two I don't know. Silver slowly opened the door, hiding her new body behind the door. She ws greeted by the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Silver! Are you busy? Sorry for intruding at such a late hour.\" Mrs. Lough carrying her boy who seemed to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not all! What's up?\" Silver asked politely. The kids seemed sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An emergency came up. The parents of these two got into an accident. So will be going to the capital to check up on them. If you could babysit them they would be a great help.\" Mr. Lough in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love too! I've been babysitting Frank and Thomas since they were babies. Its not a problem.\" Silver said with joy unknown to the couple the plan she had for the four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way who are these two?\" Silver asked pointing to the boy and girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so sorry. This is Tabitha and Reynald. They're my brothers children. My brother and his wife got into an accident.\" Mrs. Lough said in a depressed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope they're okay. So how long do I have to visit them?\" Silver asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Till Monday morning we might be a little longer if its worse which I hope not.\" Mr. Lough said sarcastically. They laughed till he felt a tug from Tabitha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Eddie, I'm really sleepy!\" She said rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"  said Reynald as he yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you two go to my room! Its upstairs to the left. You can't miss it!\" Silver said pointing to her room as the two ran up to it. The Lough's gave her the two they were carrying unaware of what she was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll carry them upstairs.\" She said as she saw they were fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm gonna get their bags.\" Mr. Lough said as he was accompanied by Mrs. Lough to their home. Silver put the two kids with Tabitha and Reynald on her bed as they two were asleep. She smiled at them when she heard some bags being dropped. She made her way to rail and hid her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are their clothes and toys! The money is in the front pocket of Reynalds bag!\" Mrs. Lough said pointing to a dark blue bag. There were four bags. A light blue, Pink, and dark blue backpack along with a duffel bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you guys take care! I'll call you if theres a problem.\" Silver said as they waved goodbye to each other with Mr. Lough closing the door. Silver quickly ran as fast as she could as her belly and breasts bounced about. Gasping for breath as she locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally alone!\" Silver said to herself as she cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the kids.\" Silver said to herself as she took a deep breath and walked back to her room. Once in her room she took the book with no name and did the same process. This time the ball of slime was a lot bigger than before. Taking a deep breath, she put her right handhand to her face, opened her mouth wide and clenched her fist. The slime ball did the same as before and swirled like a snake and went into her open mouth. Silver felt it enter her body and into her belly. She felt it stretch as it continued to fill her. She placed her left hand underneath her belly as she started to bend over due to its increasing weight. By the time it was done, Silver hands were  on the ground as her knees in a crawling position. Her belly pressed across the floor. Her belly was enormous now! Looking like some stuck a a kids sized bean chair to her body. It turned her sweater into a secondary bra as she looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I overdid now...\" Silver said to herself. She slowly put her hand on her bed, feeling her belly sway with her movement. She grunted and groaned as she tried to sit on the bed. After a few attempts, Silver finally did as her belly quivered while sitting on her lap. Her belly had to be at least 3 feet wide and close to 2 feet from her as she placed her hands on it. She felt even more sleepy as fell flat on her bed and slept.</span></div></div>",

She began to ponder the possiblities she could write but was afraid to do so. Then she heard her mom call to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver! Get down here! I got a job for you to do.\" yelled her mom as Silver groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Silver yelled back as she got up and went downstairs. She had just finished taking a shower and was wearing a tight white tank top with volleyball shorts. Her breasts despite what she wrote in the book with no name, they still bounced a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it mom?\" Silver pouted as she saw her mom's twin sister. They giggled and embraced. She made fun of Silver's bust line. Then Silver asked seeing their dressed up for an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you guys going?\" Silver asked. Sheryl (the mother's twin sister) said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High school reunion at your school. Where have you've been hiding?\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is a bookworm. And with a rack like that, she would most likely stay indoors.\" Her mom said as the twins laughed leaving Silver a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have a favor to ask you.\" Said Sheryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Silver asked folding her arms beneath her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have to go along with her. I can't watch her bundles of joy.\" Her mom said as Silver noticed the baby basket which had two babies. Twins as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Simone and Scott, your younger sibling are at sleep overs, we decided to let you take care if them.\" Her mom said as they got their things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad this one's not coming out till later.\" Sheryl said as she patted her large pregnant belly. They gave her some money and left Silver speechless. She looked the doors and went towards the twins wo were sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're asleep.\" Silver sighed as she looked through their stuff which consisted of diapers, baby bottles, etc. Stuff you'd normally find for a baby. She estimated them to be at least a year up. They also had name tags, Jeremy and Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she decided to go up, one of the twins cried. Silver quickly ran to it and hoisted him on top of her breast as the other followed in suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! What to do?!? They won't stop crying.\" Silver said as she remembered the book. She carried them up stairs and put them on her bed as she summoned the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what m gonna do....\" she thought as she began to write in the book with no name...</span></div></div>",

What can I do for to you?\" She asked the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! ! Hello! Are you Silver? Your mother should've texted you about me by now before I got here.\" The woman said in a confused tone. Silver a bit embarrassed that she forgot to check her messages since she was busy toying with the book with no name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my battery died on my cellphone so I'm charging it. What can I help you with ma'am?\" Silver asked politely while hiding her pregnant form behind the door. Her occupants moving about annoying and pleasuring her as she tried to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry. I'm Dita Halls. A friend of your mother's at the book club she attends to. She said it was alright if I left you with my twin baby girls for you to babysit since I have important matters to attend to.\" Dita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That mother of mine...Always making decisions without me.</i> Sure thing! I don't have a problem with that.\" Silver said with a smile. Dita smiled blissfully as she pulled out the baby basket and bag. She placed them inside the door and went back out as Silver hid behind the door. Dita looked at her confusingly but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your mom always said you were a shy one. Anyways here's the payment and I'll be back Sunday to pick them up!\" Dita said as Silver nodded. They waved goodbye to each other as Silver closed the door and leaned on it while she heard a car leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That was close! Luckily I didn't get caught!\" Silver said to herself as she cradledbher belly with both hands. \"Now let's see Dita's twin girls.\" As she waddled towards the baby basket. Leaning over the best she could, she saw the twins sound asleep wrapped in pink blankets with name tags Agnes and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're so adorable!\" Silver squealed as she carried them with the bag, slowly making her way up the stairs to her room. She placed the basket and bag on her bed, next to the book with no name and sat next to them as her bed creaked under her weight. She looked at the twins and at the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They seem to be the same age as Jeremy and Jerry.

Make my body able to stretch to accommodate them.</span>\" Silver wrote. As she put the period at the end of the sentence, the book began to glow as she turned to the twins as they slowly began to disappear leaving an empty baby basket. Soon she felt her belly grow as the first of the twins enters her womb. She moans as she arched her back as her belly moves forward in its growth to fit the baby in her. Then the second followed and soon enough, Silver was now pregnant with quintuplets! Silver sweating as she tried to catch her breath, her face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was amazing!\" Silver said as she caught her breath. She looked down at her even more pregnant form. It fully stood past her breasts as it covered her lap completely. She could hardly reach around as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I'm huge.\" Silver said to herself as she tried to get up. After several attempts, she failed as she sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting it to be this heavy! Well I am pregnant with 4 one year olds and a 9 month unborn. I never expected to weigh a ton.\" Silver said to herself as she rubbed her belly.</span></div></div>",

Luckily it was placed near the book with no name as she checked to see whether it was a call or text. She found a text message from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hey, Silver! Sorry for the this, but our neighbor Grace Joules has an emergency as well. She wants you to babysit her little girl, Harriette. She's about the same age as the rest you were babysitting. Sorry about Dita but I know you can handle it, Mom.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Argh! That mother of mine! Well at least I have more to spend.</i>\" Silver giggled as she placed her phone next to the book with no name. \"I just have to undo this first.\" As Silver undid what she wrote in the book with no name thus causing Jeremy and Jared as well as Agnes and Amy back in their respective baby baskets. Silver decided to leave her Aunt's unborn in her just as the doorbell rang once more. Though her belly was quite seeable through her shirt, she made her way downstairs to meet Ms. Joules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Joules had curly brownish red hair that extended to her shoulders. She was in her mid-thirties. She worked as a real estate agent and was a single mom. She explained her problem as Silver gleefully accepted the job. She took Ms. Joules little girl, Britney as they said their goodbyes stating she would be back on Sunday evening which was the same for the mother's of the two twins and one unborn she was babysitting. Silver slowly walked up the stairs,  to her room where she placed Britney alongside Agnes and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ms. Joules didn't say you were a ten pounder.\" Silver sighed as she looked at Britney who was larger and a bit chubbier than the rest she was babysitting. \"But 1st with you.\" Silver said patting her belly. She reached for the book with no name and opened it to the page where she left off. Twirling her pencil as she bit her lip, she began to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clteal\">Make the unborn child of my aunt that's in me as well as Jeremy, Jared , Amy and Agnes the same size as Britney. </span>\" As the book glowed and she saw the babies grow to the same size as Britney. She placed her hand on her belly as it grew as well making her overdue at 11 months. She rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you won't have a problem now what I'm gonna do next.\" Silver smiled as she began to write once more. She sat on the bed as she wrote.l in the book with no name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">Make my belly stretch with no stretch marks so it accommodate Jeremy, Jared, Agnes, Amy and Britney. Make them unborn as the one inside of me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book glowed once more as she saw the five she was babysitting simultaneously disappear into thin air, leaving empty baby baskets. One by one Silver's belly grew as the babies entered her womb. She placed one hand behind her while one on top of her belly as it continued it's growth.  Her shirt now becoming a secondary bra as she finally looked overdue with sextuplets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octomom! Beat me now!\" Silver laughed as her belly was now wider than her hips and completely overlapping her thighs and seemed to go beyond her knees! She sank more into her bed as she felt them move inside her. Silver felt satisfied as she patted her belly. Before she could try to sleep, she noticed she couldn't move from her spot. She was so heavy she couldn't move with her own power! She still had the book in hand as she opened it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clilac\">Make me a bit lighter so I can move.</span> Silver wrote as she was slowly able to get up. Her 36M breasts dwarfed by her massive belly. She changed into a large white gown that covered her belly completely as she scooted herself to sleep. Peacefully as she felt the life within her move about.</span></div></div>",

Silvia watched as Tiffany and her siblings again become a little bit smaller before they disappeared. She leaned back in order to enjoy the growth.<br>\r\nHer stomach suddenly expanded, shooting out farther then the dress she was wearing could cover, her skin out and on display. Her belly grew and grew until she stopped and looked to be pregnant with 11 babies and overdue. Silvia smiled gently from feeling so big and full with all the children inside her.<br>\r\n\"Hehe! This is amazing. 11 babies and no stretch marks. I swear if I didn't have the book, I may be the pregnant women in history.\" She said while rubbing her belly, feeling everyone adjust to the newest guest.<br>\r\nThat was when the doorbell rang again.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this time it is one of mom's friends with children I can babysit and not someone disrespectful again.\" Silvia said as she went up to open the door.</span></div></div>",

I'll clean myself up later. But what's this favor?\" She asked going along with the story.<br>\r\n\"Well alright.

Now what are these cuties names?\" <br>\r\n\"The two girls are Bella and Maria. The boy is Peter.\" Mrs. Annabel said handing the babies over to her children.<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I'm so sorry!\" Mrs. Annabel apologized. Peter ended up going on to Silver's giant chest and putting his head in it.<br>\r\n\"Hehe! It's alright. He's probably hungry for some breastmilk. These little ones will be perfectly fine. Now get going to the reunion! I hear that a dance party isn't starting up because of my aunt.\" <br>\r\n\"Thank you Silver. Here's the money and have a good weekend.\" Mrs. Annabel said before going to her car and heading to the reunion.<br>\r\nSilver just went over to the couch and picked up the book. Writing in the three kids name, changing them to be the size of everyone else and putting them in her womb to be overdue with 18.<br>\r\n\"This belly is so amazing. So big and taut. I want to keep them forever.\" She said rubbing her belly, feeling the kicks all around.<br>\r\nThat was when she heard a growl come from her stomach and remembered it was lunch time.<br>\r\n\"I guess I should get something to eat.

But after a little while of watching nothing but sitcoms, teen pregnancy shows, and some anime, she began to realize that she was lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you guys are here, but I do wish I had someone, anyone who could rub my belly.

And of course it is ironic given how she is practically the largest pregnant girl that man has ever known and is walking like it is nothing at all. But as she walked Silver did notice a few things about what the book has done for both her and the rest of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst that she was not receiving much attention. Of course some people stared and looked to see the hyper pregnant women, but after words they would just smile and wave at her. With other mothers or mother to be asking her how's everything been going and if their is anything that is troubling her. Even more embarrassing when one women offered to let Silver borrow her son to \"help\" her. So silver came to the only logical conclusion, this book really does warp reality on a massive scale. She could understand minor if it was close friends and family, but everyone sees her as a pregnant women like all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This book... I wonder who could have made it.\" Silver said to herself as she enetered the park since it was walking distance. Today seemed to be empty, not much people around except for families or lovers picnicking in the cool summer weather. That's when Silver thought about having one herself. Taking the book with no name out of her bag she began to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">I wish to have a picnic blanket that is big enough to have my whole belly on it along with a picnic basket that had a never ending supply of sadnwhichs and snacks</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately said things appeared on the ground next to her and allowing her to start eating and relaxing.

She put on stretchable panties with a large purple jogging pants, a sports bra, and matching sweater as she waddled down stars to pick up the girl's clothes and placed them in her basket. She went to the kitchen and ate several leftover sandwiches and drank some milk. Giggling as her prisoners kicked and thrashed about in her. Taking a liter of water with and placing it in the basket she decided to go upstairs to play with her belly.</span></div></div>",

Unaware of the changes going throughout her body. Slowly drifting away into a bliss, as she slept soundly cradling her belly.

Bigger and bigger it grew until her alarm clock rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang...Its a Saturday! As she reached out to shut it off, completely forgetting her situation that she is now carrying for babies.\" Silver slowly sat upright as she felt some what \"heavier: from the night before.

Her eyes went wide with what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts have grown large, by estimate at least a full G cup, pushing at least 36 inches from her body. She placed her hands on her hips and butt as they had increased largely as well. She heaved with all her might as she waddled to the full length mirror and looked at her self. her breasts were still intact in her sports bra, not overflowing nor underflowing. Her belly once had the imprints of the four was now a sphere. Her hips and butt grew largely as well as she had a distinct pear shape form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I look...so motherly!

In fact several.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good Morning! How the 1st day being my babies? You feel so good in me.\" as Silver caressed her belly and began her walk downstairs and into the kitchen. Her parents were away and the neighbors watched over her. Her two siblings were at sleepovers as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the snap of her fingers, the tome landed with a thud on the table. She wrote a few things as now the refridgerator and table were stocked and she ate to her hearts content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now what to do?</i>\" as Silver sat on the table looking at the open tome, sipping on some milk.</span></div></div>",

Lance carried the pot to the kitchen. \"Oh don't mind him! He's a bit grumpy.\" Agnes said as she giggled. Agnes was just as pregnant as she was! She had long strawberry hair that was neck lengthed. Wore a long flowery patterned dress that curved around her large breasts. Silver smiled but drooled inside. Snapping out of her mid trance. She greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Silver Forester. Nice to meet you.\" She said comparing bellies with Mrs. Barnes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard your pregnant from your mom. Can't wait to be a mom too?\" Said Agnes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it is a hassle carrying this load.\" Silver giggled as she rubbed the underside of her swell. Agnes smiled while rubbing her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. But its worth it. A bundle of joy, if it was possible, I wish someone would take this load off even for a day! My back is killing me.!\" Said Agnes as she arched and rubbed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten used to it.\" Silver said as Lance returned the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for the vegtables! I was craving for them when I was chatting with your mom.\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Great to meet you! I have to go since I have homework to do.\" said Silver as the three waved goodbye and Silver went back to her home. She went to thw kitchen where she and her mom talked about their new neighbor, while eating dinner. She excused herself to her room. There she finshed her homework. She stretched her arms and sighed as she felt a kick in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School works so tiring.\" Silver told her companion. The baby kicked again. \"What? You want a partner? I might get to big but she did want to take the load off.\" Silver began to ponder as the book with no name stood by her side. She took the book and went to her window to spy on her neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They seem to be talking but Silver could care less. It didn't take long for their lights to turn off. Silver smiled as she looked at ber belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not!

I want to stack witb Ms. Beddings pregnacy taking all but the arms and face. I don't suffer from morning sickness, cravings but I feed them like any other unborn baby. I don't miscarry or give birth but will grow until I want to return them.\" As Silver finished, the book began to glow. Silver then felt pressure in her belly. She placed her hands on both sides and watched with glee as it began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly surged forward as it continued its growtb slowly covering her thighs. Silver could feel her thigbs and butt gain heft too as they stretched her pants. Sweating and blushing, she watched as her breasts grew in size. From a D-cup to a E cup she moaned as it tighten but thanks to what she wrote prior to that, her clothes grew with her. Her belly shifted as it grew sideward a bit and her hips growing two inches on both sides. At the end, Silver now looked overdue witb twins with wider hips, bigger butt and thighs with DDcup breasts. She panted at the wonderful feeling as she patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt even better than before!\" said Silver as she slowly stood up. Wobbling a bit as she tried to keep balance. She stood in the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I look hot!\" Silver thought as she explores her large butt, hefty thighs and widen hips. Silver then went to her large bust. Feeling heavy but not full, she slowly made her way to her belly. Clasping it below she smiled. Then she felt a kick on her lower right. Caressing it she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh. There there. You're safe and sound with me.\" Then she felt a kick on a sensitive part, she winced and moaned as she rubbed the upper right part of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. That felt good. You two get along now.\" Silver said as she made her way to her bed with the book in tow. She laid down to see her large breasts and belly obscuring her view of her belly. It was still active. Silver yawned and rubbed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired. Good night you two.\" She said as she placed the book at her right side along with her glasses in top and fell asleep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Adding the book with no name that was in her bag which was on her study desk. She got up, trying to keep her balance as she walked towards her bag.

She patted. Silver first put on the the left thigh and heard it click. She could feel the added weight as the left side of her panty stretched making it somewhat of a semi thong. Her hips widen as her left of her butt felt heavier. She did the same with the right side as she was now even weight. Her hips now wider than her shoulders a bit as her butt looked like someone stuffed volleyballs in them. She giggled at the sight as she looked at herself in the full body mirror in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked even more motherly already!\" Silver yelled as she posed in front of the mirror.

Curiosity getting the best of her, she took off her bra as she placed the F-cup breasts in front of her C-cups. She heard the click as she pressed in on her chest. She felt how much more sensitive her breasts now and how heavy they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I'm officially pregnant!\" Silver said as she posed once more. Her breasts swaying as she changed poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda doubt any of my clothes fit now.\" Silver thought as she opened the book with no name.

She wore a brown shorts with a white maternity blouse. Satisfied with her look,  she slowly made her way to fix herself a large dinner since she was eating for two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied once more, she went to the living room, sat on the sofa.

She is well known throughout her city along the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal Sunday for her, after helping out with odd jobs around the city, she decides to go for a swim as her daily afternoon exercise. One of her favorite ways to exercise is to swim and dive in the ocean that is near her house and school. It would be this day that would forever change her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear one side of the beach is a tall cliff that people use as a scenic viewing area. Fate was diving near this cliff when she sees a large overhanging rock fall from the cliff side. It makes a large splash as it hits the water and sinks to the bottom. Once she was sure that it was safe, she dives to where the rock sank, her curiosity getting the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a safe distance, she sees that the rock had done some damage where it hit the bottom of the ocean there. She swims towards the rock when she notices something. The rock's fall had opened up what looks like a small cave. Fate checks the opening and it does seem to lead somewhere and that she should be able to fit through it. She goes up for some air and thinks about whether or not she should try to take it. She takes a long breath and dives to the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing through the tunnel, she finds that it goes straight up. She sees light just a little bit further up and she heads for it. She breaks the surface and gasps for air. After catching her breath, she looks around and finds herself in the middle of a decent sized opening with the pool that she was in on one side and some land on the other. Heading for the land, she gets out of the water and looks around some more. There is light seeping in through some cracks in the walls, but it is still dark so it takes a minute or two for her eyes to adjust. Once they do, she finds herself staring at something that is placed in the center of the land in this enclosed area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weathered wooden chest was just sitting there. Seeing it, she gets a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate: A....chest!?......A chest hidden in a secret cave that was inside a cliff.....Could there be some sort of treasure inside? No....no. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably empty.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneels in front of the chest and opens it to her surprise, the inside was in pristine condition. There was a luxurious big dark red pillow and a very weird looking book was resting on it. The book was solid black with weird etchings and symbols on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate reaches for the book.....SEE FIRST PAGE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is....stunned....to say the least. No way could this be real, she thinks.....and yet....that twinge of doubt was pulling at the back of her mind....what....what if this is real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate: I-it cant be.....A magic book that will grant any wish to only me!? But....this place....it was hidden away and I've never heard of a cave in this cliff.....m-maybe it wouldn't hurt to try it.....</span></div></div>",

Let me go!\" she beats against the giant grip, but to no avail.<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you're gonna keep protesting, I won't turn you back ever. Just calm down, I want to have some fun with you.\" Fate tries her best to smile kindly at small girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes 'Jessie' grow to trust her, or panics some more?</span></div></div>",

He does this at his school and around town with sports, cleaning, and just helping people. Therefore he is well known throughout her city along the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal Sunday for Franz, after helping out with odd jobs around the city, he decides to go for a swim as there was no more work to do this afternoon.<br>\r\nBesides helping others, one of his favorite tasks is to swim and dive in the ocean that is near his house and school.<br>\r\nNear one side of the beach is a tall cliff that people use as a scenic viewing area. Franz was diving near this cliff when he sees a large overhanging rock fall from the cliff side. It makes a large splash as it hits the water and sinks to the bottom. Once he was sure that it was safe, he dives to where the rock sank, his curiosity getting bigger and bigger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a safe distance, he sees that the rock had done some damage where it hit the bottom of the ocean there. He swims towards the rock when he notices something. The rock's fall had opened up what looks like a small cave. Franz checks the opening and it does seem to lead somewhere and that he should be able to fit through it. He goes up for some air and thinks about whether or not he should try to take it. He takes a long breath and dives to the entrance of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing through the tunnel, he finds that it goes straight up. He sees light just a little bit further up and he heads for it. He breaks the surface and gasps for air. After catching a breath, he looks around and finds himself in the middle of a decent sized opening with the pool that he was in on one side and some land on the other. Heading for the land, he gets out of the water and looks around some more. There is light seeping in through some cracks in the walls, but it is still dark so it takes a minute or two for his eyes to adjust. Once they do, he finds himself staring at something that is placed in the center of the land in this enclosed area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weathered wooden chest was just sitting there. Seeing it, he gets a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranz: A....chest!?......A chest hidden in a secret cave that was inside a cliff.....Could there be some sort of treasure inside? No....no. Don't get your hopes up. It is probably empty.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kneels in front of the chest and opens it to his surprise, the inside was in pristine condition. There was a luxurious big dark red pillow and a very weird looking book was resting on it. The book was solid black with weird etchings and symbols on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranz reaches for the book.....SEE FIRST PAGE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is....stunned....to say the least. No way could this be real, he thinks.....and yet....that twinge of doubt was pulling at the back of his mind....what....what if this is real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranz: I-it can\u2019t be.....A magic book that will grant any wish to only me!? But....this place....it was hidden away and I've never heard of a cave in this cliff.....m-maybe it wouldn't hurt to try it.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days ago you noticed the ambulance car, which was later followed by the coroner's vehicle, standing in front of the almost derelict hut where an old, strange fellow lived. Stories about strange things that people had seen, heard or rather imagined were told in the neighborhood by the gossiping females. Men preferred to shake their head but carefully avoided too much contact with the man. He was reported to have once been rich, vital and to have more siblings than normally could be accounted for. What was left of him was carried to the black van in a coffin. Your other business made you forget this episode quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doorbell rang you were the quickest one to answer. One of your neighbors told you that they had been told by the city administration that the household would be removed and driven to the city dump. The neighbors were entitled to wander through the little home and take with them what they though would be useful for them. You did not think that the old man possessed anything that would be valuable or interesting for you. But your sheer curiosity made you call a friend and meet in front of the place a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody answered when you knocked on the door and entered the house. Furniture was boring and there was the smell of old age inside the rooms. Just when you thought you had enough you saw a string hanging from the ceiling. When you pulled it a ladder came down that allowed you to move up to the dusty attic. Upon a number of hopelessly useless and damaged items you saw a sailor's trunk. The lid opened with a creak. Below some very old clothes your hands touched cold metal. A metal case was hidden under the layers of stuff. It was locked, of course. The key was nowhere to be found. Where could it be? Had you come across a treasure?<br>\r\nDid you search for the key, take the case and break the lock somewhere else? Or did something else happen?</span></div></div>",
