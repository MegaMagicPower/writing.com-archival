As you venture into Ponyville you can see things going on, such ass the  local farm of sweet apple acres that was owned by apple jack and her family, and also where apple cider was made by the family as well. If you keep on going right you might just run into the famous carousel boutique, if your lucky you would see a white unicorn using her expertise of crafting beautiful clothing for the residence of Ponyville, her purple hair swishing in the back and forth as she was hard at work with what ever marvelous creations she was making at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The more right you go the more marvels you as you come to a nice quaint little hut where a you will see a yellow colored Pegasus tending to all the little critters that lived around Ponyville, a meek yet lovable Pegasus who always tried to do what was right for her friends and such. As you make your was north and to the west a bit you would come to the sugar corner where all the fillys and gentle-colts went to have a little time to relax and unwind it was also where a happy yet hyper active pink pony worked there her job to make others feel happy and cherish their laughter that they have with their friends, as you go west to the golden oak library you will find a purple unicorn whom is quite studious in  her work for princess Celestia as her friend spike helped her with the work she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Nothing was distracting her from her work. As you make your way to the open fields of Ponyville you might come across a blue Pegasus who was taking a cloud nap as she had a hard time this day making the clouds be utterly perfect for a perfect day so to make sure that they were perfect for all to enjoy it cost her to push herself to the limits so now it was time for her to rest for a hard days work.</span></div></div>",

Princess Celestia was in charge of it all and making sure that her young disciple was doing right by everyone too was such a chore to do that she would like for Twilight to experience the world by herself and not be cooped up in Canterlot\u2019s castle, thinking that if she made friends at the neighboring town that she could grow not only as a person but make true friends along the way. Choosing to live in the hollowed out tree that was converted into a massive library by the citizens of this town, as they believed that knowledge was a great asset to their daily lives, \u201cAnother beautiful day in Ponyville\u201d Twilight exclaimed trotting outside to meet all the townsfolk that had allowed her into their lives with open arms as she as much a part of their lives as they were to her. Walking around Ponyville was one of Twilight\u2019s morning rituals hoping she could find someone she could help with a certain problem they were having at that moment, helping was something that she took great pleasure in as it kept her grounded in the day to day of the people and it felt good to help some one out of a situation that they found themselves in, oblivious to her surroundings in Twilight couldn\u2019t detect that she was, in fact, being watched by someone from a distance, someone who had always despised the purple pony and how perfect she thought she was in helping everyone and righting their wrongs for them and protecting the good people from villains who want to cause them harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making friends was something that was great about moving to Ponyville making good friends that were a great thing that came to her move even if they butted heads, Twilight made it her mission to make friends with anyone she could, friend or foe. There was one blue unicorn that she just couldn\u2019t befriend no matter what she tried the great and powerful Trixie no matter what she tried this girl didn\u2019t think she would ever be friends with Twilight, the revenge that she felt for the pony was just so fierce that she knew that no matter what she had to do she would get her revenge upon the pony who tries so hard to make friends. Stalking her prey knowing that she needed to get twilight alone but where was the question she knew that the less people that were around to see what she was about to do the better, Trixie couldn\u2019t only look upon Twilight from the bushes of which she laid in as there were too many people around to act, thinking that she could use magic to kidnap Twilight with not a lot of people to see instead of waiting for her to be alone. This caused a risk for her it could be better for her to wait for Twilight to be alone before acting in such a rash manner, but this girl just infuriated her so much that she wanted to enact her secret plan as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being a friend and caretaker to all the animals big and small of Everfree Forest was an exhausting position for the cream-colored pegasus, it was definitely a job that was rewarding though for her to say the least. Fluttershy took all her time when not hanging out with her friends to take care of all the animals that came out of the mysterious forest of Everfree her cottage was on the precipice. Being quite a normal day for her, Fluttershy thinking it was a good idea to meet with her other friends inside Ponyville being isolated for so long wasn\u2019t good for the little pegasus. Isolation from the rest of her friends was becoming more and more frequent as the mystical zebra which lived in the forest always needed Fluttershy for something or other and it was draining on her psyche a little bit, to say the least. A breather from all the mystic mumbo jumbo that she had already had a hard time understanding would be great and seeing her best friend Rainbow Dash would be a great change of pace too. Making into town and seeing all the various ponies was always a sight to see for Fluttershy it made her day, seeing her friends doing their jobs as good ponies should making her rounds around the before finally making her way to the house made of clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally made it I hope rainbow has some of those tarts she had from last time, they were so delicious, I just hope I\u2019m not intruding or anything I know that she is quite busy this time of year with the weather control\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door before going in the pony was quite oblivious to the fact that someone or something was watching her from the shadows, a creature of sorts, outside the home of Rainbow, eyes glaring as the eyed up the prey from head to hooves, Fluttershy was their prey. Entering the humble abode of Rainbow dash Fluttershy couldn\u2019t wait to see her darling long time friend, they weren\u2019t as close as they once were and this was a painful realization that they both shared hoping to make up for lost time both decided to try to work on this by having at least a monthly if not weekly get together with each other and just catch up with what is happening in each others live, though being the timid girl she is it was mostly Fluttershy listening to Rainbow Dash gush about the Wonderbolts. Entering the foyer of Rainbows dash hoping to see her friend once more was most exciting to say the least, even seeing tank was and see if he is being properly fed as Rainbow Dash does let her mind wonder sometimes and forgets to feed the turtle sometimes. Not a soul seemed to be around Rainbow Dash nor the turtle companion she kept seemed to be home, though this was the day the usually met up to talk and hang out there wasn\u2019t anyone here. Making her way further into the building didn\u2019t make her feel any better as there still wasn\u2019t around in the kitchen nor the bedrooms it was a ghost town, no hide no hair of her friend was in the area which was quite concerning to Fluttershy thinking the worst had befallen the cyan pegasus Fluttershy didn't know what she could do or what she even should do it was all quite traumatic to say the least, Sitting in the breakfast nook that she and Rainbow Dash usually have brunch together, Flutter begun to collect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to panic, I\u2019m sure its all fine Rainbow doesn\u2019t just disappear like this, she is probably just running late with fixing the weather.\u201d Flutter reassured herself calming her demeanor down to figure out her next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing around the room, trying to figure out some sort of plan and who to talk to, Fluttershy too oblivious for her own good couldn\u2019t put two and two together, what had befallen her friend and what would happen to her next. Rushing out there as fast as she could not even noticing the letter that was on the table next to where she was sitting. Rainbow dash, in fact, was nowhere near Ponyville to become kidnapped in the first place, being summoned by princess Celestia for a special mission of sorts took precedence over their get together. Fluttershy didn\u2019t know what to do but to hide out in her house thinking that this was an attack by an enemy of sorts, not even thinking her friend could be summoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a perfect opportunity for the shadowy figure who made its mission to stalk the fearing pegasus, not fearing anything that what would happen to it if acting on the almost animalistic tendencies that oozed from every movement that it made, not knowing that there was a beast after her other than the one Fluttershy had thought had captured her friend in its blind rage made her vulnerable to other attacks. So focused on her front door that Flutter never thought someone would have much knowledge about her back door though anyone with half a brain cell would know about it, to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026.where am I, why can\u2019t I move,\u201d Flutter thought, struggling to try to figure out what happened to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered if this is what happened to her friend Rainbow Dash thought it wasn\u2019t quite clear, the area where she was kept looked quite familiar to her it was like she was here before in some form or another. Chains wrapped around her body making it quite impossible for her to move on her own, no it wasn\u2019t something she could do not without help. Shuffling of something or someone came closer to her, making Flutter jump a little from what she was doing, not wanting to get caught in her plans of escape the girl thought it would be best to stop just right where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like my little friend is now wide awake well that\u2019s great we can get started with my experiments\u201d from the shadows someone came out, who was this person it was a voice Flutter did know but she didn\u2019t know where it came from or where it was originating from all she knew is that whatever was tying her down needed to go as soon as possible it was quite embarrassing to be held down by something that seemed to be so simple, looking up to who she had kidnapped her and chained her up Flutter shy was a little shocked to see the pony that had done this, manic expression plastered on their face as they looked to be in a Psyche break down of some sort, as the jewel around their neck glowed even brighter. Not knowing why she was here and why the one who had done this to her was\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having so many people who came through the town it sometimes where exhausting for the residence as they thought people would only see their home as a pit stop to make when making long trips, the residence were always nice and aquatic to the people who came but it was always tiresome when trying to accommodating so many people. One of the many stops that everyone went to due to the elegant and stylish was this pure white unicorn had created with her own initiative style and a little bit of magic she created many dazzling outfits for many ponies and her friends as well, this pony was the Pony of generosity and good friend to Princess Twilight, her name being rarity thought she wouldn't have time to tell you her own name as she was much to busy to have any kind of chatter with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going from Place to place inside the Carousel Boutique not even taking the time to breathe, Rarity was so wrapped up in her work to even  notice all the window shopper that had walked through her own little slice of paradise, she had such a big order to fill that it was taking all her concentration to just keep up with everything as this order was for Princess Celestia and Princess Luna to wear, a great honor to have in its self. Everyone knew her shop which is why the two princesses in Canterlot wanted a few new dresses for the two of them, showing off that a big brand named Boutique had made their clothes was one of the perks of being a princess, everyone knew the Carousel Boutique it was a famous place to get the best clothes, from Unicorns to earth ponies, even Dragons knew of the magic that came out of that Boutique. Some people loved how much success had come from the hard work and generosity that came from Rarity\u2019s work, but others weren\u2019t too happy with this as over time there have been people that rarity has made enemies with, Rarity tried her best to make friends with everyone but this wasn\u2019t all ways the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One person who seethed at the fact that Rarity was having so much success with her business ventures was the leader of the sirens Adagio Dazzle, her yellow slender body was the epitome of her pride but knowing that her rival when it came to beauty was doing so well made her almost scream out in rage at this fact, she knew this was something she couldn\u2019t ignore as it was an insult to their battle, she needed to figure out of a way to make that pony so undesirable that no one would want her, being the upfront type of dragon she was going to make damn sure that Rarity knew exactly who was doing this to her. Looking for Ideas of what to do to the young pony so no one would want her she begun to screen her eyes around the hideout for the sirens all the members were there doing their own things not really interacting with each other, which was normal for them, what wasn\u2019t normal was the way one of them looked. Aria Blaze, the purple dragon was looking a little more well fed that she used to be, snacking of precious jewels all the time does horrible things to your figure I guess\u201d Adagiself-proudo her self proud that she this didn\u2019t happen to her for no one would want her if she was as plum as Aria, this is when it clicked is she could fatten up rarity the rest will fall into places, this evil scheme was taking form in Adagio\u2019s mind it was only a matter of time until she would enact this crude plan, \u201chow am I going to make her eat the stuff I bring her its not like she will just sit down and let me feed her, I\u2019m going to have to force her then\u201d the Dragon thought to herself as a big grin came upon her face.</span></div></div>",

Thinking of how to make her mark on the one who wronged her the most, but how to get to Rarity was the question there was no way she could sneak off with rarity during the day every pony would see the dragon coming a mile away, she would think of a way once she has gotten to Ponyville but for now all she could do was stew in her own thoughts. Meanwhile, a certain white pony was getting ready for the day opening her doors for the oncoming hoof traffic that she usually saw every day. Ponies from all over clutching bits in their mouths loved shopping at the carousel boutique seeing all the sorts of designs the snow white pony came up with was such vigor was always splendid to see she had enthusiasm about her craft, to say the least. Tiring work was all rarity knew when it came to running her business but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t love what she did. Night set into the town of Ponyville, ponies of all kinds begun to drift of to slumber, most didn\u2019t even realize that a dragon had come into their town with a dastardly plan on her mind she needed to act fast if she was going to pull this off aria thought, slinking between trees and bushes trying to get closer to the hot spot of fashion, the Carousel Boutique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinking in the dark was Aria the shadows of the night made it a perfect cover for her to move closer and closer to the boutique making sure that there were no ponies that would sneak up on her and ruin her plans of revenge on the element of generosity, Aria needed to sneak into the boutique to enact this plan this wasn\u2019t hard to do for a dragon of her magnitude, but it was best to do without any interruptions. Unlocking the front door was child's play for aria her sharp claws made quick work of the lock, inside of the boutique Aria could do nothing but grin since her plans were going to be realized quite soon. Up the stairs to the bedroom of rarity making sure that no sound emitted from her feet was not the easiest thing to do but she was there in front of rarity\u2019s door creaking it open to show the sleeping white pony that was unaware of what danger she was in, aria sneaking closer and closer to bag in hand aria struck fast and hard, shoving the element of generosity into the bag she had wasn\u2019t the hardest thing but all the struggling was quite tiring, to say the least. \u201cwhoever this is let me go and I won't be mad\u201d Rarity said scared of where she was she knew she was moving but to where and for what reason was foreign to her she didn\u2019t know what to make of the situation she didn\u2019t even know who was carrying her and her constant tumbling through the bag wasn\u2019t making her sense of direction any better. Aria was so proud of her self for making it possible for her to get her revenge, but now she wasn\u2019t going to kill rarity no she had something else in mind but that was for later as for now she needed to get the little pony to where she had planned to enact her plans, a cave in the forbidden forest aria found a while ago was the perfect hiding spot for her and her captor she thought. With a large thud the Aria dropped the bad from her shoulder and but it open using her talons revealing rarity, \u201cyou got some nerve\u201d piqued up the woozy unicorn not even seeing her captor straight let along able to fight her she was much too dizzy to do anything, falling over from the spinning room Rarity couldn\u2019t tell where she was brought all she knew was she wasn\u2019t home.</span></div></div>",

She didn't have much planed for today but she knew something great would happen, she just couldn't imagine what it could be; but before she could try to figure out what this beautiful day holds, it is time that she eats the most important meal of the day, breakfast.  so she rushed down the stairs of the Cake's house that she stayed in to the kitchen where there was tones of well cooked and well covered food just waiting to get eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Pinkie,\" Mrs. Cake greeted her with a warm smile and an even warmer plate of overly large cupcakes of various flavors.  \"I'm glad you decided to eat this morning, for I have a surprise meal just for you.\"  her hips moved ever so slightly allowing her sizable 'plot' to jump from one side to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is awesome!\" Pinkie shouted with enthusiasm as she bounced to the table to she could eat.  She took a deep breath inward to collect the smell of these cupcakes \"oh thank you Mrs. Cake these smell beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, I'm glad you like the smell,\" she picked up the closest cupcake with her magic while preparing more food for the pink excite balloon at the table \"but, how about the taste?\" she questioned as she shoved the cupcake into Pinkie's awaiting maw causing some mess of frosting as Pinkie chowed down on the cupcake.  The taste was amazing, Pinkie was lost in the flavor of the cupcake.  Her eyes lit up with excitement as she quickly begain to dig in to the huge cupcakes.  She soon noticed that each were stuffed full of cookie doe and frosting almost as if it was a cupcake its self.  the cupcakes were thick and tasty just the way Pinkie liked it and just the way Mrs. Cake planed.  She wanted to see Pinkie become a much 'Bigger' pony in the weight department and she knew just the way to do it but she didn't know if she wanted to do it alone or with the help of various members of the town.  while she was lost in her thought more platters of cakes, cookies, and various other fattening sweets were placed on the table for Pinkie to dive in to; and dive into she did.  Plowing through the cupcakes and diving into a huge batch of large oatmeal cookies Pinkie ate like one of those eating competition ponies and it looked amazing to Mrs. Cake, she wanted nothing else but to see Pinkie full of food and eating more.  It was a lot for any pony but Pinkie was a trooper and as far as anypony could tell a bottomless pit of hugs and smiles.  She was 5 big party platters in when she was starting to slowdown, her belly was swollen, tight, and filling rapidly with food and fat.  The suddenly she stopped only  3/4ths through the breakfast she was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs. Cake,\" Pinkie let out a burp and started to rub her already tightly, stuffed belly \"I couldn't eat another bite I'm so full.\"  She was covered in crumbs and frosting and she looked so lovely to Mrs. Cake with that full belly soon to be turned into squishy lovely fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...so lets see what will happen next...</span></div></div>",

The fastest apple bucker was busy smacking trees with her hooves trying to quickly finish the job to go into town like she usually did, the blonde haired earth pony was known as Applejack, being the element of Honesty it was easy than on other people to know when something bothered earth pony. It was written all on her face she was flustered about something \u201cwhat does Rainbow dash know if she didn\u2019t have those wings she wouldn\u2019t be able to beat me like she did\u201d Applejack grumbled to her self hauling the apples she collected into the wagon. Still grumbling while she did her work about how her friend always beat her when it came to anything that they competed against each other it was infuriating, to say the least but the thing that really annoyed her the most was how much Rainbow dash gloated about her wins and how fast she was \u201cyou know she wouldn\u2019t be so fast if she wasn\u2019t so slim to begin with, if she was chubby like Pinkie pie was then she wouldn\u2019t be so fast and won\u2019t be able to gloat like she always does. That\u2019s when it dawn on her \u201cif she was fat she would be able to beat me at anything anymore and I will always be the victor\u201d Applejack snickered in the barn gently putting the apples she collected from the trees in the barrels so they could become cider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Jack\u2019s mind ran wild with ideas on how she was going to make the cyan Pegasus a butter ball it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to say the least as Rainbow dash was quick-witted when it came to people trying to trick her. Over and over it mulled in her brain trying to figure out how she can do this plan with out her other friends figuring out what she was doing it wasn\u2019t going to be easy, \u201cits not like she is just going to let me fatter her up on her own I\u2019m gonna have to tie her up or something.\u201d Something clicked inside Apple Jack\u2019s mind as her mouth curled itself into a grin, dark and foreboding smile plastered onto her face as she had found the solution she was trying to get at she didn\u2019t need Rainbow dash\u2019s compliance when it came to feeder her she just needed her to be still and quiet while Apple Jack helps Rainbow to pack on the pounds. \u201cHow am I gonna get that rascal to come here though that is the question I don\u2019t think cider would do it I guess I could try to use it to get her here but I better come up with a plan B if it doesn\u2019t work\u201d she thought silently nodding to her self that the plan she had created was a great one to capture the Pegasus that gave her so much grief when it came to competitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the day began to wind down apple jack started to put the plan her devious mind had come up with, using her sister\u2019s art supplies to make a personalized card for her dear friend in an attempt to coax Rainbow to come to her orchard to enact what she had planned. \u201cA little glue there and some glitter and it will be ready to mail to her, we are going to have so much fun\u201d Apple Jack chuckled thinking of all the ways she is going to get her revenge on Rainbow dash for gloating so much it was almost euphoric for her as she never would do something this devious before it was like the darkness that was in her heart was seeping out into these actions that she had concocted. Sneaking off so that none of her family member would be curious of where she was going Applejack began to make her way to Rainbow\u2019s cloudy home to drop the beautiful card that she had made to make apple come to the orchard in her mailbox and waited for her plan to work, if it didn\u2019t then she had to think of something more direct.</span></div></div>",

Back at the castle in Canterlot there was a pure white pony with a rainbow mane who were distraught about things that had transpired only a few months before Rainbow dash had given into her own desires multiple times before it was becoming like a revolving door when it came to her, pushing others away from her when it best suited her to her own needs, this was something that the ruler of Canterlot couldn\u2019t have as the six ponies of harmony were always needed for protection of ponyville and Canterlot, it was essential that they had always stayed together to protect evil threats that would cause harm to the land. Celestia was the princess who had to keep the harmony of the day, this was her burden and duty to fulfill and if that meant she needed to cause harm for the good of the rest she was willing to do it if it meant all the other ponies could live in bliss of not knowing what was happening around them. Rainbow dash and her constant abandoning of her friends was a problem that needed to be fixed before it got out of hand and they didn\u2019t have any way to protect themselves from all the dangers that were hiding in the shadows, Celestia couldn\u2019t allow Rainbow to be as selfish as she has been in the past for it would cause too much problems for everyone else in the Ponyville, she knew what she had to do no matter how much it would pain her to show her true devious side of her personality that she has shown no one, not even her own sister knew about the twisted side of Celestia\u2019s personality that was reserved to her own private life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the town of ponyville the cyan pegesus did her duties to make sure the clouds around the town were under control and perfected by her lightning quick flying acrobatics she usually preformed when she did her job of making sure that the clouds looked good enough to eat, Rainbow had always had a thing for making a show of everything that she did, making sure that all she did was at least looked cooler than what was really going on the pizaz that came with her personality was just one of the many traits that made up rainbow dash. After her job was complete Rainbow looked at her work from her favorite hill which overlooked the town in which she had called home for some time now. Basking in the rays that the sun had provided her on this perfect day, nothing could break this perfect day that is what Rainbow dash though as she relaxed in total bliss, a shadow of someone standing over her was the only thing that was ruining this day. Getting up from her relaxed position she had sat the gray pony that was in charge of delivering mail to all the residents of Ponyville hovering above her a golden letter clasped in her mouth with the seal of Princess Celestia on it, it was a letter that was directed straight to her, confused of why the princess would want to see her since it was usually Twilight that Celestia always wanted to see, not one to ignore something as important as a meeting the princess. Speeding towards Canterlot as fast as her wings would let her Rainbow Dash flew to see the Princess, not knowing what she was getting to into. Meanwhile back at the castle Celestia made all the preparations needed for what she was planning for her arrival that would come any minute now knowing Rainbow\u2019s speed she wouldn\u2019t have time to explain herself, looking at all the things that Celestia had collected made her stoic and gentle demeanor grin violently at what she was going to transpire, making sure no one knows her true intentions with the cyan pony.</span></div></div>",

So many questions for why she was being summoned swirled in her head there was no answer that she could have come up with that would satisfy her, the only thing that Rainbow Dash could do was ask the person who was the one who summoned her in the first place. Meanwhile, Rainbow dash started to travel to Canterlot, Princess Celestia was making preparations for her little guest for one thing and the other was to make sure no one could peer into her private obsession, it was something that she kept to her chest close in hand making sure not a soul not even Luna knew of her sister\u2019s secret desires. Making sure no one was around the castle one last time as Celestia didn\u2019t want any prying eyes on what was about to transpire in the hall of this hallowed ground, looking at all the materials that she had gathered with such glee, a manic expression plastered on her face as she wondered if the cyan pony would fight it or just give in all these questions were going to be asked sooner or later for Rainbow didn\u2019t know what was going to befall her. Coming up on the castle late at night as it takes anyone even with super speed at least half a day to get from Ponyville to Canterlot, Rainbow Dash was no different thought shaving off an hour or so on her time did make the pony feel a bit of encouragement with her speed, still dreaming of the day when she can finally become a Wonderbolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that should be everyone in the castle, I can\u2019t wait for sweet Rainbow to arrive oh what fun we will have just her and me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat fuddy-duddy, Luna wouldn\u2019t let me have any fun, but now I finally have a new toy to play with and it shall be beautiful to watch her grow into her role\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maniac was the only thought of words that came to mind when looking at the once princess of the sun, her calm and calculated ways were nowhere in sight the only thing that was left was this creature of desires, having to put on a facade all the time was quite tiring, to say the least, it ate at Celestia. Not having things her way as she had to be the champion of the people and not give in to her own lustful ideas, but that was all behind her finally in a twist of fate she was able to procure one of the Ponies of harmony, no ill will or people peering into what she thought was beautiful, she was going to have so much fun breaking Rainbow dash into becoming her obedient pet. Fed the lie Twilight was none the wiser to her master\u2019s plans for the little pegasus, neither was the other mane six aware this was all planned to give each a heartfelt letter stating that there was a sabbatical that Princess Celestia had promised to Rainbow dash and the Princess of the sun had finally had time to spend on this vacation of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ring of the front door to the Castle was Celestia\u2019s cue to get into character not wanting to play her hand too early, that wouldn't be very good of her she wanted to make game out of it, hoping that little Rainbow Dash wouldn\u2019t mind playing along as well, trotting to the door happy to see her if its the person she had summoned over here. A wide grin upon her face as Celestia looked down to see the pegasus that she had summoned, so happy that the unruly cyan pony actually responded to the notice that she was given this was a turn of events that couldn\u2019t have been better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh rainbow Dash so glad you could have made it I was hoping that we could have a heart to heart, as you might now I\u2019m quite disappointed with the choices that you have made in recent events\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I messed up Princess Celestia, I was so anxious to be apart of the wonder bolts that I left my friends behind to make my dream come true, I should have just made my dreams a reality on my own\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite true my dear pegasus, your right on the snout with that assessment, friends are a big part of any pony\u2019s life throwing them away for your own whims wasn\u2019t a great first step for the pony of loyalty, to say the least, but let's talk about this in somewhere more fitting\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia led Rainbow dash into some of the castles more private chambers, twisting and turning around each corner only made the little pony more lost, not knowing where they were going made rainbow a little bit anxious yet she didn\u2019t know why as she was in the presence of Celestia, Princess of the sun. Finally, they had gotten to a door, large and wooden in constructions, multiple locks made of bronze adorned its handle of setting the golden trim that surrounded it. For what purpose did this room have was a mystery to Rainbow dash it wasn\u2019t something she was expecting to see in the Castle of the sun and moon Princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you, my dear we have much to talk about\u201d Celestia basically shoved Rainbow into the room not wanting to hear the multiple excuses that the pony probably already had for getting out of this. Looking around, the room was quite large, to say the least, it was very roomy a large bed placed in the center and even a nook for reading was in the corner too, all the things a pony would need littering the room there wasn\u2019t anything anyone would need from the outside in this room. A cart was supplied for their chat, multiple kinds of sweets were on it for the two ponies to devour as they talked about things. Rainbow was impressed with the room, it was such a change from what she was used to when it came to Ponyville and its simplicity Rainbow had to take a step back to admire the elegance of it all. The awestruck pegasus was oblivious of her surroundings and what dangers they may present, the once calm and collective Celestia was replaced by her carnal obsessed real self, a wide grin on her face at what she was about to do, horn lit up with the yellow glow of her magic as she readied an attack. Shooting Rainbow unconscious Celestia couldn\u2019t be happier to have a new pet to break into, for this was no longer a pegasus in front of her, no it was her pet piglet.</span></div></div>",

As soon as Celestia entered Luna casts a spell on Celestia. Celestia's stomach began to growl. \"I think I'll have the chefs prepare me a salad\" said Celestia. \"Oh no sister I've got a better idea.\" Luna takes Celestia up too her bedroom. Along with a long row of carts filled with junk food.\"now just lay down dear sister\" Luna said gently. \"But my big speech in front of canderlot is soon\" complained Celestia. \"No mAtter sister\" Luna said as she locked the door. \"Luna?\" Celestia asked nervously, \"what are u doing?\" \"You'll see dear sister, you'll see\"</span></div></div>",

The shackles and chains were magically enhanced, so the only way out was by key. Celestia decided not to fight it, in case her younger sister counteracted. Luna levitated over a large chocolate and strawberry frosted cake and offered it to her sister. The moment Celestia refused, she magically shoved a slice into her sister\u2019s maw without a second thought. Celestia tried to fight back the helpings that followed, but each dessert or snack was shoved down her gullet and fell into her stomach. Cake, ice cream, cookies cupcakes, pies, candy, oat burgers hay fries, pizza, chocolates, donuts, carrot dogs, crackers, apple chips, apple fritters, apple dumplings, apple scones, applesauce, caramel apples, apple strudels, apple brioches, apple fries, apple turnovers, apple cobblers, there were too many things to keep track of as they were forced into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Celestia was fed, the more her body changed. Her belly ballooned out, to a slightly noticeable pudge, to a spherical swell that soon stood her up, and eventually ended as a ground hugging blob. Her face puffed up squishy cheeks that went from tennis ball stuffed to sagging and resting atop bulky shoulders, like medicine balls, and her chin gained two siblings which then merged with her chest and general neck fat which developed sloping folds that gave it an almost accordion look, then thickened so much that they covered her golden necklace. Her legs and thighs plumped up with drooping tissue that were like sleeves upon sleeves, up to the size of tree trunks. Her plot however was the one thing that her sister seemed to enjoy watching the most, as it bloated to rotund proportions, to jutting out like boulders heavy enough to crush the throne and ending up a few feet over her flabby back and covered in cellulite dimples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shoving one last cupcake down her sister\u2019s gullet, Luna stepped back to take a look at her work while releasing the shackles and smiled in smug satisfaction. Her sister wasn\u2019t an immobile blob, but a blob regardless. Her revenge on her \u201cbig\u201d sister was complete. Now Celestia would probably know better than to prank the Princess of the Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until they see you now, sister.\" She thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

Humming a sweet song to the flowers like she did every day she was not expecting anything eventful today it just seemed like the young apprentice of Princess Celestia was the one who had the most fun adventures with all of her friends in toe to whatever that day had in store for them. \u201cI wish my life was more adventurous\u201d Cadance sighed to herself while she looked at herself in the small puddle that had formed in the dirt from her watering the flowers, the castle did get boring from time to time as there was usually nothing to do except the royal duties that were posted to her room by Princess Celestia every morning other than those little brief hiatuses of boredom and when Shining armor gets done with his guard duties there really wasn\u2019t much she could do. Trotting to the banquet hall to have lunch with Shining armor as it was one of the brief moments that she would get to sit down and chat with him until he had to get back to his duties of securing the castle from oncoming threats whatever that threat was, there was a nagging feeling to Cadance that she really couldn\u2019t explain it was almost like she was being watched by someone but she didn\u2019t know who this person or thing was that was watching her. Trying to shrug it off for now as just thinking about it was going to drive her crazy she especially when she didn\u2019t know who was watching her, \u201c I guess I\u2019m going to lunch now all alone with no one coming to meet me there\u201d Cadance exclaimed loudly so whoever was in the area would hear her announce what was going on with her. The guards looked at her like she was a crazy person or something as they all knew that their boss Shining armor was going to meet her at lunch so what did she state that she was going to be alone then they wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The figure who was closely watching the princess saw this as their opportunity to place their devious plan into action, not wanting to rush anything that might happen beforehand they decided to wait to make sure that the princess was correct in her assumption that she was going to be alone for lunch, they had many plans for the young princess and one mistake could be their downfall. Cadance had waited for her boyfriend to come to greet her so she could talk to him about what a strange sensation that she is having all day like there were eyes that were just looking at her and her only, she didn\u2019t find herself feeling very safe with this feeling all around her it was like she was a target to whoever was looking at her. Waiting for shining armor was a toll-taking a much time as she needed until he came, being almost a half hour later since she had reached the banquet hall, already she had eaten half of her sandwich and still no one has come to her aid in this strange feeling she was having, the eyes she felt upon her only grew with intensity with each passing minute feeling as if she was about to be attacked at any moment now. Cadance didn\u2019t realize how right she was the shadowy figure that has been stalking her all this time was about ready to claim her prize thinking enough time had passed for it to not make a move and no one came. Blowing some kind of dust all over the banquet hall it was of a periwinkle color making all it touched sleepy in a matter of seconds, not long after the once alert princess begun to doze off in the middle of lunch she couldn\u2019t understand why she was sleepy it was quite strange for her to be this tired so early in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waking up from a slumber to which Cadance couldn\u2019t even remember going to sleep in, she didn\u2019t even recognize where she was this place looked to be quite comfortable when it came down to it, large and spacious in design it looked to be some one\u2019s house of sorts, with an elegant look to it she began to wonder how she got here in the first place it wasn\u2019t like her to not remember how she even got here. Fearing for the reason why she was here in the first place Cadance begun to try to get up from where she laid, only to find that she has been  chained to the wall in a manner that made it seem like she wasn\u2019t a guest but a captor of someone\u2019s but who was the person who did this to her and who actually had the gall to pull this off. Knowing that her magic could make quick work of this chain Cadance begun to try to use magic from her horn, not noticing that someone has entered to greet their new guest. Too focused on trying to make magic work on this chain with no avail, not a single magical thing happened when trying to use her horn in its intended use, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t it working it should work\u201d Cadance asked her self in desperation for her situation. The person crept closer and closer to the frantic pony tapping her shoulder as a way to get her attention, there was nothing that she could do to dissolve the predicament she was in. Exhausted Cadance gave up and hoped that someone would come and save her from this place, the same tap that she felt before on her shoulder was back turning around Cadance saw...</span></div></div>",
