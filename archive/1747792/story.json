She relaxed and began to gaze into the trees when she suddenly saw movement. Every muscle in her body tensed when she saw the movement, her heart quickened. <i>It's only the shadow of a tree or an animal</i>, she told herself. She saw the movement again and she whimpered slightly, moving away from where the shadows was. And away from her clothes.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nRealising this she licked her lips nervously before calling out, \"Is somebody there? If you are, please come out. It isn't right to watch people from the shadows you know\". Nothing happened and Sarrena began to feel sick, wondering whether or not that was a sign that someone <b>was</b> watching her. </span></div></div>",

The moonlight reflecting off her pale upturned breast caused him to inhale sharply. That could of been disastrous, he thought. How careless of me. Mr. Odell had been a counselor at the summer camp for years. He enjoyed working with the young girls, but he enjoyed watching them more. His nightly strolls almost always guaranteed him a glimpse of one of the girls undressing, or just lying around in panties and t=shirt. On a couple of occasions he was lucky enough to witness two curious young ladies enjoying each other's smooth warm bodies. No one had ever suspected his dark secret and his spying had grown bolder over the years. Tonight Odell was in his usual concealed location. One that gave him an unobstructed view into Sarrena's cabin. When Sarrena left the cabin and headed towards him he was panic stricken, but he knew if he moved now she would see him for sure. As she got closer, his fear subsided, she's not even looking my way, he sighed. When she stopped just yards from him and disrobed, he couldn't believe his luck. His leering gaze followed Sarrena's fresh naked body all the way to the moonlit water, Taking in her every step, shift, and jiggle. His plan was to creep over to the pile of clothes,find her panties, and enjoy the scent of this beautiful young creature. Unfortunately, that plan came to a crashing halt. How did she hear me, he wondered? Now what? His mind was racing with his options. He knew either way he retreated she would see him, and he would be questioned about things that would make him very uncomfortable. That was not an option. One questionable inquiry and he could be ruined for life. In the blink of an  eye, he decided; this unfortunate girl is a liability I can't afford. As he moved towards the lake's edge Odell, with all the calm he could muster, called out, \" Hey, who's out there?\" <br>\r\nA shaky voice replied, \"It's Sarrena,who's there?\"  <br>\r\n\"It's just me, Sarrena, Mr. Odell. What are you doing out here this time of night?\" <br>\r\nA brief pause and then, \"Oh, thank goodness,it's you Mr. Odell, I was kinda worried for a second. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd have a swim.\"  <br>\r\n\" Well I'm sorry dear, but no swimming without supervision, so come on out and I'll walk you to your cabin.\"  <br>\r\n\"I can't, Mr. Odell.\"  <br>\r\nOdell knew why, but he wanted to hear her say it. \"And why is that young lady?\"  <br>\r\n\" Um, well, I kinda don't have any clothes on. They are on the bank behind you.\"  <br>\r\n\"Well, I'll walk over here and turn my back, and you come on out and get dressed.\"  Something in Odell's voice made Sarrena uneasy, but she managed a feeble \"Ok.\" Why did she sound like that, he wondered. Does she suspect something? Damnit why did she have to hear me.  From behind he heard the soft ripples of someone moving through the water and could only imagine the splendor of her smooth,pale body as she emerged from the lake and headed for her clothes.     </span></div></div>",

She dreamed she would encounter a prince or just a handsome commoner who would admire her for not just her beauty (Sarrena liked to pretend she was very attractive physically, but she knew she was just average with no outstanding feature, but she wasn't unattractive either) but also would sense her inner beauty (and that Sarrena did have - a very kind heart and strong will for what is right which would ignite tremendous courage although her demeanor was typically very shy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, she was just a girl away from home, in a distant place, with a bunch of strangers, feeling very lonely. Yet she waited for the soothing voice of that special someone to glide over the water's mirror surface and tickle her ears with an introduction to the perfect romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be swimming here at night.\" a young man's nasal warning jolted her from her thoughts causing her to splash and submerge her body to her neck and turn towards the shore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Picking the pace, Sarrena managed to reach Allana, She was holding out a towel to Sarrena\u2019s relief. Allana was looking away from Sarrena, a very considerate idea seeing that she has a bikini on. Or at least it looks like it. Sarrena felt somewhat ashamed as she covered herself in the towel. Especially when she heard a number of male voices were she had been. \u201cGuys, look! Chick clothes!\u201d Sarrena bristled at that as one of them bent to pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey drop those now!\u201d cried out Allana. The boys were clearly surprised to hear a girl\u2019s voice &amp; took off at full speed. \u201cThanks.\u201d whispered Sarrena. Allana blushed in reply. \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d \u201cSo..:.uh...did you also come for a swim?\u201d Sarrena hated the awkwardness of being nude under Allana\u2019s towel as she tried to make small talk. It was so weird and off putting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was a little nervous in my bikini. But I am glad I did now. Because I could help you, not because I was staring at you, which I wasn\u2019t! I mean I wouldn\u2019t! It was because you almost got seen, though you probably would have spotted them! I mean no-one really..um...\u201d Sarrena pulled Allana in for a hug. \u201cThanks again!\u201d Sarrena felt a little heat as she embraced her saviour. She couldn\u2019t be attracted to Allana...could she? \"So uhhh...do you want to go for a swim, Allana? I will stay here and protect your clothes!\" \"But you're um....naked under the towel? D-Don't you umm...uh... welll.....\" \"You helped me, I am happy to help you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllana beamed at her, before she dived in. Sarrena watched her swim, pleased that the moon light showed off her very revealing bikini bottoms. Ok, that settled it; she was crushing on Allana. \"Allana, can I join you?\" \"Sure, the water is great! But are you sure...\" Sarrena dived in, swimming up to Allana. Allana blushed a little under the moonlight. Sarrena paused before deciding.....</span></div></div>",

He had seen her coming towards the water and watched as she had removed her pajamas and slipped into the icy lake.  With her misty breath gathered around her, it made her seem ethereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something stirring inside as she called out into the darkness for him to reveal himself.  He knew he should just walk away and give her, her privacy, but his eyes were glued upon her.  The feeling of being wicked also lent an even greater rush to his manhood.  He was tempted to take care of his throbbing problem right here while he was playing Peeping Tom, but his sense of right and wrong kicked in just a little bit too hard for that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should leave,</i> he kept telling himself but he just couldn't make his legs move.  Maybe he should just say something and apologize for his lechery, but he was afraid of making her dislike him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not a knock out beauty, but there was something about her that made his heart soar.  Maybe it was her boldness tinged with timidness.  He had seen her in camp before today and had overlooked her for a shy Plain Jane, not worthy of a second thought.  Now that he knew his first impression was the wrong one, he wanted to get to know her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dilemma was quite forbearing.  </span></div></div>",

She was at summer camp but she was lonely because she didn't know anyone there and wasn't good at making friends. It was close to midnight but she wasn't sleepy. If anything she was bored stupid and so she decided to go swimming in the lake. <br>\r\n  She crept out of the cabin, making her way down to the lake and found a secluded spot overshadowed by the forest. <br>\r\nShe stripped off her pyjamas and hid them among the trees just in case someone came, which was unlikely this late at night. <br>\r\nShe slipped into the icy rippling water. Her white blonde hair fanning out behind her, strands of it clinging to her bare skin. She shivered, her breath coming out as a white mist. <br>\r\n  Her ice blue eyes scanned the shadows for hidden watchers. She was sure she was just being paranoid, that there was no one there to watch her. She was always wary when she went skinny dipping, as she was a shy girl by nature. <br>\r\nBesides, her nervousness was not misplaced as someone was creeping unnoticed along the shore, someone who didn't know she was there.</td>",
