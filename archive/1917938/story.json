You thought it would difficult, moving house, a new school, leaving your old friends behind. You thought it would take you a while to adjust to everything and make new friends at Domino High, but it didn't. Not when you mentioned offhandedly that you played Duel Monsters. One lunchtime, you inadvertently let it slip that you had recently picked up the game to a group of kids, when all of a sudden, THE Yugi Muto, who had defeated Pegasus at Duelist Kingdom, invited you to come hang out at his house after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way that you could turn down an invitation from the King of Games, and so Yugi and you met up with his other friends after school at his house. Joey Wheeler, Tristan Taylor and\u2026 T\u00e9a Gardner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't told anyone this, but as your eyes met T\u00e9a\u2019s for the first time, it was love at first sight. She was like nothing you had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026 I\u2019m (name) \u2026\u201d you smiled, extending out your hand for her to shake. She moved her smooth, slender hand into yours as you cupped it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT\u00e9a Gardner\u2026 nice to meet you, (name) \u2026\u201d she shook your hand as she failed to notice your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your initial meeting with T\u00e9a, your friendship with her strengthened significantly, until one day, everything changed. It was the late morning of the last Saturday before Spring Break. You and T\u00e9a were at a coffee shop enjoying their special home-baked muffins. At some point, T\u00e9a said something about having to go shoe shopping. One on one time with T\u00e9a? She had your attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get some new shoes today. Can you come with me and help pick some out?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure T\u00e9a! I'd be glad to come.\u201d you said, not even thinking twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d T\u00e9a asked. You nodded. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s near impossible for me to go shopping with Yugi or Joey without them running off to buy cards for their decks. I promise it won\u2019t take long. I just need you to tell me what you think, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went to the Domino City Mall where she modeled several pairs of shoes and sandals for you. She came out barefoot once and you \u2018jokingly\u2019 told her \"Those are perfect!\u201d. She giggled because she thought you were just being silly. But actually, you were honest about that. She looked best barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped her select a few pairs of shoes and then left. She took you to her house to model them some more. You were perfectly content sitting on the floor of her makeshift dance studio as she twirled around. You remembered that she had told you once of her dream to travel to the United States and study dancing at one of the country\u2019s top universities. You remembered you told her that such a strong-willed beautiful girl like her could do anything she set her mind to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you looked her over. After a while, she noticed that you had been staring at her with a soft smile on your face. \u201cIs something wrong, (name)?\u201d T\u00e9a asked, bringing you back to reality. \u201cYou're staring at my feet kinda weird.\u201d she said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just blushed, unable to say anything. T\u00e9a walked over to you, sitting down on the floor beside you as your blush deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(name)\u2026\u201d T\u00e9a began, her look slowly turning to one of concern. \u201cWhatever\u2019s happening with you, you can tell me. We've been close friends for a some time now. So what's going on?\u201d Her tone was serious and yet\u2026 seemed sweeter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. For a brief moment, you seriously considered telling T\u00e9a how you felt about her. You had been dropping hints for a while, but she had never picked up on any of them. Either she wasn\u2019t interested in you, or she just wasn't good at noticing male body language. Even so, the fact that you\u2019d had feelings for her for so long was eating you up inside. Now was the perfect moment. You just had to lay it all on the line. You had to take the leap. You had to tell her how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT\u00e9a\u2026 the thing is\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a couple of months since you had met the duelist known as Mai Valentine. You met her at the supermarket and became instantly smitten by her. Others would call it a crush, but to you, it was something more than that. She was 27 and you were only 17, which meant having any sort of relationship with her would be frowned upon by wider society. Besides, she didn't really know you that well to begin with anyway. You however, recognized her from her appearance at Battle City, where you were able to witness all of her duels except for the finals match, which you heard she lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou encountered her at the supermarket buying groceries for herself when she was harassed by an older man. You came to her aid, although you didn't need to, and you quickly became good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you and Mai had a Tag Duel against some siblings that lived down the street from you. The duel was an easy win, you and Mai were in perfect sync. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, I activate Monster Reborn to revive Mai's Harpie's Pet Dragon!\u201d you shouted as the giant red dragon appeared behind you, smoke blowing out of its nostrils. \u201cAttack!\u201d you yelled, thrusting your arm forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's monster ripped through the kid's Winged Cleaver and won the game for the both of you. \u201cAwww... no way!\u201d the boy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, hon!\u201d Mai grinned. \u201cYou two will need to practice more before you ever have the chance of beating us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll get better, promise! C'mon sis!\u201d the boy cheered, pulling on his sister's arm until they were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was easy. How about we duel each other?\u201d Mai asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're on! But let's make a wager here.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of wager?\u201d she asked, her interest peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe loser of the duel will have to do one thing that the winner wants, no matter what the request. You in?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai smiled. <i>\u201cHe's still young. I doubt he'll ask me to do anything too bad if I lose.\u201d</i> she thought. \u201cOf course!\u201d she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos Emperor Dragon, attack Harpie Lady Sisters!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour monster charged its attack in its mouth before letting it loose on Mai's monsters. This was probably one of the toughest duels you had ever fought in your entire life. Mai was a seasoned veteran who competed in many illustrious Duel Monsters tournaments. You on the other hand had never entered an official tournament in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet somehow, throughout the duel you were able to keep equal pace with Mai, and overcoming her for an instant, you won the duel. It was no wonder that Mai became interested in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, hon. That was a close game, that's for sure. So, what's it gonna be? What do you want?\" Mai asked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been so caught up in the duel that you had completely forgotten about your bet with Mai. Now though, you had the opportunity to ask Mai to do one thing, and one thing only. There were so many things you wanted from Mai, but three things stuck out in your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitance, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

The only problems were that you had never kissed a girl nor been kissed by one, and what would Mai say or do if you were to ask such a thing. Gathering up all of your courage, you exhaled deeply before forming the words in your head and then saying them aloud to your crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to kiss you.\" you said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's eyes widened in shock. Not a good sign! Now you reckoned that she thought you were just a sleazeball or a pervert trying to come onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You want to... kiss me? Don't you think that's going over the lines of friendship?\u201d Mai asked, regaining her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to tell that she was confused, and although she tried to sound mad, it was clear to you she was amused by what you had asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes. That's right, Mai. I want to kiss you because I-I... have a bit of a crush on you.\u201d you nervously admitted. Although you were kind of worried about what she now thought of you, you were also glad to let it all out. If Mai rejected you, so be it. At least you were able to be straight with her about how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai sighed and then approached you. It wasn't that you were short, but you weren't exactly the tallest guy around. When Mai had finished walking up to you, you realized that you were eye-level to above her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shakily breathed in as she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook hon, I know that we've been friends a while now. But it seems like just when I think I have you figured out, you do something like this to blow my mind.\u201d Mai lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine...\u201d you muttered. \u201cI'm sorry I asked you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on just one freakin' minute!\u201d Mai shouted, surprising you. \u201cI never said you can't kiss me. I'm just saying that you surprised me there, okay. Even if I didn't WANT to do this, I still would because my word is as good as gold.\u201d Mai stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird. Mai seemed to be messing with you now. She was talking like it was no big deal, yet her words sounded as if she was annoyed that you even asked this. And her cheeks twitched slightly every few seconds as if there was a chance she wanted you to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? What are you waiting for? Are you gonna kiss me or what?\u201d Mai asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom watching her duels, you knew that it was rare to see her smile at anyone like how she was smiling at you now, so you nervously puckered up, leaned in, and gave Mai a soft, gentle kiss on the cheek. You felt a tingle inside as your lips made contact with her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in the alluring scent of the expensive perfume that Mai had sprayed herself with at some point in the day or another. You soon pulled away, you heart beating the hardest it ever had before. If you were to die right now, you'd die a happy young man. Even if Mai didn't see you as anything more than a friend, the fact that you got to kiss her meant the world to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so lost in your own head, that you failed to notice that Mai had a seductive smile on her face, and her violet-colored eyes were staring deep into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call that a kiss?\u201d Mai asked. You could tell by the tone she used that she was joking with her statement, but because of that, you didn't know why she even asked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry?\u201d you asked, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to do things right if you do them at all. THIS is what a REAL kiss is like.\u201d Mai slyly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say or do anything, Mai put her arms around your neck and pressed her lips tightly, yet gently against your own. You almost fell over from shock as Mai's kiss overtook all of your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai steadily held onto you as she looked deep into your eyes. As she had done so, that tingle you got earlier turned into an all-out blast of pleasure. You couldn't help but blush as Mai's eyes twinkled in the light of the setting sun.</span></div></div>",

You weren't exactly sure what to do, so you just let Mai's tongue play with yours as you tried your hardest to hold back your moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your cock stiffen and grow as Mai took her arms off of your shoulders and cupped your face in her hands. She then let some of her saliva fall into your mouth, her hands gently massaging your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never dreamt of doing anything like this with any girl, but here you were - in the heat of the moment - and by God, were you enjoying it! Mai carefully spat just a little of her saliva into your mouth and then sucked it back out, along with some of your own, and then repeated for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange... Somehow you were enjoying it, despite how gross and disgusting it seemed. Mai sure was no amateur at this, she was spit swapping without even breaking her lips away from yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Mai finally broke away from you. In the heat of the moment, you had forgotten that you could've breathed through your nose if you wanted to while Mai was kissing you. So now you were panting wildly, trying to quickly regain all the air that you had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai giggled at your display, having been oblivious until now that it was your first kiss. Mai then took a while handkerchief out of her purple jacket's front breast pocket and wiped away some of the excess saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I don't know about you, hon, but I'm getting a little bit hot here. Why don't we take this to my apartment?\u201d Mai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been to Mai's apartment before. Sure, you had been invited, but because of reasons outside of your control, you were never able to accept her invitation. Now however, you were able to go, and you would've been an idiot to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay...\u201d you panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on then. It's this way.\u201d Mai motioned, taking your hand in hers as you walked to her apartment, which to your surprise was located in the Donorium Complex, an area which was widely considered to be one of the most expensive in the city. Mai then brought you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...\u201d you gasped in awe at the interior of Mai's apartment. It was really big and well decorated, mostly with Harpy Lady accessories and such, but still pretty cool. You assumed that she was able to afford all of the expensive stuff she had by using the prize money from the various tournaments she entered. \u201cHow much did this all cost?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai shrugged. \u201cA lot, but money's not really an issue for me at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I'll give you a quick tour.\u201d Mai said, once again taking your hand and leading you around the apartment. To you, it was more like a mansion than an apartment. She led you to the kitchen, the entertainment room, the dining room, the bathroom, and then finally, her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer king-sized bed was propped up against the wall of the room, which was decorated with Harpie Lady wallpaper. Before you knew what was happening, Mai brought you over to the bed and pulled you on top of her, your head gently resting on her exquisite bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo hon, you ready for more?\u201d Mai asked, looking down at you and giving you a quick wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twitched from excitement, but managed to say \u201cGimme those big lips!\u201d before she pulled you up to meet her face as she went back to making out with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, there was no spit-kissing. Instead, Mai gently slid her tongue into your mouth and swirled it around. She wrapped her hands around you in a sensual hug as you blushed once more. You were also more adventurous this time too, taking the opportunity to cup Mai's face in your hands as her warm, soothing breath, and red, glossy lips eased your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was really getting hot, as you had a raging hard-on from the kissing. It was getting to the point where you erection was so big that it pushed itself against the top of your underpants incredibly tightly, and it hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you reached a hand to cup Mai's large breasts, making her moan deep into your throat. You then started to squeeze and fondle them, and were surprised Mai didn't protest at all. As you slid a hand past her jacket and under her top to cup her bra, you felt her right hand start to stroke your tented pants! You were nervous, but having the time of your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what happened next: Mai slowly used her hand to encircle the bulge in your pants, gently caressing it. You then experienced a feeling that you had never felt before. You let forth an intense scream of pleasure as your eyes rolled to the back of your head. Your cock began to twitch as it unloaded its contents into your undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, you collapsed to Mai's side, panting heavily. \u201cI see you enjoyed yourself there.\u201d Mai smiled, pointing to the dark stain in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what... what is... why do I...?\u201d you panted. This was the first time that you had ever ejaculated, and as such, it was a feeling you had never experienced before. Your body was desperately trying to cope with all of these new experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll explain for ya, hon.\u201d Mai began. \u201cThat feeling you just experienced is what happens when your body needs to release itself. Your dick gave off quite a lot of cum there. I'm assuming this is your first time?\u201d Mai asked, tilting her head to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah...\u201d you mumbled. \u201cI've never done anything like this before...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's okay. You seemed to know what you were doing for a first-timer.\u201d Mai said, leaning in and giving you a prolonged kiss. She then looked over to her bedside clock. It had gotten very late very quickly. \u201cIt's pretty late now, hon. You wanna stay the night?\u201d Mai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. In the span of a day, you had received your first kiss from your major crush, you took part in foreplay, and now were being asked to stay over. Awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if it won't inconvenience you.\u201d you said politely. \u201cI don't want to be a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're nothing but, believe me.\u201d Mai assured you, briefly getting up and taking off her jacket, heels, stockings, and earrings. \u201cI was actually going to ask you... this 'crush' you have on me, how long have you had it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... honestly? Ever since I first saw you duel on the SS Fantelle...\u201d you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai thought back to her days on the SS Fantelle. She was hired as a waitress to serve drinks to the personnel, but became introduced to the Duel Monsters phenomenon. It was there that she met Jean Claude-Magnum, who proposed to her. \"I had no idea you were on the ship...\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was much younger back then.\u201d you said. \u201cMy mother was good at Gin and Rummy, so she was invited on board to participate in a tournament. She couldn't find a sitter, and this was during a time where my dad was still working, so I had to come on board as well. I saw you defeat what's-his-face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Jean Claude-Magnum?\u201d Mai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that guy. To tell you the truth, you were the one who really got me interested in playing Duel Monsters.\u201d you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you went silent for a while as you stared into each other's eyes. You didn't exactly know how to continue the conversation, but Mai obviously had something that she wanted to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(name)...\u201d she began. You looked at her immediately, noticing that she called you by your first name, something that she rarely did. \u201cI was wondering...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I-It's nothing...\u201d Mai stammered. \u201cWe should get some sleep...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay...\u201d you murmured, sure that Mai had something on her mind. But then again, so did you. \u201cUm... where do I sleep?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai let out a weak smile. \u201cRight here, hon.\u201d Mai kissed you once again, before pulling the covers over the both of you. You were nice and snug in Mai's warm bed, and after such an eventful day, you were dead tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, (name).\u201d you heard Mai say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG'nite, Mai.\u201d you chirped as you drifted off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

You were talking in your sleep, and you look like you've been crying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of course! Everything's fine!\u201d she insisted, before exhaling deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell that you're not fine, Mai. No one cries in their sleep from a regular dream. You were having a nightmare, and you sounded really terrified. If anything's on your mind, Mai, you can tell me. If it's a secret, I'll take it to my grave, and if I can help in any way, I'll try my utmost to do so.\u201d you said, meaning every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai just stared at you silently, the pale moonlight breaking through the curtains. She then leaned in and gently kissed you on the lips before pulling away once more. You could taste the tears on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not like anyone else I've ever met, (name). You're so wise for your age. It's one of the reasons why I feel like I can really open up to you, like you did to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMai...\u201d you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've been having these reoccurring nightmares for a while now.\u201d Mai began. \u201cAt Battle City, I lost my finals match to Marik Ishtar, a man who was at the time in possession of The Winged Dragon of Ra, one the most powerful cards in all of Duel Monsters. When I dueled him, it wasn't like when I dueled you. He was one of the most psychotic people I have ever met in my life. He managed to somehow trap me within my own mind and fill me with so much self-doubt that I thought I would die. I keep dreaming that he's here, (name). That he's here and he traps me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up in Mai's eyes once more. It was obvious that this was a very emotional topic for her to talk about. For the first time, you saw a side of Mai that you had never seen before. A side of vulnerability. You quickly hugged her. \u201cI'm sorry, really. I'm not sure how I can help you.\u201d you said, honestly. \u201cBut if there is anything you need of me, just ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing...\u201d Mai muttered, sniffing over and over again due to her crying. Mai then leaned close to you. \u201cStay by my side... please...\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d you said without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai smiled and grabbed a tissue from her bedside table, wiping away the tears. \u201cThank you, (name). You don't know how much it means to me to have someone like you by my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed profusely. \u201cI'm flattered that you trust me so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai then gently caressed your cheek. \u201cI'm sorry for waking you. We should try getting back to sleep...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, shifting yourself around in the bed. The morning would mark the turning of a new leaf. No matter what, you would help Mai overcome the darkness that had gripped her soul.</span></div></div>",

You scrunched your face as your consciousness stirred and you slowly opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped the sleep out of your eyes and noticed that you were alone in Mai's bed. The sunlight created a glare on Mai's bedroom clock, so you were unable to read the time, but you could tell that it was late morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and pulled back the sheets to neaten your side of the bed, before letting out a yawn and giving yourself a quick stretch. It was then that you noticed a piece of paper on Mai's bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over and picking it up, you read it to yourself. \"Gone out to get us some breakfast. Be back in a bit. Feel free to make yourself at home. xoxo\" the paper was then signed with a red lipstick print in the shape of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. The paper smelt like her. Putting the paper down, you went into Mai's bathroom and gave yourself a quick shower to freshen up. When you finished, you used one of her towels to dry your body, and proceeded to put your clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of breakfast filled your nose as Mai entered the room. \"Mornin' hon.\" she said, holding a paper bag with the Golden Arches on it in her left hand and a flyer in her right. \"I hope you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mai.\" you greeted happily. You looked at bag. It seemed like it had so much food in it that it would burst at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai saw you looking at the bag and smiled. \"C'mon. Let's go eat in the dining room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, following Mai out to the dining room table. The table was elegantly set with a glass vase filled with water and roses sitting in the center. As Mai was organizing the food on the counter, you took the liberty of moving both chairs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mai turned around, she smiled as she noticed what you had done. \"You're a real gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for buying me breakfast.\" you blushed. \"I'll pay you back my share as soon as I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off as Mai put the plates down on the table and then gently placed a finger to your lips. \"There's no need for you to pay me back, Anon. I want to buy you food and I enjoy your company. Please sit.\" Mai insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on your chair and looked at the spread in front of you. On your plate was both a Sausage and Egg McMuffin, a Bacon and Egg McMuffin, three hash browns, and a stack of pancakes. To the left of your plate was a huge plastic cup filled with orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at Mai, who was now seated opposite you and daintily eating the food off of her plate. She looked back at you and saw that you hadn't touched your food. \"I didn't know what you wanted, so I just got you a bit of everything. Sorry if it's not what you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! It's not that!\" you assured her. \"The food looks great! I'm just unsure where to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well if you're worried about how you eat in front of me, don't worry. Joey is one of the heaviest eaters I've seen in my whole life!\" Mai giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'kay then...\" you muttered, taking a bite out of your Sausage and Egg McMuffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you didn't say a word during your meal. It took some effort, but you managed to successfully eat everything on your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for the meal, Mai. It was lovely.\" you said, unintentionally let out a little burp at the end, causing you to cover your mouth and Mai to giggle in response. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, hon.\" Mai smiled, taking a sip of her orange juice, still not having finished her meal. You happily stayed seated as you waited for Mai to finish. Once she had, you gathered up all the rubbish and threw it into the trash, Mai cleaning the plates in the sink. \"I'll be with you in a moment,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, your eyes wandering over to a flyer on the kitchen counter. The bright colors and images caught your eye. Mai finished cleaning the dishes as you went over to read the flyer. \"What's this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai turned to you, suddenly looking really nervous. \"It's a flyer for a Tag Team Tournament. I was wondering if you wanted to enter with me. I mean, I know you said you've never entered a Tournament before, but with how you Dueled yesterday, and with how you've been Dueling, I think if we teamed up, we could win.\" Finally, Mai's expression softened, and she walked over to you, cupping your hands in hers. \"What do you say, hon?\"</span></div></div>",

Me too.\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when shaking starts to happen and Serenity stumbled on top of you. You two blushed madly while looking closely at each other. You two quickly get up and straighten yourselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Varin.\" Serenity apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.

But, stay behind me.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran out of the blimp with Serenity behind you and head straight to the tower. Once there, you took the elevator up, but it was too late. You and Serenity were shocked to see Joey passing out on the ground after getting hit by Marik's god card, The Winged Dragon of Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOEY!!\" You yelled as you and Serenity run up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been friends with Rebecca Hawkins for a while. After graduating from a High School in Weckwood, you were given a scholarship to study at one of the most prestigious colleges in America, Harvard University. You would've been a fool to turn down the offer so you accepted. The very next day, you flew to Massachusetts and began the next phase of your academic life. To say the least, you were surprised to meet a fifteen year old child prot\u00e9g\u00e9e who was not only tacking some of the toughest courses Harvard had to offer, but was also the best Duel Monsters player in the United States.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou formally met her during a study session with a bunch of other students. Finals were coming up, so of course, tensions were high. The only person who didn't seem to be stressing out was Rebecca. Leaning over to her seat, you asked, \u201cHey\u2026 uh, Rebecca, right?\u201d she nodded. \u201cHow are you so calm right now? Finals are less than a week away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \u201cWhy shouldn't I be calm?\u201d she asked you back. \u201cI've done enough study.\u201d She then glanced over at the copious amount of notes you had written into a blank exercise book. \u201cAnd judging by the state of your notebook, I\u2019d say you have too. Trust me, you've got nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was right. The two of you passed all your final exams with nothing but the highest marks. The grueling amount of time you put into study had paid off. But if it hadn't have been for Rebecca, you probably would've just stressed yourself so much that you wouldn't have been able to focus at all during the exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter graduation, you headed back home and you thought you\u2019d never see her again. But that wasn't the case. It turned out that she and her grandfather, Professor Arthur Hawkins, spent quite a lot of time in Japan. When you saw her at the arcade a year later, you went over to say hi to her, but feared she may have forgotten all about you. That fear left you when, as soon as she saw you, she ran up to you and hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! (name)?! It\u2019s been so long, how\u2019ve you been?!\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting along fine\u2026\u201d you said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Excellent!\u201d Rebecca cheered. \u201cHey, come with me. I've got a couple friends who I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to meet.\u201d Before you could even say anything, Rebecca grabbed your wrist and pulled you along to another part of the arcade, one with a DDR machine. It was there that you were introduced to Yugi Muto, Joey Wheeler, T\u00e9a Gardner and Tristan Taylor. Soon after, Rebecca gave you her phone number and address and asked you to come over whenever you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few months you spent getting reacquainted with Rebecca and took note of how she interacted with her friends, specifically Yugi. Rebecca would always appear out of nowhere at some of the most random times and wrap her arms around him, or even give him a little peck on the cheek, to which Yugi would do little more than blush. You were a little bummed that she didn't do this with you. You thought she was kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you and Rebecca were at her grandpa's lab chatting and just basically hanging out. Somewhere along the lines, she asked you if you thought she was pretty. \u201cRebecca? Of course you are! You're one of the prettiest girls I know!\u201d you said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why doesn't Yugi like me then?\u201d she asked. This was kind of an awkward question. You had known about Rebecca\u2019s infatuation with Yugi. You had never fully understood it, given Yugi\u2019s apparent apathy towards Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really fond of all that. You\u2019d actually developed a crush on Rebecca recently, but you hadn't yet worked up the nerve to tell her. Sure, it was a bit manipulating, but all you could do was try and deter Rebecca from Yugi long enough for Rebecca to lose interest in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know. I think he's just not into girls yet. He is kinda young.\u201d you stated. Rebecca sighed with disappointment. You tried your best to convince her that she should meet other guys, namely you, but she was a bit reluctant. You could tell she was feeling a little down, completely different to how she was a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let's go get lunch and we can talk about it then.\u201d you offered. Rebecca agreed and the two of you went to McDonald's for burgers and milkshakes. While you ate, you also kept at trying to convince her to move on. You were starting to get to her when you started to complement her. Suddenly, you felt her slide her socked foot over your leg! She was playing footsie with you! Pretending not to notice, you continued complementing her. Soon, you were both done eating and you invited her back to your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Rebecca fawned over the state of your house. This was the first time that Rebecca had ever been over to your house, so you took the liberty of showing her around. It wasn\u2019t big, but it wasn\u2019t small either. After you finished showing her around, the two of you sat down on your couch. \u201cYour house is amazing.\u201d Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d you smiled. \u201cWould you like to watch a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? A movie sounds great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exact moment that you heard Rebecca\u2019s response, you decided that today would be the day that you would pop the question. No, not THAT question! The smaller one! You\u2019d ask Rebecca if she liked you. Even though you were pretty sure that she only liked you as a friend, considering her interest in Yugi, you figured that it couldn\u2019t hurt to at least ask. Well\u2026 it might. Your friendship with her would probably be ruined, and if not, it wouldn\u2019t be the same. Still, you had to ask. These feelings were eating your insides and you had to get them out in the open\u2026 even if it meant losing a good friend\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo set the mood, you decided to watch a romantic comedy, closing the curtains (which you told her was just to reduce the glare), you then set about getting a bag of popcorn ready. With everything in place, you sat down beside Rebecca, putting the popcorn in between the both of you and began to watch the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like at McDonald's, you felt Rebecca\u2019s foot rub up against yours. You pretended to pay no heed to it and resumed watching the television, but Rebecca kept at it for pretty much the whole movie. In fact, the only time she didn't do it was when you hit pause on the remote because she had to go to the bathroom halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca, do you like me?\u201d you asked, looking over at her as the movie ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rebecca asked. \u201cOf course I like you, (name). I wouldn't be here if I didn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I mean, do you like me\u2026?\u201d you said, really enunciating the word \u2018like\u2019. You waited for Rebecca to say something, anything, but she didn't, so you continued. \u201cSee\u2026 the truth is\u2026 I think you\u2019re really cute, and you\u2019re such a nice person to be around. I've seen the way you look at Yugi, and it pains me, more than you realize, to see you vie for his affection and for him to give you no notice. He might not be able to see you for the beautiful person you are, but I can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca\u2019s mouth dropped open slightly, and she seemed to be at a complete loss for words. She looked like she wanted to say something, her mouth opening and closing a couple times, so you waited patiently for her to gather her thoughts, understanding that you did kind of thrust the question on her without any sort of warning. Rebecca turned back, silently looking at the television, you in turn realizing that you may\u2019ve come on a little too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn't have come out and said all of that without a heads up. If I've made you feel at all uncomfortable, and you want to leave, that\u2019s fine. I completely understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after what seemed to be the longest seconds of your life, Rebecca sighed, turning to face you head on.</span></div></div>",

Your prick stands firmly in place between her beautiful soles rubbing it up and down.<br>\r\nRebecca starts to pick up the pace, and a little bit of precum trickles out the head of your piece. The pleasure of her soft soles was sensational. Your breathing was getting heavier as Rebecca gets faster and faster. You feel the pressure building up in your dick and you cum all over her soles coating them in your cum. Rebecca kinda giggled at all the cum on her soles and asked \"what happens next\"?<br>\r\nyou tell her to lick off all your cum from her cute preteen feet.<br>\r\n Rebecca raises an eyebrow but shrugs it off. She lifts one of her feet up to her face, and licks it from heels to toe. Rebecca smiles after the first lick so was clearly enjoying licking your product off her sole. Again and again she kept doing big licks and was using all of her tung. Finally she started to suck her toes \"they taste great\" she mumbled. One after the other she sucked all of her toes then licked between them.<br>\r\nonce Rebecca had finished cleaning both of her feet she held her soles up to your face and asked \"am i done?\"</span></div></div>",

This was the first time that Rebecca had ever been over to your house, so you took the liberty of showing her around. It wasn\u2019t big, but it wasn't small either. After you finished showing her around, the two of you sat down on your couch. \u201cYour house is amazing.\u201d Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d you smiled. \u201cWould you like to watch a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? I just thought of something awesome we could do together! I know we just got here, but if it\u2019s alright with you, could we go back over to my grandpa\u2019s lab?\u201d Rebecca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cYeah\u2026 sure\u2026\u201d You tried not to show it, but you were a bit upset. You decided that today would be the day that you would ask Rebecca if she liked you, and nothing seemed to be going how you envisioned it. You decided to give it one last shot to see if you could get Rebecca to stay at your place. \u201cBut I was kind of hoping maybe we could-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I know what you wanted, but I just HAVE to show you this! It'll totally blow your mind.\u201d Rebecca cut you off, taking your wrist and dragging you out of your house, barely giving you any time to lock up, before leading you to her grandpa\u2019s lab. \u201cGrandpa? Are you here?\u201d she called out once the two of you were inside. There was no reply and you swore you heard Rebecca say \u201cYes!\u201d to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the lab. It was like something out of some crazy science fiction movie. Wires and cables practically covered the floor, so you were constantly looking down so you wouldn't accidentally trip on one of them. The center of the room housed a giant supercomputer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we actually doing here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you in a second.\u201d Rebecca hushed you, getting her Duel Disk from the other side of the room, strapping it on and plugging a green cable into the disk\u2019s USB port. \u201cOkay, so you know how KaibaCorp used Solid Vision to create holographic projections for Duel Monsters, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ever since this incident with Doma, my grandfather has been working on a machine to turn the data that the Solid Vision uses to create its monster holograms into real beings with corporeal forms.\u201d Rebecca explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell does that work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure, but grandpa\u2019s been spending most of his time down here working out the kinks. He\u2019s gotten to the point where you can summon a monster to the field, and that monster will appear with a basic awareness. It\u2019ll follow any orders you give it, and I mean ANY.\u201d Rebecca said. When she saw that your expression was one of disbelief, she drew a card from her deck. \u201cWatch\u2026 I summon Celtic Guardian!\u201d Rebecca slid the card into her Duel Disk\u2019s Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various lights on the side of the supercomputer flickered vigorously as Celtic Guardian appeared before you. You inspected him, noticing that his eyes shifted between you and Rebecca, though he remained silent. You could definitely tell that no hologram was in front of you. Celtic Guardian was in fact, a real monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now I\u2019m going to give him a command.\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cCeltic Guardian, come over here and give me a little smooch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled a little at Rebecca\u2019s choice of words as the Celtic Guardian walked over to her, got down on bended knee and planted a soft kiss on the back of Rebecca\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Way\u2026\u201d were the only words that came out of your mouth as Celtic Guardian stood back up. Rebecca then took the card off her Duel Disk, causing the Celtic Guardian to disappear in a flash of light. Returning the card to her deck, Rebecca then walked over and gave you the Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can try it out if you want.\u201d She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be awesome! But I left my deck at home.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem! Wait here!\u201d Rebecca said, running off and leaving you alone in the room for a few minutes. When she returned, she gave you a deck. \u201cHere, you can use this. This deck contains only female monsters, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something to your liking in here. I should warn you though: You can only have one monster out at a time, otherwise the system malfunctions and it has to be reset.\u201d Rebecca explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, drawing the top card from the deck and looking at it. Your eyes widened in surprise. What card was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes widened in surprise. The card you were holding was the Dark Magician Girl. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rebecca asked, noticing your somewhat shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your eyes off the card, still holding it, and turned to Rebecca. \u201cYou've got the Dark Magician Girl?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah. Is it really that surprising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Yugi was the only one who had a Dark Magician Girl card.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. There are quite a few people in the US who run Spellcaster decks with her in there as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you run a Spellcaster deck? Why haven\u2019t you put this in your main deck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DID run a Spellcaster deck.\u201d Rebecca clarified. \u201cBefore that, I used my grandpa\u2019s deck. Now I run Dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Okay, fair enough.\u201d you shrugged. The two of you stayed silent, you not slotting the card in the Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna summon her or not?\u201d Rebecca asked with a smile. You quickly looked back at the card in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 sorry\u2026\u201d you placed the card face-up in the Monster Card Zone as the supercomputer\u2019s lights flickered once more. A few seconds later, the Dark Magician Girl appeared in front of you. You were instantly smitten. Although you had seen Yugi use the Dark Magician Girl a couple of times in his duels before, the Dark Magician Girl in those duels was just a hologram. Unlike Yugi, you had the real thing standing in front of you. You were at a complete loss for words, and so you just took the time to look Dark Magician Girl over. Her golden blonde hair, her emerald eyes, her rosy cheeks, the cute little outfit she wore with the giant hat and matching wand. You had the sudden urge to just go over to her and start kissing her, but you felt a little awkward with Rebecca in the room with you. It wasn't like you could ask her to leave, it was her grandpa\u2019s lab after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a beep coming from where Rebecca was and saw her pull out her cell phone from her pocket. \u201cGrandpa needs me to meet him at the Domino Museum. Can I trust you to stay here with her until I get back?\u201d she asked, nudging to Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome one on one time with one of the hottest Duel Monsters ever? Awesome! \u201cYeah, you can trust me.\u201d you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled back. \u201cOkay, great. I\u2019ll text you when either Gramps or myself are on our way back.\u201d She said as she walked out of the lab, leaving you alone with Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you looked at each other, not saying a word. You blushed, remembering how Rebecca ordered the Celtic Guardian to kiss her, which he did \u2013 no questions asked. You thought about just giving her an order to kiss you, as it had always been one of your biggest fantasies to get a kiss on the lips from this girl, as crazy as that sounded. If you were daring, you could order her to give you a blowjob, or maybe even just make her have sex with you straight up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, Rebecca did say that all the Duel Monsters summoned with the machine had a basic level of consciousness, so on some level, it wouldn't be right to give her an order like that. She wasn't just a hologram anymore. As long as your Duel Disk was connected to the machine, she was a real, living, breathing person. You couldn't really ask her to do that, could you? Maybe you should be a gentleman and just talk with her for a while? After all, she\u2019s probably got a lovely voice to go with that lovely body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while you were deciding what to do, Dark Magician Girl just looked at you with a blank expression on her face, probably because you hadn't given her a command or said anything to her yet. You glanced at your Duel Disk, before looking to Dark Magician Girl and deciding to\u2026</span></div></div>",

The other held her cape, attached to a dark green shirt. She had quite the physique, clearly someone who worked out. The shirt led to a miniskirt and black shorts. They led to bare thighs that led to high stockings and boots. There was a robot dog too. She was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and the artwork was fancy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's brand new!\" Rebecca said proudly. \"Brand new archetype too, not many people have this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You grinned. \"So we should see what all the fuss is about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activated the card. A flash of light and all of a sudden, there she was. The redhead was much nicer in person. Now if only she'd chosen to expose more than her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her robot dog jumped in front of her with a loud bark. It didn't advance, but man was it a boner kill. Farmgirl crouched by it. \"Relax!\" Her voice sounded soft, but experienced. \"I'm sure there's no threat here. Is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd got your dick back up. You shook your head. She smiled and pulled her cape off. Why did she have to have buttoned her shirt up all the way? She was in the perfect position for you to sneak a peek at her chest. She took her goggles off too, as well as the tool in her hand when she noticed Rebecca looking at the dog in awe. \"Are you a dog person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you two know your way around tech too. Why don't you play with him for a while? He's a softie deep down.\" She stroked the dog on its neck and it sprang forward, nuzzling Rebecca's thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him for a walk maybe? If you can keep him hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled and walked the dog away. Farmgirl looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, aren't you interesting?\" She walked towards you, swaying her hips. Fuck that was sexy. She ran her hand over your Duel Disk. \"Do you need to wear this or shall we get comfortable?\" You took the Duel Disk off and placed it on the machine, taking care not to disconnect it from the machine. When you looked back, Farmgirl was in the process of undoing her thick twin braids. You watched as she unravelled the last loops and red hair cascaded down her back and shoulders. She smiled at you, then bit her lower, luscious lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly know what you're doing. What do I call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you mean. And can't you guess? I'm well known in your world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. A farm girl with a dog? \"Dorothy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" She stepped closer and trailed her fingers up your arms. \"I saw how you looked at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, then dragged a finger down your torso. \"Well, I find you quite the specimen. And while we're alone, why don't we <i>play?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think you'd ever heard a more sultry word. Her fingertip dipped behind the waistband of your trousers and traced it around your front, brushing ever so lightly against your head. You grinned at each other. She slipped her finger further inside and added her other three. She gripped your trousers loosely in her palm. She applied a tiny bit of pressure and you realised she could take your pants off too, leaving you nude from the waist down and freeing your boner from its prison.</span></div></div>",

But from there, things went downhill quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, she made a major comeback. She cleared your entire field and made it impossible for you to rebuild.

But for some reason, when she did that around you, her dark persona was much milder. Perhaps it was the close friendship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you were over at her house, alone with her talking about the Dark Signers, when she slipped her shoes off, saying they were making her feet sore and sweaty. On instinct, you looked down at her socked feet. They were REALLY beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, will you rub them for me? They hurt real bad.\u201d Akiza pouted. You were glad to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to your knees and she put her feet near you. You grabbed one and started to gently massage it. Slowly, you eased the pain and her grunts of pain turned into moans of delight. You did her other foot, then set her feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if they stink. I hate these shoes.\u201d Akiza said. You leaned in close and inhaled the intoxicating aroma of Akiza\u2019s feet just because you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's nothing, Akiza. Really, I didn't smell anything bad at all.\u201d you told her. And ain't that the truth! You LOVED it!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asked you with a raised eyebrow. You didn't say anything, instead choosing to answer by putting your nose atop her feet and taking in a long whiff of her scent. Akiza stared in shock, but still let out a cute little giggle. By the looks of things, she was either extremely ticklish or thought that your behavior was funny. \u201cReally.\u201d you answered, going in to sniff the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You LIKE doing that?\" She asked, still giggling. You nodded. Your eyes widened as Akiza's hairpin fell out of her hair and onto the living room floor, time seeming to slow to a standstill. A reddish aura seemed to emanate from Akiza\u2019s body, which you knew could only mean one thing: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, her dark persona, The Black Rose, had taken over. The sinister grin and dominating gaze she gave you now caused you to sweat a little. In reality, you didn't have that much to worry about. Even as The Black Rose, Akiza would never do anything that would deliberately cause you pain. She wasn't as unruly with you like this either. Hell, Yusei got a worse time than you did when Akiza was like this! That\u2019s got to account for something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing you could do at this point was see if you could bring Akiza back to her senses. When Akiza was like this, you and Yusei seemed to be the only two people who could snap her back to normal. \u201cAkiza\u2026 are you alri-\u201d you began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d Akiza cut you off, not letting up on her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I've had some 'one on one' time with you hasn't it?\u201d you stayed silent. \u201cHasn't it?\u201d Akiza repeated, you now realizing that she was in fact asking a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Akiza. It has\u2026\u201d you answered, the expression on her face no longer affecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza smiled. \u201cWell (name), we\u2019re alone here\u2026 And you seemed to enjoy playing with my feet\u2026</span></div></div>",

No one knew about your foot fetish but it seemed as though the cat was out of the bag with Akiza. You figured you might as well enjoy yourself, and keep her happy while doing so. \u201cHow do you want me to start?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to start by kissing my foot, (name)!\u201d Akiza ordered, pressing her foot against your chest. You gladly obliged, gently picking up her left foot and kissing it all over. You trailed kisses up from her heel to her cute toes, and then kissed each toe just for the fun of it. After that, you kissed the top and sides of Akiza's foot. \u201cVery good!\u201d Akiza praised. \u201cHow about kissing my right foot in the same way you just did my left?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you happily did. The aroma of her feet was engrossing you now, words couldn't describe how much you were enjoying this! You finished kissing Akiza's foot and looked up at her waiting for your next orders. \u201cYou\u2019re really getting into this, aren't you? But how about we put that tongue of yours to work now\u2026\u201d before you could say or do anything, Akiza lifted her right foot up and stuffed her big toe into your mouth. \u201cGo on, lick\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though things were progressing faster than you ever thought they would, to stop now would be one of the stupidest decisions you would probably ever make. You reached up and gently held Akiza\u2019s shin with your hands, slowly fondling Akiza\u2019s toe with your tongue. Quiet whimpers escaped from Akiza\u2019s body as you continued to pleasure her for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were starting to get into it though, savoring the full taste of Akiza, she brought her foot away from you, taking her toe out of your mouth.

She was embarrassed at her having made you kiss her feet all over and lick her toes. But her face clearly showed that she enjoyed every second of it in pure ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine, Akiza. Really. You can't help it when you lose your grip on your powers and go back once in a while. Besides. I sort of liked doing that a little.\u201d You admitted. Suddenly, you felt awkward. You did smell her feet, but that was amusing to her. This time, you kissed them and then licked one of her toes, admitted to enjoying yourself. Akiza was blushing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... could you... I mean... If you liked that then... would you do it some more?\u201d She asked nervously. Hah! She felt just as awkward about this as you did! Now, how could you deny her what she wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Akiza and gave her a warm smile. \"Sure Akiza. I'd love to!\" you said. You grasped one foot in each of your hands and brought her feet to your face. They were oh, so cute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Akiza's feet close, you began. You first planted a kiss on each sole, Akiza letting out a slight moan in response. Next, you kissed her heels. Then her arches. After that, Akiza looked down at you and said that felt nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked and said \"Well. you haven't seen a thing yet!\" Then you trailed quick kisses up from her heel to her toes, and a soft kiss on each toe. Then you grabbed her other foot and did the same, planting several, quick kisses all over her foot. After that, you paused to adore them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. You're not done yet, are you?\u201d Akiza asked, clearly wanting you to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m just admiring them.\u201d you answered. Then you poked out your tongue and shyly licked her heel. Akiza's foot jerked as she let loose a giggle. Apparently, she was QUITE ticklish on her feet. Seeing that, you decided to go the distance and just let your tongue fully out, easing it on the base of Akiza\u2019s feet, smiling as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza then aggressively pulled you up by your shirt towards her. You were about to protest, until you realized her dark persona was back in control again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake off my bra, (name), and start massaging my breasts!\u201d she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied, reaching forward as Akiza took off her top and removed her bra for her. Her breasts pushed out in their full glory. They were HUGE! Instinctively, you grabbed one of her nipples and start twirling it around between your fingers. After a few minutes of this, you moved up and started gently massaging her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Akiza let out a lengthy sigh. You noticed by her expression that she was back to her old self. She looked at you for a second and then apologized once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I lost control again.\u201d Akiza paused. \u201cCan you continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d you said to Akiza. You continued to massage her breasts. Though as time passed, she began to look a little shy about it, so you stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry. Am I doing something wrong?\u201d you asked Akiza worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d she paused as she answered \u201cIt's just that, I've never been with someone that's not afraid that my evil side might take over and attack them. You're the first person I've been with besides Sayer that doesn't seem afraid of being next to me\u201d. Her face was turning tomato-red and she seemed like trying to shrink into non-existence from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put one hand on her shoulder and sighed. \"Akiza, you make it sound as if you're a monster. No one thinks of you that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza looked back up at you, a determined expression on her face. \"You're wrong, (name). Everyone at Duel Academy thought I was, and everyone at the Fortune Cup thought I was a witch. My own parents even thought I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupted her. \u201cAkiza, other people may think you're a witch, but I don't. You're a very beautiful and intelligent girl. The only person that you have to prove anything to is yourself. And besides-\u201d you were unable to finish your sentence as Akiza pulled you in for a tight embrace and kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened due to Akiza's sudden forwardness. This wasn't the Black Rose that was in control, this was the real Akiza, holding you against her chest, arms around you, who had her lips pressed tightly against yours. Akiza attempted to slide her tongue into your mouth, and after a moment's hesitance, you allowed her tongue to enter into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza moaned deep into your throat as she slowly slid her hands up the sides of your body and proceeded to cup your face in her hands. You couldn't help but blush as Akiza stared directly into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt maybe only took a few seconds but it seemed like it went on for hours, maybe even days. When she pulled away, you could feel her breath on your face. You could even feel the heat coming from her cheeks. She was HOT! So hot in fact, that you were panting from the air around you two. So was she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she broke he hug. She gathered her clothes and ran out of the room while dressing in a hurry, clutching her right arm. You quickly got dressed and ran off behind her. You eventually found her at the local park, sitting on a swing. It was night-time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, what happened?\" you asked. Akiza looked down at the ground, tears welling up in her eyes, which soon fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's the Dragon Mark...\u201d she finally replied. \u201cEver since I got it, people have been scared to be around me. That's also the reason I've been marked as a witch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was letting it all out. You saw in her a person in need of help and care. You sat in the swing next to her. You placed your arm around her and she rested her head on your shoulder. She quickly fell asleep, so you placed your jacket over her and carried her home. You placed her in her bed and you slept on the couch. Tomorrow would be the turning of a new leaf...</span></div></div>",

Akiza allowing you to indulge in your fetish was a fantasy you had, but her dark persona would turn this into a nightmare you feared. You started sucking her toe and licking the tip of it with your tongue. Caution locked your eyes with her's, until a sign of her normal personality was resurfacing or this dark persona was pleased with you, you would not turn away. You wondered if she was enjoying the dread that this persona brings you, and knowing the Black Rose persona you had a gut feeling that you shouldn't doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin on her face slowly shrunk away, her eyes were filling with boredom but the desire to dominate never left them. Your tongue work wasn't doing anything for her anymore. \"If this is all you can do I regret letting an uncreative person have their fun with my feet.\" Her expecting glare gave you the motivation needed to not keep her waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled her toe out of your mouth, enjoying the taste left in your mouth, and licked from heel to toe on her right foot. Going counter clockwise your tongue covered every inch of her sole, and you heard a giggle or two escaping Akiza's mouth. You took a guess and figured she really was ticklish. Not wanting her to get bored of this, you gave her left foot the same treatment. With an increased intensity and peaked interest your tongue moved across her foot. Akiza, barely realizing what you were doing, failed to stifle herself before laughing. Satisfied with finding out that she was ticklish, you toned down the speed of your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Akiza said with one last laugh followed after that. \"I'm feeling generous today, so you get a reward for that,\" she said moving her right foot to your crotch and rubbing it slightly. You felt an erection rising, and considered that maybe this wasn't so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza stopped and sighed. \"I'm sorry, Anon,\" she said with her normal personality back in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine, Akiza! I was having a good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you feeling taken advantage of,\" she says, \"just let me know how I can make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she make it up to you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's what kissing Luna felt to you, you could only imagine how it felt for her. Your lips parted from hers again as she looked at you longingly. A smile etched itself across your face as one of your arms wrapped around her and the other brisked a few strands of her hair out her face.

The smell of the city air which you would've hated on any normal day smelled and tasted like rose petal as you drove with her below you. Then a idea went through your head as you stopped at a light. Nudging her out of her fantasty, she had her eyes closed the whole time loving this moment of bliss \"Hey take the wheel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said in slight shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it trust me, i trust you and im here to make sure nothing bad happens\" you said as she looked skeptical <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in you\" you said kissing her right where her neck met her shoulder. a shiver went through her body as her hands reached for the hand bar and you off your hands from the throttles and let her hands take over.

You kept encouraging her and eventualy she was doing the speed limit and was driving this thing like a pro. You smiled at her as you let her drive.

You reached over Luna and pressed some things on the control pad <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Your name* what are you doing?\" She asked as the duel runner screen read AUTO PILOT STANDING BY <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your hands on the throttle and act like your driving\" you said to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeha but why are we...?\" she asked as your hands reached around and grabbed hold of her of small breasts, barely A's but that wasn't your concern your concern was massaging her little nipples. She shivered and a small moan escaped her mouth \"*your name*...\" she said out in pleasure as you reached under her shirt and massaged her bare nipples. She kept gently moaning as you kept going feeling your erection come up again poking her at her butt. You started to grind against her as the auto pilot took you god knows where. Strangly there weren't that many people out on the street. Not that they could see very clearly what you were doing with how fast you were going. As you dry humped Luna her moans got louder and louder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" she chanted as pinched her nipples.

You're not going to be homeschooled over here are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he's enrolling with us,\" Luna said making you stare at her with confusion. You thought you saw a girn on her face that showed she enjoyed your confusion. You would get her back for that and this, or you would forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Hey, Luna, mind if I hangout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind at all, Patty,\" she replied making your confusion grow more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your confused look for the next five minutes until Patty left to use the bathroom. Now was your chance to get an answer. \"Lunny, could I ask why you did that? Did you really mean it?@<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an idea I had, Anon,\" Luna answered, \"and yes I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna, I really don't want to go back to school,\" a little bit of immaturity came out when you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon, I thought you would like to spend more time with me.\" She said. \"And what were you going to do anyway now that you're a kid again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got you there. The kid in you wanted to say \"stay home and watch cartoons\", but you kept that to yourself. \"But I thought I was in charge here. Remember what you said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both kids now, and I would think this would be easy for you since you've already taken classes already.\" She said. You were a good student but you didn't want to admit it to her to make her feel more right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have liked a chance to agree on this, but maybe it won't be so bad,\" you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna kissed your cheek. She whispered, \"Master, if you feel the need to punish me go ahead.\" That made you smile a little.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gave her a quick peck on the nose before you hoisted her into your arms, she holding onto your neck and wrapping her legs around your waist. Man you'd probably regret the fact your a kid again in no time, Luna felt heavier now that you were little again. You slightly laughed in your head when a thought crossed your mind that all Luna's weight must be in the butt of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So got anything in mind\" she coued in your ear as you walked her down her hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't worry your pretty little head about it, let me do all the work\" you said as she snuggled her head into your shoudler <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you keep calling me nice things like that\" You heard and felt her say into your shoulder, the sensation tickling you and feeling warm. You chuckled as you held her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing honey bun\" you said as you felt her hot breath hit your shoulder, feeling the forming smile on her face. You lead her down the hall, slightly pacing yourself due to her new found heaviness, till you were infront of her bathroom door. Managing a balancing act you were able to twist the door knobs by hoisting your foot up to the doorknob and turning it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe i should call you monkey from now on\" she said with humor as you did a fake chuckle. You quickly unwrapped your arms around her, but didn't let her drop, instead smacking your hands on her butt and holding her up by that, she gasping at the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me monkey and i swear honey buns that ill make you live up to that nickname\" you said rubbing and grabbing her butt, making her moan. You grinned as you let one of your hands go, supporting her with the remaining one, as you turned the knob on the bath tub on as steaming water began to flow out into the tub and started to mist up the bathroom. You turned your head to hers, still buried in your shoulder, and dug your face into hair or neck, you didn't really care you just wanted to snuggle your face in her as you said \"Bath time Luna\" through small moans she asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you?\" you responded by kissing whatever you had your face dug into, which you were pretty sure was just hair. She giggled as you set her down, and the both of you stripped the other till you were down to nothing and so was Luna, even taking out her hair ties so her hair went down. Had to admit, with the hair down she was even hotter. You took the spot near the faucet as Luna settled back onto the other side as you both relaxed for a moment and let the hot water take you, covering all of you and taking out every single worry or inhibition you had and letting it wash away. Then you felt something odd around your crotch, looking over you saw Luna had her foot on your crotch and was gently rubbing it up and down. To say it felt amazing was a understatment, but were you just going to let this girl take advantage of you? Hell no! You slyly moved your right foot till it was at Luna's crotch and using your big toe you began to rub Luna's clit, she moaning as she kept rubbing your crotch faster and you kept rubing your toe on her, even sticking it in her and i guess the apporiate term would be that you started toeing her. </span></div></div>",

Cum roped out of your and splattered all over Luna's butt, so much that you were sure for a spilt second that that your cock wasn't going to stop letting out the frosting for these yummy honey buns. You gasped as you almost fell over but caught yourself on the wall, if you fell back you would've hit the faucet. Not fun. Luna was gasping too as the both of you tried to get feeling back in your legs, Luna getting it back faster than you as she shakfully turned and helped you sit back down in the tub.

The action making you bite your tongue when Leo noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... paper towel\" you said grabbing the roll next to the sink \"i'm still kind of wet\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude just go dry off in the bathroom\" he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what not give Luna something to do when she gets home?\" you answered as Leo chuckled, Luna glaring at you. You gave her a apologetic smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon that's not funny\" Leo said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey i'll clean it up don't worry\" you said both to Leo and Luna. Leo sitting back into his grin as Luna gave you that look that told you 'you better'. You started walking over to Leo, digging in your pockets till you pulled out your keys. Gesturing Luna to them you started for Leo \"Dude you still need help in that game of yours?\" you asked, noticing Luna creeping slowly to your keys. Leo nodding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i keep getting killed by all the radiation and even if i have my power armor on the raiders still kill me\" he said as you chuckled and got to the couch, reaching for the controler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here i gotcha\" You said starting it up as you heard Luna quietly grab your keys. \"Dude i spent way to many hours of my life in <b>my apartment</b> trying to beat this\" you said stressing on the apartment part so Luna knew you wanted her to go there. Leo looked at you weirdly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you yell that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not yelling\" you told him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you are\" he said as you thought of another way to make this easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have some water in my ears so i don't hear it, mind if i raise up the volume?\" You asked asked as Leo shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it i love it in surround\" he said as you raised the volume from 18 to 40. Damn was it loud you could even hear the crickets in the game. But you also kept a ear out for Luna. She was moving quick while you were on the game, hearing a few rips coming from her clothes as she moved to the door and finally made it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing to cause alot of alarm but there wasn't that kind of goofy undertone in her voice anymore, she sounded more stern. It was hard to describe, it was like the really kiddy part of her had grown away as her body did too. She stopped leaning off the wall and found her bearing and began to walk a little.

Your dick was as hard as it had ever been, but Luna wasn't ready yet. You placed your hands on her rump, just above her hands and slowly slid them up her back. She looked at you over her shoulder, about to question you before your hands landed on her bra. You unclasped it and let it fall to the bed. When she pulled her arms out you held it over the side of the bed and let it fall. You put your hands back on her body, her waist this time, and trailed them up. She smiled as your fingertips passed over her navel and gasped as you palmed her budding breasts. You pulled her close, kissing her neck and then her lips when she turned her head. Your hardness felt so nice between her buttocks and pressing against her holes. One of your hands glided down her body to push her nether regions closer to yours, passing over her pussy. You smirked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wet.\" Her lips were soaked. You wondered what the innards would be like as you pressed a finger in and she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't want to...waste time!\" she gasped. She wasn't kidding. Her pussy was so wet you could probably plunge your whole length in first try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" you kissed her behind the idea and she giggled. Then you pressed her down. She held her body up with her hands and watched as you angled your dick at her entrance. Both of you moaned when you made contact. You rubbed the head against her opening, up and down. \"You know it hurts the first time right? And I'm a lot older than you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand on your dick, the other ran up her side. When it got near her armpit she jerked her arm away, possibly afraid you'd tickle her even though she'd made the region larger. You smiled, then moved your hand to the side and gripped her left breast. She moaned, then moaned louder as you pushed your cock in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head hit the mattress and your right hand gripped her waist as you forced the head of your dick in. Man, she was tight! It was lucky the bed muffled her cry as you got your head in, you could have sworn it could have gotten the whole block's attention otherwise. While you had no intention of stopping, as you inched further inside her a small part of you couldn't help wonder how she'd react to having her hymen popped, if she had one of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she?</span></div></div>",

Wiping out your cock and hot dogging her. Doing this to an older Luna, and a much bigger, rounder, softer, and fatter rear end. Spanking her too. And then you thought about the previously mentioned, all while an older Luna wearing a collar, calling you master, while being corrupted from the cute, innocent girl to a hedonistic, masochistic teen who loved being spanked.

Walking down a street in the city you passed by some shops, ice cream, video games, clothes. You were full, no good games were out, and you were pretty comfy in the jacket and jeans you were in. The thought went across your head that you didn't have to spend any money today but screw that voice in your head you were young and loaded so you were going to enjoy yourself. Speaking of that's when you passed by a window and saw something you wanted. A short blonde girl with dark skin, in a academy outfit and damn did you love that those skirts were so short. Man you wished you could go back, but then you remember all the snoring in class, awkward moments, and crappy people and were glad you graduated last year. Oh man, as the girl you got a nice treat her full figure. Definetly modest but her breasts and ass were in perfect proportion and those deep blue eyes. If your mind could be heard it'd be screaming for you to get in there and talk to her, to bad your body was two steps ahead of your brain. Entering in the shop, which seemed to be a donation shop or reuse shop, why she would be in here was beyond you but she was heading your way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You know she really does seem nice, come on you know what to do with nice girls. Or did you forget what your mother told you on how to treat them? Hopefully not because your going to make this girl feel special. As you walked the streets with her, still holing onto her hand warmly you scanned around at the restaurants about. Most of them looked like standard chain places and fast food joints, as much as you would like a burger or some bleh food that had decent side dish you wanted this special. Out of the dozen restaurants here you found it. Perfect, a little place with low lighting from the outside and not to flashy. Didn't seem busy and what tickled your fancy was that long vacant chaired bar in the back. It was countless how many times you thanked your big sister for bumping your ID up a couple years. So no one was going to question a 22 year old who was really 19 ordering a beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This look good to you?\" You asked her, pointing to the restaurant. She still had some of that red on her cheeks as she stuttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yea..yeah\" she said nervous, and you caught on to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everything alright?\" you asked, looking right at her. It was so cute how she kept trying to break eye contact from you, she couldn't even look at you for more than a second without that deep red turning to a bright crimson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always say the same thing twice like that?\" You joked, getting her to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always\" lord almighty she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's the matter?\" you asked sweetly and concerned, you earnestly did want to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... this is kinda sudden you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They always say love at first sight is\" smooth man, you felt her shake at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you always this sly?\" she joked with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always\" you repeated what she told you, the smile on her face the warmest thing you've ever seen. \"I know it's sudden with us just meeting Patty, but you know beginnings are always sudden\" you told her, after a moment of silence she looked at you and asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginning of what?\" and you slyly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want it to be\" ouch, her grip man! She gripped your hand hard after that line, you could feel her heartbeat strong from your words! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... I want a nice date with you\" she shouldn't have loosened her grip. The moment you did you took advantage of it, rubbing your thumb against her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... i thought you'd give me a tough one\" after that little quip she leaned on your arm, hugging onto it as you led her into the place. Pretty empty, thursday night must not be kind to this place. The place was a steak house with a very big selection of wine. You told Patty to order whatever she wanted, a nice piece of skirt steak and you ordered a nice sirloin with potato skins for a appetizer. Of course a glass of wine to, a nice red one. When your waiter brought it over, Patty looked at you a little shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 21?\" she asked, you pressed a fnger to your lips and shushed as you shook your head no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"19\" you said to her under your breath, she still looking shocked. Your waiter soon came back with your appetizer, smelling great, cheesy, and bacony. Of course you spilt them with Patty, you even went a step farther and offered her some of your wine. She hesitated at first but you assured her that it was okay and that if she seemed a little weird by the end of this you'd help her sober up. After that assurance and the first sip showing her how sweet it tasted, you just lost your wine. After your steaks came you asked for a bottle of the stuff you just had. That wasn't enough, you two went through 2 and half bottles by the end. You really didn't mean to get her drunk but you were having such a good time listening to her talk about everything about her and you telling her about you to care about how much you were both drinking. Even though you had some, you remembered everything she told you. School, her parents and home life, her best friend Luna and her brother Leo, that she wants to be a special needs teacher for deft kids and even showed you that she could sign. You told her everything, your mom and dad living an hour away, your sister living in the satellite helping with the reconstruction efforts, and how you worked a nice job as a waiter in the city. That's why you made sure you tipped your waiter a 15 on that 60 dollar bill. You stumbled up, you were buzzed no doubt about that but Patty was worse. She had to cling onto you as she could barely walk her way out of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we had a fun night\" you said in a calm voice, the voice you only recognized when you were drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you big jerk haha! you got me all spinny\" she told you as you laughed a little harder than you would if you were sober. But drunk as you were you knew you shouldn't ask her to go home, her parents would kill her and arrest you! Quick you drunken flirt, i think it's time to make a quick decision.</span></div></div>",

Running through her numbers you texted her dad telling him she was staying at Luna's for the night. Patty was giggling into your arm as you moved slowly ahead. When that ring came saying that her dad was alright with that you smiled and started back for your home with your drunken angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did stumble into your 3rd floor aprartment, Patty was still klinging onto you but you were holding her red academy jacket. She had a little accident and threw up on it. None of it got on you that's good. You threw the jacket at your laundry bin then wandered to your couch with her and collapsed on it, she laying on it. The whole time after she threw up she kept slurring that she was sorry over and over again. You kept telling her it was alright alright alright. Looking over at her, her shirt had gone a little transparent and you could see her pink bra underneath.

You were about halfway out the door before Patty ran, a wide smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you!\" She said rather excitedly grabbing your hand and tugging you out the shop.

The two of you crossed the street and ran through a alley to arrive at a place simply glowing and bursting. A three floor building with lights aiming at the sky in a endless stream of colors, a midnight rainbow. Nothing but windows on the second floor to see what was going on on the inside, dancing dancing and oh more dancing. If only you had known you were going to a club you would've dressed up a little better. \"Sweet looks like it's booming tonight\" she said as she yanked you again, this time you yanked back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold on!\" you shouted at her. She ignored you and just yanked you again and, almost dropping you on your knees, as you ran for the door. To your semi relief there was a bouncer in front that stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up missy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh thank god' you thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your ID?\" he asked her as she dug in her purse and produced a blue ID. That shocked you as the bouncer looked it over, you were about to speak up and tell him that she was lying before Patty reached around and pinched your but. You felt your heart jumped as you felt her hand rub your ass down to your thigh as she rubbed the inside of it very close to your cock. You felt breathing get a little heftier and your heart rate jump as you looked down to her to see her grinning. She looked a little smug and proud at her effect on you. The bouncer handed back her ID <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay say your 16...\" he said as he looked at you, still shaky from the rubbing Patty was giving you. \"...He your sponsor?\" he asked as Patty gleefully nodded. The bouncer did a once over on you before he shrugged and got out of the way for you two. \"Enjoy Ascendance you two\" he said as Patty gave you a light push by your butt to get you in. When you were in she let go of your ass and streched her arms with the biggest smirk ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet i'm finally in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what the hell...\" you began before Patty then clung to your side again, but instead of touching your butt she grabbed at your crotch. You let out a gasp as you felt a excited jolt go through you as she rubbed. The people of the club not looking over at you and her, to busy dancing, drinking, or practically having sex on the dancefloor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh shhh be a good boy and get me a drink please or else i'm taking you out on the dancefloor and...\" she said as she teased at your zipper, making your toes curl and your cock get hard \"having my way with you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell was this girl...</span></div></div>",

Sayer, deciding that making new psychic duelists is easier than finding new members/future tools started a  breeding program, and figured the reader and Akiza would produce some strong kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1:Let's go with that old idea. Get along with Sayer's matchmaker scheme, and pray that in this storyline Akiza can beat Dark Misty in time to change your kids' diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Sherry: I don't think I ever did the Sherry option for my old pregnancy story so this one isn't really an old idea. You and Sherry are attending a party, have a little bit too much to drink, and in your drunkenness come to the conclusion that the best way to getting to know each other better is to fug in private. A few days after this Sherry starts showing the signs of being pregnant, and coming from a traditional family does not find the idea of her child being born out wedlock all that alluring.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Recently, I noticed that this story had been taken down from Writing.Com for whatever reason. I genuinely enjoyed the story and was sad to see it removed. Therefore, I am hoping for this item to act as a reboot of Dr. Awesome Funk's Original Story. Many, in fact most of the story's original guidelines for chapter submission will apply here, however I would also like to add a few guidelines of my own. Despite the story's namesake, a pathway does not necessarily have to contain any Foot Fetish-related content. I understand that many contributors have differing likes and dislikes and as such, I don't wish to discriminate against anyone who may have different tastes to other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow basically anything, so long as it has relevance or significance to the plot. The three things that I will not allow though are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath <br>\r\nCrossovers (no having characters from two different series [i.e GX and 5D's] interacting within the same timeline. Note that you can disregard this rule with the 'Rebecca's Cool Toy' pathway)<br>\r\nContent which breaks from reality (Inflation, TF, vore, unbirth etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're not sure if a chapter you wish to add violates any of the above, feel free to email me on the site for clarification. Otherwise, please contact me if you have any concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen writing a chapter, please refer to the characters by their 4kids dub names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would generally like this to be an actual story (meaning that each pathway should have a plot, no continuous sexual activities just for the sake of it). Any chapters I find with spelling mistakes or grammatical errors will be corrected. I encourage those who created additions for the original story to add to this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginal characters by Kazuki Takahashi<br>\r\nOriginal story and concept by Dr. Awesome Funk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7/10/15 Update: From now on the MC is to be referred as Anon, a stand in for Anonymous reader, because typing *your name* all the time is annoying.</td>",
