His Buster swelled and morphed into a hybrid of a Vulcan and a Mark Cannon, painted in blazing red and with his emblem painted on the guards of the barrel, while his other hand became blocky and jaggedy like his boots, his hand gaining sharp nails and a block on his knuckles and the black of his hand. From his emblem, blocky armor grew, swept upwards and connected with his shoulder-guards, forming chest armor. His helmet became blocky, grew fins like Zero\u2019s helmet, and his ear guard antennas split open as greyish purple gems emerged from them. A purple visor formed over his face, obscuring it and his now brown eyes as they shot open and dispersed the Liquid Dark Power that had surrounded him, landing gracefully yet menacingly on the ground. This was his new Dark Soul, the Burning Soul. He tuned his focus to Bass, and raised his Burning Buster at the powerful Net Navi.

Megaman\u2019s PET was on the table, propped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan sat up. \u201cOkay, Dark Program could mean anything, but I need to ask this. Has someone decided to restart the production of Dark Chips again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this has nothing to do with Dark Power.\u201d Chief shook his head. \u201cRegal has stuck to a righteous path even since we recovered him from Mt Belenus, and all of Nebula\u2019s tech within the volcano was rendered useless when it erupted. From what we salvaged, none of it was useable. While that doesn\u2019t rule out Nebula remmients, we\u2019re don\u2019t think it has to do with Dark Power or Murkland, Black Earth. This new dark program.....well, I\u2019ll let the future boy explain.\u201c He gestured to Geo to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo put it simply, this new Dark Program is reverse engineered from a program in my time. It\u2019s what Clockman was juiced up on, and it\u2019s what we thought Megaman accessed when he fought Clockman.\u201d Geo said, taking over for Chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gonna say this now, that was a completely different power that Megaman tapped into. I don\u2019t even know what it was, but I could take a guess.\u201c Land interrupted. \u201cGo on, I wanna know who made this thing so I can take a shot at them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Geo said. \u201cThe Dark Program works as a Black Navi Cust Program, taking up 6 squares in a K shape. The description says \u2018Sets everything to max\u2019, and it does is power up the Navi\u2019s Buster and Abilties, but it also bugs out the Navi. Every Navi that\u2019s had installed has become uncontrollable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only reason it\u2019s not a threat is that it\u2019s not widespread yet, only being released in test runs.\u201d Chief finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, it\u2019s really called the Dark Program?\u201d Megaman chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Yes it is,\u201d Chief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so do you know who\u2019s behind this?
