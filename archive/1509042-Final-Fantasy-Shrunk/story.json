But where you are is about to become the least of your worries, as thundering footsteps are heard approaching your position. A shadow falls over you, and as you look high up, you let out a gasp.

Anything to avoid being flattened under her massive foot. You didn't know where she was going, but right now it didn't seem to matter. You just kept putting one hand in front of the other, and slowly- very slowly, scaled up Aeris's dress. You wanted to get her attention. You knew Aeris was a kind girl, and would PROBABLY help you. Probably. She had a better chance of being nice than either Yuffie or Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, you got used to the swaying of the dress, as Aeris took her steps, and you slowly managed to climb higher and higher and higher.

LOOK DOWN HERE!\" You call up to her. Aeris hesitates and your hopes die as you hear the next words out of her mouth. \"How'd a speck of dirt that large get on me?\" She thought you were a speck of dirt! You were moving, using one free hand to wave at her. She then glared. \"Ew! It's a bug!\" She exclaimed. You start shaking your head. \"No! No Aeris! Don't! I'm a person! Not a bug!\" But it's too late to do anything. Aeris's hand sweeps in, and you feel her fingers push you hard. Aeris flicks you off her dress, and you fall quite a distance, slamming on the ground. You let out a scream of pain as you hit the ground. The pain's incredible, but somehow nothing is broken. But all the same, the pain prevents you from moving, effectively paralyzing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris looks around to make sure that nobody is watching and then smirks down at you. \"You know... I'd hate for the others to find out. They think I'm a really nice girl, and I am. But... when I see bugs like you... so helpless... I just can't resist this!\" She starts to take off her shoes, and her beautiful bare foot hangs above you. Were you at normal size, this would have looked amazing and flawless. And from your position it still is. But it's far more than an object of beauty now. Now, Aeris's foot is nothing more than an instrument of your death. \"Don't worry! I'll make this nice and slow...\" She tells you. \"So we can both enjoy every moment of it.\" Her foot slowly begins lowering towards you. The smell is faint at first, but as it nears, you can make it out more distinctly. The smell of sweat and foot. It's not a pleasant smell, and Aeris's feet were hot from walking in those boots all day. A droplet of sweat falls from them and hits you in the eyes. You scream and close your eyes, as the sweat stings them. Aeris does not notice. You've been completely covered by her foot, and aren't even as big as her pinkie toe. You were going to die under the foot of this goddess!</span></div></div>",

You can feel how soft her sole is, and despite your panic, you actually begin to think this won't be so bad. Afterall, all she has to do is crunch down and it'll all be over, right? But unfortunately for you, Aeris isn't feeling so merciful. She said she'd make this nice and slow, and so she fully intended to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly began applying more and more pressure, and began rubbing her foot across your body, pushing it farther and farther into her sole. The pain begins, slowly at first, but slowly becoming worse, and worse, and worse, until it's blinding pain. You can feel your bones start to crack under the weight of her foot. You try to scream at her to stop, but her foot is in your face and everything you say is muffled and even you can barely hear yourself! And Aeris's fun is only just starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot rubs back slightly, so that you're under the ball of her foot. You see her heel start to leave the ground and the pressure begins to grow rapidly. \"Aeris.... please....\" Tears are in your eyes as you try begging the goddess for help. But no help is to be given. Aeris's foot continues to press down harder and harder, until your body finally begins to give way, and becomes little more than a splatter on Aeris's sole. She grins widely, lifting up her foot to admire her handiwork. Your remains are pasted to her sole and she sighs happily. \"Wow, you were a squishy one.\" She teases. \"That was fun!\" She assumes you dead. Unfortunately, or perhaps, fortunately, for you, that is not yet the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared shrinking made it impossible for you to die! But it clearly didn't make it impossible for you to get hurt. Even though your remains are splattered across Aeris's sole, you are still aware... and in incredible pain. Everything is in blinding pain. But the pain is slowly, ever so slowly, starting to go, as you notice your body is trying to pull itself back together from nothing. But your relief turns to panic as you feel Aeris's foot start to move again towards her boot! Oh no! If she puts her foot back in there and starts walking again, there might not even be enough space left FOR you to reform! You could be stuck being a splatter on her sole forever!

And it just so happened that you were about to experience those breasts of Tifa a little more than you may be ready to. Because while you stared at the approaching goddess, mystified, Tifa tripped. Not the most graceful of actions, but it sums it up pretty well. She tripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, unable to catch herself in time, she landed hard, sprawling out on the ground. \"Owwww...\" She muttered. \"I can't believe I just tripped! God!\" She exclaimed. She got up and checked herself over. \"I bruised my knee too? Ugh!\" She exclaimed in frustration. Well, a bruised knee may not have been something to celebrate, but you were definately in a worse situation. Mainly because when Tifa fell over, those lovely melons you'd been admiring landed square on you.

Probably really exhausted from all the make-shift work Cid's had her doing through the entire nauseating flight. You overheard Yuffie let out one last sigh as she stomped over to the bed, constantly shaking you around inside your little insole prison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! ......THHHHHUUUUUUDDD!!!!*<br>\r\n\"AAAAAGGGHH!!\" The stomping ended when Yuffie literally jumped onto her bed... The impact snapped you against an inner shoe-wall, no doubt giving you whiplash to add to your broken ribs! Ugh... hard to believe it took you THIS long to realize youre tagging the wrong girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, Yuffie's apparently too tired to kick her shoes off! The moment she makes contact with her big comfy bed, she rests her head against her pillow and quickly drifts off to sleep. \"Mmm... g'night,\" you hear her mumble. A good night youre obviously not having. Youre still crammed in the ninja-girl's boot and youre aching all over.<br>\r\nBut on the plus side, at least she's stopped moving around and the way out is finally within your reach. Seeing as though this might be your shot at freedom for a while, you have to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly crawl through the tight space between her foot and her boot and made your way up to the boot's tongue, despite it squeezing against you really badly as you continued upwards, as if the boot itself didnt want you to escape!<br>\r\n\"Ngggh.....NNGGGHHH!!!\" you struggle to break through the little gap leading to the outside, \"Rggg....Nggghh....GrrrAAAH!\" SUCCESS! After what seemed like forever, youre finally out of the boot!<br>\r\nSure it was just out of a girl's shoe, but to you it felt like you broke out of a maximum security prison without even alerting the guards! You'd jump for joy, but your body was still in pain after the little 'fun-run'. You merely let a sigh of relief and stepped down the bed, gripping your side in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAint got the foggiest what to do now. Maybe try to wake Yuffie up and let her know that there's a tiny person in need of help. But then again, what if she wants compensation for her services? Eh, well. You'll worry about paying her later! Right now you'll just have to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZZZZzzzz....ooohhh.....\"<br>\r\nWhile you were busy thinking to yourself, Yuffie rolled over in her sleep... toward YOUR direction!<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you saw her colossal body starting to down at you! You wanted to run, but you were in no condition to.  Out of other options, you closed your eyes and hoped it wasnt gonna hurt so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDDDD!!!*<br>\r\nThankfully it didnt. As luck would have it, you werent crushed at all. You found yourself trapped in a bit of space conveniently big enough for you to fit in. Unfortunately it wasnt long before you realized it was Yuffie's belly-button!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... crap!\" you groaned to yourself. Beautiful... out of one cozy prison and cramped in another! And unlike the last one, there is no space whatsoever to escape!<br>\r\nYoure down to the last option: Wake Yuffie up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUFFIE!!!\" you scream as you constantly beat on the rubbery belly-buttony walls, \"Yuffie wake up! WAKE UP!! WAAAKKEE UP!!!\"<br>\r\nYou scream and fight, but to any avail? Is your struggle enough to wake the sleeping giantess on top of you?</span></div></div>",

She grabbed her pillow and stuck it over her head, trying to ignore the heavy hum of the airship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt something wriggling under her belly, in her belly button.

You turned your attention to Yuffie who was now only a few inches away from you. She frowned and brought you a little closer to her. Your embarrassment rose as Yuffie sniffed you briefly and wrinkled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. You smell familiar but a bit gross,\" she said and paused. \"Well, very gross,\" she said correcting herself. She put you back on the bed and sat down in front of you. She crossed her legs and you were left staring at Yuffie's boots. You shuffled uncomfortably as you knew why you were so stinky and the fact that you could smell her boots from where you were was an unpleasant reminder of the last few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me how you got here and how you got so small?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure! When I woke up I found myself here this size,\" you said. You told her how she had almost stepped on you and how you'd survived by clinging onto her boot as the ran around the Highwind. When you told her that she had kicked her boot off with you still attached she gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F$%^! I could have killed you,\" she cried. You were pleasantly surprised how she seemed to care about your safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was ok,\" you reassured her, \"I landed on something . . . soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bed? she asked naively. You shook your head as you got increasingly uncomfortable. \"Then what?\" she looked at you suspiciously. You plucked up the courage to reply although you knew that she wouldn't like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boot. I landed in your boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yuffie went bright red and she stared down at her boots. Immediately you could see that she knew why you smelled so familiar and she couldn't look at you in the shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when I put my boots on I . . . I squashed you with my feet?\" She said, shocked. You nodded to her, trying to be as kind as you can. \"And the reason why you smell is because . . . ?\" she said horrified. You nod again and to your surprise she started to cry. \"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I know my feet stink . . . that's why I wear these boots. Vincent took one sniff of my feet and now won't talk to me. I can't get anyone to stay around me for that long and the only reason why the others haven't noticed is because I move so quickly around them,\" she said burying her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sad for her. If you were full sized you could have comforted her but as it was you could ony gently pat the toe of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay!\" you told her trying to make her feel better. \"your boots were very comfortable. They were so warm and snug. And your foot pressed against me was nice as well. It was like getting massaged all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie blinked down at you. \"You really didn't mind it?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all! The only thing that stopped me having fun was that it was slightly painful when you walked around. Otherwise I would have loved to do it again,\" you said, proud at how nice you had been to her. However, instead of replying Yuffie looked thoughtful for a moment and you were slightly concerned at what she was thinking. Had you gone too far?</span></div></div>",

You try not to groan out loud as she pulls her boots off and a familiar but gross odour filled the room. Yuffie sniffed both her boots, squeezing her eyes shut at how strong they smelled. She holds them down near you and you think you might be turning green. You hope it's just you and she doesn't noticed how grossed out you are by how her feet and boots stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which do you think smells strongest? I can't decide,\" she asks. She sticks her left boot in front of you and you cough as you smell the really strong fishy odour coming out of it. She replaces it with her right boot and if anything the smell is even stronger. Your eyes begin to water as she moves it a bit closer and you can't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That one's stronger!\" you cry. You sigh in relief as Yuffie pulls her boot away and sniffs it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross! Eww you're right. This one's worse,\" she says with a giggle. She grabs her other boot and pulls it on her foot before dropping her stinky right boot in front of you. Suddenly you realise what she wants you to do and your heart sinks. She want you to go back in her boot while she wears it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then! I'll make it enjoyable for you! I promise!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel sick but you know you couldn't stand up to her even if you wanted to. You edge into the boot and walk down the shaft, the smell of fish getting stronger as you head down the moist dark tunnel.   When you're almost at the bottom she turns her boot the right way up and you tumble forward landing face first in a stinky grimy pool of sweat. You spit the foot sweat out as you look up to see Yuffie poke her face over the shaft of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to leave my socks on or do you want me to take them off?\" she grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't decide which would be worse. Her socks smelled as though she had been wearing them for days and they'd probably absorbed several days of foot sweat. Of course, they were also the only things insulating her feet, which could possibly smell even worse if they were unleashed.  Either way your were doomed but which would be worse for you . . . and which did you really want?</span></div></div>",

She started jumping up and down which made the whole boot shake.

Don't worry. You're gonna love this!\" Yuffie squealed with happiness. Slowly the ninja started to peel her thigh high socks off her leg, deliberately positioning herself over her boot so you could see her feet as they were exposed to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled off her left sock you saw that her bare leg was glistening with sweat below the knees, and you began to regret your decision. Eventually she got down to the foot and with a bit of effort pulled the sock right off, exposing her foot for the first time in days. You got a first whiff of how it smelled, and you immediately held a hand over your nose. It made her sock seem like a rose garden by comparison...it was shiny with sweat and slimy drops were dropping from the underside of her foot. Some drops hit the side of the boot and slithered down the soft leather, and a few even hit the bottom of the boot with a large splash, like giant raindrops. She wiggled her toes in front of you, and the smell completely assaulted you all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually, can you leave your socks on instead?\" you said, trying not to retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!\" she grinned. She held her left socks up to her nose and sniffed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gross!\" she wrinkled up her nose and coughed. \"Oh, I feel so sorry for you. This is going to feel so horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie giggled again, accidentally dropping her sock. Given where she was standing, it wasn't a surprise that it fell into the boot that you were in, and your eyes widened in horror as the huge black ball plummeted towards you. You groaned as it hit you in the face with a wet squelch, smothering you in sweat and filling your mouth with bits of toe jam that you spat out. You heard her laugh and she reached into the boot to pull her sock out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry about that,\" she giggled. She pulled off her right sock and you could just shake your head as the smell hit you. Her right foot definitely smelled worse, like fish and cheese mashed together. She rested her now bare foot on the side of her boot, sweat running down the inside of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot covered the top of her knee high boot and the light dimmed until you could hardly see anything. You awaited your fate again, knowing it was going to be so much worse than before. Very slowly, Yuffie eased her foot into the boot. You could hear the rustle of her bare foot against the leather of her tall boot and you could just about make out her shiny bare foot making its way towards you. You cringed and knelt down as it rubbed against you. You recoiled from the disgusting touch of her soft, stinky feet, but there was nowhere to do and you couldn't do anything but think of anywhere you'd rather be as her foot nestled into the bottom of the boot with a loud squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were squashed between her feet and the sole of her boot. It didn't hurt that much, thanks to the protect materia, but you felt awful all the same. Yuffie wiggled her toes again, causing you to slither between them as sweat poured from her feet and covered you all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it get any worse than this?</span></div></div>",

You tried to get a grip on her middle toe but the crazy amount of sweat prevented it and you slid down her silky sole towards the arch of her foot.

As you opened your mouth the salty liquid produced by Yuffies rank feet seeped onto your tastebuds, taking over your mouth. The smell was intoxicating and you felt as though you were being put under her spell. Yuffie started to wiggle her toes in her sleep providing somewhat of a full body massage for you as you started to become encased in a mixture of sock lint and newly formed toejam.

You'd been slaying monsters for about an hour now and you were working up a bit of a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand comes up to mop your damp brow as you slump against the still warm corpse of your kill.

It was your sword, but it was as big as a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the situation starts to sink in you hear, and feel, a titanic rumbling in the ground beneath you. You prepare yourself to fight another towering T-rexuar but as you turn round you see that a dinosaur is not the source of the ominous rumblings. Gazing up you see a field of yellow fabric, looking straight ahead you see two massive brown suede boots, ones that were heading ever closer towards you. You know this outfit, it was that energetic busybody, Selphie Tilmit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops for a few seconds looking around, her last titanic footfall knocking you over with the sheer force of the quake it caused.

A silky smooth, feminine voice purred out at you, before the black void was replaced... by a throne room. At the center sat an odd looking woman, wearing a skin-tight red gown with a plunging neckline that exposed her neck, chest, stomach and abdomen, and only partially obscuring her breasts. A black collar extended down the neckline to her waist, and long red sleeves with prominent shoulder pads joined with her purple taloned hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin is tattooed with lined patterns, and she's wearing a gold necklace, earrings and hair jewelry among a headdress designed to pull her hair up to resemble horns; silver bangs are left to frame her face. She also has yellow eyes surrounded by purple eyeshadow and she wears deep red lipstick. She has no eyebrows, instead having tattoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost oddly, she is not wearing shoes, completely barefoot, and although she has a human appearance, her toenails resemble a beast's claws. It's these toes that she bares, beckoning you forward. Unable to stop yourself, you move forward, slowly growing more aware that you are shrinking with every step you take, until you're the size of one of those toe claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets her foot down next to you, regarding you with a cold, callous stare. Her next word feels heavy, like it's lined with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately fall to your knees and press your face to her foot, licking away at the skin and flesh, moaning in sheer pleasure as you do. She smirks cruelly down at you and raises the foot out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ultimecia... you may call me 'Goddess'. I summoned you out of your time because...\" She steps her foot down on your legs, flattening them. \"I want you... to revere me.\" She purred, twisting her foot to turn your legs into jelly. You scream, only to be muffled as she places a toe on your mouth. Clicking her fingers, a greenish-blue light surrounds you, reconstructing your legs and killing the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd let you die just like that...? Oh no...

The path is really deep, and after you run for a while you realize you aren't hearing the storm anymore. In fact, you don't even seem to be on an alleyway anymore, or even in a city at all. Instead, you find yourself inside a ship of sorts. It's the Falcon, though you don't know that. You also notice the ship seems to be enormous, as if it was built for giants. In front of you there's a half-open door, so you enter to find yourself in a large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room, Celes was walking around, all alone \"I understand only four of us can go at a time... but why was I the one left out?\" She's mumbling like this when she sees you running across the ship. \"Halt! Who's there?\" Her voice catches you offward, and you turn around to see a enormous girl wearing only a blue bandanna, a white cape and a green one-piece bikini. Confused and stranged, you ignore her question and run away. \"You won't escape!\", she exclaims as she starts running after you. Naturally, being much faster than you, she easily closes the distance inbetween you two. Once she about half a meter away, she jumps and does a hip-drop on you. Her soft butt's full weight stops you on your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\" She pulls you from under her body and uses Cure on you, which makes you feel less \"crushed\". \"Now explain what are you doing here!\" You explain to her you just appeared out of nowhere and are a nice, defenseless guy. \"Oh.. so you mean no harm? Well, sorry for my Hip Drop before, I thought you were an intruder. My name is Celes, and I'm a former General of the Empire. My friends and I are gathering resources to fight the evil tyrant Kefka.\" You suddenly remember who she is, of course. You liked that game.

I'm sure the others will be alright with you, so let's wait fort hem... Though, now I think about it, they're gonna take a while. Want to come with me to a small cave near here? It has a relic that will boost my Runic abilities! Runic lets me absorb magic, so you know.\" How odd... you don't remember a Runic-boosting item... so you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Well, I'm going to pilot the Falcon, want to come with me?\" You nod \"Good, though... at your size, the wind might push you offboard, or a Dark Wind might grab you... I know! I'll put you inbetween my buttcheeks, that way my clothes and my body will protect you from the outside.\" Before you might have a chance to complain, she moves you to her behind, pulls her bustier's bottom a bit, shoves you in the space she created, and lets her clothes go, thus sealing you in her ass. \"Is it warm in there?\" she asks giggling. It is. She then runs to the Falcon's deck (shaking off your body wildly) and takes the ship's control. \"There we go!\"</span></div></div>",

Once there she lands the Falcon in front of the cave and gets off. \"Well, my new friend, it's time for dungeon exploring. Remember, hold to my butt at all times and you'll be safe from all enemies!\" PRRRRAFT! Celes accidentally lets out a fart after saying that. \"But you won't be my safe from by gas, apparently.\", she adds giggling. You cough and gag, not seeing what's so funny. since her fart stinks bad. \"Better smelling some farts than being killed, right?\" And with that (sadly, true) comment, Celes (and you) enter the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cave there's some light, but not a whole lot, though it's hard for you to tell from your hiding place. \"It's dark... hopefully there won't be many monsters around...\" And just when she comments that, a group of enemies appear. \"Uh-oh...\" Celes draws her sword and starts fighting the creatures, dodging her attacks with jumps and backflips, launching jumping slashes and running while she blasts them with Blizzard magic. Needless to say, all of this rocks your tiny body all over, her cheeks jiggling wildly and smacking you. Fortunately the battle is soon over. \"How's that? We win!\" She then uses Cure on you again (this time not even bothering to put you near to her, she just points to her ass) and says \"Sorry from all the movement from before, I'm used to fighting this way.\" You think to yourself she actually fights by standing in one place and swinging her weapon and casting spells, but whatever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that there aren't many encounters other than some weak critters, which Celes easily dispatches. Soon you two reach the cave's end, where a young woman is waiting. She looks about Celes' age and height, with long brown hair on a ponytail and wearing a cocktail dress. \"Welcome, mere mortal. I am holding the Rune Storage, a relic that allows a person to canalize the magic a Rune user absorbs and use it themselves. If you want to defeat me, you'll have to beat me in a duel...\" Celes starts unsheathing her sword again \"...of Butt Battling.\" Celes, confused,  sheathes her sword back and asks \"What's a Butt Battle?\" \"The rules are simple, we two start pressing our ass against each other until one of us falls to the ground. The girl standing left shall be the winner. If you lose, though, be ready for the worst...\" You are ready for the worst already, and that's justified when Celes says \"I'm in! Prepare yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls then turn around and put their asses against each other. You can feel the Guardian's butt squishing you against Celes', and it's at the same time wonderful and painful. \"Ready? Go!\", the fight starts! The Guardian starts pushing her butt very hard, your body being shoved into Celes' asscrack slightly. \"She's good... I can't lose!\" Celes doesn't gives up easily and pushes back, sending you off her crack. You hit the Guardian's rump and fall back where you started; this causes the Guardian to get distracted a few seconds, a chance Celes take to push harder, finally making her opponent fall down. \"Hooray, I win fair and square! Now give me the Rune Storage!\" \"Sheesh, you're good... Here, your relic! Come back anytime if you want a rematch!\" \"I will!\" You hope she doesn't. Celes takes the relic and uses warp to come back to the Falcon.</span></div></div>",

You only realized this, of course, because her butt was now above you. Her backside wasn't small for her size, so now it looked gigantic to you.

You tried to get off her butt, but it was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rosa keep her magic practice, trying a variety of spells, but none of the Minimum again, apparently having given up on getting it to work. After about half an hour of practicing, she considered herself to be done. \"Whew, I'm exhausted! I'll go take a shower and then I'll have breakfast.\", she mumbled while heading to the bathroom. Hearing that, you relaxed a bit, thinking she'd find you when taking off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom, Rosa started taking off her clothes, not that you could see much from your position. She dropped her bustier and walked to the shower, when she tripped on her own clothing. \"Whoops, that was a bit clumsy of me.\" Fortunately for her, she didn't fall down and was only caught a bit offguard. Unfortunately for you, this caused your whole body to end inside her asscrack, facing the outside. Despite her name, it didn't smell like roses in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa entered the (magic-powered) shower and started washing her body. You could hear the water running as you tried to get off her cheeks. Suddenly, her huge hand stopped in front of you, holding the soap. \"Is she going to wash me?\", you thought confused, but soon the answer came. From behind you. PRRRRRFFFFT! Rosa blew a strong fart that sent you out of her buttocks and into the soap, to which you hold quickly. \"Ugh! She looks sweet and demure, but her gas ranks bad!\". Not knowing you were there, she started rubbing the soap (and thus you) all over her rump. Since moving could mean falling off, you tried to stay as quiet as possible, even though it was hard because of her quick hand movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being finished with her butt, Rosa decided to take a look at her soapy hand. And then she FINALLY saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in here?\" She asked sweetly? She didn't seem angry, just confused, so you told her about your sudden appearance and your adventures in her butt. \"I see... well, I'd love to unshrink you, but I've never got Minimum to work... until now, apparently. So until I can't get it to work for sure, you'll have to stay this size. Don't worry, you can stay with me! But in exchange, you'll have to help me in ways only you can.\" She said winking. You liked that wink, a little. \"Well, my friend, now that you helped me clean my butt, you can now help me to wash...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naturally, you accept, because you're a good guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'm gonna lay down so it's easier for you.\", and that she did, while she was carefully holding you in her hands, \"There we go. You can start anytime\", she added while placing you on her chest. You smile and start washing her front carefully, rubbing the soap (and yourself) all over her cleavage, carefully caressing her breasts and her nipples, until you're done. She giggles and says \"I like your cleaning. Want to become my official Bath Helper?\" You smile and nod your head fast, obviously liking the idea. \"Good boy! You cleaned my breasts well, so let me clean you.\" she then picks you up and washes you like a doll, making sure you're properly cleaned. \"There, you now look much better. I'm done washing, so let's get out!\". Rosa gets out of the bathtub-shower and helps you get out as well, she then wraps her body with a towel, then puts you in her butt, her towel keeping you from falling. \"Sorry, haven't got any pockets\", she explains smiling. You don't mind because you like her ass as long it's not crushing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa heads off to her room, wiggling her butt on the way. Once there she takes off her towel, dropping you on the bed. She then puts on a bustier similar to the one from before, only this one is light brown and covers her backside a bit better. \"Do I look good on this?\" You say she looks lovely. \"Good. Then I'm all set!\" She makes breakfast and you two eat it \"You need very little to be full, which is an advantage of being shrunk, I suppose\", she mumbles smiling. \"I have to go shopping now, for food and arrows, so you'll have to come with me, if you want.\" You do. \"Good, though... now that I think about it, you're nude... well, it's alright, nobody is going to see you anyway, since I'm going to carry you...</span></div></div>",

However there is no such risk down there.\" That sounds logical to you, so you accept. Plus once you get to her butt's \"fragrance\" it's not too bad in there, but it's still not the smell of roses. She picks you up, pulls her clothing's bottom a bit and then shoves you inside her crack, then lets her clothes return to their regular position. \"Comfy in there?\" You say you are. \"Perfect then, let's go!\" She takes her purse and goes off to Baron town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop are the various food shops. Despite the \"aroma\" in your position, you can still tell whenever the shop you two are in sells meat, fish, vegetables, or whatnot. You start thinking on the various (small) meals you're going to have with your new girl-friend and smile. However, thanks to this distraction you don't realize Rosa's ass is heading down until you hit ground and her cheeks start squishing you (Fortunately Protes still works).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was sitting down on a park bench, tired from all the shopping. \"I'm exhausted, thank goodness I found a place to sit on... Wait... Sit on... !!\" She then remembers you were in her butt and quickly gets up, pulling you from her clothes. \"Are you fine?\" she asks, you say you're alright but that caught you for surprise. \"Sorry, I kinda forgot about you. I'm not used to carrying someone in my butt.\" she says smiling at you. You can't be angry with such a cute girl, so you forgive her for this time. \"Thank you! Now get back in my asscrack, we still have to buy arrows for my archery training!\". And with that, Rosa shoves you in her behind just like before, takes her goods, and goes off to the armory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, Rosa picks the arrows she'll buy. \"Okay, that will be 500 Gil\", the clerk says. Rosa takes her purse and starts looking for her money. Once she's done, she hands the money to the clerk, but a coin falls down. \"Oops. I'll pick it up.\" she then bends over to grab it,which you can tell by how the butt moves around you. What you weren't able to tell was that bending over would cause Rosa to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRRRRRFFFFFAAAAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she just farted in a public place, Rosa turns bright red, picks up the coin, gives it to the (trying to not to laugh her ass off) clerk, takes her arrows, and runs off without even getting her change back. Only once she's two stores away she realizes you were in her butt the whole time. After checking no one is around, she quickly places her stuff on the ground and pulls you out again. The fart smelt quite bad and you had passed out. \"Sorrysorrysorry!\", she exclaims while quickly chanting Cura on you, waking you up. You see you're on her hands and realize what just happened. \"Forgive me, I was unable to hold that fart in and... well... excuse me!\" Since she looks kinda sad, you forgive her again and even say it didn't smell all that bad. She smiles and kisses you in your face. \"Thanks, cutie! You're so sweet! Want to go again in my buttcrack?\" Naturally, you accept. This time nothing uneventful happens and you two make it back home safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in home, you have a delicious meal. When you're done, Rosa decides to look for a way to help you get your size back.</span></div></div>",

Maybe she knows a way to solve all of this!\" Rosa quickly looked through her stuff until she found a Talking Stone, which allow two far-away people to chat anytime. \"Rydia? Can you hear me now?\" \"Oh, Rosa, what's up?\" \"I had some problems when trying a magic spell and... Well... It'll be best if you watch it for yourself. I'm in my room.\" \"Alright, here I go!\" And mere seconds after saying that, she appeared on Rosa's room, just like that. You seem rather surprised at seeing her popping out of nowhere. \"Warp Magic\", Rosa explains to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what happened?\" Rosa shows you to Rydia \"I accidentally used Minimum on this guy, it somehow worked, and now I can't dispel it off.\" Rydia looks at you during the explanation. Rydia, like Rosa, wears basically a one-piece/bustier, only green, like her hair. \"Minimum, huh? Rosa, you know that's White Magic, and my specialty is Black Magic. However, I'll try helping you.\" After saying that, Rydia started drawing a hexagon-like figure on the ground. \"What's that for?\" Rosa asks. \"Part of a ritual for dispelling spells.\" After a few minutes, she was done drawing the strange picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Rydia turned to Rosa and asked \"Now could you strip and lay face-down on the ground, right where I drew the Ritual Polygon? Don't worry, the Polygon keeps the ground warm.\" \"D-Do I really have to be nude?\" \"Yes.\" \"Alright...\" Rosa then took off her clothes again, letting you look at her nice figure with a bit more peace. She then laid down as said. \"Well done, Rosa. Now, you guy, stay here and don't move no matter what.\" Rydia said while picking you up and placing you laying on Rosa's butt, only face-up. \"And now for the last part...\" Rydia then proceeded to strip herself, showing off her lovely body as well. \"This might hurt...\" and right after saying that, she turned her back to you, and sat down on Rosa's butt, with you in middle, crushing you inbetween both asses, which felt wonderfully squishy but also really hurt. \"Now what, Rydia?\" \"We must wait for one hour without moving.\" You almost fainted when you heard that. ONE HOUR? But so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed. Not doing anything for an hour is boring, but doing so with two girls' butts crushing you is even worse. After 18 minutes, something that broke the monotony happened: Rydia farted. BRRRRAP! \"Sorry\", was her only comment. She may be sorry, but the one bearing with the awful stench was you. At minute 32, Rosa farted as well. FRRRRT! \"I am really gassy today\", she said, and you agreed. The tip of the iceberg was minute 46, where both girls managed to fart at the same time. BRRRPRRRAPRRT!! \"Excuse us!\", they even said at the same time too. You mumbled something along the lines of \"It's on purpose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a hour passed... but you were still small. Why?</span></div></div>",

Sorry, guys, I thought he would have fun like this, I know I did, but seems I was mistaken. Can you two forgive me?\" \"I'm not angry, Rydia. You're still my friend, right?\" The two girls hugged sweetly. You were a bit angry she had lied to you, but the ritual wasn't as bad as you made it out to be. So you forgive her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, both of you! Now, I can't help you guy get your size back, but I can give you this.\" She then gave you a ring, though with your size you had to wear it like a tiara. Very manly. \"This is the Iron Body Ring. As long you're wearing it, your body will stand being crushed by any weight, any at all. This way you two won't have to worry anymore for accidental crushing.\" You liked the sound of that, so you thanked her for that gift. \"Rydia, since you came, would you like to sleep here tonight? Just the three of us, it'll be fun!\" \"I like the idea, I'm in!\" You like it too, since Rydia is really cute, and her ass smells a bit better than Rosa's (Not that either smells like roses.)</span></div></div>",

So I'm putting the rules down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No one liners. Entries should be at least four sentences.<br>\r\n-Don't tipe liek th1s. n0b0dy lieks et, 0k4y?<br>\r\n-This is purely a GTS story. No male interaction, unless the other males are shrunk too.<br>\r\n-Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A special thanks to Machan for adding so much in such a short period of time. Your work is well appreciated!</td>",
