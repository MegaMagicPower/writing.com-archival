You walk down to the common area. It's a room near the lobby, on the ground floor with a bunch of chairs, couches, and tables where students could study and socialize. You'd never been in it much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Where do you think you left it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I dunno, just look around,\" she says. You look at all the tabletops and find the keys. Oddly, they're emitting a dull green light. At the touch, they feel cold. You turn around. \"Found them,\" You say. \"Thank you so much,\" she says, and grabs them. As she does it, you could swear you see somebody else in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Little did you know it, but you and Eva are about to swap bodies!

As expected your parents are still not home, your mother has gone out with some of her new made friends and your father is working late. \"Just as expected.\" You murmur as you make your way to your room. Not knowing what to do you decide to make your homework but after ten minutes you decide you aren't in the mood for it. You surf the web to kill some time, but in the end decide to go to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in your bed you just hope tomorrow will be a different day. You close your eyes and go to sleep not knowing your wish would come true. It's at one minute past midnight when you suddenly feel like you're being pulled by this invisible force. You try to move back but the tugging force keeps getting stronger and suddenly you feel yourself being lifted up in the sky. Not knowing any dream to begin like this you decide to open up your eyes. The next moment you see the wall of your room heading your way. You want to pull back, but the force still keeps tugging you. You close your eyes again and hope the impact doesn't kill you, but when you expect to hit the wall nothing happens. You open your eyes again and see to your surprise you're actually floating in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You let out as you can see you're flying above your neighborhood. What is this? Some kind of dream you're a ghost. But strangely enough you cannot control to where you're flying. It's like you're being drawn to something. In fact you notice from the way you're flying you're headed to the university. From all the places in the world you didn't want to go there (much more preferring the bedroom of some hot girl). When you're near the university you suddenly feel yourself changing course, now heading towards the girl's dormitory. But suddenly you're seeing something, something or someone is coming out of a window and heading your way. You want to look up, but your head is locked into this position. You fly through the window and into a room. You can see there are two people sleeping inside the room, each one sleeping inside a bed on the opposite sides of the room. Weird thing however is that you're drawn to one of these girls. Suddenly you get this bad feeling, like something from a horror script. You try to move away, but you seem to be stuck. It's only that when you're an inch away from the person, you can see it's a familiar looking girl. Who it is however, you can't say as you black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next morning you can hear an alarm clock going. You immediately reach for it and put it to snooze. Weird thing though is that you didn't set your alarm. You don't have any classes in the morning. Something feels wrong. You open your eyes and to your surprise you're not in your room anymore. This room looks unfamiliar to you, though there is a ring of familiarity to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to lye up in your bed when you notice a weird sensation coming from your chest. Looking down you can see someone put a pair of balloons inside a unfamiliar black t-shirt. \"What the.\" You let out. Your voice sounds different as well. Somehow this doesn't feel right. You notice a mirror hanging on one of the walls. You step outside of bed and ran over to it, or should you say stumble more likely. There is a weird pull of gravity you're feeling. Looking in the mirror you confirm your worst fear, as your reflection displays the shocked expression of Eva, the girl you met yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react?</span></div></div>",

You could say that in fact they are so desperate for me to start dating if they found you \"sorry me\" sat like this they would invite me to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Then a thought hit you) look Eva can i ask you something, \"yeah sure Jake\" what is it?

It was Kaylee Blue, the most popular and beautiful girl of the whole school. <br>\r\n\"I should think so!\" She retaliated angrily. \"Do you have any idea how much this outfit cost. More than what you can afford that's for sure.\" Looking at her you noticed her black and white striped crop top with skinny jeans and designer heeled sandals. It must have cost a fortune. Ofcourse you weren't surprised as her Dad worked in the oil industry and her Mom was a world famous model. \"Next time you better watch where you walk otherwise I won't be as nice to you!\" After apologising again you begin to walk off in shock over her rudeness. Under her breath she says \"What a complete jerk does he not realise who I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did either of the two notice the gothic girl, Eva Samuels, watching in the corner. She had witnessed the whole event taking place. Like you she was a victim of Kaylee and her rudeness. However nobody knew that she was secretly a witch. She felt it was time that Kaylee should be mistreated like how you were. Leaving the building she headed towards her common room muttering an incantation along the way.<br>\r\n\"Goddesses of Eden swap thee<br>\r\nJack Gates and Kaylee Blue<br>\r\nTonight as they fall into deep slumber<br>\r\nLet her live his poor bland life<br>\r\nAnd him as her fantastic glamorous life<br>\r\nBut make it so only Jack knows of his time as he<br>\r\nLet me enter his dreams to decree the change!\"</span></div></div>",

This had started after accidentally walking into Kaylee Blue at school earlier today. Thinking nothing of it you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere Kaylee Blue was removing her makeup in preparation for bed. Her designer top ruined after the hot drink was spilt on it. Annoying yes but she had others similar to it. She was not overly concerned for it. As time passed with it becoming increasingly later she found herself fall asleep in her expensive silk pyjamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both slept the Incantation began to take effect. Both individual souls were taken out of their own bodies and placed into the others. It was a quick and painless process. Kaylee's memories were rewritten to that of Jack's. She would have no recollection of her past life as a girl. It would be as if she had lived the whole of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand were a different case altogether. As mentioned in the incantation Eva Samuels appeared in your dream. \"Do not be afraid Jack.\" She said. \"Today I witnessed what happened with you and Kaylee Blue. This behaviour is unacceptable in my understanding. She deserves to be punished for her actions. As such I have performed an advanced body swap spell on the two of you. She will not remember her life as a girl instead she will think that she was always you. Yourself on the otherhand will retain past memories in your new life. I hope that you will give her as much grief as possible.\"<br>\r\n\"But why me I don't understand I'm nothing special!\" You returned.<br>\r\n\"On the contrary Jack as a human of pure heart you were the most suitable candidate for the incantation to work\" said proclaimed \"this process needed someone with a victimised experience  in order to work.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok but what is in it for me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"You will have the life of luxury that you have always dreamed of. With rich parents, lavish lifestyle,  expensive clothes, beautiful looks and popularity with new friends this is what you have deep down always wanted.\" Eva returned pleasantly.<br>\r\n\"I'm not a girl though! How will I know what to do?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n\"Do not fear about this, I have provided you with a female instinct in your new life that will help with matters like fashion and applying make up. Now it is almost time to wake up. I must go now as I have other spells to attend to. If you have any issues come speak to me at school. I will assist you in any way possible. Enjoy your new life as 'Kaylee Blue' haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final statement she was gone. Your new life as a girl was about to begin!</span></div></div>",

But there was one thing Jack couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off. His breasts. Kaylee always had the biggest breasts in his school. He cupped the left one with his hand and squeezed. He felt and great amount of pleasure and continued to by grabbing his ass. Deep down, this is what he wanted.

You, of course, were miserable, having to go on a six hour drive to a new town, leaving behind your friends and the great life you had. You were at least happy to get out of the car, as your family had been driving you crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your mom, Linda, was a chubby, 45 year old woman who had singlehandedly raised her three children. She was a hard worker, and always kept her chin up, but was very stressed out. She was a plump woman with visible age on her face and body. She had hair that extended only barely past her face, and wore glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your 12 year old sister, Maddy, was a geeky girl who was obsessed with anime and nerdy stuff like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. She had an unkempt mane of chestnut hair, a small, stocky build, and wore glasses. She was only 12, so her body was still developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your 8 year old sister, Emma, was the definition of \"girly\". She was cute and hyper, always had a missing tooth or two, and was very thin. She had long brown hair and freckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Emma excitedly ran into the house before anybody else, and then shouted, \"Mommy, what's this?\" The rest of the family walked into the house to find out what she was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In the middle of the house, was a large machine with two pods. There was a note attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Dear Gates family,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   My name is Professor James Gardner, and I have spent years working on this invention of mine. You may find this hard to believe, but it is capable of swapping people's bodies. I have decided to leave it to you as I am old and have no use for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   -Professor Gardner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wow! Neato!\" exclaimed your mom, \"Hey, kids. Can I just say something crazy? I think that we should use this, and then destroy it! A new body to go along with our new house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes yes yes!\" exclaimed Emma, \"I wanna be big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That sounds interesting,\" said Maddy, \"It reminds me of this manga I read...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Uh, no way! No offense, but I don't really want to be any of you guys.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, sorry, but we took a vote,\" mom said, and it's three to one. So, let's put our names in a cup and that's how we'll decide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I couldn't believe we were actually going through with this. But it was impossible to change my mom's mind. So soon enough, we were picking names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Jack, why don't you choose first?\" suggested mom. Grimacing, I reached into the cup and pulled out a name. I looked at it to discover whose body I would live in for the rest of my life.</span></div></div>",

I was going to be stuck inside my mom's body. I would turn into a woman double my age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom, can't you swap with someone else?\" I begged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack honey, we all agreed to it. Cheer up, it's not going to be that bad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom could say that easily, she would be able to relive her teenage years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing I could do about it, mom was still in charge of us. So the four of us headed to the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took a look in the instruction manual and told us that you only needed to pull the big red lever to swap. She gave Maddy the order to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced by my own family I stepped inside a pod while my mom stepped inside the other. For the last moment I looked at my body, before Maddy pulled the switch.</span></div></div>",

I was sucked up into the air and for a moment I was just floating in the air, just before I was sucked into a tube. It happened in a second as I was flying in the tube, I saw so many things. I saw my mom and Maddy standing in front of the machine watching what would happen and then there was Emma who was in the same tube as me. It happened fast, but I believed Emma arrived in my pod faster than I did in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrived in Emma's pod and automatically entered Emma's body. There was a flash and the next moment the pod door in front me opened. I felt rather dizzy and I was wobbly when I exited the pod. I fell upon the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack is that you?\" Maddy asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me.\" I dreaded this moment. I looked up and saw Maddy standing in front of me. She was much taller than me. I looked at the right and there I saw my body standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy it worked.\" Emma was jumping up and down excitedly. It was a terrible voice, Emma was used to speaking with a high tone and it didn't work with my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it did, but I don't think you should call me mommy anymore. Mom is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...mom\" Emma giggled as she jumped up and down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\" I mumbled as I looked at myself. I felt my longer hair resting on my shoulders. When I looked down, I could see the t-shirt and skirt Emma was wearing before. I realized something else too, I quickly put my tiny hands on my crotch and felt my member missing. Instead I felt the soft fabric of my panties. I quickly moved my hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now me and Maddy will swap.\" Mom told us. \"Jack could you pull that lever when we get inside?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as I made my way to the lever, but I was blocked by Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She meant me of course. You're little Emma now.\" Emma looked at me with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as Mom and Maggy stepped inside their pods...</span></div></div>",

I'm mom now!\" exclaimed Maddy. \"I'm young again!\" Mom exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" asked Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, we should start calling each other by our new names.

I was Emma now. \"Jack\" walked out for a minute and came back with the sledgehammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smash away!\" said mom in Marsh's body. I wanted to cry as my only means of getting back to my old body was destroyed in front of me, but refused to act as a little girl would. I let out a whimper as the machine was crushed to a rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's all get used to our new lives!\" exclaimed mom, who was now Maddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma, bedtime!\" said Maddy on mom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's only seven thirty!\" I exclaimed in the voice of a whiny little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help her,\" said mom in Maddy's body. She grabbed my hand and brought me up to my new room. It was pink and girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy\" walked over to my new dresser and pulled out some pink pajamas. \"But these on, Emma.\" She said. Begrudgingly, I stripped out of Emma's pink t shirt and skirt to get changed into the PJ's. My new body was so tiny, my legs and arms were like sticks. My bellybutton was also now an outie, but that was the least of my concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to brush your teeth,\" said Maddy. I walked to the bathroom and picked up my toothbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, silly goose! You have to use your new toothbrush!\" I looked at Emma's old, pink toothbrush. I didn't really want to put the toothbrush that an eight year old had been using for six months, but then again, I was in possession of the mouth it had been in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stuck the toothbrush in my mouth and brushed, then spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, good night,\" said Maddy, and tucked me into bed. She turned the lights off and left. I was left alone with my thoughts. I kept feeling around my tiny body. My skin was so much softer, and without my muscles, my arms felt so squishy. Having long hair was an itchy mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She was just an average student just like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom (or Maddy) was really proud (or at least I thought) when I told her I was going to the next grade. Mom her looks had completely changed as to before the swap. She let her hair grow longer, she would wear different clothes and she would occasional buy manga or anime stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy wasn't the same either. She was more cheerful lately, she would experiment with different hair styles, dressing more like a teenage girl. Still, she was there for us, and would always listen to us whenever we needed someone to tell our stories to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I haven't told about Emma's life. She was still the same hyper active girl as always. At school of course she had to act like me, but when she came home she would turn into her former behavior. I was still a little resentful at Emma for having my body and my life, but things were okay between us. She got along with the rest of my friends, even making a couple of new ones (all of them girls). But unlike me the swap didn't affect her brain. She still knew everything I knew, and in class she got the same grades I did. These things were weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got home again, I saw my mom and Maddy and in front of the car, waiting for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um where are you going?\" I asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to buy some new clothes, want to go with us?\" Mom asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure.\" I said hesitant.

It's nothing like I haven't seen before, you know.\" Emily replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just odd you looking at me like that.\" I tell her while pulling my shirt over my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you've been avoiding me lately?\" Emily asks serious. I pull on the legging and my skirt as I try to think of an answer. \"Perhaps, yes. I mean, don't you find it odd to stare at your old body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily just shakes her head. \"Not really, I think you're doing great. I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I ask surprised. Emily and me haven't talked a lot lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, I would never guess you're that smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's the only thing that I have left of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Do you miss your old body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think how about I should put it. \"Yes, Em, I do.\" The tears suddenly begin to drop. \"I miss being myself, okay, I miss being a boy. I miss standing around to pee, I miss my old friends, I miss not being able to kiss a girl when I want it, and I miss being tall!\" I let myself fall to the ground as the tears drop to the floor. I just wish this was some dream, where I could wake up. But no I'm stuck like this a lifetime, my whole miserable live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a thing, Emily bows down towards me, grabs me, sits down on my bed and lets me cry on her shoulder. Emily just holds me and doesn't say a thing, she just lets me cry as I pour my heart out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm finished I look up at her, she's been crying too. \"I also miss being myself Jack. I don't want to be a boy anymore. I just want to be an eight year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have each other, right? Between the two of us we don't have to pretend to be someone else. I can be an eighteen year old boy and you can be an eight year old girl\" I try to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can. I'm so happy Jack.\" Emily gives me a big bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em, you might want to let go, you're almost killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm still not used to this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I'm glad it's you Em.\" I admit. \"Wouldn't want mom or Maddy to have it. Can you imagine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean mom looking like you telling us to do our homework, or Maddy who would lock herself in her room all day making you gain even more weight?\" We both laugh at that. For the first time since we swapped I could laugh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Em. I really need that.\" I tell her rubbing the tears of joy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Jack. You know perhaps we should have a moment like this every day, just being able to be ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\" I give her another hug and then she goes off to her room. I feel much better now, and I know that if something is bugging me, I can always talk to Emily now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>BEEP BEEP BEEP. The alarm clock goes on like that until you hit the snooze button. The sound immediately stops as you open your eyes. You have to go to school today, not something you look forward to. You step out of your bed and make your way to the bathroom. Automatically your eyes are drawn to Emma's room, or better said her old room. Now it is the place where your mom makes her cosplay outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way into the bathroom as you look at yourself in the mirror. It's been four years now since you swapped with Emma. A lot has changed since that day. No longer were you the man in house and the oldest (except for your mom of course). Now you were a typical teenage girl. The reflection in the mirror confirms it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at you is Emma's old body, or rather your body now. It's strange how familiar your body is to you now. Your big eyes and your big front row teeth and your short brown hair. Whenever you look at your hair, it makes you feel proud inside. Your mother begged and pleaded not to cut it. But thanks to Emily Maddy finally agreed to it. Thinking about Emma makes you feel a bit sad. Emily was a second year college student now. She had to move away. When you think about the day that Emily left you, you can almost feel the tears coming back to you. You never expected it to be that terrible, how you hugged Emily goodbye letting your hands go through her longer hair. But things are good for her now. She's doing great at college and she even has a boyfriend. At first it shocked you, the thought about your body making love with another man. But then Emma convinced you that this was for the better, she could never be herself with another girl (even though she's popular with the girls). In her mind she will always be a girl. The same counts for you. You're a twenty-two year old guy in the body of a girl. Your preferences have never changed of the years, it's just that you never felt a physical attraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shake your head. What are you thinking about? You have school to go to. You pull the tank top off, looking at your reflection with pride. While it took some time, your boobs are finally developing. They are not much to look at now, but in a few years they will grow bigger. You're sure of it! And then you hope you can finally indulge yourself in some exploration. Although you hope that it makes up for the disadvantages of growing into a woman. A few weeks ago you got to enjoy the first of your monthly pain. How sick you felt that day, never wanting to leave your bed. Hopefully it won't be as that bad in the future it. You pull of your panties and take a quick shower. After you're done you quickly leave the bedroom before your sister could walk in. Or your old mother Linda as she once was called. She looked nothing like her old body. Your mother changed your sister's identity completely. While at first she was weak and stocky, she now definitely had some assets to be proud of. Particular her tall legs and her big eyes which she uses to charm every boy she comes across. Not only the boys loved her, the camera loves her too. She could get selected to be a model if she keeps up her appearance. That is, if she doesn't get wasted at every party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk inside your bedroom and quickly pull a training bra out of your wardrobe and some panties. It's summertime so you decide on a t-shirt with some skinny jeans. Nothing special. You walk downstairs where you find your mom standing. An even bigger change underwent your sister Maddy. While at first it seemed nothing special, soon Maddy found out why mom switched with her. The responsibilities at work, preparing food and the uncontrollable eating frenzy's. That soon changed with Maddy inside your mom. While at first Maddy seemed to break down, you and Emma talked a lot with Maddy. She missed her old life, but there was no way to change that. The only thing she could change were her circumstances. So she decided no more uncontrollable eating frenzy's. You could hear your sister as your mom wail in the beginning as she had such desires but she kept resisting it. Now she has a nice figure. Besides that Maddy now designs and makes her own cosplay costumes. What started as a joke from you, soon turned out to be daily thing. She even managed to sell some of her costumes. The downside was that you and your sister now had to model sometimes for your mom. The pro was that it earned you some extra pocket money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy was reading some documents for work. She already made your breakfast ready, an apple and a slice of bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maddy.\" You say as you sit down. While your old mom would call you with your body's name you, Maddy and Emily still call yourself by your own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack. Good night sleep?\" She asks while still reading through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was okay. How about you?\" You ask interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so good. I was still busy with adjusting costumes I lost track of time. I crept in my bed at half past one.\" Maddy said yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good Maddy, you need your daily rest especially now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, in case you haven't noticed I'm the oldest one around here.\" Ouch, since Maddy became your mother she was more talkative than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't have said that, I'm sorry Jack.\" Maddy said rubbing her temples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm just worried about you Maddy. Doing your normal job and making these costumes takes a lot of energy. I just don't want to see you getting overworked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know but it's so much fun to do and besides the money isn't that bad either.\" Maddy grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddy! You're not thinking about what I think you think?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so boring at the office, sure it's nicer than mom's older position but still.\" Maddy was frowning as she looked through the last few pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can talk about this later. I need to catch the bus.\" You say standing up and looking at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can also bring you with the car.\" Maddy suggests. </span></div></div>",

And if something is bothering you, you can always talk about it with me or Emma.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thanks Jack. I appreciate it.\" Maddy says a bit embarrassed. If she wouldn't look as your mom, you would almost say it was Maddy all over. It was the exact posture she usually would have. You get over to her quickly and give her a hug. \"Nothing to worry, we're family. And I'll always be your big brother, no matter how I look.\" You say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister looks up and smiles a little too. \"Not that I'm complaining yet, but aren't you going to miss your bus?\" She asks with a curious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the clock and see you only have a few more minutes. \"Oh no. I'll have to go now. We'll talk later okay.\" You tell Maddy before you rush out the door and to the nearest bus stop. Sprinting as Emma still sucks in comparison to your old body but you manage to get there just as the busdriver wants to leave. Luckily he sees your charming smile and opens the door so you can get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time try to be on time.\" The driver says looking straight forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Ted, but thanks.\" You tell the driver as you make your way to the back. You come across a few of your classmates, but most of them ignore you. You're not really popular in your class, most people still don't understand how such a charming, talkative girl like you manage to keep up with them (not knowing you have done the same material already). You only have a couple of friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Em. Come sit next to us.\" Yuki says enthusiastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Meg says in her monotone voice as she notices you. You make your way to the back of the bus and sit in between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki and Meg are two of your friends. You know Yuki for two years and Meg for almost a year now. It's curious how the three of you seem to get along. Especially Yuki and Meg since they're the opposite of each other. Yuki has Japanese origins but has spend most of her life here. She's only an inch taller than you, has long black hair, a cute face and is fascinated with the color...pink. She's crazy about it, her entire room is pink and she preferably wears pink clothes. She also wants to dye her hair pink, but her parents have decided against it. She does have a pink wig in her room, but she isn't allowed to wear it outside. Nevertheless she remains a cheerful, preppy girl who can't wait until she can live on her own and paint her hair pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg on the other hand is the opposite of Yuki. Meg is more quieter, keeps most of the time to herself. She has long brown hair which she tries to use so nobody notices her. She's taller than you and how should you put it a bit big according to the other girls (after all considering your new height most people are bigger than you). You don't think it's true, she has a little meat on her but what gives? If you were still a guy you would find her more attractive than those other bamboo sticks in your class. Still, it does make her stand out and as a result she's mostly ignored by the other girls in class. If it weren't for you and Yuki she wouldn't talk with anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for today?\" You ask with the usual excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Yuki nods her head. Meg just nods her head as she looks outside the window. You make small talk with Yuki and try to talk with Meg. After a while the bus arrives at your school and you step outside with a spring in your step. You can't wait until class begins. </span></div></div>",

Have to stay healthy.\" You say with a fake smile on your face. You hated salads when you were a boy, but since you were in Emma's body they didn't taste that bad. If only for the fact that the lunch lady even made a salad tasting worse, without doing something with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that, you're as thin as a branch.\" Yuki comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but just the same I try to eat healthy.\" You say taking your first bite of the salad.

She's lucky you're the only one who notices it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class is over you and Meg step on the bus and wave goodbye to Yuki who is being picked up by her mom. You and Meg sit in the back of the bus, nobody else is sitting next to you. While Meg is staring out the window you take a look at your phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Meg suddenly asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask looking up.

You both walk out and head over to a nearby street. Meg then enters a small looking house with you following behind her. \"Watch your step.\" She warns you and when you step inside the house you find it looks rather dirty. \"Mom works day- and nightshifts so she doesn't have much time to do housework.\" Meg tells you as she notices your stares. She then enters a room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, awesome!\" You tell Meg. She has a collection of some video games posters on the wall that you like, couple of Cd's you used to listen to as well and she has a nice television set. Meg motions you to sit on the bed as the television is opposite from it. She then bends over to grab some DVDs. While being bend forward you notice Meg's underwear, a pink thong.

The school can provide one...mhm... no, free of charge...\" She rambled on for minutes, as I shrunk smaller and smaller into the comfy armchair that I was too small for. I dreaded having to see a therapist, because I wasn't even lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mrs. Meagle hung up. \"Your mother says you just have an overactive imagination, so I won't be putting you in therapy.

It wouldn't be too bad, and could certainly be worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to the classroom, only to find it empty. It was lunchtime. I went to the cafeteria and sat down with some of the other girls in Emma's class. I couldn't bring myself to pay attention to what they were talking to, because even I required a certain level of intellectuality in my conversations. I found myself drifting off to daydreaming. I thought about my favorite Disney princesses, and... wait, what? I hadn't thought about Disney movies in years, however I knew Emma loved them. Was I becoming more like her, or was this all in my head? If I was becoming more like her, this whole thing would probably become more bearable. Being an eight year old girl is easier when you have the mind of one. However, I was also scared. I didn't want to lose who I really was, and if I was becoming more like Emma, did that mean I was becoming less like myself? The prospect of completely giving in and becoming my second grade sister in body and mind was alarming, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my hands. They were so small, and my arms were squishy little twigs. I couldn't wait to get older, back to at least high school. I couldn't believe I would have to wait years until I could drive again. And the idea of going through elementary school and junior high again made me want to throw up. It was horrible the first time, but again? And as a girl? Hopefully I would grow up to be pretty, so I would at least be popular. That would make it easier for sure.</span></div></div>",

Life as Emma seemed more natural now, and although I really did miss my old body (who was now in college) I had two great best friends, Kayla and Alexis, and I was growing up to be a beautiful young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd just recently had my first period, something I never thought I'd experience.  I couldn't believe I'd have to put up with these for the rest of my life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was November, and I was enjoying sixth grade so far. I finally had a cell phone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the girl's bathroom, I looked at my reflection and thought back... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis body seemed so much more natural to me now. I had become more like Emma over the years, and whereas in my old body I was quiet and more reserved, as Emma I was an energetic, talkative, chatty (and slightly annoying) twelve year old girl. I had big eyes and big front teeth. My brown hair went down to about my shoulders. I had become quite a girly girl, but still remembered and wished for the days when I was a guy. I might be a twelve year old girl on the outside, but deep inside, there was a twenty one year old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said my best friend Alexis as I walked out of the bathroom. \"Hi,\" I said, and we hugged. Alexis was the first friend I'd made after the swap. She was my BFF, and was so pretty! She looked older than twelve, with a body that was already developing. She already wore real bras, not just training bras. A lot of girls were jealous of the way she looked. I had to admit that I was too. Kayla, my other BFF walked up. I met Kayla in fifth grade, bacause we were in the same class. The two of us had become inseperable. Kayla looked more like her age, just like I did. She had blonde hair that was a little shorter than mine, and was taller than most girls our age. She was very athletic. He smiled at me and walked next to me. We had first perio</span></div></div>",

Firstly, you aren't in the street of your neighborhood anymore. You're in a bedroom that you've never seen before. The room was well furnished and the people who lived here seemed to be well off. However, a much more strange and drastic change was how your body now felt. Your hair felt much longer and you felt it touch your shoulders and neck. You also felt some weight on your upper chest and a void between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down a see you are wearing a woman's nightie! Not only that, but you also seem to be fitting into it very well. You notice breasts poking through the nightie you're wearing. In a state of shock you slowly bring your new hands to feel them. You think to yourself that they can't be real and that this is impossible. Then you notice your hands also look much different. They are much more slender and feminine looking with well manicured nails. You feel your new breasts and can't deny anymore that they are real and that they are yours. You squeeze them a little and felt sensations that you've never experienced before. \"Woah,\" you say. Noticing that your voice now sounded more mature and more feminine too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the mirror in the bathroom connected to the room and see your new self for the first time. You see an attractive woman with dark hair in the mirror.

You wave to your reflection and the woman does the same. You play with your new hair and the woman does the same. You then take off the nightie you're wearing and throw it on the bed. Your reflection does the same. You see yourself in nothing but a bra and panties for the first time. \"So this is really me now.\" you say to yourself. You remember the amulet and the voice. \"It was that amulet!\" you say to yourself. \"It stole my body and put me in this woman's body. I have to find my body or the amulet. Maybe there is some way to reverse this. I can't be a woman! Especially not one twenty years older than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

You headed back upstairs and knocked on her bedroom door.<br>\r\n\"Come in, just doing my makeup,\" she yells through the door. <br>\r\nAs you enter you see her in the adjoining bathroom leaning over the sink so that she can't see you in her peripheral. You greedily check her out, she's wearing 3 inch wedge heels, a floral sundress and has her hair in curls. The dress hangs off her but in a very pleasant way and you admire her smooth legs.<br>\r\n\"Hey.. Um.. Alexa?\" You Start, trying your best to snap yourself back on task,\"I was just reading this weird box of candy, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to do an experiment with me?\" At this she turned from the mirror and looked at you, her well maintained eyebrows furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Experiment? Did you want to do the mentos in coke thing? Because I can tell you exactly what'll happen kiddo.\" She laughs retiring her attention to the mirror.<br>\r\n\"No actually the box claims these candies can swap peoples bodies.\" I managed, realizing I felt quite silly for bringing this to her.<br>\r\n\"Swap bodies? Ha that's a good one Jack, thought you actually wanted something for a second there.\" She mocked, blowing herself a kiss in the mirror before tidying up her makeup and walking out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Well ya I dont really believe it either, but I figured hey, what's the harm and giving it a shot. If it's crap candy we can just spit it out haha.\" <br>\r\nAt this she looked at me with yet more confusion.<br>\r\n\"Well alright, if you want me to eat this candy so badly I guess I'll try some, worst case I get to enjoy youth for a bit right?\" She said that last part in a rather sarcastic tone and we laughed a bit together.<br>\r\n\"Ya, and worst case I'll be an attractive older woman for a bit.\" We shared another chuckle but I felt myself start to blush at the thought \"Anyway each package contains two candies, one for each participant.\" She nodded along still with a comical grin on her face. \"I brought to packages, just in case we dont care for the results.\" <br>\r\n\"Ya ya just hurry and give me my piece smarty pants.\" she moaned, half grabbing the candy from me and sticking it in her mouth. \"Mmm blueberry.\" She hummed.<br>\r\nI took my piece as well and got the same blueberry flavor. But almost as soon as it touched my tounge I felt a wave of vertigo, and from Alexa's face I would tell she felt the same thing. I half stumbled half fell into her,and we both stumbled together falling back on the king sized bed, my head nestled between her soft breasts. Then all sensation seemed lost to me, except of course the taste of blueberry candy.<br>\r\nAfter a severe spinning sensation subsided I could again feel, and bright light filled my visage. My eyes struggled to open, as if I'd just woken up from a long sleep. As I gathered myself I noticed I was having trouble breathing, and as my sight returned I saw the top of a male head rested on my chest, but the head seemed to be pushing mg pecks apart in a strange way and they hurt abnormally. Then I recalled the candies, and was stormed with the sensations of my exposed legs and big wedges strapped to my feet. I struggled to get my former body off of me, but with my new strength I had to use more than a little effort to shimmy out from under 'him'. I quickly tried to stand up to nearly fall flat on my face, adjusting to my new shoes poorly. Looking down at these clunky shoes, though they did make Alexa's... Or I guess... my legs... look great.<br>\r\nWhilst admiring my new legs, I couldn't help but be distracted by the big round lumps of flesh no protruding from my chest. I cupped them with both hands and found they were defiantly more than these hands could hold, though passingly I supposed a man's hand might be able to get a better grip of them. Shaking that thought I started hefting my new breasts, feeling their fatty liquidy mass shift beneath my skin was so alien, so strange, so pleasant. I continued fondling my new breasts when I began to feel strange, like my crotch was getting warmer.<br>\r\n\"Ugh god why's it so bright in here?\" I let out an involuntary yelp, more of a girlish scream really, as the male voice boomed from behind me. Gosh being female was different.<br>\r\nI carefully turned on my elevated shoes to see my own body picking itself off the bed and blinking groggily.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my voice.\" Alexa croaked in my baritone, making it sound slightly whiny as she tried to reach her normal pitch. As she stood a look of shock and rememberence passed her... Or.. His face as the consequences of his now flat shoes and his new voice dawned on him.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\" He breathed,  using one hand to grasp his new equipment, and the other to feel his flat chest. after a few more moments of contemplation and groping, he turned to me eyes wide \"Jack...Is that you?\" His voice lacking its timbur.<br>\r\n\"Ya it's me... That is you right Alexa?\" I squeeked, my new voice shocking me still.</span></div></div>",

Dfferent,\" he says, rubbing his hands across his toned chest.<br>\r\n\"Ya... definitely different.\" I agree, cupping my breast again in either hand, the material of my bra brushing against my nipples, causing my breathes to deepen and the resurgence of that heat between my legs.<br>\r\nAlexa's new face takes on a look of concern, and then shifts his gaze to me saying \"I think I have to pee.\" He remains seated, looking at me with curiosity \"Do you mind if I...\" He hints, gesturing to the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Oh um no go ahead.\" I respond on impulse, wondering why that wasn't a more difficult decision. \"Don't forget to aim,\" I add lamely as he smirks and walks to the bathroom, his steps heavy and unsure of his new balance.<br>\r\nWhile the sounds of water hitting linoleum echoed from the side room, I found my curiosity got the better of me. With the heat still eminatting from between my legs, I bent at the knees and fiddled with the straps on these sexy platform sandals, and after several attempts I decided to suck it up and learn to walk like this.<br>\r\nA flush came from the bathrom, but the door remained shut. I wasn't as concerned with that however, as i was with checking myself out. With great concentration and balance I found myself sauntering over to the full length mirror in the corner of the room.<br>\r\nDrinking in my new reflection,I swirled my hip back and forth, watching my skirt flurry in the process. Withmy new manicured fingers I pull up the hem of my skirt and see my panties, and faintly, the outline of my womanhood.<br>\r\nI glance over at the bathroom door, still shut tight. Alexa must have either made a mess, or taken a few liberties. No matter, I return my attention to my beautiful reflection. with one hand still grasping my skirt, I use the other to hook the side of my panties, and begin tugging them downwards. Once past my lovely thighs they drop with little effort, collapsing around my heeled feet. Bending at the knees I remove my panties entirely, a tricky maneuver in these heels and my limited experience. I stand again, putting my panties in the hand clutching my skirt, as my other hand rubs my pussy. The heat from earlier had been persistent, but now my rubbing has evoked a much stronger flame, I feel my fingers getting wet in their efforts. With bravery, I delve  a moist finger beyond the brim of my slit, and slide it in as fas I can. I watched in the mirror as my hot step mom fingers herself in front of me. My body now screams for more, and I slide a second finger inside my slit, in and out, in and out. God she is so sexy.. Wait no... I am so sexy. Look at me, I'm a hot &amp; horny MILF. with this my hand finds new urgency, and begins working caster and faster, my vaginal muscles gripping tightly around my manicured digits. I feel amazing, I am Alexa and I love it. By now my legs are weak and I find I'm leaning against the beg frame, my dress no pulled up and is tucked beneath my chin and I'm moaning, my now free hand massaging my clit.<br>\r\nThus went on and on just climbing until with a load womanly moan I crested the hill and rode it down. The stories about women having multiple orgasms must be true, but as I debated going for it I heard a masculine grunt from the bathroom, followed by flushing. He'd been masturbating, to my moans no less, If I wasn't beet red before I was now. removing my soaking fingers from play and dropping my dress I looked around for how to dry my hands. In a bit of panic I began licking my own juices from myself, finger after finger, and then wiping the saliva on the bottom side of the bed sheets. No sooner than I'd regained my composure, Alexa exited the bathroom. He looked over at me, before going to wash his hands, \"This is awkward...wouldn't you say?\" He asks, also beet red. I realized my blushing must not be as bad, since I'm wearing a coat of makeup.<br>\r\n I look down sheepishly, noticing the panties lying on the floor, and swiftly I kick them under the bed, \"ya.... I'm kinda embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" he dried his hands and walked over to me, standing close, too close maybe?.<br>\r\n\"I suppose you'll want to switch back now right?' I asked dejected.<br>\r\n\"Why....do you?\" His question. surprised me and look away from his sculpted chest to meet his gaze.<br>\r\n\"Um.... Well... I'm in no hurry really.\" I sheepishly answer, sounding very feminine and submissive. What's wrong with me?<br>\r\n\"Well... I was thinking... Maybe we could stay this way, at least until your... Husband gets home tonight.\" He said, looking hopeful<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean sure, that's good with me.\" I respond, notably overeager, making him smile.<br>\r\n\"How about we hang out for a while then, we can watch some TV together?\" He asks, his smile convincing me.<br>\r\n\"ya sure... But ummm... First.... I need to wash my hands.\" I Managed to say, walkung around him into the bathrrom turning beat red again as laughed. While hands in the sink I see he's still standing there looking at me. Is he checking me out?<br>\r\nAs if reading my thoughts he says, \"I'll umm see you down there. Dont take too long or I'll come looking.\" he joked as he walked out. Looking in the bathroom mirror I see my reflection, the reflection of Alexa the MILF. This should be an interesting afternoon.</span></div></div>",

I'd been sitting with my legs crossed, trying still to conceal the fact I wasn't wearing panties. Alexa started sitting as conservatively, but as time went on his legs became akimbo, enjoying the freedom pants and masculinity provided. <br>\r\nI've been trying to ignore the pressure on my new bladder, but eventually I had to give in.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna run to the ladies room real quick.\" I said, getting up and adjusting the hem of my skirt. Alexa eyed me with a grin<br>\r\n\"Ladies room? Don't forget to touch up your makeup doll face.\" He joked as I walked away.<br>\r\n\"Haha\" I mock laughed, looking over my shoulder to see him snap his head back to the TV. Giving his joke no thought I entered the bathroom and locked the door. I put the lid down on the toilet, before lifting my skirt and sit down. After flexing a few different muscles in my be there I found the release I needed to pee. This was way different than with a dick. The stream ended and I felt much better. i remember to wipe, front to back, drying up my lips. I flush, smooth out my skirt and again admire my reflection as I wash my hands. I blow my reflection a kiss and once again feel the heat rising between my legs. <br>\r\nI snap myself out of it and leave the bathroom. as i walk back to the living room a though occurs to me, this might be a good time to go put my panties back on. I peak into the living room and see my former body on the phone, Alexa's phone to be exact. He doesn't notice me so I quickly run upstairs, or as close to run as I can get in these heels. I retrieve my crumpled panties from beneath the bed and replace them about my hips. Returning to living room I see Alexa is no longer on the phone, and he turns his head to you as you enter the room.<br>\r\nHe smiles awkwardly and says \"So it appears your husband isn't coming home tonight Alexa.\" <br>\r\nYou were a bit taken aback but not exactly surprised. Your Hus...er..Father was always being called away to last minute weekend business trips. \"Oh that's too bad.\" You say honestly.<br>\r\nAlexa continues to look at you expectantly. He takes the hint you aren't getting it and says \"so way I see it we have to options. Either we switch back tonight or wait until your husband returns home like we said.\"<br>\r\nOh i get it now. We can either spend another couple hours as each other or the whole weekend, seeing as it's Friday night and dad won't be back until Monday at earliest. The look in Alexa's eye already shows what he wants and you couldnt agree more.</span></div></div>",

You look around confused and notice the only person in the room was your Math teacher Mrs Flanny. She wasn't a model but she was still very generally pretty. You always admired her personality even though everyone mistakes her sarcasm as blandness. You approach the desk and she is still busy at work, her head down and grading tests. \"Mrs Flanny?\" You say out loud but she doesn't hear you. You take a step back and realize what has happened \"That ghost stole my body, so I guess I'm the gh--ghost now\" You say, you start to panic. You expect your heart to beat faster but feel nothing in this ghostly form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a pull towards Mrs Flanny, it's uncontrollable and strong. You try to fly away and resist but the force is impossible to rebel. You try to escape but you only get dragged closer and closer to Mrs Flanny. You begin to brace yourself for some type of impact as you draw closer to her and closer to her. You eventually collide straight into her and for a second everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and suddenly feel the air against your skin. You realize the fact that you are in human form but the only thing you remember is Mrs Flanny and being dragged closer and closer to her... Suddenly a string of brown hair falls across your face. It's soft and you don't recognize it and lift your hand up to inspect it but the hand you see is not yours. The hand inspecting the hair was slender and soft. You stare at your new hand and examine it, still pretty confused you begin to realize what has happened. You look down to see yourself sitting down, but it wasn't you. It was Mrs Flanny... Well, you were Mrs Flanny. You notice her comfortable black pants and baggy white shirt, she did like to dress comfortable. You also notice the two massive mounds of flesh on her, now your, chest. She may not have been the skinniest but she did have a fantastically large rack. Your hand move to your face as you feel the new softness and delicacy of your new face. You now realized that you were Mrs Flanny. This sudden realization took time to kick in and as you were touching your face you scream in panic, only to have your voice sound exactly like Mrs Flanny. You stop and turn as you hear the door swing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ralph, the school janitor. \"Mrs Flanny, excuse me but I never knew you were in on a Saturday... I heard a scream is everything okay?\" ...</span></div></div>",

It was weird talking and not hearing your own voice come out of your mouth. You clear your throat and continue \"Maybe, it was perhaps from next door\" you say realizing it was a bad excuse. Ralph just smiled at you and said \"Oh, Okay Mrs Flanny. It's just that when a girl as pretty as you might be danger it's kinda instinct to go investigating\". He leaned on the door frame and continue to smile at you... Was he flirting with you? The idea was pretty funny but kind of grossed you out. It was flattering in a weird way though. You shake your head out and can only muster a confused giggle \"Uh, Thank you Mr Macheo.\" You smiled a warm smile at him, you knew what it was like to compliment a girl and you admired his bravery. He smiled back and didn't seem to be going anywhere, you didn't know what to do so you looked back at your table and saw the pile of tests on your desk. You stared at them hoping for him to go away when you heard \"So, ah, what you doing today?\" come from Ralph. You closed your eyes and cringed. The idea that his janitor was asking him out was creepy enough and weird in so many ways. You looked to your side and saw Mrs Flanny's bag. You looked back at Ralph who was still smiling \"Oh, nothing--nothing at all. In fact I'm going to uh--- go home now. Tired as hell\" you say picking up her bag and trying to escape the room. You smile at Ralph one last time and squeezed past him to get out of the classroom. You didn't look back and just kept on walking, The feeling of your new breasts moving up and down as you walked distracted you but you eventually found your way to the parking lot. You pressed unlock on her keys and found her car parked in her space near the pool. You get in and close the door. You take a deep breathe in and look in the rear view mirror to inspect your new face, You come into eye contact with your new eyes and kind of jump, you stare at yourself and begin to make faces and get used to your new reflection. You put the keys in the ignition and decide...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You sat in the car and stared at the ignition wondering where to go. Home wasn't an option, you couldn't explain this and you felt like it would be destroying a unique opportunity. You decided that a hotel was best, it was anonymous, you were an adult now and it gave you a quiet place to figure out what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start Mrs Flanny car and breath a sigh of relief to find out it wasn't stick. You slowly made your way out of the school grounds and onto Main street. You had a basic idea where the nearest hotel was and you headed there. It's weird driving as a woman, you haven't adapted to your new body and your breasts always seem so apparent. Not to mention the fact that you could notice the emptiness between your legs. You noticed that your crotch was different, even when driving. You stop at a red light and look down, you take a quick look to remind yourself who you are. The realization that you're an adult woman was actually rather exciting and put a smirk on your face. You began to become very excited at the prospect of being alone in a room by yourself, you could feel your heart rate beat faster and your stomach become hollow with anticipation. You may have a body of an adult woman but you still had the mind of a teenage boy, a very curious and perverted mind. You kind of giggled at the thought of it all and finally became grateful for your situation. You could worry about all the other stuff later, you just wanted a day to yourself as Mrs Flanny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the hotel and walk to the front desk. Your womanly form becoming more and more noticeable when you walked, it made you smile with glee. Your heart was racing as you reached the front desk, you were so excited and you could barely contain yourself. You stood at the front desk and got the attention of the pretty receptionist. She smiled at you and moved her chair towards the counter.<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss, how can we help you?\" She said politely. You look at her, but your mind is lost in thought and excitement. Also the way she greeted you wasn't something you've ever heard. \"Miss?\" She says again. You suddenly notice that she's addressing you and you snap back into reality <br>\r\n\"Oh---OH. Yes, yes, uh--- one room please\" You say smiling at your new voice. The lady then looked to her computer and typed something in.<br>\r\n\"What kind of Suite Madam?\" she asks. You didn't think of that, you didn't even know if Mrs Flanny had money on her. You peek into her handbag and notice she does have her purse. You look back tot he receptionist and stalled a little, you wanted a room but you didn't wanna make poor Mrs Flanny bankrupt. <br>\r\n\"Just---uh, give me something nice but not too fancy\" You say trying to sound adult and convincing. The lady smiles at you and goes back to her computer.<br>\r\n\"How long will you be staying with us?\" She asks. <br>\r\n\"One night---maybe two--- maybe three\" You say panicking a bit. <br>\r\n\"I'll just put indefinitely, we'll make a copy of your credit card and you can pay once you check out\" She says to you with a smile. You smile back, it's a great idea. The lady then hands you a room card and a brochure.<br>\r\n\"Your room is number 508, on the fifth floor madam. Thank you and enjoy your stay.\" She said with that glimmering smile of hers. Her respect towards you genuinely made you happy. You smiled back once more and said \"Thank you very much. You've been very---uh--- helpful\" You say trying to sound adult but genuine. The receptionist was very pretty and even in your new body you still admired her. You still saw her in a sexual light, which was a good sign. You look down at her name badge and see the name \"Maria\". You take your handbag and kind of awkwardly rush towards the elevator. You didn't want to run but your excitement was getting the better of you. The elevator comes and takes you to the the fifth floor, you exit in a hurry and rush around looking for your room. Your breasts bouncing as you jogged, which only excited you more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually found the door and opened it. Your room was simple and neat. It has a double bed, a decent TV, a full length mirror next to the TV facing the bed and a bathroom which was tiny. It was suitable and homey. You drop her handbag on the tiny table near the door and close the door behind. As soon as the door shuts you smile. You jump around excited and squeal with delight. You were finally alone. You...   </span></div></div>",

He was a great guy and you only got to see him once a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey Jack, it looks like Uncle Charlie left you something,\" your mom said, handing you an envelope.

Also, you should keep the power as secret as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go up to your sister and ask her first. She was sitting next to the snacks for the party, tipping something on her smartphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis.\" you said, a bit nervous.<br>\r\n\"Yo bro, what's up?\" she said, cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got along rather well with Brianna, but you weren't sure if she would agree on this. And the thought of being your own sister was kind of... strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um... there is actually something I would like to tell you. It's important to me, but you should keep it a secret, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, anything! Just tell me, dont't worry.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay... uhm... the letter that uncle Charlie left me... he told me that I can swap bodies with people. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, how silly! Uncle Charlie is quite the funny guy, isn't he.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah... but, uh.. he seemed kind of serious. And I...\"<br>\r\n\"... and you..?\"<br>\r\n\"I kind of wanted to try it. With you. Because you are a close relative. And, eh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"That is ridicolous, Jack. But okay, since you have birthday, I can try it with you. What could possibly go wrong.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you Brianna!\"<br>\r\n\"So then? Go on, try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've gotten really nervous at this point, but you tried to stay calm. You thought about yourself in a womans body, and it was arousing, you could feel the blood rushing trough your member, but you tried to control yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I will just try to think about it, maybe that will work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated on your sister. You were looking at her first, she was standing there, waiting, and you closed your eyes and tried to focus harder. When you almost wanted to give up, you finally felt your mind released, losing control of your body slowly, but quickly at the same time - you haven't even fully understood what was happening and you already were standing where your sister was previously. Your senses were overwhelmed with the new sensations of your new female body, the different height, figure, hair, gender, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" a familiar voice said stunned, \"We actually swapped bodies... no way...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly grabbed hold of yourself and slowly checked your body. You let your hands glide along your figure and shortly grabbed your crotch - your penis was gone for shure. The new sensaition of a vagina was very much to take up for now. The new weight of your breasts were also pretty obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, stop checking my body please...\" your sister said in an uneasy way with your voice.<br>\r\nYou quickly got your hands off yourself and put them into the pockets of the jacket Brianna was wearing.<br>\r\n\"U-Uh I am sorry, sis, but... but you are doing the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to your sister now, she was also checking your body, especially your crotch area. You could see she was very uncomfortable - probably because of the massive boner she had right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do now?</span></div></div>",

You continue to scroll down and down seeing many pictures but none that interest you. You are about to stop scrolling and go to another app when you see a video of a woman that catches your eye. She looks very pregnant and are assured at that assumption by the description of the video under it. It said she was 40 weeks and 8 days pregnant with twins. You decide to tap and watch the short video. You tap it and see the little video icon blink and just before it plays something weird happens. You feel an invisible figure come out of the phone and enter your body and your soul enters the phone directly to the video like it sucked you inwards. You blank out and dont know what is happening next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see you are standing with a new iphone in your hand. \"When did I get this?\" You think to yourself. You look and see that instagram is open and about to record a new video. You then look up from the phone and see a mirror and are shocked at your reflection. You see a soft, cute feminine face with long brown hair down to your shoulders. The biggest surprise is two swollen, lactating, milk filled DD cup boobs hanging from your smaller chest. Under those melons in a maternity bra is a ginormous pregnant belly. All of the weight in the front of your body feels so foreign and your center of gravity is so much different especially with thicker thighs and a bubble butt. You look at your reflection again and you realize that this body is the same from the video. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/IMG_1689_zpsurthfrmi.mp4\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>][IMG]<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625/bfine2525/Pregnant/th_IMG_1689_zpsurthfrmi.mp4\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1175.photobucket.com/albums/r625...</a>[/IMG][/URL]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel two kicks to the bladder, memories kick in.

He was searching the many ridiculous stories that were on the site. Suddenly a pop up appeared with a headline, \"Angelina Jolie pregnant with twins!\" It also had a picture of her extremely pregnant on the red carpet of some film festival in France. Jack tried to click the \"X\" to get out of the pop up story, but was for some reason lost looking at the eyes of Angelina Jolie. He suddenly dipped in and out of consciousness and then finally blacked out on his keyboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly woke up. He looked around and saw he was in what looked like a penthouse with what looks like a big master bedroom. He was laying in a rather large bed by himself. Long brown strands of hair fell in front of his eyes. His body felt off as all of his weight seemed to have shifted to the front of his body. He struggled to get up off the bed as he seemed to have lost all muscle. He finally pulled off the huge covers off of his body and was shocked about what he saw. He saw two GG cup boobs, swollen and milk filled, laying on top of an enormous pregnant belly. He felt two kicks hit his bladder as he finally was able to get up off the bed. He put his now small, more feminine hand on top of the huge belly. He waddled over to a mirror and saw a familiar feminine face. \"How did I become Angelina Jolie and when she is pregnant?\"He thought to himself. Memories hit him and he was now the 33 year old, 32 weeks pregnant with twins, Angelina Jolie. He also remembered that today was the start of the Cannes film festival and he would now be attending. He still also had memories of his life as Jack Gates, 16 year old boy. \"Man, Angelina put on a lot of weight since she got pregnant.\" He said to himself in his Angelina's voice. He again had the urge to put his hand on his belly as he waddled back to the bed. He sat at the edge of the bed and starred down at the huge belly. He felt kicks from the two babies in his belly and put his hand on the belly and slowly went across the flawless skin of the rather large belly and felt multiple kicks along the way as the babies seemed to be very active now that he was awake. He decided to get up  and see if he could put on some clothes to wear for the event that he needed to now attend as the very pregnant Angelina Jolie. He found a nice, long elegant maternity dress and put it on. He almost lost his balance due to the belly but was finally able to get it on. he looked in the mirror and fell in love with the dress and how it showed off the curve of her belly while not being tight.

How are the twins doing in there?\" Brad said and also asked as he weirdly, Jack thought, put his hand right on her pregnant belly. Jack answered him  kinda annoyed as he said, \" Well I feel huge right now and  really do not want to be in public. These two inside my belly are getting so annoying as they keep kicking while also making me eat the most fattening things.\" He again rested his more feminine hand on his pregnant belly to soothe the fury of kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

His breath reeked of liquor and he was holding an ornate bottle with a pure blue liquid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some dude outside gave it to me,\" said Mike, \"Said it's fire. Jack, you gotta try it, you haven't had anything all night. They say nobody's ever tried it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have some can we leave?\" I asked. Mike was my best friend, but he was always more of a risk-taker than me. He'd recently acquired some fake IDs for us and we were at a club. Mike had been trying to pick up girls all night, but I just wanted to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded drunkenly. I took the bottle and opened it, and glugged some of it down. It was surprisingly good, since I'd never really had any alcohol I liked. It made me feel weightless, and also gave me a weird tingling sensation that went through my body but then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it here,\" said Mike. He grabbed the bottle, but then dropped it and it shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" Mike exclaimed, \"Those guys told me not to use all of it... We're in some serious shit right now. Let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got out of the club and I drove Mike home. I then went home to a dark house. My family was asleep. I was surprised to find out it was almost 3 in the morning. I fell into bed and immediately fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up and got out of bed. And then I stayed hovering in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" I said, but no sound came out. I could hear it, in my mind. Then I noticed my body was still sleeping in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you had the drink, then?\" said a wispy female voice. I shouted and turned around to see a colorless girl also floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Annie,\" she said, \"Welcome to the astral world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The *what* world?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"The astral world. It means you're, I guess what you would call a ghost, except your body isn't dead. Just asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I get back into my body?\" I asked, examining my sleeping body and the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"You can, however, possess other people's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can become someone else but not myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Annie, \"I'm just here to help you. I've been in the astral world for a few years now... my parents think I'm just in a coma. When you're astral, you can't talk to physicals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I possess someone?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you are become a physical. You can talk and interact with the physical world, but not with astrals. And you can die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is insane,\" I said, trying to take in everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's a lot to take in,\" said Annie, \"But you can always possess somebody and live a normal life. Live any life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow THAT sounded pretty cool, I had to admit. Become someone rich or famous, live life as anybody else... I just had to find a place to start.</span></div></div>",

I was wearing a low-cute t-shirt that showed off much of this girl's cleavage, and yoga shorts. She definitely dressed like a slut.

The machine did what it should and Jack now was turned him into a girl. Average female, easy to blend in and hide. Name Sandra Henderson, 18 year old\u2026<br>\r\nJack awoke slowly, his whole body felt sore. As he sat up he saw long brown hair blocking his view. At first it was almost like a dream. He almost had forgotten about the procedure until it finally hit him....<br>\r\nAgent 21 guided the new girl to a huge full size mirror, where Jack saw a woman staring back at him<br>\r\nShe was fairly cute. Very good body shape and skin color. Average B-cup breasts, long brown wavy hair. While not a super model but by no means ugly. Jack wondered because his new body seemed like not 16, but much older, but maybe this was only imagination.<br>\r\nAgent21 handed him a pair of panties and bra which felt weird to put on.<br>\r\nShe asked if she needs help but she declined, first reason this was to embarrassing and the second reason was more important: She knew that this will be her body and cover or disguise for a while and she most properly needs to be able to put on a bra by herself!<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Sandra how do you feel?\u201d Agent 21 asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you calling me Sandra, I thought I will be Kelly?\u201d new Sandra asked a bit surprised at your new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is your new name. We had to decide on Sandra, Kelly\u2019s older sister to become your new identity. Once your body finishes adjusting we will meet and go over the details.\u201d 21 said.<br>\r\nNew Sandra nodded and now she knows why her body looked older than 16\u2026<br>\r\nBut the main obstacle or enterprise was and will be to adjust, because she is still kind of irritated from the new sensations she feels.<br>\r\nAgent 21 told to step over to the next room of the office lab: Sandra follows to see a kind of clothes store. Again in wonder Sandra stands there not knowing what to do actually. Agent 21 told to select something from here, since she can\u2019t wonder around in just underwear and most certainly she will not stay here forever.<br>\r\nIndeed Sandra became hungry somehow and thirsty as well. Agent 21 seems to be able to read minds and suggested to have some lunch after the difficult selection of wardrobe but she added, first time she appears human by making a joke: \u201cYou know girls don\u2019t have it easy to decide what they will wear!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes most properly and I never guessed that this will be my fate as well\u201d Sandra added sounding desperate and lost\u2026But she is a fighter and determined to survive in this body shell until the court will start to bring that criminal into prison!<br>\r\nShe took some jeans and top and it seems to be fine. Then looking at agent 21, who is also a rather attractive woman, getting the confirmation that this is acceptable.<br>\r\nShe seems to sense Sandra\u2019s feelings and told that she will help in the first stages of Sandra\u2019s new life and will start to advise whenever needed.<br>\r\nShe points out to some rack, where some nice dress is hanging on. \u201cAfter lunch you will try this one!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a joke?\u201d Sandra protested but she seems to be serious: \u201cBetter start now then later with these things\u201d she said and Sandra really feels even more lost now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the first moments the unisex jeans and top will do.\u2026<br>\r\nSo wearing a pair of hip hugger jeans along with a black fork fitting bra and tank top was your selection.<br>\r\nFor the tank top and the bra you have to notice that is was pretty tight especially around your boobs.<br>\r\nLastly you found a pair of sneakers and tossed them on. Taking a good look in the mirror you felt satisfied with the selected outfit. It was cute and not too much girly\u2026.<br>\r\nTime to leave the lab to the public cafeteria\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent21 was careful and told Sandra she should act like a proper lady. This might be a test but it is also real life and it will be important to blend in to be able to survive.<br>\r\nWhile in the elevator with Sandra, who definitely looked like an 18 year old girl, she was thinking how to avoid the most properly enemy agent47 and the other man in black suit\u2026.<br>\r\nOnce the door of elevator opens\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elaine Woodley had been my next door neighbor for my whole life. She was my mom's best friend, and was well liked by almost everyone in town. A mother of three, Elaine was a 48 year old, slightly chubby woman with red hair, glasses, and freckles covering almost every inch of her body. She had three children, a seventeen year old girl named Elisa, and two nine hear old twin boys named Mikey and Chris. She also had a husband, Jeff. I never thought she would be anything but my next door neighbor and my mom's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   My name was Jack Gates. I was seventeen. We still don't know why this happened and we probably never will. All we know is it's permanent, and if there was some way to reverse it, we would know. Besides, I'd grown attached to the children who were now mine after all these years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Let me start from the beginning. It was September, and I was just starting to get back into the groove of school. Elaine, or just Mrs. Woodley as I had called her back then, gave me a ride to school every morning with her daughter Elisa, who was my school friend. I had never really been anything more than cordial with Elaine, only a \"Thanks for the ride, Mrs. Woodley,\" every morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   School was just starting to become more like school. Tests, quizzes, and the likes were all piling up. I was walking into my house after a tough day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Howdy, Jack!\" Mrs. Woodley called from over the fence. I waved back. And in that moment, it happened. All of a sudden, I was looking at myself standing on my front steps -who, in turn, was frozen looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What the hell just happened?\" I asked out loud. Then I realized what had happened- I had just spoken in Mrs. Woodley's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Jack...\" said my body, \"Are you in there?\"</span></div></div>",

Why am I in your body?\" I exclaimed, looking at my aged, small hands, with nails painted red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mrs. Woodley, in my body, walked over. \"Come inside. We need to get this sorted out,\" she said. It was so strange looking up at myself, as I was a tall guy and Mrs. Woodley stood at a measley five foot three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With my strength, she grabbed me and pulled me into her house. \"Elisa's staying after today, so we're alone here for an hour,\" she said, \"Now... do you have any idea what's happened?\" She squinted at me. \"Did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hell no!\" I exclaimed, \"Uh, no offense, but I don't really want your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"None taken,\" she sighed. We were silent for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well then, what now?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She looked at me. \"I guess we're going to have to get used to this,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mrs. Woodley, you can't be just giving up!\" I exclaimed, hating the way I talked through the voice of a middle aged woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Do you have any idea what to do? Because I don't,\" she said. I sat down, feeling what was now my wide ass and hips spread onto the chair. I buried my face in my hands. \"I can't believe this is happening,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mrs. Woodley put a comforting hand on my back. \"We can get through this. Hey, you might even end up liking my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No offense, but I doubt it,\" I said, \"Does your back always ache like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She nodded, \"Unfortuantely, yes,\" she said, \"Just one of the perks of being a nearly fifty year old woman.\" I wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mrs. Woodley, I just can't do this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Um, honey, you should probably start calling me Jack. And get used to answering to Elaine,\" she said, adding, \"And mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey, look on the bright side,\" she said, \"No more homework!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Thanks for trying to make me feel better, Mrs.- er, Jack. I'm just not in the mood right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I guess I should go to my new home?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yeah, you should,\" I said miserably, \"And I'll stay in mine.\" With that, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I decided I might as well explore the house. I hadn't really gone over here very many times. I left the kitchen and walked upstairs. It was so odd walking with these super wide hips. And not to mention the emptiness between my fat legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Upstairs, I found a bathroom, the boy's room, and Elisa's room. I also found the room I would now be sharing with Jeff. I shuddered. I never thought I'd end up sleeping with a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   I looked at myself in the full-length mirror. I was realizing now just how unnatractive Elaine was. I'd never thought about her looks before, but now that I was inhabiting her body, I found that they weren't that great. I took her, well, my glasses off and found that I could hardly see without them. I shoved them back on my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly, I heard the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Mom, I'm home!\" called Elisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Coming... honey!\" I shouted. I walked downstairs and found that Elisa was taller than me now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Unlike her mother, Elisa was very pretty. I hoped she would never end up like this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"H-how was your day?\" I asked, taking her backpack and putting it in a closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hard. We had a pop quiz in chem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That sucks,\" I replied. I was surprised at how well I was imitating Elaine. All those mornings of listening to her and Elisa talking had prepared me well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess we're lab partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't talk. It was high school, and cliques didn't mix. I was perfectly okay with that; we didn't have anything in common, and she wasn't as hot as every other guy seemed to think. Sure, she had a great ass, but she just wasn't really anything above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanuary 4th. Not only was the earth at perihelion in accordance with the sun, but it was the first day in several months of sitting next to Brooke Tanner that I actually got to know her. And more well than I had ever wanted to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost guys in my school would kill for the opportunity to have complete access to Brooke Tanner's body, but after the incident, which we still don't know the cause of, I realized how much harder girls have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into class late and sat down next to Brooke. She was wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt and a black and white striped scarf. Black yoga pants adorned her legs, and on her feet were a stylish pair of brown leather boots. Her blonde hair was straightened, her legs crossed curtly, and her usual pair of glasses that she didn't need rested on her nose. Yeah, you read that right. She wore fake glasses for fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me as I sat down, but then didn't say anything. Our teacher, Mr. Ozlinton, droned on about the primary differences between rocks and minerals and when Eric Donahue pretended not to understand, Mr. Ozlinton kicked him out. The guy was a real hardass and a horrible teacher. To think, if I had just switched out at the beginning of the school year like everyone told me to, I could've probably avoided all of this. I probably never would've even met Brooke Tanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the lesson, Brooke raised her hand and asked to go to the bathroom. Mr. Ozlinton granted her request, and she nodded and walked lightly out of the room. About half the guys (and even one girl) turned to look at Brooke's perfect, yoga pants-clad butt as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I knew, I was standing in a bathroom stall holding what looked like a lightly giftwrapped item. I pushed my glasses up, and- wait, my glasses? What the hell was going on? I looked at my fingernails and saw that they were painted white, with the ring fingers each having little black dots on them. I opened the stall and walked cautiously up to the bathroom mirror, noticing there weren't any urinals in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at me was Brooke Tanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly screamed, but forced myself not to panic. Before anything else could happen, I felt a horrible pain shoot through my body. I grunted in pain, wondering just what the hell that was. Another wave of pain came, this one worse than the first. It seemed to be coming from the bottom of my, well, Brooke's stomach, under the naval. My eyes darted back to the giftwrapped item I was clutching with white knuckles. It wasn't any gift- it was a pad! Somehow, I'd been transported into Brooke's body- and she was on her period!</span></div></div>",

I walked out into the hall, only to find myself standing there. My old body now towered over my new one, which was five feet, four inches at most. My body walked up to me and whispered through grit teeth- \"What did you do to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened either! One moment, I'm sitting in Earth Science, the next I'm in the bathroom holding your period pads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down!\" Brooke whispered. A wave of pain shot through what was now my uterus, and I cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Jack? Did you put my pad on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" I said, \"And what the fuck, I had no idea that it hurt this much! I thought you hitched were just exaggerating!\" She crossed your arms over her chest. \"No, now you understand. And go put my pad on! I can't have you ruining my leggings!\" I stood in the hallway, barely registering what she said because of the pain. \"GO!\" she finally shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled back to the girl's bathroom, almost in tears. It felt like someone was repeatedly stabbing a knife into my belly. I went into one of the stalls and opened the pack of pads, which was crinkly and loud. I took one of the pads out, and pulled down the yoga pants. Brooke's panties were lavender and silk, with a little pink bow in front. I pulled the panties off to find an already bloodied pad resting there. It was disgusting getting it off of myself, to think girls put up with this for a week every month! The dried, dark blood on it made me retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced down at Brooke's hairless pussy before putting the fresh pad on. I didn't exactly want to become familiar with this body, and would start looking for a way out of it as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back out into the hall and Brooke in my body was standing there, arms crossed and tapping my foot impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't stand like that!\" I exclaimed, examining her pose, \"You're gonna make me look super gay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed. \"Well, if I can't find a way out of this body, that's what you'll be!\" \"You wouldn't dare!\" I exclaimed. \"Well then, would you go out with boys if you were stuck in my body?\" I looked at the smug expression she wore on my face. \"Fine. But it doesn't matter, because we're not going to be stuck in these bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body's eyes lit up. \"You have a way back to our own bodies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at Brooke's smaller feet. \"Well no...\" I said through Brooke's soft voice, \"But I'm sure we can figure out something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me condescendingly. \"We swapped for no reason. Our best hope is just another one of these random swaps happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that might never happen!\" I exclaimed. She rolled my eyes. \"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were silent, until I finally said, \"This sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not too happy about this either,\" Brooke said, \"I was perfectly happy with my body, thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"We've been out here too long. Ozlinton will start to wonder where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, for once,\" she said, \"Okay, you go back first, and I'll come back in a minute. It would look weird if we walked back in together.\" I nodded. \"Wait, why am I going back before you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first,\" she chuckled.</span></div></div>",

She was accompanied by Ben Everett, captain of the school's varsity football team, and a pretty girl with a heart shaped face that I'd seen before but never found out the name of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey,\" I said quietly, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Jackie, \"We're just making sure you can still come to Ben's party tonight!\" Ben smiled and put his arm around my shoulder as we walked. I knew Brooke and him weren't dating, but word on the street was that he liked her. Well, me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brooke, Ben towered over me at a massive six foot four. In my old body, i was six foot two, so he never seemed super tall. But now, i was realizing just how tall... and strangely, attractive, he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" I said, \"You bet your ass I can make it!\" I'd heard about Ben's party, but wasn't invited. All of Ben's parties were supposedly awesome, and it looked like being in this body finally had a perk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to get to economics. See you at the party!\" said Jackie, and they walked off. Strangely, I missed the company of Ben's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started walking back to lunch, when Brooke in my body came walking through the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at the library in five minutes,\" she whispered in my low voice. I nodded, and she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the cafeteria for about a minute, and then decided to go to the library. The library was the only air-conditioned and heated room in the whole school, so nobody actually went there to read, just to warm up or cool off. In the dead of winter, the library was at a toasty 63\u00b0 Fahrenheit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted Brooke sitting at one of the computers, with just Google open blankly on the screen. I walked over, and she said, \"Sit at that one. Don't make ot look like we're talking.\" I sat at my designated computer, Brooke's bubble butt squishing underneath me. Above all things, at least I always had a cushion where I went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing some research on body swapping,\" she said, my body's eyes still intently focused on the monitor. \"Don't look at me!\" she snapped. I looked at my blank computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One website said that your spirit is tied to the sun. And you know what today is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squinted my eye. \"Friday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you idiot!\" she exclaimed, \"It's January 4th!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her through the corner of my eye. Her eyes were still focused on the screen. \"You're not clearing things up for me, Brooke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Call me Jack while we're in school. And did you seriously not do the reading for earth science last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...skimmed.\" I admitted. She sighed and I could almost feel her roll my eyes. \"The earth is at perihelion today. We're closer to the sun today than we are any other day of the year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying the sun did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying anything,\" she said, \"I'm just saying it's our best lead right now.\" She looked at me. \"Hey! Why'd you take my glasses off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned. \"You're really focusing on something like your fake glasses right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let our an angry sigh. \"They're part of my look. Put them back on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't put them back on I'll tell your dad that I masturbate to granny porn!\" I looked at her, horrified. \"Tune, jeez.  I'll put your stupid glasses on.\" I reached into her backpack pocket and pulled the glasses out, and shoved them defiantly on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you need to learn how to be me for the time being. Jackie Vasquez is my best friend-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I talked to her already,\" I said. Brooke had a shocked expression. \"Did you tell her...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no,\" I said, \"She just asked me if u was going ti Ben Harrison's party, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what'd you say?\" she asked frantically. I glared. \"You didn't let me finish,\" I replied, \"I said yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, great. I completely forgot about the party. Oh my God, J- Brooke!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, concerned. \"You have to hook up with Ben!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" I asked back. \"It's all part of my plan for the rest of high school. Me and Ben are going to start dating, and eventually get married, and it all depends on tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" I said. She had my eyes go into puppy dog mode. \"Please do this. I'll owe you one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Fine. God damn it. Fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, under one condition,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'll do anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't go gay for anyone when you're in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" she said immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shook on it.</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't see Brooke again until Monday at the earliest, so I was in for a tough weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of Brooke's AP Enviro class and saw Jackie and the girl from before standing there. Jackie ran up and hugged me. It was a pleasurable feeling for our breasts to squish together, as both of us were hey well-endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Skye are going back to my house to get ready for the party,\" said Jackie. So the girl's name is Skye, I thought. \"You coming?\" asked Skye. I was reluctant to say yes, but I knew nothing about girl's fashion, or parties in general. So I accepted the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out to the commuter lot and to Jackie's shiny silver Mercedes. \"Whoa, awesome ride!\" I exclaimed. Jackie looked at me weirdly. \"Brooke, I've given you a ride to and from school every day this year in this car. Why the sudden interest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no reason,\" I said. I wanted to slap myself. If anyone found out about this secret, I'd be dead meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on the passenger side on sleek leather seats, with Jackie driving and Skye in the back. Skye turned on the radio to the douchiest station, which was blaring some Katy Perry hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Jackie, \"Tonight's the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What night?\" I asked dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" asked Skye, then looked at Jackie. \"Is she serious?\" Jackie looked at me. \"The night you finally hook up with Ben, retard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I'm really an idiot!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all you've been talking about for a month,\" said Skye, \"and suddenly *we* have to remind *you*?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl must be stoned,\" said Jackie. \"Yeah, what's up with you today?\" asked Skye. I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie's house was huge. It was in the richest district of town, which I should've figured out based on her car. I reminded myself not to marvel at the house for too long, because Brooke had been here hundreds of times, so I should act as of it's nothing new to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked in and I followed the two girls upstairs. I noticed Skye's amazing butt, it was almost as good as Brooke's. Almost. We followed Jackie into her room, and age immediately walked to the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Brooke, since it's your big night, we're going to focus on you all afternoon. I'm thinking something sexy, definitely can't go for too serious. Elegant but easy to rip off.\" She and Skye started giggling. I blushed and looked at Brooke's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" asked Brooke, holding up a short white cocktail dress. \"Go try it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing white,\" I said, \"I'm on my period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" exclaimed Jackie, \"Well, we'll find something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us tried on clothes for hours until we found the perfect outfit for me: a sleeveless purple button-up shirt and a black pencil skirt. I had to admit, it showed off Brooke's amazing figure incredibly well. Jackie did my hair and Skye did my makeup, and then it was off to the party.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was going down and the sky was dyed a beautiful deep purple hue. I'd never been to Ben's house, but you couldn't miss it. Cars were already lining the street and we heard the deep bass sounds of hip-hop music emanating from the spacious estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had barely stepped out of the car when Shawn Darter, another football player ran up and greeted me. \"Hey, Brooke, what's up?\" It was common knowlege around the school that Shawn got raging homers whenever he saw Brooke, and Brooke hated him. I acted as I knew Brooke would- with a crisp, \"Fuck off, Shawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn walked away, destroyed, and I had to admit it was fun having power over the guys who previously would've shoved my head into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe, Skye, and Jackie walked up to the house, and were greeted by Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in ladies, glad to see you!\" He smiled at me, and I smiled back. 'You're only doing this because Brooke needs you to,' I thought to myself, and walked into the party. Within a half hour, the house was packed, and I think some college kids even came. I noticed Shawn trailing me the whole time, so I went to the bathroom. It was about time to replace my pad anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unzipped my skirt, and pulled off the panties, and for the first time I got a clear view of Brooke's ass. It didn't disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly replaced my pad and put my clothes back on, and I was just about to leave when I noticed two guys looking in the window, one holding a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the window. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" I said, trying to sound intimidating, but it only came out in Brooke's singsong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys, Brett Dierden, laughed, and the other, who had the phone, bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett looked at me and started breathing heavily. I could smell the alcohol on his breath. \"Yo, the whole fuckin' school's gonna see your ass!\" he exclaimed in a slurred voice. I started to panic as he ran away. Brooke was going to kill me! I couldn't concentrate on that right now. My main concern was the Ben thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back out into the party to a room full of drunk teenagers. I remained completely sober, I couldn't compromise the mission. It took a few minutes before I found Ben. He drunkenly put his arm a little too tight around Brooke's delicate shoulder and snapped a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whassup, bitch?\" he said through slurred speech. I couldn't believe this was the guy Brooke wanted to get married to! Sure, he was totally hot, but- wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking up with Ben wasn't very hard. Within minutes, we were making out on the couch, and it seemed like the world vanished except for us. It was strange, I was almost... enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm doing this for Brooke, I told myself, but found myself starting to feel thorny. Ben put his hand up my skirt and started fingering me. I wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or he was just bad at it, but it felt like he was trying to get his guitar pick out of the hole of his guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was a blur, even though I wasn't drunk.</span></div></div>",

I didn't remember drinking last night, but I obviously must have from all this pounding kn my head. As the room came into focus, I recognized it as Jackie's room. Skye was sitting in the corner, looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got pretty wasted,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't,\" I said in a hoarse voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

Did we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure seemed like you were going to.\" I groaned and layer back down. So I'd just lost my virginity to a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Brooke? Isn't this all you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to remember it, that's all.\" I noticed Skye had gotten up from her chair and was sitting at the edge of the bed. She looked extremely sexy in a crop top and panties, and I had to admit I was getting aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you something to remember, if you want,\" she said. She leaned over and kissed me, then we started passionately making out. She reached down and fingered me, not how Ben had, but with finesse and confidence, and I started moaning. This went on for several minutes until I got too wet for her to adequately finger me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skye... that was amazing.\" All I heard in response was her breathing heavily. \"You always struck me as bi, Tanner.\"</span></div></div>",

She took out her phone and showed me her Twitter feed, with several of the boys in our grade having tweeted a grainy picture of a girls nude ass in a bathroom mirror through a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, that's me!\" I shouted, \"What the fuck? How did they get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got REALLY wasted last night,\" said Jackie, \"There's a video, too.\" She opened YouTube to a video called \"Psycho Bitch Blonde\", and it was Brooke, drunk, and yelling at the boys who must have taken the picture. Stuff I never would have thought of if I was sober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to cry. \"Aw, man, now the whole school's seen me naked!\" Jackie sat down next to me and put her arm over my shoulder. \"It doesn't matter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I fell asleep again and when I woke up, I was in a house I had never been to before. It took me a moment to register that this must be Brooke's house. I was in Brooke Tanner's bedroom! I looked around. Brooke really was a hipster, I thought to myself. Several posters of Lana Del Rey adorned the walls, along with posters for Bastille, Arctic Monkeys, and The 1975, which I could only assume were bands Brooke liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out of bed and realized I was in my underwear. I found Brooke's sleek white iPhone on the dresser, and turned it on. I had a missed call and a text from a number that I recognized as my own; it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet at Starbucks. 3 pm. Wear something presentable.\" I set the contact in as \"Jack Gates\", because as Brooke said, we would have to get used to calling each other by out body's names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened Brooke's drawer and pulled out a black Rolling Stones shirt ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.backstreetmerch.com/images/products/bands/clothing/rlst/bsi_rlst416.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.backstreetmerch.com/images...</a> ) and a pair of high waisted shorts ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=HN.607986456729553219&amp;pid=1.7\" target=\"_blank\">http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=HN.60798645...</a> ) I looked in the mirror after I put them on. Brooke was an attractive girl either way, but I knew she would expect me to wear makeup. I found her makeup kit and put on some light foundation and blush, and put on some sunglasses to avoid doing eye makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just about to leave the house when I realized I would need a purse; these shorts had fame pockets! Who the hell thought of that, I wondered. I grabbed one of Brooke's many purses, stuffed her wallet and a few pad, tampons, and some lipstick into it, and walked out to Brooke's car. While Brooke's car wasn't as nice as Jackie's Mercedes, her Nissan Altima still beat what Jack Gates had: nothing. I'd had my license for several months, and this was the first time I was actually putting my driving skills to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on the car and Brooke's phone automatically connected via bluetooth. A Lana Del Rey song called \"National Anthem\" started playing. I drove through Brooke's neighbourhood and realized I had no idea where in town this was; I took Brooke's phone and turned on the GPS. I was far from town, it looked like Brooke lived in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, although I had never listened to these artists before, Brooke's music taste was actually pretty good. As a guitar player, the main riff in the Arctic Monkey's \"Do I Wanna Know?\" was to die for, and I really dug The 1975's catchy song \"Girls\". A few more Lana songs passed by, which I wasn't really that into, but it was better than nothing. I eventually found my way to town after a twenty minute drive. I was about ten minutes late to Starbucks, and Brooke was already there, clad in a white t-shirt, jeans, and my body. I stepped daintily out of the car and she looked up at me. I sat down at the outdoor pavilion at the table she was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" I said, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed. \"At least you didn't dress TOO horribly.\" I smiled. \"Thanks, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me, right in the eyes. \"How did a picture of my butt get leaked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I really don't know. I hardly remember that entire night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was expecting her to be furious. \"Well, I guess that's your problem now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not once we swap back,\" I reminded her. She sighed and rolled my eyes. \"Don't you get it, Brooke? We can't swap back. I wish we could, but technically, body-swapping in the first place should have been impossible. What are the odds of it happening again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the website-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke, I found that website on the third page of search results. On Bing. It's about as factually sound as Kim Kardashian giving a sermon on quantum physics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Well we can't just give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Brooke,\" she said, \"But I already have. I've said goodbye to your body, and now it's time for you to say goodbye to yours. After this, we go our separate ways.\" I bowed my head and looked at my hands. These were my hands now. They were tiny and delicate, with painted nails. I had to say goodbye to my life of gaming, goodbye to all my friends, and hello to being a girl, and having periods and getting pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, \" I said, \"See you around, Jack.\"</span></div></div>",

I briefly stared at my girly hand, with my painted white nails, and then brought that same hand down back to the table. This whole interaction had happened so quickly that I had not even had a chance to get a coffee. I wondered if I would still like bitter drinks like flat whites, or if my tastes would change with Brooke's body. The idea that my sexual preferences seemed to be changing already left me <i>very</i> uneasy. The last thing I wanted was to lose more of myself to Brooke's natural bodily impulses. It struck me that this might be unavoidable, however, as I suddenly noticed that my legs were crossed in a feminine way and had been since I first sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was handling all of this awfully well. <i>Perhaps too well</i>.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'd always been on good terms with Katherine Mariet; a shy, small, slightly plump girl with straight brown hair and glasses, she was one of my few female friends. I wasn't attracted to her sexually, but I liked her nonetheless. Besides the occasional \"Hi, )\" in the hallway at school, we never really were anything other than friendly acquaintances. I never thought I'd get to know her as..  personally, for lack of a better word, as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine was in my English class. She didn't speak unless she was asked a question, and always spoke very softly. For this reason, I sat next to her so I could hear what she said, coupled with the fact that she let me copy off her during tests as an added bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was October 28th, and the school was in full Halloween mode. Every room was decorated with cheap and cheesy skeletons, pumpkins, and ghosts. It was a bumit ridiculous; we were juniors in high school, not kindergarteners!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was five minutes into English class when Katherine walked in. This was the first time she'd ever been late, as far as I could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm sorry,\" she stammered softly. Our teacher, Mrs. Garrity, smiled and said it was quite alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For today's assignment,\" said Mrs. Garrity, \"You'll be writing a scary story with your partner. Write about whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Whatever* we want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Shawn. You know what I mean,\" Mrs. Garrity snapped at the douchey football player Shawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Katherine. She was wearing a light blue sweater and a black and white striped scarf, with high-wasted white pants. \"What should we write about?\" I asked. Her eyes lit up. \"A story about a mad scientist who transplants human brains into animal bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" I said. And so we started our shirt story on Dr. Virgil Farnsworth, mad scientist and part-time hot tub salesman (since being a mad scientist was more of a pastime and didn't pay the bills).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was over before we knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can finish the story by myself,\" said Katherine. \"No, we should do it together. Call me later and we can talk,\" I said. She smiled. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 7:30 p.m., the sky was dark and lightning and thunder were cracking and booming. I was in my room, listening to the Smashing Pumpkins, when my phone started buzzing. I checked it, and read \"Katherine Mariet- Incoming Call\". I hit \"accept\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Katherine,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" said Katherine, \"You know how we left off at Dr. Farnsworth agreeing to put Kelly back into her normal, teenage girl body? I think Gordon, who's still trapped as a tiger, should jump out of the shadows and kill Dr. Farnsworth, leaving Kelly trapped in her gorilla body forever!\" I chuckled. \"You're a psycho!\" She was silent. \"I love it,\" I added. \"I'm glad,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you hear that?\" I asked, when I suddenly realized I wasn't speaking in my usual voice. \"Wait, what the hell just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Is that you?\" asked a familiar voice at the end of the line. It took a moment for me to realize it was my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah- Katherine?\" I asked, in a familiar stammery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack... I think we just swapped bodies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around. I definitely wasn't in my own room. I was in a rather plain Jane room with beige walls and an indented ceiling, sitting at a cluttered desk with the Harry Potter and A Song of Ice and Fire series scattered about. I was now wearing a light green tanktop, that showed off about b-cup cleavage that now belonged to me. I had long hair that was slightly wavy and wet. I seemed to be wearing contact lenses. I looked down and noticed I was wearing nothing but a pair of 'Lord of the Rings' panties, and had slightly chubby, hairless legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katherine, I'm you!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, this is uber-embarrassing,\" she said, \"I hoped nobody would ever see those LotR panties- and now a boy is wearing them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it's any consolation, I'm more concerned about my sudden lack of a dick than your nerdy panties,\" I said, perplexed by the sudden flatness of my crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a disaster,\" said Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck did this happen?\" I asked. \"Um, please don't swear in my body,\" said Katherine, \"My parents -your parents- don't allow me- you- to curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said through Katherine's voice, \"Now how do we switch back? Don't take this the wrong way, but I don't exactly wanna be you for the rest of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" said Katherine, \"I was only me for sixteen years and it was unbearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent for a moment, then said, \"Can you think of any way out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do some research, Jack. But for now, I'd get used to answering to Katherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed.  Well, this sucked. You were already a loser in your old body, but you'd always flown under the radar. Katherine was constantly bullied and picked on. You'd always felt bad for her, but you never thought that you would take on all of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Katherine, \"There's some stuff about body swaps occurring during the full moon- you don't need to look outside, it's not the full moon tonight- and really there's nothing with concrete evidence. It's possible that there's no reason we swapped bodies, Ja- uh, I mean Katherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying it doesn't look like we'll be able to switch back.\" she said glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I don't wanna be stuck as you!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get used to it. You never know, if the cause of our swap was nonexistent, we might also switch back for no reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wake me up when that happens,\" I said, and hung up.</span></div></div>",

I suddenly remembered everything that happened, that I was more than likely stuck in the body of Katherine Mariet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized I had to go to school as Katherine. I also realized I'd have to take a shower as her. I decided I may as well buts the bullet and shower now, as ot looked like this was my body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of Katherine's room and surveyed her house. I looked around the rooms until I found the bathroom, and sat down to take a piss. I sighed knowing I'd have to sit down to pee from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stripped off Katherine's clothes and looked at her naked. This was the first time I'd seen a naked girl that wasn't on my computer screen. She had smallish, asymmetrical breasts dotted with acne and a hairy, unshaven vagina. She actually had a half decent butt. I also noticed, on what were now Ny fat legs, thin, white scars that looked self-inflicted. All of a sudden, I felt really bad for Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI showered quickly and wrapped a towel over my body. I walked back to Katherine's room and picked out some clothes- a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt. I put on Katherine's glasses and tied her brown hair back. I was going as gender-neutral as possible today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came downstairs to find a handwritten note in scrawling handwriting-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKath- had to go to work early -xoxo, mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poured myself a bowl of raisin bran and ate barely any, then put the bowl in the sink and walked out to the bus</span></div></div>",

I texted her mine, and had a silent busride, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was really dreading school. I'd seen Brooke Tanner, one of the more popular girls, bully Katherine to tears and I didn't want to be on the recieving end of that. Then again, Katherine had put up with it for years, and I, her friend, had never said a word to stop any of it. Maybe I deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to Katherine's locker and realized I didn't know her combination. I tested her \"hey what's ur combo\", to which she replied six minutes later, \"17-34-6\". I opened the locker and took Katherine's history textbook and binder. In my old body, I would've been able to carry them no problem, but in Katherine's five foot three, weak and unfit body, it was a struggle. I made a mental note to start working out this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't make it to Mrs. Hennessy's history class, because Brooke Tanner was in my way, backed by her clique, Jackie Vasquez and Skye Wilhelm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, loser?\" asked Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-history,\" I stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you l-l-like it?\" Brooke asked, imitating Katherine's nervous stutter that I'd inherited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to walk away, but Skye, who was tall for a girl, blocked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see my six foot two old body walking down the hall. Katherine, in my body went up to Brooke and said, \"Leave her alone or face me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, we were just joking around, freak!\" said Jackie. The triad walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt... awesome,\" said Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hid, do you have to put up with that every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore,\" said Katherine, \"This swap is the best thing to happen to me!\" I looked up at her. A look of guilt spread across her face. \"Wow, I'm sorry Jack, but it's so much easier to not be bullied or be a total loser.\" I glared. \"I'm sorry!\" exclaimed Katherine as I stormed away.</span></div></div>",

There was no room for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around, but all the tables were full. I had seen Katherine sitting against one of the walls so that was what I did then. I silently ate my salad, not looking around me how everyone was taking looks at me. I was one of them before, I always wanted to invite Katherine to our spot but I never did. In a way I was now paying the price for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was finally done with my salad I noticed a pair of yoga-clad legs in front of me.

I felt tears welling up in my eyes, and noticed Katherine still sitting with my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little boyfriend won't wave you this time,\" said Brooke, \"He traded you for a higher social status- in a heartbeat, I should add.\" I felt betrayed. Katherine had just given up on me like that? The one other person who knew the daily struggle of being Katherine Mariet had left me alone to rot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fucking CRYING!\" shouted some guy with a shocked, yet impressed tone. Some of the female onlookers looked disapprovingly at Brooke, who just got mad and said \"Yeah, fucking whatever.\" Brooke walked away and the crowd disappated. A small, skinny pale girl with short brown hair was the only remainder of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" I asked angrily. She sat down next to me. \"A friend,\" she said, \"It's my first day here.\" I sat angrily, glancing over at her. She had a big nose and puffy eyes, and looked like a total loser. Like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Collette,\" she said. \"Ja-Katherine,\" I grunted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to help you clean up? I have a change of clothes in my car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not exactly friend material,\" I said, \"Being friends with me is just asking to be bullied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you need someone to help you through it,\" said Collette. I was silent. \"Look, if you ever need anybody to talk to, I'm here for you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just really don't wanna be here right now,\" I said. \"I can drive you home,\" she offered, to which I accepted. We walked out to Collette's car and I gave her directions to Katherine's house. She said goodbye and I thanked her hastily, walking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I took off all my sticky, wet clothes and got into the shower to wash the dried soda off my skin. Afterwards, I got dressed in a plain white tanktop and some pajama bottoms, and crawled into Katherine's bed. It creaked under me, and I fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katherine, honey, wake up.\" I opened my eyes and saw a woman who was the spitting image of Katherine, only about thirty years older.

If I was with any of my guy friends I would fire up my game console and do some multi-player games. I wasn't sure what girls would do when they were together. I noticed a stack of DVDs Katherine loved to watch (mostly fantasy and sci-fi), but I wasn't sure if Collette would be interested in those movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollette looked around the room, until she noticed something. She walked over to the wardrobe and pointed upstairs. \"How about we play that game?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what kind of game it was but I nodded. Anything but this awkward silence. Collette grabbed the desk chair as she stepped up the chair to grab the game. My eyes wandered to her figure. She must be the same length as me, but while I had fat legs Collette's legs were skinny. Collette wasn't a looker, but neither was I now. There was something though that made me drawn to her, I mean I wasn't sure if I was sexually attracted to her but she was different than the girls I knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this game looks really old.\" Collette brought it up to me as I stepped out of bed. It was a Game of the Goose. Seems Katherine played it a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still want to play?\" I asked shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollette nodded and though I wasn't sure how to play it, the rules of the game were included in the box. At first it was a little awkward but as we began to roll the dice, we both got more excited. Collette seemed to enjoy herself too, and for the first time since we met I saw her smile. We had a real good time, especially when Katherine's mom got inside the room to bring us some cookies and drinks. She was happy to see me (or Katherine) enjoying herself with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Collette had won three of the five games. I was just about to ask her for a rematch when she noticed the clock on the wall. \"It's that late already? I need to hurry home.\" She stretched herself as her t-shirt raised up and I automatically looked at her tummy. I was shocked by how skinny Collette was, I could almost count all her bones. Collette noticed me looking and quickly pulled her shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up too, noticed that I was still dressed in the tank top and pajama pants I put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey want to sit next to each other in the bus tomorrow?\" I asked her hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I take my car, but...sure, I'll be waiting for you.\" Collette replied. We both walked downstairs and I saw her off in front of the house. When I went back inside, I could smell the food Katherine's mom was preparing. I decided to...</span></div></div>",

We played some old board game.\" I told her as I put the forks near the plates. \"We were bored.\" I said as Katherine's mom raised one eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear honey, you're always spending your time alone upstairs. It's nice to see someone over for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom.\" I said rolling my eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you can invite her over for dinner.\" Katherine's mom suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, we just know each other for a day.\" I whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, just suggesting that's all.\" Katherine's mom shrugged her shoulders as she concentrated on the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only ten minutes as dinner was served. I spend the rest of dinner eating my dinner making small talk, asking Katherine's mom how her job was and how she was doing. I think she appreciated it as she smiled at me the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were finished we did the dishes and after that I went upstairs to my room. I remembered that I had skipped a few classes that afternoon when Collette brought me home. For the rest of the evening I was busy finishing that homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was ten o'clock I was yawning as I rubbed my eyes constantly. I needed to go to the bed. However there was still the computer, I really was curious how Katherine was managing with my body. I could give in to my curiosity or go straight to bed.</span></div></div>",

She saw me sitting there, just looking as how Brooke poured the drink right over me. I knew I wasn't the best of friends with Katherine before, but even I would do something back there. If Katherine would allow things like that, I really didn't wish to know what else she would be up to in my old body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why I closed the curtains as I prepared myself to go to bed. I went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth and after that I crawled inside my bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just lay there staring at the ceiling as I tried to get to sleep. My body felt tired and my eyes slowly closed themselves. But my mind was still awake. I kept thinking how I wished I could be back in my own body again. I would never be the same guy that I was before. I would be happy when I would go to family gatherings. I would never complain again when I would have to do my chores. I would hang around with my friends as much as I could.  My life was so much better than I ever knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was stuck inside Katherine's body. Her mom wasn't that bad though, and Collette seemed like a nice friend to have. I only wished I had my own body, I wouldn't be so weak against Brooke. I could jack off again too, I thought smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't really thought about it much before, I mean yesterday we just swapped. But today was different. My hands slowly moved themselves to my breasts. I could feel the small asymmetrical breasts I had seen that morning. <i>My </i>small breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hesitating at that moment. The boy's part of me really wanted to feel around Katherine's body, the other part just wanted to rest and prepare for tomorrow's bulling from Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end I decided to...</span></div></div>",

The pleasures I got from my new body were so pure, I wish I could have them continuously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began of course with my breasts. The small size made me hesitate a little of course, always having pictures around with big breasted woman to jack off to. But as I began to play with my own, I noticed the little electric shocks I received. And it wasn't like a shock when you grabbed an electrified fence. Instead I wanted more. I began to play rougher. I even pinched one of my nipples. I still remember the moan I let out. It was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body began to get warmer and I felt myself getting wet by my vagina. I hadn't examined it at all, something I plan to do some other time of course. As I remembered the movies I watched, I slowly played around with the outer parts. It got me even hotter as I moved my hips. Then I slipped a finger inside. I remember I put my hand in front of my mouth as I was filled with pleasure. It felt like I was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I haven't talked about my first orgasm. It was magnificent, it was like I unleashed all of this erotic energy inside of me. If you sit by a fire outside, you slowly begin to feel the warmth. When I had my orgasm, I felt like my body was all on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it, as I began to masturbate again, when I looked at the self inflicted scars on my legs. Why did Katherine wanted to die, when she had all this pleasure just waiting for her? I couldn't find my answer as I had my second orgasm that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued long into the night. It must be around 3 AM when I felt tired and couldn't move my legs anymore. The sheets were dirty but I was too tired to notice it. I closed my eyes as I dreamed about my little erotic trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still thinking about that, when I let the alarm clock play the game of thrones tune. I had to go to school again, too bad though.  The sheets are still dirty though covered in my fluids, so I put the blanket over them. No need for Katherine's mom to see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then showered myself quickly, dried off, and put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Katherine's glasses I put on again, but this time I let my hair down. I felt like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs I noticed Katherine's mom was already away for work, I grabbed a bowl of raisin bran and ate as much as I could. I felt starved for some reason. I then quickly put the bowl in the sink and went for the bus. Collette would be waiting for me. </span></div></div>",

My hart skipped a beat when I saw Collette sitting. I was so happy to see her. She was staring through the window. I quickly sat down next to her and most people turned back to what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" She replied back. \"Everything fine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything is okay.

She just nodded. Collette didn't seem to want to talk about it so I just let the subject drop. We talked about school and things, when the bus suddenly stopped. People stopped talking, and all were looking at the front of the bus. I realized too late what it was, or to be exact who. Brooke stepped inside the bus. Normally she would take her car (her parents bought it) but today she did not. There could only be one reason: me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly looked in the same direction as Collette was staring at. My body began to shiver uncontrollably. I could see in the corners of my eye that Brooke walked down the aisle. Would she be going for me? I praid she wouldn't stop at my seat. My prayer didn't get answered. Brooke just stopped in front of my seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this seat. Move over.\" Brooke nudged towards the backseat of the bus. There were still a few empty seats left. I wanted to move away, but then Collette put her hand down on my leg. She looked me in the eyes and shook her head. I didn't need to move away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to move already?\" Brooke complained. I knew that if I would upset Brooke I could be punished later for it, but if I moved Collette wouldn't like it. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

I saw Brooks looking around trying to pull a prank on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the bus driver spoke up: \"Hey you in the back, sit down alright. We need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooks couldn't do anything at the moment, so she gave me an evil eye, turned around, mumbled something and sat down next to another girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, I did it.\" My voice was still a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you just have to learn to stand up for yourself.\" Collette told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's so hard sometimes. But thanks for helping me.\" I lied my hand down on Collete's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollette smiled at me, and for one second I forgot that I was a girl and that Collette was a girl I could go out with. Then I remembered that I was still a girl and quickly took my hand away. We continued our small talk and not soon the bus arrived at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still wary as I exited the bus, making sure Brooks wasn't around. Collette tried to distract me, but I was on my guard now. Nobody would cross Brooks and just live to tell the tale. I walked over to my locker and put my locker code in. A moment later I was pulled away from my locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?\" I asked Collette looking back. The next moment I heard a loud splash. The ground in front of my locker was wet and there were pieces of a balloon. I just escaped from being soaked wet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Collette.\" I hugged Collette, still a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. You're lucky I'm around.

Kailey and I had been dating for a little less than six months now, and everything in my life was perfect. I got out of my car and walked up to her house, knocking on the door. I waited until Kailey's kid sister opened the door. Her name was Isabelle and she was about twelve or thirteen, and was honestly really annoying. She looked a lot like a younger version of Kailey, with straight blonde hair that went down to her shoulders and a light dusting of freckles across her thin, pale face. She was short and thin. Today she wore a pink and white striped shirt and a pair of gray tights, and her hair was done in two braids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kailey's in the shower,\" she said, and led me inside. The Denardos lived in an expansive, large house. I knew they were rich, but I didn't know how rich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be out soon, I hope?\" I asked. I was going to take her to the movies today. Isabelle just nodded and turned on the TV. She put on one of those new Nickelodeon shows that everybody except twelve year-olds hated. I sat down on the armchair. \"What are you watching?\" I asked. She ignored me. I wanted Isabelle to like me, because I was in love with her sister. It proved to be not so easy. I thought twelve year old girls were supposed to be social!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The water that'd been running in the background stopped, and I figured it would be just a few more minutes before my Kailey was ready for our date. Then it happened. I didn't notice at first. My vision shifted slightly, and I was looking directly at the TV and not from an angle. And why wasn't I in the armchair anymore? Then I realized my breathing sounded different. It was higher-pitched and childlike. I looked at my hands. They were small and noticeably feminine. I looked around the room and saw myself in the armchair. Then I realized: I was Isabelle! </span></div></div>",

She looked beautiful, wearing a blue crop top showing off her perfect round breasts her awesome tight stomach and her naval piercing and a white skirt showing beneath it a red thong. In her hands she was holding a pair of high heels of the ones I loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look totally hot.\" I said out loud before I realized what I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thanks Izzy.\" Kailey said looking a bit weird at what I was saying. \"Me and Jack will be going for a few hours. Tell mom I will be late.\" Kailey said as she grabbed Isabelle's arm and pulled her outside. The last thing I saw before she was out the door was her looking scared and confused as she was dragged away by her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the window where I looked at the sight outside. Isabelle sat down in the passenger's site while Kailey was sitting in the driver's seat. Whew, at least I knew my car wouldn't be driven by a fourteen year old. Kailey waved her hand at me and I waved back and saw my car gone with my girlfriend and my body. I was all alone now. Only me alone in the house. I quickly made my way to the front door and locked it. Normally I wouldn't do such a thing but being inside a twelve year old doesn't feel safe at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now? I pondered as I walked back to the living room. I didn't want to watch television and I shut down the television. I would spend some time in my room, Isabelle's room to be precise. I walked out of the living room and up the stairs which were pretty soft, being carpeted and the whole thing. Upstairs I saw several rooms. I wasn't sure which one was Isabelle's, but luckily the rooms all contained signs. Must be for all the staff they've got. I then spotted Isabelle's room at the end of the hallway. But then I spotted Kailey's room as well. It was six months already and I was still not invited to her bedroom. I realized this was the perfect opportunity to check out her bedroom. Who knows, maybe it would help me and Kailey? Or should I just go to Isabelle's room?</span></div></div>",

Kailey and Isabella would never find out I would be in there and besides as her sister she couldn't stop me. I opened the door quietly as I was afraid of making a sound, the door opened quietly however and I stepped inside Kailey's room. Inside the room however I looked my eyes out, it was pretty awesome. The room had a glass door going to the balcony, the furniture inside the room was expensive but tasteful. I even discovered Kailey had her own bathroom! With a shower and everything in it. I had no idea Kailey had all this. I then made my way to Kailey's bed, I know it may sounded perverted but for once I wanted to smell Kailey's bed. I put my face on her sheets and took a whiff. It was Kailey's smell, this smells so good I thought. I wished I had my trusty guy, but sadly it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then saw a big wardrobe standing inside the room. I knew it would be even more improper for me, but I couldn't care at the moment. I walked over to the wardrobe and opened the doors. In it I saw all of Kailey's favorite outfits, jeans, skirts favorite tops. \"Wow,\" I said as I looked at all of this. I couldn't believe Kailey had such hot stuff, but I was also interested in something else. \"Mmmhm, where does she keep her underwear?\" I asked myself. I looked down and saw two drawers. I opened them both and saw that they contained Kailey's bra's and panties. She had them in every shape and colors. I grabbed one of the thongs Kailey had, the material was almost nothing. I wondered how it would look when Kailey would wear it. Or perhaps I could see how it would fit myself? I looked at myself, I was a girl now. A twelve year old girl, that well, but nothing could prevent me from wearing a thong. Should I do it though? Or look for something else?</span></div></div>",

Walking up to the water fountain, I didn't notice Kelly Compton, who I assumed was coming out of volleyball practice walking towards it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're going, runt!\" she exclaimed. I was too tired to protest. It wasn't like I was a runt, I was actually pretty tall- about 6'0\". It was just that Kelly happened to be a whopping 6'5\", and counting. Of course, due to her height, she was the school's star volleyball and girl's basketball player. She was actually kind of pretty, but most guys found her intimidating due to her massive height. I waited patiently as she drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, I felt water at my lips, and almost choked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" I heard a familiar voice say. <i>My</i> voice, I realized. I turned around and was looking down at myself. Not the body I was in, but my real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" I asked in a voice that was deep for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? Give me back my body!\" exclaimed my old self. I looked down at myself. I was in a very tall, female body. Then I realized- somehow, I'd switched bodies with Kelly Compton!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" I said, looking around and making sure nobody else was in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down? You stole my body!\" she exclaimed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't 'steal your body', and I'm just as confused as you! Seriously, why would I want to be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her... my head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sports career is over. I can't play volleyball in a body this short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not that short. You're just freakishly tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we need to figure out just what the hell is going on,\" I said. \"Just pretend to be me for a while, and we can sort this all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll pretend to be you. But you better figure out how to switch us back! There's no way I'm spending the rest of my life as <i>you</i> !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe exchanged phone numbers and other information, and I went to Kelly's locker. It was the end of the day, so I had to pack up her stuff and go to her house- something I wasn't exactly looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to her locker and entered the combo- <i>14-20-32</i> . My fingers were a lot longer now, and it was odd to walk through the halls at such a high vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed her stuff and walked out to the parking lot to her car, and drove to her house. I had some trouble driving because I still wasn't totally used to my new limbs. I hoped I wouldn't have to get used to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was home yet when I got to her house. It was a relatively simple, one-story house in a small neighborhood that a lot of kids in our town lived in. I looked at myself in a mirror. It was so weird seeing a different face and body in the reflection.</span></div></div>",

You hate your sister, she has such a pretty life. She doesn't have any studies or work. Your parents told you that Olivia couldn't handle that yet, Olivia tried different studies but each time she drops out after half a year. You could get so mad at her at those times. And she didn't even have to work, as she needed the time to find \"the right study\" for her. Yeah, the only study that would be perfect for her doesn't exist yet. And still your parents believed her pathetic excuses and so you were stuck with her until the next semester when she would be off for another study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated her so much.

It's then that everything turns black and you fall down with your head on your book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you feel different for some reason. You can feel the softness underneath your bottom, like your sitting on something soft. Your entire posture seems different from where you took off. It's like... You look around yourself and notice that this is your sister's room. You recognize the disgusting pink color immediately and the pink sheets of your sister's bed. It's then that you notice your toenails are painted with that exactly same nail polish your sister always paints her nails with. Speaking of nails something is off with your body. Your legs are different, they're much more in shape and they're completely void of hairs. You're wearing a pair of super tight shorts. Looking down you're shocked to see a pair of breasts hanging in a pink colored bra and white tank top.  \"What the.\" You let out as you touch them. They feel real as they jiggle to your touch. You stand up from the bed and walk over to the large mirror Olivia has in her room. As you notice your reflection, you automatically look disgusted at the sight of your sister. But your sister has the exact same expression on her face as you have. You walk closer to the mirror and slowly touch the mirror and see Olivia doing the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You've switched bodies with Olivia</i>. But how?</span></div></div>",

They answered yes and asked if you were interested. Since your parents were inside the room with you, you could only say yes hoping that they didn't need anyone anymore. To your embarrassment they said they still needed someone and asked you if you were available for a job interview. You answered yes and so the arrangements were made. Your parents made you change your clothes into something more professional. A white blouse with a jacket and some new jeans wearing flats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could take it all in your parents drove you to the mall and wished you good luck as you made your way to the store, confused and flustered by all the underwear on display. You then had your job interview in which the beautiful female manager asked why you wanted the job. You made something up about how you believed women were all beautiful and that lingerie would allow them to express that beauty. You expected that not to work at all, but surprise surprise they bought it and so they hired you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were standing with a coupon (one of the advantages of being hired here) for one of their products.

It's rather difficult to you knowing you're going to strip your sister's clothes and you're the one that will see everything. You take a few steps closer to the mirror, Olivia does look great but you always hated her personality. And now it's you inside her body. Not knowing for how long and why, but you're Olivia now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and pull the jacket off you wore. Then you pull the blouse off your parents forced you to wear over your head and let it fall on the ground. Your eyes are still closed you're not sure if you can handle seeing your sister in her bra, but there is no choice. You open your sister's eyes and look at the reflection in the mirror. Olivia is standing there rather shocked wearing the pink bra she was wearing earlier. It's a weird sight to see her, or rather you like this. From this point of view you can see Olivia is stacked. Not as bad as you thought. You grab your breasts and heave them a little before letting go, the jiggling a rather odd sensation coming from your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this might not be so bad as you originally thought, you decide to continue with your plan. You still need to take off the bra first. Problem is you don't know how exactly, you have seen girl's being busy with their strap on the back but what exactly you don't know. You turn around and face the mirror to see what the back looks like. You see there is a clip that holds the bra together and you notice something else as well. Your sister's unblemished back. You always liked girls with a little curve and you have to admit your sister does have them. But you quickly focus your attention on the bra. You move your hands behind your back to find the bra and try to undo the clip, it takes a little while but after some struggling you finally pulled the bra off. You grab the bra in front of you and study the label on the bra. A D-cup bra, you find out. Good,  you know what to get. But as you turn around to the bra pile you grabbed earlier you eyes stick to the mirror in front of you. Olivia is standing there with her naked breasts nipples and all. How does that make you feel?</span></div></div>",

I also noticed my voice was much higher in pitch. I raised my hand. The girl did too. I realized I was looking into a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around. I was in a pink bedroom with posters for pop stars all over the walls. Looking back in the mirror, I decided to assess my situation. I was a girl, of about eleven or twelve, with red, wavy hair extending barely past my shoulders, a thin face, and freckles. I opened my mouth and realized I had braces. I looked down at my body. I had barely-budding breasts under a pink shirt. I had capris on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did this happen to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a folder on the desk labelled \"Kristin Lacey\"- little hearts were over the i's. That must be this girl's name- Kristin Lacey. I said it a few times, so it would stick in my memory- for all I knew, I would have to get used to this name. It was so weird to speak through a new voice. All I knew was that I had to get back to my old body- there was no way I was going through puberty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristin!\" a voice shouted, from the lower level of this house. I assumed it was the voice of Kristin's mom. I left the room and walked downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were taking forever up there, Kris.\" said \"my\" mom- she looked a lot like Kristin. This swap was really messing with my perception of things- I'd lost so much height. I had no idea how tall I was in this body, but it couldn't be over five feet. Kristin's mom, who my old body would have towered over, now towered over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate a bowl of cereal and then Kristin's mom walked me out to the bus stop. I couldn't believe I was going to go to sixth grade again. If there was anything good about this swap, it was that school would become a lot easier for me, since I already knew everything. This body swap could almost become a fresh start for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kristin!\" said a brown-haired girl who looked to be of the same age as \"me\". Crap! I didn't know this girl's name! Suddenly, I spotted something. She was holding what looked like a flute case- a name tag read \"Dakota Little\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dakota.\" I responded. The bus came, and Dakota sat down with me. She must be Kristin's friends, I realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus was really loud. I'd forgotten how annoying everybody was at this age. To think I had to put up with this now... it wasn't exactly a great prospect. I just had to pretend to be Kristin for the day. After that, I could figure everything out.</span></div></div>",

Rubbing your eyes, nothing changes. Okay, what the he'll was going on here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Barely making out a pair of thick glasses on the counter next to the bed, I put them on and things came into focus. I looked at my hand. It was gangly and awkward, and covered in freckles, but notably female. That was when I noticed all the Friday red hair that went... well, almost everywhere. Getting out of bed, I realized I was most definitely a female, but not a very attractive one. I was in the body of an unusually tall and lanky girl with a lot of freckles. Looking into the mirror, my worst fears were confirmed: I was in the body of Daisy Pace, the nerdiest girl at my school!. She had no friends, was super annoying, and everybody hated her! And more importantly, now that was me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Obviously, the first thing I had to do was find out if she was in my body.

Sorry jack, because i sure am but you need to learn from a different perspective\" \"oh thank you Mrs. Cartwright, i won't let you down!\" You hear yourself say with your new soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Anne appeared and said, \"well be sure to enjoy that body mr. Kendrick, it is yours now\" that's when your old body began to sweat and say, \"umm can't we establish some ground rules for him to follow, like 'no touching things he shouldn't be touching\" that thought was destroyed when Mrs. Anne said, \"why should he not be able to touch his own boobs and vagina, Mrs. Cartwright?\" Your old body looks flabbergasted as she said thatand says, \"his boobs...his vagina! Last I checked I was the one who grew those boobs and that vagina was definitely trimmed by me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to feel a little awkward, especially since they were talking about your new vagina (apperently it was trimmed). Mrs. Anne was apparently protecting your new rights for whatever reason because she said, \"well now their his appendages, whether you like it or not he can feel them up as much as he wants as long as its his body\". Your body grudgingly agreed but told you that you should probably watch out for her husband, who she had not told about this affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you all parted ways, Mrs. Cartwright was going to live your life while she was in his body while you were going to live her life while you were in her body. With your new memories, you were able ti drive all the way to your new house that was quite a while away from the school but was glamorous to look at. When you arrived you unlocked the house and stepped in, you were gired out for whatever reason and layed down on the couch, you didn't expect to fall asleep (especially with this annoying skirt and blouse) but you did anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were apparently dreaming with your new body since in your dream you still had the appearance of Mrs. Cartwright, you vaguely even remembered the dream so the dream is a little fuzzy but the main idea was that you were getting to know yourself *cough feeling yourself up cough cough*. When you woke up you feel something big gripping your butt you were surprised by this so you jolted up, this got the thing off but made it more awkward when you realize ot was her husbands hand that was gripping it. He says, \"honey? You okay, you woke up with quite a jolt?\" You wanted to redpobd but you didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also realized that Mrs. Cartwright hadn't told her husband about the swap, which could complicate things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Sue and Jack stared coughing, then almost what looked like an epileptic seizure. Jeff at first thought he had passed out, as the smoke cleared in his booth. He saw his old body in the other booth. He saw his old body coughing in the booth with thick black smoke. He tried to get the attention of Dr. Abbott. She was busy wrestling with her console, when it exploded, and caught fire.

The print dress he had on reminded him of something his grandmother would wear. His feet were so small, in sensible shoes. His tiny hands, had the beginning of age spots, and long red nails. He touched the twin globes on his chest, realize these were now part of him. He quickly felt his crotch, and quickly confirmed that he was no longer a he.

On the other hand, he had laugh lines wrinkles, lost 7 inches, gained more then 75 lbs, almost 30 years, and the beginning of a turkey neck. His arms were flabby, his toenail's were red like his fingers. His breasts were huge. That was nothing compared to the size of his butt. He lifted up his dress and looked at his tree trunk sized thighs covered in dimples. He couldn't help himself as he pulled down the panties, and gasp. His pussy covered in thick wild red hair. So thick the only thing visible about his pussy was a string coming out of it. \"Perfect ending to a perfect day,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Just then he heard a knock at the door.

There were puck marks on her face, a turned up pig's nose and large ears that stuck out at 45 degrees. \"There are a few things you need to know once you are in my body,\" Miss Piggy said in a shrill voice, \"You will need to inject 85 units of insulin every morning. If you eat more then 1200 calories a day you will gain weight because of a slow metabolism. And be careful about the high blood pressure.

The men helped me up, and I wobbled toward the door. The heat was smothering, I could feel more sweat forming on my face, underarms, even under what must have been tremendous breasts. My thighs slapping each other with every step. Even with a bra on, my breasts kept swaying. All this was throwing off my balance. I couldn't hold back the tears. They lead me to a waiting taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The smaller tec told me, \"You are lucky, your bodies old owner has set you up in an apartment, with a nurse to show you how to care for yourself.</span></div></div>",

At least I stopped sobbing. We drove to a nice section of town to a high rise apartment. A large woman waiting at the entrance helped me out of the cab and into the elevator. She introduced herself as Connie. Normally she would check up on me every Monday, but for now she was going to spend the next few days with me showing me how to adjust. Riding the elevator with her I felt claustrophobic. We entered a 2 bedroom apartment I would spend the next month in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"It's so hot in her can we turn the temperature down?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"It's 70 degrees in here. How cold do you want it?\" Connie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I don't know I just can't stop sweating. I can't stand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I can see the sweat stains on your shirt, maybe you should take a shower. It will cool you off,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I dreaded getting naked in this fat body, but the sweat was so uncomfortable. Connie took me to the bathroom, and took off my shirt and pants. I turned to the mirror in shock. I was a car wreck, but I couldn't look away. Even though this body was only 40, with all the heath problems, I figured , I had lost 40 or 50 years of my life. I lifted up my arms, to see jiggling flesh hanging down from them sway back and forth. My cottage cheese legs had saddlebags, verrucus veins with calluses where they rubbed together. My ankles and knees were buried in fat. My huge ugly gut had a large outie belly button, and hung over my oversized panties. I had never seen such a huge bra, or breasts so monstrous and wide. Deep crevasses  had been cut into my shoulders from years of bra straps, supporting my cow sized udders. As my bra was removed my long wide, breasts rested on my belly. They were so saggy my nipples were hidden under my breast meat.  I pulled down a set of panties, the size of a circus tent. As I leaned over to pull them off, I nearly fell over as my tits swung their full length towards the floor, as pink nipples 6 inches across were exposed. I felt where my manhood had been. There was virtually no hair. My pussy was so buried in lard, my fingers could barely find it. With that I vomited on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie push me in the cool shower, and started cleaning up the mess. The cool water relieved me somewhat, as Connie started to wash my back. <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

I turned her offer down, as I was much too tired to move at all. I lumbered to bed, my legs chafing and my entire body jiggling with every step, and I layer down, buck naked on the bed. To my horror, I started sweating again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please turn the heat down!\" I cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already did!\" said Connie, who I noticed was shivering, \"You just have a very sweaty body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not I started to cry was lost to me, as my face was already soaking wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just leave you be,\" said Connie, clearly disgusted by my putrid odor.</span></div></div>",

This was definitely not your room; the room is painted gray and white and there really is a desk and your posters are indeed gone. There is still some hope that you only have been brought somewhere else, but that dream from before and this makes you scared. Standing up you take a few steps forward; feeling your breasts jiggling with every step you take. There is a mirror on the far wall which could explain what has happened to you. Did some quack do a breast job on you? If they did, you really want to kick their ass right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the mirror your face instantly turns worried.

My body was slowly being erased, I just stood there in shock as I didn't dare to move. I looked at Dr. Thomas who just smiled excited. I assumed it must be part of the experiment and I just stood still as I felt myself being erased piece by piece. And when everything was gone, only my head was floating there. I took one last look at Dr. Thomas and just closed my eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teleporter transferred my date over to the other teleporter, however the other teleporter was doing the same thing. As the date of our bodies crossed each other something happened. Instead of transferring my mind with my body, the teleporter didn't know which mind belonged with which data stream. So it activated it fail safe mechanism and ordered my mind back. However though it didn't account for my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was rather surprised when I opened my eyes to see Dr. Eileen Thomas again, expecting another doctor.

Luckily, there were about two hundred students in the school, so it wasn't like I had the odds stacked against me; but then again, someone had to be picked, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school had recently opted to partake in an experiment being conducted by the government, in exchange for an expanded budget. The experiment was a test for a beta body-swapping invention of some kind, and they wanted to see the long-term effects of a body swap on two different adolescents. When the school first decided to enact this experiment, they asked for two volunteers. However, when nobody stepped forward, they decided they would draw two names randomly, one boy and one girl, and they would be the ones testing the invention. The biggest problem was that the effects of the invention lasted for two years. So if I got swapped, I would end up in someone else's body for two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment was anonymous, and it was very important that the subjects didn't tell anybody. Only a select few people in the government would know who was involved in the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Monday. During my lunch period, I checked my phone and had a text from an unknown number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Mr. Gates,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you have no doubt heard, the school is conducting a beta body-swap experiment. You have been selected for this. Please report to the guidance office immediately for further instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest wishes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach lurched. I just couldn't believe I had been chosen. Warily, I walked down to the guidance office, drinking in what, for all I knew, would be my last few moments in my body for two years. My mind was racing. Who would I be swapping bodies with? Who would I live in for the next two years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you must be Mr. Gates.\" I was greeted immediately upon entering the office. \"Uh, yeah,\" I said. \"You can call me Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come right this way, Jack,\" said the sandy-haired middle-aged man. \"You're just about to meet the person you'll be swapping bodies with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed him down a corridor and he opened a door. Sitting in the room was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Danielle Morgan, a renowned school slut, and not too bright.

As I was waking up, I heard all these noises around me. When I opened my eyes I saw Mr. Johnston's face with next to me the faces of the other kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, are you alright?\" Mr. Johnston asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren?\" I wanted to ask. Confused to how he could make such a mistake. Instead I felt my mouth saying: \"I think so, I feel really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment I panicked. My mouth just said something I didn't commanded. Then it hit me. He called me Lauren, so would that mean I was now inside Lauren's body somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you stand up?\" Mr. Johnston asked me. I felt my head nodding. Then Lauren wanted to get up from the floor, I could feel her trying to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Lauren?\" Mr. Johnston asked me. \"Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it's like my legs aren't there anymore.\" My mouth said. \"I can't move them.\" I could hear the fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this my doing? Why had this had to happen to me? Out of frustration I kicked my leg up in the air. The next moment I saw Lauren's leg kicking in the air. Mr. Johnston looked relaxed for one second, but the next second he was quite angry. \"Lauren I don't have time for these jokes of yours. Clearly your legs are fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mr. Johnston that wasn't me, I didn't do anything.\" I felt how my hands pointed towards Lauren's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas I perhaps the one that did it? Was I in control of her legs?\" To put the matter to the test I moved my toes. Out of the corner of my eye, or better said Lauren's eye, I could see how Lauren's toes moved at the same time I tried mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I was aware of what happened to us. I now controlled Lauren's legs, not her anymore. The only problem was that she didn't know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone,\" Mr. Johnston announced, I want you to all help finding Jack. Clearly he isn't in the classroom anymore. I want you to go all look for him, and that includes you too Lauren.\" Mr. Johnston looked at me. With that the whole class left the room, leaving me and Lauren alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, he's so not my favorite teacher anymore. And I can't help it really, it's like I can't feel my legs anymore.\" Lauren was mumbling in herself still lying on the ground. I decided to intervene. I moved with my legs towards the right. \"Wow, there they go again. What's up with you legs? You act so weird.\" Lauren asked out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh is she really this stupid?  I thought. I continued moving to the right. \"Oh, I get it, you want me to roll towards the right, so I can stand up.\" Finally, I thought. Lauren moved also to the right and now she was lying on her belly. She then pushed herself off the ground while I moved my left leg forward and upwards. And so we finally had finished one of many challenges. I wouldn't realize that things would go a lot harder from here on out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext think I know....</span></div></div>",

I turned around for the door and walked over to it. Then when Lauren tried to further open it, I was a little too late and she got hit by the door as I didn't step back in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few kids who left looked up. \"Gee, I'm still a little dizzy.\" She explained. Then I made my way to the girl's bathroom. Let me tell you something. It's terrible being the lower part of Lauren's body. The girl has such a short attention span, she always looks at everybody and everyone. Now if I didn't control her legs and feet I wouldn't mind, but finding out you almost run into everyone you come across, does make you feel angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's when I stepped inside the bathroom. Lauren finally said something to me. \"Gee, I remember it differently.\" As Lauren looked around I realized what the problem was, this was the boy's bathroom. I quickly turned around and made Lauren's body push against the door to open it, as she still hadn't figure it out. I then entered the girls' bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so much better.\" Lauren mumbled. \"Now can you move to the mirror a little?\" Lauren asked me. I answered her request as I moved to the mirror. \"Thank you.\" Lauren said as she took a look in the mirror. I thought she wanted to help me, but as usual Lauren was checking out her reflection in the mirror. As she didn't seem to stop checking out after a few minutes, I got mad and stomped with my feet. \"Whoa, whoa, easy my feet, everything's going to be okay. I just need to check out if my hair is right.\" I stomped with my feet again. \"Okay, fine, I get it. Now what's wrong with you? I wiggled with my feet forth and back to try and say something, but I couldn't say a word like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to work, can't we do something else like can you say yes and no?\" I waved with my foot up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's something. Now are you some part of your body that doesn't like me?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my feat even though I knew her body would have wanted me to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it, oh so are you some spirit having taken over my legs?\" Lauren asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waved with my foot a little around. She was close, but not quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you are not a spirit, and not a part of my body. Wait would that mean, no way that would be stupid, but might you be Jack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't think Lauren had it in her, but she finally got something right in her life. I nodded with her feet extensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, I need to hold my balance with my other foot. But wait, you are Jack? No way that's....</span></div></div>",

At some point I opened my eyes as I felt my body was different. I couldn't pin it out, it just felt wrong. Something to do with the potion, I thought then. I then saw a lot of my fellow students surrounding me as well as the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" The teacher asked me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling a bit dizzy, but fine.\" I said. However that wasn't me that spoke those words. I didn't use my mouth, I was still stunned by the explosion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. Now don't try to move too much. As far as I can see, you look alright. It is odd though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" I felt my lips moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no trace to be found of the chemicals you used. As far as I can see it, you're looking as dry as you should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, sir.\" One of the students said attracting the attention of the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The teacher asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we can't find Jack. He's gone.\" The student told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it, How could he be so blind when I was lying right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over here.\" I said. However nobody paid any attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that Lauren. Now I want everybody to search for Jack. We don't know what happened to him.\" Everyone left me and went off. But wait, did he say Lauren? Was-Was this freaky sensation because of? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Can anyone help me?\" I felt my lips moving again. \"I can't move my left side.\" What was she talking about? Now that I noticed I couldn't feel anything at my right side. I waved my left hand and saw my head turning it's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is going on here?\" My voice sounded scared. I didn't know what happened, but the best thing would be to talk about it with Lauren. But not here in the classroom, somewhere private. I turned myself around surprising Lauren and we were now on our hand and feet. I felt the sensation of Lauren's breasts pulling us down. I managed to pull in my leg and luckily Lauren seemed to understand what was going on as she moved her other feet and we were standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Are you some kind of ghost?\" Lauren asked unsure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. We have to talk somewhere.\" I told Lauren as I made my way to the door. However I could my right leg not moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I'm not going anywhere with you.\" Lauren said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice, I'm stuck here with you. So come on.\" I said pulling myself to the door. I managed to open it and while struggling I limped to the bathroom. Luckily it was right around the corner. I wanted to open the boy's but Lauren grabbed my hand before I could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in there.\" She said afraid anyone would see her. She then brought us to the girl's bathroom, a place I thought I would never visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom Lauren faced a mirror looking afraid but also angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, who are you?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

It's normal for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't do that.\" I said and wanted to turn my part of Lauren's body around when she grabbed my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jack, I really need to.\" Lauren said as I felt it then as well. Lauren's bowels were making awful noises and I could feel how it hurt. But why should I listen to her? It was Lauren's fault that we got like this. A little lesson in humiliation would go a far end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lauren hit me with the argument that made the most sense to me: \"Jack, if I don't go, you will be humiliated as well.\" I really wished Lauren had not said that, but she was right. I was still riding along in Lauren's body, everything happening to her was happening to me as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's go.\" I said and hurried my way to one of the bathroom stalls. She quickly opened the door and stepped inside while I closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lauren could sit down we had to take off her skirt. It was one with one button and then she just needed to unzip it. She was fumbling around with the button as she couldn't move the button as well as with two hands. I quickly stepped in with my hand and we quickly unzipped the skirt. I then had to pull of the thong Lauren was wearing as well and Lauren quickly sat down on the cold toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore one of us could say or do something we both felt how Lauren's bowels were working and soon I felt how the little turds were falling down. I couldn't believe how good it felt to be relieved of something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" Lauren said after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It is.\" I agreed with her. Lauren then grabbed some toilet paper, which I helped with of course, while I was staring down at Lauren's legs. Even if I didn't like Lauren that much, she did have a nice body. I touched her leg and felt how soft it was. Amazing to think she had such soft legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, when you are done perving, can you stand up please?\" Lauren said not as happy as before. I stood up at my side and we raised the thong and the skirt up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then made our way outside and washed our hands. Looking at Lauren's face like that, made me smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lauren asked seeing her left side of her lips raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just happy that a hot girl like you, can be such a stinky, stinky.\" I commented on the smell of before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt and saw Lauren's face pouting. \"Ah bite me.\" She said and with that we left the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

For some strange reason that I can\u2019t really comprehend, Principal Gonzalez didn\u2019t understand the comedic genius of my hilarious walrus impression and dragged me out of the class to talk with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me, Mr Gates,\u201d Dr Gonzalez hissed, \u201cI\u2019ve got half a mind to call up your Mom and tell her what you\u2019ve been up to. The only reason I\u2019m refraining from doing so is frankly because I don\u2019t want to waste my air complaining to her, yet again, about your behaviour. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head sarcastically, a move that had proved efficient with many adults I\u2019d encountered over my 16 years on planet Earth. Principal Gonzalez definitely seemed satisfied, a smug grin plastered on her face as she thought she\u2019d reformed one of her \u2018troubled students\u2019. I rolled my eyes and strolled back into the classroom, bumping fists with Danny as I rejoined him at our desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Gates, I\u2019m not finished speaking with you yet!\u201d called Principal Gonzalez as she stomped her way back into the room. Now, if she hadn\u2019t come over and grabbed my arm, none of what I\u2019m about to tell you would\u2019ve happened and I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you right now. Anyways, she grabbed me and I immediately jerked my hand back in response, accidentally pushing over a trio of unmarked test tubes and sending them crashing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was immediately flooded by a thick pink smog that surrounded everything and made my eyes water. Worse still, I could feel something shifting inside me, as if my very essence was being sucked out and absorbed into the swirling cloud. The last thing I remember seeing was Principal Gonzalez\u2019s shocked face before I rushed towards her and blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Hello?\u201d I could hear voices calling out to me but they were strange, muffled as if I was underwater. I groaned as I regained consciousness, opening my eyes to see Mr Johnston and a bunch of other kids staring down at me. \u201cThank God, you\u2019re awake! How are you feeling?\u201d Mr Johnston asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good, just a little dizzy...\u201d I groggily levered myself upwards as the other children stepped back. I shook my head, pushing a few strands of light brown hair from my face as I half-listened to Mr Johnston speaking. <i>Did Mr Johnston get taller?</i> I asked myself as I now had to look up to him instead of looking him in the eyes. I nodded as he continued to mumble on, feigning interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...ipal Gonzalez?\u201d I cursed as Mr Johnston now stared at me, probably catching me out for zoning out. \u201cYeah! Yeah, what you just said, yep, completely true!\u201d I smiled at him, this action for whatever reason seeming to unnerve him even more. \u201cRelax, dude, it\u2019s just me, J...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped abruptly when I looked into the reflection of one of the beakers set on the table in front of me. Instead of seeing my slightly scrawny, developing male body, I saw a Latino woman in her early 40s. Her body was still in great shape, 5'6\" with large D cup breasts and a svelte body with sexy, feminine curves. I was completely dumbfounded as I stared at the woman in the reflection. I waved a hand and was shocked to see the woman completely mirror me. <i>I\u2019m... I\u2019M FREAKING PRINCIPAL GONZALEZ!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this moment I think Old Johnston definitely thought his boss was going crazy from the pink smoke she\u2019d inhaled. \u201cPrincipal Gonzalez, I repeat, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun round, nearly smacking another set of test tubes with my massive new jugs. I awkwardly rested one of my new, feminine arms on the corner of Mr Johnston\u2019s desk. I scoffed, maybe a bit too loud, as I tried to cover myself. \u201cAlright? Yep! Doing just peachy! Nothing strange here! I\u2019m Principal Gonzalez! Definitely not a 16 year old boy! Pfft, what?\u201d Now everyone in the room stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, get back to work students! Soak your heads in the... learning waters of, erm, education or something. If anyone needs me, don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to the bathroom and I... I need to take a dump! Yeah, and if I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll crap ALL OVER my panties. Okay? Erm, safe learning or whatever.\u201d I slowly backed out of the room slowly, turning around and running down the hallway leaving the poor class dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hallway monitor was quietly patrolling the corridor when he saw me zip past. \u201cHey, you need to slow down... PRINCIPAL GONZALEZ?\u201d He watched as my female form ducked into one of the boy\u2019s bathrooms. The dude probably reasoned, <i>Well, I guess it IS her school.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I ducked into one of the stalls I threw off the strappy heeled sandals that I\u2019d foolishly ran down the corridor with. <i>How the hell do women DEAL with these death traps!</i> I tried to compose myself, something that was hard to do considering that I was a horny 16-year-old kid in a sexy, 40-something-year-old body. Eventually I calmed down enough to think, deciding to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Swapping pairs are chosen AT RANDOM. It was an optional class for senior year, but Jack's mom thinks it would be a good idea for him to experience life as a female. When swapped, Jack is allowed to tell anyone he wants about his true identity, as his new body is for seeing what it is like living in the other gender's body and learning about their body's functions/needs. He will live at his own house too, where he lives with his mom, dad, 14 year old sister Megan, and his 7 year old brother Noah. The only other thing he has to swap with his partner is clothes. Jack is an average 18 year old who is 6'2\", has short brown hair and brown eyes. Below are 5 girls that Jack can possibly swap with:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda Smith (18 Years Old, 5'4\"): Average life, good looking. Jack's good friend and crush. He doesn't know if she likes him back. They spend a lot of time together, as they talk everyday and often go over to each other's houses. Jack has tried a couple times to reveal his feelings to her but can never bring himself to do it.. She is Jack's preferred choice as a swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.baconsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hot-syracuse-cheerleader-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.baconsports.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie Armstrong (18 Years Old, 5'7\"): Head cheerleader, VERY good looking. Has a boyfriend, (Nate Jones) who also happens to be Jack's rival. While he hates her boyfriend, Jack doesn't mind her, he hasn't really ever talked to her. Jack is apprehensive about swapping with her due to having to deal with her boyfriend, but he would like 2 weeks in her hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-06-at-3-42-38-pm.png?w=600\" target=\"_blank\">https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/201...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie Young (18 Years Old, 5'9\"): Class president, not a nerd though. In fact, she runs track and is very fit. Jack talks to her occasionally and she seems nice. She's decent looking, too. She has an outgoing personality that goes hand in hand with her class presidency. She is basically friends with almost everyone in the senior class. Jack wouldn't mind swapping with her, as he feels that she would be an easy partner to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blogs.baylor.edu/mindyourmajor/files/2012/09/Tutoring-105vmar.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.baylor.edu/mindyourmajor/fi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina Blue (15 Years Old, 5'0\"): Really smart, could be described as a 'nerd'. Would be a freshman, but she skipped a few grades. She's okay looking, but no guy in Jack's swap class never wants to swap with her because of her younger age. She's kind of cute, but her body is still developing. Jack has never talked to her because she is normally in all of the smart and most advanced classes. Like every 18 year old, she is considered a senior and is going to college next year. Jack doesn't know but she admires him from afar and has a crush on him. Jack doesn't really want to swap with her because he wants to swap with a 'more mature' girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e7/2f/b9/e72fb95965a75e8c946563d1f1eac252.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha \"Sam\" Abrams (18 Years Old, 6'0\"): A tomboy, she is on the basketball team and plays center because of her height. Jack has never talked to her, but she has a lot of friends who are female athletes. She seems decently nice, however. Jack wouldn't mind swapping with her, in terms of size, she would be the easiest adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site568/2015/0401/20150401__Ionescu-0402~5.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/me...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
