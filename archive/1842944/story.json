These two were Shou Tachibana(The girl and the pilot of Unit-2) and Go Ichimonji(The boy and the pilot of Unit-1). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a helmet flew between the two of them. They turned to see a man known as Yamagishi stomping towards them. \"Go, what the hell was THAT? Are you trying to get me KILLED!?\", Yamagishi yelled. \"What are you talking about?\", Go asked. \"Don't play dumb!! The combination timing was off by .024 seconds!\", he angrily told Go. \"What makes you think it was my fault?\", Go calmly asked him. \"Who else could it have been?!\", he retorted. \"According to my calculations, Unit-3 was off by .024 seconds.\" \"What did you just say?!\", Yamagishi furiously said, before he quickly picked Go up by his collar. \"Are you trying to blame me!?\", Yamagishi yelled at him. \"Go!\", Shou said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Yamagashi!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three turned their heads to see a large muscular man wearing a mechanic's uniform. This man is Gai Daido. \"Could you two get out of the way? I have to repair the damage you guys did to Unit-3.\", Gai asked Go and Yamagishi, who released his hold on Go almost as quickly when he grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and Shou to Commander Jin's office.\", an intercom said. \"<i>What could he want with us at a time like this?</i>\", Shou thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sometime later...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rift?\", Go curiously repeated after his commander told him about a rift that is causing panic. In front of him sat a man that if you looked straight in the eyes, you'd see death and wisdom in them. This is Jin Hayato, former pilot of Getter-2. Jin nodded. \"Yes, a rift in time and space, to be exact.\" \"So, anything could come out of this 'rift'.\", Shou said to Jin. \"Exactly. Thus, you'll go to this spot.\", Jin said as he told the duo what to do. \"Can we bring the Getter?\", Go asked. Jin looked at him. \"Uh, in case something happens, Sir.\", Go quickly added after Jin's cold stare reached his eyes. \".......Very well.\" Go &amp; Shou were about to leave Jin's office when he said \"One more thing.\" The two turned to face him. \"<i>What else could want us to know?</i>\" \"Yamagishi will not join you for missions anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", Go and Shou nearly shouted. Although the two hated him, they wondered why he won't join them for missions. Jin raised his hand to silence the two. \"Yamagishi is emotionally unstable. Therefore, he was honorably discharged and a Mr. Gai Daido will be the pilot of Unit-3 now.\" Seeing their shocked faces, he added \"While he has failed the Intelligence and Speed Tests, Gai got a perfect on the Power.\" Jin sighed. \"Besides, his heart is in the right place, and that alone is good enough for me. You may leave.\" After Go and Shou left, he stood up and looked out the window. \"<i>Heh. A battle hungry kid, a sharp-minded girl, and a man with a big heart. Reminds me of the old days.{/}\" Jin thought, reminiscing about fighting in Getter Robo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few hours later)(Hey, fixing up a giant robot takes time!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant robot was flying over Japan.<br>\r\nIt was colored dark blue(Top half) and rad(Lower half). It also has finned blades on its forearms, along with a 'crown on its head. This is Neo Getter Robo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel, Gai?\", Go asked through the interface. \"How does what feel?\" \"Piloting your 'love', you idiot!\" \"Well, its like a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gai, how much did you repair this thing?\", Go asked, wondering if this would be his last flight. \"Well, considering that some of the parts damaged are hard to find, I'd say I repaired about 85% of the damages. So, don't worry about being destroyed so easily!\", Gai responded, getting teary-eyed about thinking of the damages done to his machine. \"Target is in sight. Get ready, you two!\", Shou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio saw with their own eyes a crack near a street. Although normal to have cracks in streets, what WASN'T normal about this one was the fact that it was in mid-air, almost as if someone cracked the air itself. People stood near it, wondering what the heck is it. \"I'm getting weird energy readings from that hole, so say cautious!\", Shou warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the crack widened and spat out.........                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </i></span></div></div>",

Not much else so have at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1.) No cursing<br>\r\n2.) No sex or nudity of any kind<br>\r\n3.)No death of any main character even if they are your own.(Violence is allowed but keep it moderate)<br>\r\n3.) you may include your own characters but be as descriptive as possible. e.c. Miley is a female hedgehog that wears a yellow dress. She is a very cheery type of girl and her best friend is Scott. (you don't have to format it like this but please make at least three descriptive sentences)<br>\r\n4.) Have fun.  (if you are not sure about something just ask me.<br>\r\n5.) Please don't make any over excessive options or you will ruin the story for everyone. Just keep it simple other stories will have other options.<br>\r\n</td>",
