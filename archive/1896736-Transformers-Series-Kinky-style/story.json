            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slipstream stood inside her elevator in a annoyed yet embarrassed silence. She could not believe what her superiors at Destron Incorporated had authorized over the weekend. When she opened her email she received a notice regarding a change in the company's dress code directed to the female staff. While they still had to wear business suits the new regulations stated that the tops of their shirts had to remain open during office hours and all forms of underwear were prohibited. In short, they had to expose their breasts during their work hours. Upon reading this Slipstream thought this was some sort of sick joke but given her superiors' response to those with similar opinions it became apparent that this was no prank. Seeing as she wanted to keep her job Slipstream swallowed her pride and complied with the new dress code before setting off to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Slipstream arrived at her office building she unbuttoned her top and allowed her breasts to fall free into the open. Almost immediately after opening her top the male staff had began to stare at her with hungry eyes. Slipstream ignored them but could still feel their predatory gazes directed as her before she entered the main elevator and ascended to one of the higher floors. If there was any silver lining regarding this new policy it was that all her co-workers in her department were female so she wouldn't feel any lingering male stares whilst performing her duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator slowed to her designated floor Slipstream took a deep breath and decided to act as if nothing was out of the ordinary when she exited the lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Slipstream.\" She spoke aloud to herself. \"Let's just get through this and eventually you won't even notice the difference. Just keep calm and do your work as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened she found herself in a sea of women who were also following the new dress code as all their tits were out for any and all to see. Some had natural small breasts while others had much larger busts. The very sight before her caused Slipstream to shiver as she felt her insides become hotter with erotic desire. She suppressed these feelings and carried out on making her way to her office without glancing at any other topless co-worker. After a short walk she found her cubical and placed herself in her office chair. By now Slipstream was sweating and could feel her inner thighs become wet yet continued trying to ignore her urges as she activated her desk's laptop and began working on her files. She didn't get much work done before she heard someone knocking on her cubical wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? Who is it?\" She called. A moment later the person in question revealed to be Black Widow, her black and gold colored co-worker. The spider was also dressed in accordance with the new regulations and had her impressive rack on display. Slipstream flinched, biting her lip to contain her increased arousal, when she saw her friend's chest before asking what her friend wanted to see her for. Black Widow smirked. \"Well I saw you shaking outside the elevator and wanted to see if you were alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow was no fool and could tell the new dress code was driving Slipstream crazy. She knew that if no consequences existed her friend would be diving at her and begging for sex. This was becoming more evident when Slipstream stuttered through her response to Black Widow's concerns. \"I-I'm fine. Just a little h-hot right now. The new d-dress code has me a bit f-flustered is all. I'll g-get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow smirked, her suspicions now turning true, as she accepted her friend's explanation and went on her way returning to work as normal. With the spider gone Slipstream took a moment and sighed with relief before returning to work.</span></div></div>",

See was so happy she were with women and see so many breasts made her image being in bed with many of them and all having sex together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, a little more just a bit more,\" moan Slipstream as she was reaching the climax point.

Look down she saw she made a big wet spot and blushed very embarrassed on now naughty and bad she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLick her hand clear and moan as her own taste of cum, she try to get back to work, but her mind what filled with want sex with other femmes and have a orgy with many of them.</span></div></div>",

Once the co-worker was out of sight Slipstream would find herself once again masturbating inside her work space praying that she was never caught. When it was nearing her first break she had already orgasmed several times and her body was beginning to reek of sex. It was much to her relief when her break started that she was able to make her way to the nearest restroom and take care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen entering the restroom Slipstream went for the nearest empty stall and locked the door behind her before resting upon the toilet seat. By now her hormones were driving her mad and she could not restrain herself any further in wanting to masturbate once more. She pulled down her skirt and panties to her ankles and began rubbing her fingers against the folds of her moist and heated pussy while stimulating her clitoris. The moment of contact brought a sense of relief to the purple office worker as she continued to rub her privates. Since Slipstream was within a public restroom she couldn't risk anyone knowing what she was doing and tried to keep her volume to a minimum as well as her finger movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she began inserting her fingers into her now leaking cunt Slipstream heard a noise that made her shutter in fear. The main restroom door had opened and she could hear the sound of several footsteps entering the room. She couldn't recognize the voices of the new arrivals but listened while continuing the thrust her fingers in and out her throbbing pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you hear what happened to Nightbird?\" One of the new arrivals asked only to receive a pair of \"no's\" as a response. She went on to tell her story of the grey and black intern. \"Well just this morning she was working in the company casino lounge and I found her in the break room. She was gasping for air and was covered in male spunk. When I asked her what happened she told me how she and a few others were punished for not complying with the new dress code. The boss' had her stripped of all clothing except for a pair of leggings, a bra, high heels, and a pair of PlayMech bunny ears. They even took her mouth guard. She told me how the male staff kept groping and fucking her until she was left in the state I found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god!\" One of the listeners gasped. The other one remained silent, unable to speak on her shock and disgust to her friend's tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipstream, however, couldn't help but become more aroused by the story despite its context. While she felt bad for her friend her current state of mind could only imagine herself in Nightbird's position and being fucked by her fellow staff members. She was so entranced by her fantasy that she had forgotten to keep her finger movements and voice down. By the time she realized what she had done it was too late and the group outside was aware of her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who's in there?\" One of them asked. \"What are you doing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipstream panicked. She was cornered and had no clear way out of her current predicament. She had two choices. Either admit it's her in the stall or pray for a miracle.</span></div></div>",
