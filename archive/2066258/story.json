Its contents had been scattered on the concrete; soil, roots, and tattered leaves smashed into the ground by uncaring footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze rose, and peering into the little shop, her pulse took an uptick. The place looked to have been looted.

Kayla shouted, \"oh no, no no no NOOO\" as she tried to break free of the female zombie's grip, but far too late Kayla felt the penis rammed into her, \"AHHAHA\" Kayla screamed thinking nothing could get worse the female zombie who Kayla saw had a name tag with Jenny written on it leaned down and started kissing her, Penny's breath was foul, Kayla was losing strength her body now reacting to the pumps of the male zombie, her breasts jiggling up and down with the movement. The zombied Penny's lips where still locked to her's, Kayla was now in ecstasy and that's when she climaxed along with the male zombie, Kayla whom's eyes were closed and panting from the sexual charge didn't see a change come over the undead Penny and Male zombie before Kayla could overcome her sexual arousel Zombie Penny and Ted attacked her, \"AHHHH-\" her scream was cut short as both Penny and Ted bit into her flesh and devoured her leaving blood splatter all over the ground and turned tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Earth 74312.11 (A world where the zombie apocalypse didn't take place)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla entered the cafe and walked up to the counter to be welcomed by women who Kayla guessed to be in her early to mid 20s \"Hello, My name is Penny, what is your order today?\" \"Yes hello could i get a iced caff\u00e8 latte please\" Once getting her latte Kayla and being shown to a table by a Waiter named Ted, Kayla sipped her iced latte, all of a sudden Kayla shivered as though a coldness watched over her, 'odd?, its not that cold for this part of the year?     </span></div></div>",

She was too busy staring out the front window. Something had happened out there, in front of the cafe. She didn't know how she knew that, but she did. Call it intuition, revelation, it was all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latte, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said your latte's ready,\" the waiter named Ted said. He stood proffering the cup to her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, sorry. Daydreaming, I guess.\" She took the cup and looked upward, flashing an appreciative smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which soon withered and died as she took in the grotesque figure that stood before her. Tattered waiter's uniform showing ribs pressing through rotting flesh, a face brown and weathered, stretched too tight, with no lips, empty eye sockets staring. The stench of dead meat filled Kayla's nostrils and she had to fight the urge to puke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay,\" came the death-distorted voice of Corpse-Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla blinked and when she opened her eyes, she saw Ted. Regular Ted. Not dead Ted, looking at her with genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kayla said cautiously, \"long day at the office. I thought I saw...never mind.  You know what, I changed my mind about the latte. Here,\" She fished through her purse, pulled out the first bill she grabbed, a twenty, and thrust it at Ted. As soon as he plucked the bill from her hand, Kayla slid from the booth and nearly ran through the door out into the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed loud, the honking of cars, the chattering of passerby. Even the sound of the Autumnal wind, blowing scattered leaves down the sidewalk proved too much for her senses and she swayed like a drunkard, fell to her hands and knees. Panting, she looked around her at the city, but it was dead now, no people. Rusted cars lined the streets. shattered windows, And the living dead, roaming freely through the streets, shambling, moaning. Then the vision shifted and she saw her. Not <i>her</i> her, but another her. An alternate Kayla that looked and dressed exactly the same. She was flanked by two zombie who Kayla recognized as Ted and Jenny. Kayla, the real Kayla, unable to push the vision from her head, watched in horror as the two dead cafe employees approached her hapless doppleganger, one ripping Kayla's shirt and bra off, the other grabbing her skirt. Kayla watched in horror as her other self was raped, molested, and eventually devoured by the undead fiends. And once finished, they stood, their decaying bodies tensing. They spun with more agility than one could imagine and spotted Kayla, still on her hands and knees. They moved then, in lock step, half shambling, half sprinting, eyeing their next victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla screamed as the two zombies grabbed at her clothes, but before she could fall victim to the same fate as her other self, the vision ended. Kayla was lying on her back in the middle of the sidewalk. She struggled to her feet and looked around, relieved to find everything was normal. No zombies, no deserted city. Everything was as it should be. Well, almost everything. A little ways off, about where her other self had met her demise in Kayla's crazy waking nightmare, was a large fissure that split the sidewalk. A strange red glow radiated out from the crack, calling to her, beckoning her closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Kayla do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

One of the gang members spoke to her \"Good allow us to do this too you and we won't touch the girls\" he laughed evilly. Jackie turned too look at Ashley 'i'm sorry Ashley had tears running down her face Jackie continued \"but we need to get out of here, were is this secret passageway out\" Ashley composed herself and stood up. The room they were in was an old study Ashley walked up to a bookcase and started count the books across the middle shelf before stopping at a book which Jackie could see read 'Gulliver's travels' and pulled it slightly there was a click sound and the bookcase opened inwards showing a hidden staircase she placed the book back to its proper spot on the self. \"Come on\" Ashley whispered lightly grabbing Jackie's hand who blushed from the contact. They both walked into the hidden passageway which closed behind them. Lucky for them it was light in the passageway allowing them to see the stairs that they were walking down as they went downwards it began to get narrow soon the stairs stopped leading to a small room, the room didn't have much in it besides a table with a chair there was also a car on the other side of the room was a garage door and a door. \"We can get out there\" Ashley pointed at the door. \"What about the car?' Jackie questioned \"My uncle said that he hides the key to the car somewhere on the desk\" Ashley replied.      </span></div></div>",

Ashley little sister is eleven years old and her name is Kelly. The girls manage to find an abandon grocery store. They also find just shoes for Ashley and Jackie to wear. However no other clothing is found. They do find a couple of backpacks. The girls fill up the backpacks full of food. They quickly leave. They don't want to stay one place to long. They head back into the woods. The girls are heading to Jackie's dad hunting cabin. The girls find a small cave. Jackie quickly camouflage the entrance. The girls spend the night in the cave. The next morning the girls run into the two old guys plus one of their sons and two grandsons. The guys could a either help them or be mean to them.

Emily feels a mixture of emotions as she feels her brother entering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their uncomfortable taboo embrace is short-lived, as they find themselves trapped inside of a see through bubble. The bubble traps the naked siblings inside of it and neither of them have much room to move, but they can breath, talk, turn their head a bit, and even move their pelvis around. Unfortunately, the ability to move their pelvic areas around leads to other problems. As the taboo couple try not to go further into each other, a huge zombie walks up to them, grabs the tight bubble they are in and says in broken English, \"Look here; I have caught a human couple in the act of breeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The 55-foot command zombie alien takes them back to its ship, along with other living naked survivors. The nude siblings see their unharmed, hot naked mom among the living human prisoners. She is also trapped in a bubble and alive. The siblings and their mom are...</span></div></div>",

Hundreds of safe-zones, fortified cities, and towns have been established throughout North America. Thousands of farms have also been secured as well. Large concert walls surround these secured areas, and they now resemble ancient castles. Outside of these walls is the unsecured zones, where hordes of the undead walk around, along with a few million unfortunate living humans. The military transports food, medicine, and other supplies from one secure area to the next. Every State and Province has at least one major city, along with several towns, villages, and farms that are secured-zones, but most of the country is unsecured. Denver is the new capital of North America. Inside these secured zones, life is starting to return to normal, and most human zombies are stupid, for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Outside in the unsecured zone, a nearly invisible flying saucer rests near an old farmhouse. An eerie full moon now hovers over the countryside. The UFO's three occupants have just returned a hillbilly named Herb to his house, and are returning to their ship. These three aliens are unaware that a zombie outbreak has occurred on Earth. As the aliens walk to their ship, they see movement in the woods, and a group of the undead attacks them. The aliens manage to fight off the zombies, but not before all three of them have been bit. The three of them quickly bored their ship, and take off before a large horde shows up. The alien ship is about to leave the Earth's atmosphere, when it suddenly loses control and crashes near a lake or the beach, very close to a secure area. Some foliage hides the nearly invisible alien ship, as a door opens up, and three alien zombies emerge. These alien zombies are still intelligent, and can now control the lesser human zombies. They also have limited mind control abilities, they can shape shift for a bit, and they can become invisible at will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before we go on, these undead, horny, hungry, zombie aliens in their natural form look like what?</span></div></div>",

The walls of this safe zone secure the town, 2 lakes, a river, and over 30 square miles of farming land. Thirty human zombies that the aliens control now are surrounding them. These three aliens are driven by hunger just as the human zombies are. These undead aliens have to feed and they can easily swallow two adult humans whole, just like a big snake can, and they have a strong sexual hunger, unlike most of their undead human counterparts. These aliens need to feed on living human sexual fluids and flesh from time to time, in order to maintain their intelligence. If they do not feed regularly on the sexual fluids of living humans, both genders, their minds will rot, and they will become as dumb as the human zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n These three shape-shifting aliens resemble the Prawns from the movie District 9, only they stand around 10 feet tall, but they can increase or decrease their size at will. They also have long, vacuum like tongs in their huge mouths. They also have limited mind control abilities, and telekinesis. The three aliens can also become invisible at will. The three undead aliens send their human zombie slaves over to their ship, and order them to guard it. Alone for now, the three undead aliens press a button on their wrists, and become temporally invisible. They also easily walk through the wall without causing any damage to it.

You can either be a zombie or a survivor, The story can be written in first person or third person. The choice is your own. Pretty much anything goes. The only exception being is no poop, pee, diapers, boogers, or characters under the age of 7 if its perverse. Zombie children are ok though. Once a character has a name and an age please don't change it, as this is a Zombie story Deaths are more then fine, they are a necessity.  Finally Please have fun and enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies would prefer to eat humans with no clothes but its up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions please don't hesitate to email me.</td>",
