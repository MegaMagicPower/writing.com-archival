He was swept up by the strong wind that happened that faithful. Luckily for him, he was used to be a speck in his home and having to survive not getting stepped on or eaten by his family so his survival skills are quite handy for himself. On this journey of his he learned a couple of new things about himself. Hes able to withstand a huge amount of pressure and being attacked by predators of the insect world. Which to him it means he is indestructible and another fun fact he learned he can understand all insects making him never lonely in this gigantic world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past months, he has been living within the tall grass within a far section of the city's park that has been neglected by the park ranger and the citizens of the city allowing the bugs to fully take over. From the bugs, he learned new survival skills them. Yet due to his sense for adventure, he longs for more so that on that day he decided to venture on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy hops onto a nearby fly and asks it for a ride. The fly at first refused by soon gave in as it flew off to the distant allowing Timothy the adventure he has always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did they go?</span></div></div>",

As the fly soars around Timothy notices a couple of people sticking around. A young boy playing in the playground, a tall hairy muscular man with a beard in a loose white t-shirt with a navy blue button-up striped shirt telling the same boy in the playground that they are leaving soon. In a bench nearby is a very formal looking man eating food from a tray he got from the food truck. Lastly is a sweaty muscular man wearing skin-tight clothing ordering a hot dog from the hot dog stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a large blue jay is flying right behind Timothy and The Fly that when the fly finally reacted it managed to knock Timothy right off of it. \"Oh god, I knew shouldn't be staring at the other people\" spoke Timothy under his breath as he looks where he is heading. </span></div></div>",

He was in his mid-30s, very tall, masculine, with a great beard and, clearly, bulging pecs that Timothy crashed right into. Tim yelled out in pain as he hit the chest of this giant man, but was able to prevent himself falling for now by grabbing onto the massive tree-sized strand of the chest hair. As the father walks with his son back to the car his pecs began to bounce with each step as Timothy holds on with all his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But had the handsome, bear-like father noticed the impact on his chest?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while of flying, Tim dozed off, but eventually he was woken up by the sound of a frisebee flying just overhead. He looked around and realised the fly had flown him all the way to the beach! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shrugged, pretty excited by this development. His family had never let him go anywhere on his own, really, let alone the beach! He asked the fly to slow down a little and the fly acquiesced, slowing down just enough for him to get a good bead on what was going on. It was a busy day. There was an African-American family of 3 nearby; two sons, one an older teenager of maybe 18, a handsome father who didn't look much older than 40. Two Caucasian males lying very close to each other, both looking fairly masculine, one easily 6'4''; not displaying much outward affection but clearly together, but Tim guessed they might be gay; and some muscular hunky jock-types exercising at a small outdoor gym right next to the beach itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly, though, was headed for an ice-cream stand, which included a surprisingly handsome vendor, also Timothy's age, and a loooooong line of people of all sorts of backgrounds and with all sorts of different companions - friends, families, what looked like two members of a sports team given their matching outfits... so many different people he could drop in on. Timothy had a choice - where could he go? He could more or less go anywhere, see anyone - become an almost literal fly on the wall of ANYBODY'S life. It was a strange kind of power, especially for one so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where was that power going to take Timothy today? The world was his oyster.</span></div></div>",
