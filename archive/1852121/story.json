Because of this Lucy didn't need to go onto missions to get money for her rent, so for the last month she had been only feasting and lazing around, doing nothing but stuff her face. This showed clearly in her physique, her formerly slim, 103lbs body filling out, gaining 30lbs to her formerly thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of a mirror, prodding and probing certain areas of her body that had widened and softened. Her formerly flat belly had gained a soft layer of pudge to it and her breasts going up a cup size. But most of her gain was in her ass, it being nicely sized for a girl her age before, now having gained a serious ghetto booty. Her tighs had widened slightly to accommodate for her larger behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was always pretty slim, even though she had the best cooks when she was little and living at the Heartfilia mansion. The food in the guild wasn't exactly made for dieting either, but she had managed to keep her slim but curvy figure. So having gained weight was something new to her, never having any excess to her body before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This person was Lucy Heartfilia, a Celestial Mage and as of a few months ago local fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of Team Natsu being temporarily disbanded because Natsu wanted to train she didn't go on any missions, allowing the pounds to pile on. Erza went on a S Class mission and Gray, not wanting to be weaker than Natsu went training to. So she was left at the guild with nothing to do but stuff her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown immensely over the last few months, her belly becoming a small gut and her breasts growing until they were the size of prized melons. Most of the weight was located below the waist though, as she sat down on two chairs because her ass was too big for one. Her tighs were now constantly connected, forcing her into a waddle and preventing her knees from touching each other. Her calf's were the size of a thin girls tighs and ended in pudgy little feet. She had gained a small double chin and pudgy cheeks, complimenting her soft figure. Lucy's arms had also swelled, burying any muscles she had in them in soft, jiggly tissue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer failed workout attempt months ago was the only effort she made to lose weight, and now after she had gotten so big she had to admit to herself that she kind of liked the feeling of her fat. Lucy had to admit to herself that the feeling she had when her entire body entered a jiggling motion was incredible and the constant rubbing of her tighs was quite *ahem* erotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now she embraced every new pound, and was waiting on the next to be added to her expansive frame. </span></div></div>",

She loved to read about stories and take notes to hone her craft in writing her own novel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Fairy Tail Archives are loaded with books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter winning the Magic Games against Sabertooth and thwarting the Eclipse Plan by the corrupt Council Knight Arcadias, Fairy Tail got their winning purse and bought back their old Guild hall, which was foreclosed on earlier due to debt. It took a while, but thanks to everyone's help, the Guild managed to bring the old Guild hall back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy chuckled when Erza used the idea of competition for Gray and Natsu to help with cleaning, dusting, and arranging furniture. Those two can do great things when they put their minds to it...and when it's against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two will never change,\" she smiled. As she dragged the wheely ladder across the racks of books in the library, she began to climb the long wooden ladder at the \u201cG\u201d Section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember there was a new novel here called the \u2018Great Galen\u2019 around here somewhere,\u201d pondered the blonde to herself. \u201cIt was released sometime while we were trapped at Tenroujima. Oh\u2026\u201d She pouted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Makarov didn\u2019t buy the \u2013\u201c Her train thought stopped. Why would Makarov buy a novel. The only literary item he would buy would be swimsuit magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past the old geezer,\u201d muttered Lucy to herself as she began to climb back down, past the \u2018Gr\u2019 to the \u2018Gl\u2019 and her leg accidentally slipped on the ladder peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ceep!\u201d Her hand instinctively reached out to grab something, in this case a book, but it fell down with her. \u201cKyaaaah! H-H-Help!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the book that she reached out was wrapped tightly inside her arms, as she was curled up in a fetal position as she fell.

She'd expected it to be hard and painful, but it felt as if the floor had suddenly softened beneath her, letting her sink and slow down gently before she was lifted back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, the blonde Stellar Spirit Mage opened her eyes to see the ceiling above her. Still clutching the book under one arm against her stomach, she lifted herself up. At first, getting up felt a little unsteady. Using her spare hand however she pressed against whatever was beneath her and pushed herself up into a seated position. Beneath her, Lucy saw a group of letters. Actual letters, like you'd see in a book, that seemed so soft and comfy to touch, like a pillow. All of the letters, of course, were packed together to spell a word - \"Soft\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... That was close...\" a voice quietly sighed. Looking up, the blonde smiled a little at the sight of a blue-haired Mage. A wordsmith who'd read as many books in her lifetime as Lucy had, Lucy wasn't surprised that it had been Levy who'd saved her from hitting the floor. Most of the other girls weren't exactly interested in reading - not that it bored them, but this was Fairy Tail. Most, even the women, looked forward to drinking and fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Levy. I was worried for a second there...\" Lucy remarked as she stood up from the soft, bed-like \"Word\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Lucy, what's that book under your arm?\" Levy asked. Raising a brow, Lucy looked down and at last began to notice the book in her grasp. Feeling a little sheepish, she looked back to Levy with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess I must have accidentally taken this book down with me when I fell...\" Lucy remarked, looking back down at the book. Inspecting the book's title, the blonde couldn't help but raise a brow. \"The Glutton Grimoire? I don't think I've heard of this book before...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Levy responded as she walked closer. Standing by Lucy's side, she looked down in unison with Lucy at the book. She certainly never remembered seeing that book before, and she was pretty sure she'd read at least most of the books in Fairy Tail's library. \"I don't remember it. Think we should take a look?\".<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within the book\u2019s contents was a written red dialect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis ring a bell? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a language like that,\u201d Pondered Lucy to herself. Levy squinted her eyes and moved the book clockwise and side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Lucy I think I\u2019m looking at an alien language here or something,\u201d said Levy as she placed her index finger on the red letters. Lucy followed her finger to the red letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, should we tell Master about this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe for lets-\u201c the two were interrupted as a red light shined from the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the-\u201c Then all of sudden the letters came out of the tome and as if all the letters and characters were taken from the book and began to hover in mid-air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the girls could cry out in surprise, the letters then attached themselves to their hands and began to climb up their skin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeeeeh! What\u2019s happening!\u201d Cried out Lucy as she tried to shake off the letters from crawling on her person. She suddenly shivered as the letters, while she couldn\u2019t feel them physically, were crawling up her arm and down past her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Yelled Levy in tandem as she tried to use a spell to dispel the increasing red letters, but they kept coming and attaching themselves to the girls. The letters began to glow brighter and both girls screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the light faded both girls were waving their arms around and when Levy opened her eyes, she noticed the letters were gone from their bodies. She inspected her legs, inside her shirt and tapped the flailing Lucy\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy,\u201d she said, and the blonde stopped her hysterical screaming and blinked. She blinked at the now letter-less Levy and then down at her own form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026the letters are gone!\u201d Said Lucy as she looked around her legs, her arms, and around her midriff. Levy looked a bit sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must have been a prank,\u201d she said with puffed cheeks. \u201cShould we tell the Master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing Master HE might have been the one behind it,\u201d deadpanned Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly both girls placed their hands on their growling stomachs, having just noticed their growls and pangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t ate breakfast yet. You?\u201d Asked the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me,\u201d replied the bluenette. \u201cWanna get some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to sate their hunger before they searched for the prankster, the two young women stepped out from the library. Although normally they might have considered eating breakfast at the Guild, Natsu, Gajeel and Gray seemed to have already started a brawl of sorts. Eating breakfast in this kind of atmosphere would be too difficult, they noted as one of Gray's shoes zipped past their head and hit the wall behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should eat out, in a Caf\u00e9 or something,\" Lucy remarked, letting out a little sigh at the sight. Watching Natsu begin breathing fire encouraged Levy to nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's,\" Levy agreed as the two began to slip out of the Guild Hall, dodging the thrown chairs and occasional heaps of Gray's clothing. In spite of the loud crashing and mayhem ongoing around them, the two young women managed to just escape before they could be caught up in the chaos. It almost came naturally with Fairy Tail - when you spent this long with a group of brawlers, you learned how to escape the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I remember seeing a nice Caf\u00e9 up the road the other day,\" Levy commented, smiling as she took the lead. With Lucy quickly following, the two strode down the street by themselves under the morning sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Lucy began to hear her stomach growl again and frowned a little, rubbing it with her hand. It felt as if she hadn't eaten anything in her life. Didn't she have anything to eat last night before going to bed? Could she really get this hungry? Hearing another growl, but realizing it wasn't from her, Lucy looked over to Levy, who blushed crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess both of us must be starving. I could swear I didn't feel this hungry earlier though...\" Levy muttered, somewhat surprised by her own hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of our stomachs sound like dragons...\" Lucy joked lightly. What she didn't predict was that someone else would overhear her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls suddenly turned around, nearly dying of shock as they saw a tall and strong figure practically looming over them. A heavy coat was draped over his shoulders, his blond hair spiked up a bit, but what made him most recognizable was the lightning-bolt-shaped scar running through one eye. This person, of course, could be none other than the Master's son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Laxus! I didn't expect to see you here. I... I was just making a joke. Our stomachs have been growling since we're so hungry. We haven't had breakfast yet...\" Lucy tried to explain coherently. Raising a brow, Laxus didn't seem to be particularly amused by the joke. But then, both had gotten the feeling long ago that Laxus wasn't the joke type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So, I'm guessing there's a fight at the guild? Figures. It's always so damn loud...\" Laxus remarked, looking off to one side for a moment. He didn't seem to be particularly interested in going to the guild while there was a fight on. Lucy began to wonder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Laxus, do you want to come and have breakfast with us?\" Lucy asked, much to the surprise of Levy. Laxus observed her with a raised brow, likewise thrown a little off by the question. But nevertheless, he had an answer.</span></div></div>",

The way their stomachs were growling, Lucy and Levy could hardly even wait to start eating. As they entered the Caf\u00e9, they were immediately met with the fragrance of Oolong Tea. Lucy and Levy barely even noticed with their stomachs practically commanding them at this point, but it was more than powerful for Laxus and his Dragonslayer nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's not shi-\" Laxus paused mid-sentence as he saw Lucy and Levy quickly rush to the nearest available table. He raised a brow. Hunger didn't even begin to describe it - these two must be desperate for food, given their eagerness. Nevertheless, he shrugged his shoulders and walked over, sitting himself down in a chair with Lucy and Levy to his left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good morning good sir! I suppose these girls must be, ahem, with you?\" a waiter spoke, addressing Laxus directly as he stood by their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-With Laxus?\" Lucy exclaimed, a little surprised by the waiter's comment. Laxus gave the man a stare only a delinquent could pull off. It seemed to have the desired effect, because the man's face began to sweat bullets as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, young man. Never mind me, never mind... I suppose you three are looking to order? Perhaps you'd like our breakfast special? It consists of-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take two!\" Levy interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same!\" Lucy chimed in as well. The waiter stared, a little caught off guard for a moment.

Anything would do, really...\" Lucy answered for herself and Levy. Deciding it best not to question the two obviously eccentric girls, the waiter turned to Laxus, ready to ask if he had anything to order, only for Laxus to cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee will do. I already ate,\" he told him. Deciding it best not to speak again, the waiter quickly wrote the orders down and scurried off, ready to get their orders. In the meantime, Laxus looked back to the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't take either of you to be big eaters...\" he remarked dryly, a little bit surprised. But he didn't seem to really push the topic further. Patiently, the three waited for their orders, making some brief small talk. Eventually the waiter came back, setting down their orders for them to begin eating while Laxus had his coffee.</span></div></div>",

Basically, after the two breakfast specials, which consisted of a helping of hash browns, bacon, eggs, and buttered toast, the girls were all leaning back in their chairs, noticable rises in their midsections thanks to their stuffing of breakfast. Lucy's blue and white shirt rose a little, revealing a stuffed tummy. Levy's short orange dress made her a small bump around her abdomen as well. Both girls were relaxing back in their chairs patting their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better be careful, we might lose our figures and turn out as bad as Droy!\" Chuckled Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's eat breakfast first thing we get up, that way we won't be as hungry like this again.\" Nodded the bluenette. She turned her head towards the taller blonde Thunder mage. \"You've been really quiet Laxus. Got something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" remarked Laxus. \"Just been thinking of where to find a place to set house and what not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you live with Master?\" Asked Lucy as she sipped her water. The blonde man shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I can handle myself, although Gildarts was kind enough to let me crash at his place while he's away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good,\" said Levy. \"Looking out for family is what Fairy Tail does best.\" Laxus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Although the world passed by in seven years, for Laxus it was nearly six months. In October of X784 during the Fantasia Festival he was a power hungry maniac bent on reforming Fairy Tail by purging the weak so that only the strong can be it's members. After being defeated by Natsu and Gajeel he was exiled by Makarov and wandered around the various nations until he decided to stop for a trip to Tenroujima, right during a Guild war between his old guild and the strongest of the Balam Alliance, Grimoire Heart. He even helped his old guild defeat them and stood by them when Acnologia supposedly destroyed the island, until Mavis' spirit saved the guild with Fairy Sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before the Fantasia Festival he almost hurt Levy were it not for Gajeel taking the hit. And now, nearly half a year later for them they are just sitting down having coffee at a cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laxus?\" The mentioned blonde turned his head, his train of thought coming to an end at Lucy's voice. Now she was a newbie he once thought as merely a trophy girlfriend material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked himself mentally that he didn't come to his guild's aide during the Phantom Lord incident because he was arrogant enough to demand Lucy as his woman in exchange for his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just really quiet for some reason, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Just...thinking on things,\" Laxus went for his wallet to pay the bill for the girl's breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Laxus you don't need to do that, I mean, we can pay ourselves!\" Protested Levy, touched by the tall blonde's offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls have to worry about apartment rent and dorm payments. Gildarts lives in a paid off plaid. Besides I'm heading off on a job today so I can recover,\" said Laxus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laxus how sweet,\" said Lucy with a smile. Laxus merely shrugged as he stood up. The girls stood up, but slowly, hands on their stuffed tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, man I never felt so hungry in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah same here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter waved his arm from behind the counter. \"Thank you! Come again.\" Levy and Lucy gave their thanks as Laxus gave a grunt and a nod as he escorted the girls out. The two girls were whispering in each other's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucy, we gotta pay back Laxus,\" whispered Levy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" She replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaxus remained quiet but had a quirked eyebrow as the girls talked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we could go with him on that job. Like give him a hand or something,\" commented the Script mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? You sure? We might get in the way, I mean he's the second strongest mage in the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any other suggestions?\" And Lucy thought...</span></div></div>",

A poster upon the wall, advertising an eating competition. Both took a moment to stare and read, neither of them saying anything to one another. But in spite of themselves, both couldn't help but lick their lips. Even though they wouldn't call themselves gluttonous, something about the prospect of an eating contest enticed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eating contest... 8 o'clock tonight...\" Lucy began, her fingers gently stroking her soft middle. This wasn't the kind of thing she would have normally considered - after all, she had a figure to watch! But something in her gut encouraged her to take part. No pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner gets 1,000,000 Jewels too...\" Levy added, biting her lower lip. The money sounded interesting, but really, the promise of food seemed to catch her attention more than whatever the reward was. Noticing at last how long both had been staring, the two looked to one another and paused, as if waiting for the other to speak first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Just once couldn't hurt. And it would be nice to win that prize...\" Lucy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Levy agreed. \"I don't think pigging out once in a while is that bad\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their decision made, the two made sure to memorize the details of the poster before proceeding to walk off together, ready to continue the day.</span></div></div>",

Levy nodded in agreement, watching the chaos unfolding before them. But then, the chaos seemed almost like clockwork. In that sense it was almost a kind of orderly chaos. Almost. Breaking from their thoughts however the girls suddenly saw a wooden table fly through the air towards them. Letting out shrill screams, the two girls quickly dove to the ground as the table passed over them, crashing out the door of the guild. Lying flat on their stomachs, they both sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go back to the library and figure out what went on with that book.

For a moment everything was still a blur, but when her eyes readjusted she could see that Mirajane was standing there the same as normal.

All of a sudden her stomach felt incredibly empty as a loud growl emitted from her middle. Rubbing a hand over her soft belly, still plump from this morning's breakfast, her thoughts were mostly confusion. But in spite of her confusion at being hungry all over again despite it not having been very long, the pangs of hunger won her over and now she felt herself desiring food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, an early lunch isn't bad...\" Levy remarked, her stomach growling yet again. As she stood there, both Mirajane and Lucy carried large bags and containers filled with all sorts of ingredients. At last they seemed to notice Levy standing at the stairs, both of them looking up with a smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levy-chan, Mirajane and I were feeling hungry, so we decided to have something to eat. Do you want to join us?\" Lucy asked, raising a brow. Lucy couldn't deny her own confusion at being hungry again already, but her body was crying for food. She just wanted to stuff herself full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've decided to make a large cake! Lucy suggested we should have chocolate. Do you think that sounds good?\" Mirajane asked, smiling as she carried the bags of flour. Levy, unable to restrain herself, licked her lips excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure, that sounds good... great! I'll go get some more ingredients!\" Levy responded, quickly running into the pantry. In spite of her desire to tell them about the Grimoire, the hunger was overwhelming her common sense. Grabbing more than enough ingredients to fill her arms, Levy hastily ran back up the stairs to carry them up to the Guild's kitchen, where they were safe from the ongoing fighting at the Guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get to work! I can have a big, delicious, mouth-watering...\" Mirajane trailed off, practically watering at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mirajane, please! You're just making me hungrier!\" Lucy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sorry. I can have a big cake done in no time at all! I'll need your help though!\" Mirajane told both Lucy and Levy, who were eager to get started. For the next hour they were grabbing all sorts of ingredients and throwing them together and mixing them, going through the steps of baking the cake until eventually at last a large chocolate cake stood upon the countertop before the three young women, who were all more than eager to devour it.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t really wanted to follow through on this, but her stomach was craving the massive desert in front of her, regardless of her prior knowledge about the Grimoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not we take a layer and plant our own frosting on it,\u201d commented Lucy before Mirajane could retort. \u201cThat way we get our own equal share and our own frosting for it.\u201d She quirked her head to the side and gave an infectious grin. \u201cEveryone wins!\u201d Levy caught it, as well as the silver haired woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl I love the way you think,\u201d smiled Levy. Mirajane nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too! I\u2019ll get a spatula.\u201d Mirajane wondered over to find the cooking tool required. \u201cSo how was your day,\u201d she asked as she inspected the cooking tool shed(to think there\u2019d be a small shed for cooking tools).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we woke up, read, and went for breakfast with Laxus to avoid the chaos going on upstairs,\u201d pointed out Lucy taking her finger and taking little bites of her strawberry frosting.

Each girl took to their task carefully, though all the while the three couldn't help but feel eager to simply devour the cake as it was. Their mouths watering, they hastily finished up their icing - Lucy with vanilla, Levy with strawberry and Mirajane with caramel. By the time the three girls were done, they all looked over their portions of cake with a lick of their lips. They wanted to sate their hunger <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one practically dove into their cakes without a word of warning. Lucy quickly began to take handfuls of the cake and shove it into her mouth, gulping down as much as she possibly could with each mouthful. The taste was like ecstasy to her taste buds, the flavours on her tongue more vivid than she'd ever remembered anything tasting before. She didn't know why everything tasted so incredible, but she was far too intoxicated by it to really think about it. Whatever crumbs were left around her lips as she chewed down her food was quickly licked up by her tongue, making sure she didn't even leave a piece of the cake uneaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy was no different. Levy hungrily wolfed down the food in front of her, unable to contain herself. With a seemingly bottomless appetite she tore through the cake and devoured whole mouthfuls in moments. Whatever icing and crumbs were left on her fingers were quickly licked clean. Her eyes watched for even the tiniest crumbs, seeking to devour everything before her. The taste of everything sent a shiver down her spine. It was as though she had found the nectar and ambrosia of the gods themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane was perhaps only slightly different to the other two. Though definitely absorbed by her growing hunger, every bite was followed by a moment of bliss as she savoured the incredible taste. Every mouth-watering crumb and intoxicating bite was not immediately swallowed down, but allowed a brief moment to be enjoyed as she found herself giving in to her gluttonous desires. But in a manner no different to Lucy or Levy, she left no crumb uneaten. To allow even a piece of such a delicious treat not be eaten was a crime against humanity to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs minutes passed, the three were slowly beginning to finish up their rather large portions of cake. Each of the three young women showed definite signs of their gluttony. Though Mirajane was left with merely a bloated belly, having been under the effects of the Glutton Grimoire for a shorter time, both Lucy and Levy sported swollen stomach distending into their laps, a layer of soft pudge coating their bodies. Their thighs and hips seemed thicker, but it was definite that both girls had gained substantial weight. What they could initially pass off as just a full stomach was now a sure sign of weight gain.</span></div></div>",

Whether it was because of the huge meal they'd just finished or the lingering influence of the Glutton Grimoire, they each dreamt of an endless land of sweets and desserts. They dreamt of lakes of caramel and toffee clouds. They dreamt of palaces of gingerbread and forests of taffy. They dreamt of blizzards of ice cream and seas of liquid chocolate. Intoxicating, euphoric gluttony consumed their thoughts as they all dreamt of wondrous deserts that, alas, could only exist in fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed in her sleep, shifting a little for comfort beneath Levy's form. Her chest rose and fell like wandering clouds, with Levy's face resting upon her breasts as though they were pillows. Lucy's arms draped around the blue-haired girl, embracing and holding onto her like a child would clutch a teddy bear going to bed. Hours passed as they slumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of a sudden, Lucy's body felt warmer. Something soft slipped over her and Levy's figures. Wearily an eye began to flutter open, though the effort of doing so was akin to Atlas' lifting the world on his shoulders. A vague blur hovered above, pulling a sheet over her figure. Her eyes shut for a moment, but then her eyes began to pull open - not yet wide awake, but catching a glimpse of the figure as her mind deciphered the colours and shapes before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lax... us?\" her voice whispered, barely making a sound. But the blond figure hovering over her heard and paused, looking down into her eyes. He seemed to mumble something, but Lucy didn't quite catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to wake you...\" Laxus spoke, his stronger voice making a presence even as he tried to whisper. But the other girls had also begun to awake. Mirajane, lying across the couch opposite, began to move her arms to wipe away the tiredness from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...? What are...\" Mirajane paused, letting out a tired yawn as she brought her hands down from her eyes. \"What are you doing here...?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laxus is here...?\" Levy muttered, still not quite in her head. But a few moments passed as realization dawned on her. She realized just how... Intimate her cuddling with Lucy looked. Letting out a surprised yelp Levy lifted herself up, now kneeling on the couch with one leg on either side of Lucy's frame. Her cheeks turned red, but she took a moment to notice the blankets draped over them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, look, I just noticed you three snoring in here and I thought I'd give you each a blanket... I mean, a couch isn't much of a bed, is it?\" Laxus defended himself, letting out an irritated sigh. But the irritation was faked - the three girls could tell. He was a nicer person than he let on. Looking up towards him, Lucy smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Laxus... Oh, wait!\"</span></div></div>",

Long tables had already been prepared, but the chefs were all busy in the kitchens getting ready to prepare the incredible feast that would begin soon. A table for sign-ups had already been set up by the entrance and plenty of people both fat and thin were signing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving it all, of course, were two young girls determined to win the contest. The two of them had both changed into new clothes that gave their figures a little more freedom - Lucy's outfit consisted of a blue and white tank top that held in her shapely breasts whilst exposing her soft, round belly that dipped over the edge of her blue mini-skirt. Her skirt just barely covered her bottom as her hips and backside had become a bit more prominent following her earlier eating sessions. A pair of white stockings stretched up her long yet chubby legs, ending just short enough to expose some skin between the stockings and her skirt. Lastly she wore a pair of blue shoes, along with a blue ribbon in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy, meanwhile, had tied back her blue hair in a ponytail with her bangs pulled into two additional side-tails that framed her face. Her outfit consisted of an orange tank top with separate orange sleeves bound to her upper arms that covered the length of her arms. Her doughy middle distended and hung down in front of her, hanging over her orange short-shorts. Her legs were left bare otherwise, with orange shoes covering her feet. Levy silently stared at her own middle, poking it gently with a finger. She could have sworn she was going to mention something earlier, but now it seemed as if the only thing she could think of was her own desire to eat. Part of her just wanted to begin the contest already, just so she could stuff herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already signed up, now we just have to wait for Laxus...\" Lucy commented, her cheeks blushing red a little as she thought of the blond. He really wasn't as bad a guy as he seemed - in spite of his abrasive nature, he was truly kind. There was a time when she couldn't understand how he and the Master were related, but now it made too much sense not to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy looked over to Lucy as she was lost in thought, catching a glimpse of the round and soft stomach she now sported. Levy couldn't deny that there was a part of her that had always been attracted to Lucy. Lucy possessed a quality in her that Levy couldn't quite put into words, but it made her overwhelmingly glad that she'd gotten the chance to meet Lucy. The blonde was simply beautiful, yet ever since they had begun to gain weight Levy found herself catching glances of Lucy's curvier form. But before Lucy noticed Levy would always turn back to Lucy's face, if only to admire how round and chubby her features had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they'll be here shortly. Look!\" Levy spoke, pointing down the street. The two girls stared down and smiled before giving waves to the two figures that were walking towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, of course, was the tall and muscular Laxus, who instead of looking irritated or stone-faced actually possessed a small smile on his face. Beside him walked the white-haired beauty of Fairy Tail, Mirajane, who now wore a red bikini top that left her belly completely exposed. Though not as prominent as Lucy or Levy's, it was certainly nothing less than pudgy. Covering the woman's lower body was a red sarong that flowed around her, possessing a single slit down the side of her left leg that allowed her to occasionally show some skin as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Laxus addressed them, waving back to the two girls. \"It's going to start soon, isn't it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Lucy replied, smiling as she looked up to the taller blond man. \"You're just in time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect to see you here, Mirajane,\" Levy remarked to the white-haired woman with mild surprise. Mirajane smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laxus asked if I wanted to come as well, so I thought I should. I wanted to see you two do your best!\" Mirajane remarked. But even as she said that, she could sniff the scent of food that lingered in the air. All of a sudden it felt as if her stomach was begging her to find whatever it was and devour it. She kept a straight face, but now a sudden hunger had taken over her. Her mouth was already watering. She wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I just had a thought! Mirajane, do you wanna join the contest too?\" Lucy asked, raising a brow. Mirajane looked to the blonde and for a second she pondered the question. With her hunger now making itself known again, would she try joining up if only to sate it?</span></div></div>",

I appreciate the offer though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaxus added in. \u201cYeah, and besides it\u2019s duos, not trios unfortunately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, duh,\u201d Lucy bonked her head playfully. \u201cMy fault there, I forgot.\u201d The white haired woman waved her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You two get ready, as for me.\u201d She stretched her arms out. \u201cI\u2019m going to get something from concessions. You want some booze Laxus?\u201d She turned towards the much taller man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust some beer I guess, I\u2019ll pay ya back afterwards if that\u2019s fine,\u201d shrugged the tall blonde. Mirajane nodded. \u201cGood luck you two!\u201d With that Mirajane trotted off to find the find the snack shack. The lightning mage and the celestial spirit mage stood along with the script mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you two get ready. I\u2019m gonna find some spots to sit.\u201d Lucy nodded at Laxus\u2019 suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right Lu-chan. We gotta take our seats at the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it Laxus,\u201d The man turned around. \u201cOh! One more thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d He turned his head. Lucy blushed a little and turned her eyes away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for coming\u2026It um\u2026\u201d She absently scratched her girth a little. \u201cMeans a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d Levy broke out into a huge grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more agreeable than Gajeel that\u2019s for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaxus grinned, although deep in his heart he felt a pang of guilt at what she said. After all, he did try to hurt her back seven years ago when he was in his \u201cpower-over-all\u201d stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d His small grin and nod was all that was needed and he worked his way through the crowd to find Mirajane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we better get our seats Lu-chan.\u201d The blonde girl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it Levy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found themselves signing up, then wearing unique tags on their shirts, and making their way to a nearby long table. Up above the table was a huge sign with three sections:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourse 1: Fruits and Appetizers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourse 2: Main Course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal Course: Dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo three stages huh? Not a problem,\u201d said Lucy with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? I mean, we did eat a lot today. Maybe we should have-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat starve ourselves and waste away? Pfft yeah right!\u201d Scoffed Lucy. \u201cI got curves to worry about after all to up my sex appeal~.\u201d She made a pose putting her hand behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy rolled her eyes and grumbled. Lucy turned towards her slightly shorter friend. \u201cBut hey Levy-chan, you\u2019re not all bad yourself. You got a nice butt forming~.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow THAT made the bluenette blush. \u201cS-Shut up I-\u201c She couldn\u2019t find the words. She liked what Lucy was saying to her, but out in public where people could listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey it\u2019s starting!\u201d The blond whispered into  her friend\u2019s ear, gaining her attention at the announcer walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome! Today is the beginning of the 1st Annual Moon Festival, and to kick start the week of family fun, we are proud to host the main event of the first day: The Tri-Cycle Eating Contest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t there be a tricycle then?\u201d Whispered Levy into Lucy\u2019s ear. Lucy shrugged and her eyes scanned the crowd for Laxus and Mirajane. No sign of them yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you see above you, we have three courses! A fruit and appetizer, a main course meal, and a desert! And you have to complete this cycle three times!\u201d Lucy and Levy gave an \u201coh\u201d in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo three times the fun huh,\u201d remarked the blonde. \u201cBring it on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are also having a timed system going. If you can complete a course, you can wait until we hand you the next course and so forth. After going through the three courses three times, whoever is finished the three courses fastest or is the last one standing is the winner. Should there be a tie, then we move onto the Sudden Death Round, and those details will remain unknown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy took it all in. \"So we could just go slow and take our time as the other's stuff themselves silly, or we can bull rush through and get small breaks inbetween, along with getting the fastest time as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lucy pointed and waved towards the crowd, Levy falling her hand and seeing the tall Laxus giving a simple nod of his head in acknowledgement over the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a hand holding a drumstick waving back. \u2018Must be Mirajane,\u2019 thought the Script Mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow without any delay,\u201d the chefs brought out the plates. The first appetizer being a plate of about fourteen mozzarella sticks with marina sauce to the side, and another plate filled with eight. There was also pitchers and glasses of water nearby to help the contestants satisfy their thirst. A timer made of magical numbers appeared in the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may begin!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy and Levy decided it best not to wait the moment they were told to start. But even if they wanted to pace themselves, it seemed as if their stomachs were begging them to hurry and devour everything before them. An intense hunger took control of their bodies and now the two women may as well have been puppets dancing to the tune of their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls certainly didn't spare themselves. Lucy and Levy both would take their mozzarella sticks and cover them in marina sauce before devouring them in quick bites. One bite was never enough - one mouthful wasn't enough. Nor two, nor three, nor ten. The two girls didn't waste even a crumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, one of the two would fill their glasses to full and gulp down the entire glass of water in a matter of seconds before continuing again. Time wasn't the most important factor here - stamina was. As much as they desired to devour everything as quickly as possible, they also recognized that going through the cycle three times was going to take a toll on the capacity of their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy licked her lips after she gulped down another mouthful of food, but as she reached for her plate she found nothing was left. Levy was similarly dismayed for a brief moment, but the two were quickly gifted with the next course of their meal - plates and plates of pasta and meatballs. The two girls eyes' shone in delight at the sight, as if seeing a mystical treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls quickly dug into their food. Their forks moved quickly, fitting as much food into their respective mouths as there could be at any one time. Lucy gluttonously gobbled up generous helpings of food, with sauce staining her cheeks as she threw any sense of etiquette to the wind. She would immediately lick up any sauce left on her face, but only out of hunger rather than any embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy was no less piggish, pushing ponderous portions of food between her plump lips. Large lumps could be seen in her throat as food flowed down through her system to be digested as fat. A part of her was tempted to even do away with her utensils and just shovel everything into her mouth with her hands, but she forced herself not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy let out a brief belch after swallowing down another mouthful, causing her to blush as Levy chuckled bemusedly. Nevertheless, neither girl could afford to stop for more than a moment - the others around them proved gluttonous as well, devouring their own meals with a similar hunger. Still, Lucy and Levy felt almost as if they were only becoming more hungry the more they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the last plate of pasta and meatballs was cleaned of its contents, the dessert arrived - servings of apple pie for both girls. Neither, of course, decided to waste their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the knives they'd been offered, both girls quickly divided their pies into six large slices and one by one, the girls would force entire slices of their dessert into their mouths. A few moments would pass for them to chew the delicious pies, but they were of course unable to savour the flavour for too long as quickly enough the mouthfuls of food would be swallowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorging themselves, the two gluttonous girls were led by their greed to gobble up every last slice. They'd only just shove entire slices into their mouths before grabbing another, only to then start consuming that slice the moment they had just finished swallowing the last piece. It was almost as if they'd learned how to breathe through their noses whilst simultaneously consuming as much food as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes that felt more like moments, the trays of pie were completely empty, with the two Fairy Tail girls leaning back in their seats and patting their stomachs - both of which were already bloated and engorged. But by the end of the night, they would no doubt be far bigger - they still had two more cycles to complete.</span></div></div>",

She was taking bites from her drumstick  of chicken in between cheering, her semi-filled up tummy filled with meat and some booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he turned back to see Levy and Lucy tear into the watermelon with a gusto, going through it as fast as they did the mozerella sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he grinned a little, knowing that if they finish this contest\u2026all of that food will\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFwah!\u201d Lucy leaned back in her chair, finishing her melon clean. Levy finished just shortly after her. \u201cYou okay? Levy-chan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d She groaned back. The two of them did feel full. And they heard the crowd go crazy when one of the duos passed out after finishing their melon. But despite all of that, the two girls still felt hungry, as their filled up bellies gurgled and churned, Levy\u2019s dressed starting to rise and Lucy\u2019s skirt starting to feel tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the second course, a slab of steak with mashed potatoes and gravy, and the two girls got into it like hyenas on a carcass. They wolfed down the food fast and quick, cutting the steak up quickly into small bites, mixing them with the potatoes and gravy and stuffing them down their faces. But with the starch of the white food, another duo fell out, too stuffed to continue, and Levy and Lucy continued on, eating bite after bite after bite, their stomachs rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in three minutes, they cleared their plates, the two of them belching and stuffed, well ahead of some duos in the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls panted, holding their hands together as they rubbed their tummies to try and ease the pain. But for some reason, they\u2026sort of liked it\u2026there was a unique feeling of feeling so full and bloated, along with the pain of their taut skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is so going to my thighs\u2026\u2019 Thought Levy as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the chefs brought them the desert, two medium sized bowls of chocolate pudding with spoons as they cleared their table.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spoons may as well have been shovels. In spite of how full their bellies felt and how much they had eaten, there was still something deep within that yearned for more. Even as they filled their mouths and swallowed down so much food, they wanted more. Even as they felt their clothes become tighter, they wanted more. Even as they felt their bodies becoming softer and heavier, they wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy hungrily tossed chunks of the chocolate pudding into her mouth, gluttonously gulping it all down. Even as other duos looked to be pushed past their limits, Lucy didn't seem to have an end in sight. Her hunger simply begged her to eat more and more. Lucy was simply powerless to resist her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy, of course, was no different. The blue-haired girl simply couldn't stop herself from forcing mouthful after mouthful of the pudding down her own throat. She had passed the point of savouring food - now she just wanted to sate her hunger as quickly and effectively as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plates very quickly became empty. Bite after bite reduced the chocolate pudding down to smaller and smaller sizes until eventually not even a crumb was left of it. The girls sat back for a brief moment as the plates were taken away, with the ever-enthusiastic announcer looking eager to begin the final cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright folks, here we are! Only four duos left! Who will be the victors and take home the grand prize? Who ever lasts the longest wins! Lets begin the Final Cycle!\" he declared with enthusiasm, pointing in the direction of the kitchens as now men wheeled out carts carrying the food for the Final Cycle. As they arrived at the tables they set down the starters of the Final Cycle before each of the duos - four servings of barbecued scallops for each of the duos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, all four of the duos dug into their food. Lucy hungrily grabbed the skewers and tore the food from the skewer, trying to get it all into her stomach as quickly as possible. By all means she should have hit her limit long ago - Lucy had simply never felt this hungry, nor eaten this much food in one sitting. But something inside her willed her to eat and devour yet more and more food. Even why, by all rights, she should have stopped, she still kept eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy likewise dug into her starters, showing herself to be quite capable of keeping up with Lucy when it came to eating. Hands hungrily helped themselves to taking hold of food and cramming it into her mouth. In what was much like a flash, both girls had managed to leave the skewers looking completely bare, even as another duo ended up out of the competition, being unable to eat another bite. Almost instantly the officials took the empty plates from the duos and quickly began to bring out their main courses - whopping 28 inch diameter pizzas covered in mozzarella, tomatoes, mushrooms and pepperoni. Even as the other duos stared with concern, Lucy and Levy could only stare as their mouths watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to control themselves the two girls grabbed slices of pizza and crammed their faces full. Muffled moans of gluttonous pleasure could only barely be heard past mouths stuffed with food. Each slice of pizza was like heavenly bliss, and they had more than enough of it to spare. Lucy and Levy both let themselves become like pigs as, even with their swollen stomachs and soft thighs, neither one looked any less hungry. On the contrary, it was as if being presented with such a huge helping of food just made them even hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed stretchmarks made themselves known as their bodies just continued to pack on the pounds. Food was digested and converted into fat with each and every bite. But Lucy and Levy didn't notice, or maybe they didn't care. Even as the food showed its results on their bodies, the only thing that concerned them was devouring every last crumb and morsel of food. There was no longer even winning or losing. There was simply eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice by slice the pizza was getting smaller. What was once huge enough to feed a family was now dwindling down, becoming smaller and smaller. Now it was reduced to an almost pathetic shadow of its former self before the two gluttonous girls. And soon, even that was gone, leaving behind not even a scrap of food as the two girls devoured the last of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople watched in awe as another duo dropped out, leaving only two duos. But what fascinated them most were the two girls, previously unheard of in the realm of competitive eating. These two newcomers were outeating everyone else and it was putting people on edge with excitement. Now there was only one course left - dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore each duo was placed a pair of silver bowls, within which massive mountains of ice cream rested. Vanilla, strawberry and chocolate with a cherry on top - the sight awed the girls as they realized that these massive mounds of ice cream were for them. They didn't worry about not winning. That wasn't even on their minds. They might as well have forgotten they were in a competition - right now, there was only the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even bothering with spoons, the two girls reached into the ice cream with their own hands and shoveled it into their gaping maws. Scooping up huge chunks of ice cream in their hands they hungrily swallowed each and every handful they could grasp. From time to time they'd lick their lips and slurp in all of the ice cream that stained their mouths, but then they'd eagerly grab more ice cream and devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd even lick their fingers and hands as they found there was still more to be had. They wanted everything. Their hunger for ever more pushed them to continue even past the limits of normal people. The other duo, even as they tried to keep up, found themselves in awe of the two girls as they simply ate without stop. And if the universe would allow it, possibly without end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tense few minutes as people watched, but soon it became abundantly clear there was no longer even a contest. Before the other duo had even finished half of their desserts, the two Fairy Tail girls had devoured everything, leaving even their bowls completely bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible! Ladies and Gentlemen, the winners of our contest are the two newcomers; Lucy Heartfilia and Levy McGarden!\" the announcer exclaimed passionately. The people in the audience cheered and clapped as both Lucy and Levy leaned back in their seats, with Levy letting out a loud belch as Lucy patted her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's figure had become big and round, with her belly being her biggest and roundest feature. Her face had become round and chubby and each breast looked almost as big as her own head, but her stomach bulged outwards, sitting in her lap like a large mound of flabby flesh. She could only just wrap her arms around her own middle, finding herself completely stuffed beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy was pudgy in the middle and her chest was certainly big, but in contrast to Lucy her most prominent features were her bottom and thighs. She'd developed a pear-shaped figure from all of the stuffing and gorging and eating she'd done not just in the eating contest but in the whole day she'd spent eating non-stop. Her hips were wider than Lucy's, with her bottom like a pair of fluffy pillows. Her thighs rubbed together and Levy was certain that if she got up and walked, they would scrape against one another constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut neither complained of the excess weight they'd gained, if anything, something akin to pride welled up within them both as they looked at their figures. They took pride in their gluttony.</span></div></div>",

Say, remember that beach resort where we trained before the games?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean where we partied for one night, got drunk out of our minds, went to the spirit world and got drunk again, came back and three months went by in a blink of an eye? That resort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not.\" The two girls laughed, but both grabbed their guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...no laughing for tonight...\" Groaned Lucy, her stomach taut. As she looked down at her figure, she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jeez...how much do I weight?' Thought the Celestial Spirit Mage. 'I'm almost scared to even check. Or worse, even step on my scale back at my apartment...' Her train of thought slowed down thanks to a yawn escaping her mouth. She smacked her lips, eyelids feeling heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Said Levy, also begining to feel drowys. \"Food coma...Can I sleep at your place Lucy? Just for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Another yawn. \"Don't see why not. I do have a spare couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls managed to get to Lucy's apartment and got inside. The blonde began to strip down to her tight undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...maybe a shopping spree first wouldn't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy didn't have as much trouble, removing her dress, though her panties looked like it was bordering on thong territory, her food belly of a belly hanging over her crotch, just like Lucy's. The bluenette gave out a small burp. \"Man...if I hadn't eaten all that food, I would have thought I'd be pregnant...\" she looked over at Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone looks heavy with child too~\" Giggled the Script Mage. Lucy stuck out her tongue at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks whose talking.\" As she sat down on the bed, making it creak a bit harder than usual, she remembered Laxus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter winning the contest, both Laxus and Mirajane offered their congratulations towards the girls. Mirajane looked mildly stuffed, but looked nowhere near full capacity like the blonde and bluenette were. Laxus was smiling through it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lucy thought of his golden locks, his tight strong muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Levy.\u201d She relaxed back in her bed as Levy managed to find an extra blanket and pillow from Lucy\u2019s closet and sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie. Even when Laxus was an asshole back when I joined the guild, he looked like a stud.\u201d Levy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one. Lots of girls had their eyes on him. It was just his power hungry personality that was sort of a big turn off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr a turn on, depending on the girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that Minerva bitch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt sleep tug at her and stood up again, waddling over, belly swaying and sloshing and churning, to turn off the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first thing tomorrow\u2026\u201d She yawned. \u201cWe\u2019re going shopping for more clothes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd turning in our check and splitting it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d yawned Levy, sleep nearing her. \u201cBrunch with Laxus and Mira\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy let out a small sound of acknowledgement as she got into bed, more creaking sounds being made, and got under the covers and let sleep take over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sun shone in through the windows, casting a light upon the heavy figures dwelling within the apartment. The light bounced off of and wrapped around their plump figures, emphasizing the size and solidity of their bodies. In the pale light of the morning, the blonde's eyes slowly began to open up as she raised a pudgy hand to rub the tiredness from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Lucy began to lift herself up from the bed, continuing to rub her eyes. The blonde stopped herself, beginning to look down at her figure as she sat still in silence on the bed. She bit her lower lip, observing her size with her eyes. A hand reached and grabbed hold of her own excess, a little surprised by the sight of herself. And yet, looking back at herself last night, she couldn't help but understand why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lucy wasn't satisfied with seeing or feeling. Pushing herself up from the bed - hearing a creak as her weight left it - she stood upright on the floor, her legs taking a minute to maintain their stability. Slowly she strode across the room, passing through the door as she snuck her way to the bathroom, being sure not to wake up her sleeping and no-less-heavy friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the bathroom door behind herself, Lucy looked at the imposing figure in the bathroom that practically held a noose around the necks of people around the world - the weighing scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sat there, as weighing scales generally did. It seemed innocent and nice, but Lucy was scared nonetheless - scared of what the scale might read. Lucy suddenly began to notice just how much she was shaking, standing in just her bra and panties. But Lucy shook her head - she was determined to check, regardless of what it might say. Stepping close, she slowly rose to the weighing scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth feet stepped onto the scale, pressing their soles flatly on its surface. Her figure stood over the scale, her distended and soft stomach hanging in front of her. In spite of the fear of what it might read, Lucy dared herself to look down at the scale and read the number it held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... 220 pounds...\" Lucy remarked, looking at her full, fattened form. A plump, round stomach like she'd swallowed a barrel. Thighs that pressed against one another when she stood still. Breasts even larger than their original D-Cup size. The tips of her fingers pressed against her round stomach. She'd gotten so big, and yet... She didn't mind. Contrary to what she'd expected, there was a part of her that actually liked the sensation of fat beneath her fingertips - of her figure carrying so much... <i>Weight</i> to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're awake now...\" another voice spoke. Turning quickly, the blonde stared and gaped at the awake blue-haired girl in her bra and panties. Levy's figure was probably no less large, she understood. But Levy didn't seem to mind her extra weight - or maybe she hadn't even acknowledged it. Yet Lucy knew that Levy knew - there was no way she couldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night and had a bit of a snack... So I decided to weigh myself too. 216 pounds. I guess we've both put on a bit of weight, haven't we?\" Levy spoke, smiling a little as she stepped close to her blonde friend. Smiling up at Lucy, she spoke further. \"But you know... Even though I've gotten this big, I don't actually mind it one bit. In fact... I'm kind of excited for breakfast,\" Levy confessed, smiling as she patted Lucy's stomach. Giving her own small smile in return, the blonde nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could do with some breakfast too,\" Lucy responded, smiling.</span></div></div>",

Oh! Add in fruit too! Like strawberry or blueberry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With chocolate chips?\" Added Lucy as she bent over, her full plump rump swaying in the air. Levy's eyes traveled toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too. I heard there's a waffle house in the west side of town. Wanna head there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\" The bluenette stood up, also in her yellow undies and saw Lucy rummage through her closet, standing right behind her. She blushed and grinned seeing the ass shake and move side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou~. I don't have anything that would fit~\" She said as she held up her old white and blue T-shirt and skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know why,\" smirked Levy. Her land then went to her bum. \"Honk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep!\" Lucy flinched, straightening out and standing up. \"Levy~!\" She blushed, puffing her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the bluenette giggled. \"We're both chubsters here. We might as well wear something skimpy or wear sweats and buy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry~\" Lucy's whining correlated with her growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Levy could retort, Lucy's keys began to glow and the room glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess. Do you need assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Virgo!\" Beamed Lucy as she turned around, tummy and breasts jiggling and seeing her faithful Celestial Spirit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy stared, a little dumbstruck at the sight of her Celestial Spirit, Virgo. She was well aware, of course, that Virgo's appearance could change. She shuddered as she thought of the hulking, brutish woman she had seen in Duke Everlue's mansion. But this change still came unexpectedly, as the blonde hadn't anticipated Virgo changing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before her, the pink-haired maid still wore her french made outfit as usual. Yet in spite of how frilly the dress was, it was still undeniably obvious Virgo had grown. No longer was her waist so narrow compared to her chest and behind - now, layers of pudge caused it to bloat outwards, the black fabric of her dress clinging tightly around the curves and love handles she now possessed. The white straps of her apron dug into the soft flesh of her curvier physique, whilst her thighs now rubbed against one another whilst standing still. Her skirt rode up a little over her figure, particularly at the back where her extra pounds made her behind that bit more prominent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even in such a state, Virgo didn't seem to notice or even address it. Nor, for that matter, did she even acknowledge her master's extra weight. Lucy stared, a brow slightly raised as she looked at the maid. Levy made the same expression as she looked back and forth between the two, having been unaware of Virgo's ability to change shape. But eventually, after a brief silence, the maid spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, is there something you need assistance with?\" Virgo spoke, a brow only very slightly raised as she remained as stoic as ever. \"I heard that you wanted breakfast, but also desired clothing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, right!\" Lucy responded, breaking free from her thoughts. \"Um, Levy and I wanted to get breakfast, but our clothes...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our clothes don't really fit us anymore,\" Levy finished, gesturing to herself and Lucy. Virgo looked between the two of them and nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to bring you new clothes, princess?\" Virgo asked. Lucy smiled, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be-\" Lucy didn't get the chance to finish as Virgo suddenly vanished, popping into a swirl of magic that sparkled like the stars. Lucy stared, a brow raised for a moment. Levy looked to her, about to speak, but she too lost her chance to speak as the magic swirled into existence once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wrapped around and engulfed the two girls, catching them by surprise and causing them to yelp. The whirling magic eventually began to disperse as Virgo popped back into the world right where she had been standing minutes before. But more importantly, the magic dispersed to reveal Lucy and Levy's new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's outfit was a black, strapless dress that hugged her figure. It widened out at the hips, reaching as far as the knees, and worn over the dress was a white, long-sleeved jacket that was buttoned just beneath her breasts. The outfit felt snug around her chubby figure - not too tight, but not too loose either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy, meanwhile, was clad in a black, backless dress with a short skirt. White pinstripes ran down the dress vertically, whilst from her biceps hung black, detached sleeves. She also possessed white, thigh-high stockings that ended just short of where the skirt began. Levy looked down, running her hands over the silky fabric with a smile. It felt so <i>comfortable</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Virgo!\" Lucy remarked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have to have breakfast, though...\" Levy spoke up, feeling her stomach beginning to rumble. Lucy nodded, thinking it over for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Once you return, you are to make a large and yummy picnic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that order?\u201d Asked the plump pinkette.

She slipped once again, making her breasts quake from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well why are you so big, can't you change your form again and get back down to a thinner size?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Princess desires it,\" Virgo said plainly. She made no further attempt to move, awaiting Lucy's mental command to change her form. But, after a moment, nothing happened. \"Princess?\" she asked, not changing her expression. Lucy bit down on her lip, she just couldn't do it. In her mind, the idea of making someone get thinner, especially if they didn't want it, was repulsing her. The mere fact that she had suggested it to her made her stomach switch from ravenous hunger to self-loathing. For about five seconds, and then the cravings came right back. There was just a nagging in her mind to let Virgo stay chubby, even if it because of her unique ability. In fact, maybe that was why she had invited her to brunch, to see if the Celestial Spirit was capable of gaining weight naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, just, help us up please. Levy, how are you doing?\" Lucy asked. She got a squeal in response as Levy realized the position she was in. Resting on her stomach and boobs as she was, Levy's largest assets were on display, and her skirt was pulled up to showcase even more of her creamy, adipose-filled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second, I think I can, um, sorry Lu-chan,\" Levy said. She reached out and grabbed two thick handfuls of Lucy's proud stomach, using it to crawl on top of the blonde, so she could get purchase on the slippery ground. After a moment of pudgy prodding, leading to a lot of blushing from Lucy, she was able to stand up. Levy took the opportunity to summon some water, which helped wipe off the oil from all their backsides and let them all stand up. Lucy got herself mobile once again, holding her now sopping-wet chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Levy, a bit wet now. Can you help again Virgo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Princess,\" Virgo said, dutifully pulling the girls clothes off and replacing them with new, identical ones in a flash. However, when the light faded from their bodies, the girls saw that Virgo's maid outfit was now intentionally skimpier, showing off some of her cleavage, and even more of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's better. Okay, now we can get going,\" Lucy said, turning around for a moment to lock her door, pointless as it often was. The trembling trio made their way to the park, so they could find a good spot for the picnic.</span></div></div>",

But she did appear bigger than last night, her clothes stretched more tightly around her stomach, her boobs showing more cleavage than normal as the top was incapable of holding all of her bosom. She waved to both of them, Laxus in particular, as she, Levy, and Virgo approached the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" she said with a grin. She stopped in front of them, went to speak again, and then bent over, starting to pant. Levy came up as well, and leaned on Lucy to help catch her own breath. Virgo seemed unimpeded by her weight, not even blushing or breathing heavily. The pink-haired maid bowed to Laxus and Mirajane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning you three,\" Mira said with a giggle. \"I'm surprised to see you both so active, after that feast you had last night I would have thought you'd be sleeping for days.\" This made Levy chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, well, we were really tired last night. I actually slept with Lu-chan last night,\" she said, patting her blonde friend on the back. Laxus raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? Well, thanks for sharing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Levy said, confused. \"Oh! No, I meant I slept over at her house, I was too sleepy to make it back to my place,\" she clarified. Lucy's face was beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, sure, sure,\" Laxus replied. \"And are those new outfits as well? When did you have time to get new clothes, surely those didn't fit you before yesterday,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I created the clothes for Princess and her friend,\" Virgo said. \"These are actually the second sets, the first were made too greasy earlier. It is possible they would have slipped out of them with too much activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... huh,\" Laxus said, perplexed by the Celestial Spirit's honesty. \"So, what brings us all together now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we wanted to have a picnic with you all. You didn't eat yet, did you?\" Lucy asked. Mirajane shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only had a handful of apples, about a half a loaf of bread, and a pound or so of yogurt for breakfast,\" Mira explained. \"So I've got plenty of room,\" she added with a pat of her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because we're starving!\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls are impressive. How on earth are you still hungry?\" Laxus asked, leaning forward. Laxus' words reminded Levy about what she had figured out the day before, that the book the three girls touched was probably responsible for their intense appetites, and new plump, though admittedly sexy bodies.</span></div></div>",

She fanned it out and laid it on the grass. Then several baskets of food flashed and appeared, landing on the ground. \"There. We have several chicken and turkey sandwiches with assorted vegetables and sauces inside. Several bags of chips.\" She gestured to each basket, one filled with the plastic-covered sandwiches, the other with lots of chip bags. \"Here we have wrapped up corn dogs still warm.

Mirajane sat next to him to his right on her knees as she began to eat some rice balls. Virgo sat to his left and began to nibble on rice krispy treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets eat~!\" Cooed out Levy and Lucy as they have filled up on chip bags and sandwiches, and began to unwrap them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laxus reached for a sandwich himself. He intended to grab the one that was the most stuffed with meat, but as he looked through the food, each sandwich was incredibly thick and loaded with good, smoked meat. He grabbed a turkey sandwich and unwrapped it, sitting back on the blanket as he watched the others eat their food. It was a beautiful day for this, and he gave a short laugh to himself, surprised by how much he was already enjoying this. The sandwich was delicious, and... damn, the view was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him, Levy and Lucy were both feasting on sandwiches. He had barely finished one before they had already begun their seconds, and each appeared to have devoured a bag of chips as well. Right now, Levy was holding a sandwich in each hand, taking bites out of them in turn with a big smile on her face. Her already pudgy cheeks were constantly stuffed with delicious meat and bread, making the short girl look like some sort of pudgy chipmunk. When she wasn't taking a bite, she was letting the sandwich rest on her new shelf of a bosom, which was also holding a bag of chips that she was sneaking bites of occasionally. Laxus could see how the blanket was pulled towards where she was sitting, the big booty that was packed too tightly into her clothes was actually pressing down into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was likewise stuffing her face. She'd emptied an entire bag of chips onto a sandwich, had eaten the top piece of bread, and then smashed another sandwich on top of it. The blonde took the giant sandwich and managed to take a chomp. Laxus swore he could actually see her belly extend a bit from how big the bite was. She pulled it away with a happy moan and licked a dallop of sauce off of her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, these are delishus Virgo, good job!\" Lucy said, putting her sandwich down for a bit, to grab a corn dog, smother it in ketchup, and take a bite. Laxus couldn't help but stare as she slid a good four or five inches of the dog into her mouth before sucking the dog down, chewing it in a few bites, and swallowing. But, he then turned his attention to Virgo. When had she gotten so big? Granted, he didn't see the pink-haired maid often, but he could have sworn she was skinnier the last time. Was Lucy that influential? Maybe that explained Levy's growth too, it was clear to everyone how much the bluenette looked up to Lucy. Ironic considering Levy had been at the guild longer than she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Virgo had apparently taken to her weight gain with a healthy vigor, as she was demolishing the stack of rice krispie treats she had placed by her side. She was eating daintily as opposed to the stuffing that Lucy and Levy were doing, but it was gluttonous all the same. There was a consistent crunching sound coming from her as she ate with one hand and rubbed her stomach with the other. She kept casting glances at Lucy, and rubbing her belly every few moments. Laxus couldn't see underneath her black clothing, but she was keeping up with Lucy's weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fantastic sight. All three girls just making themselves fatter and fatter. Laxus forgot to eat for a while, awestruck by the sight. At one point, Lucy missed a bit of sauce on her cheek, and Levy leaned over and licked it off for her. Lucy and Levy did nothing more than blush and giggle after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to eat that, Laxus?\" The blond turned to face Mira, who was pointing to the second half of his sandwich. Mira's face was dotted with rice from her rice balls, but she apparently still wanted more. Laxus frowned for a moment. Mirajane was still smaller than the others. He was hungry, but figured he could get another sandwich, so he handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, go ahead,\" he said. Mira smiled and bit into the sandwich, shaking her arms with joy as she took a bite. Laxus licked his lips a bit and went back to watching the others as well. Mira scooted closer to Laxus, he could feel her love handles brush against his hips.</span></div></div>",

Lucy touched her huge swollen belly \"Wow it was amazing\", Levy noded \"Yeah, Virgo is really a great cook, even though they were jus sandwiches\", \"I agree with both, but i'm still hungry\" said Mira, who ended up eating more than the other girls, demonstrated by her larger body: her belly is now very big and flabby while her thighs and hips are almost double as before, and her chest is almost as big as Lucy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she was still small compared to the others, Lucy has has the boobs of a watermelon and her huge belly is so big that it goes down covering her knees, while her face has now developed a double chin.<br>\r\nLevy, instead, has a belly a bit bigger than Mira's and one of her thigh is as big as Mira's thighs combined, while her butt was so wide that she problably needed two chairs to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Virgo, who was just a bit chubbier than before, came with a huge cake, nine feet tall and ten feet large. \"I thought you wanted some desserts after all the sandwiches\".

This woman had blond hair styled into a side pony tail, chocolate brown eyes and plump, kissable lips. But one of her attributes overshadowed all the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fat. Incredibly so, she weighted at least 550 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had a double chin with a third one already on the way and her breasts were like two overripe melons portrouding from her chest. Her belly was split into three rolls, the first one quite small, the second a bit bigger and the last one was huge. Her shirt didn't even attempt to cover her expansive middle, acting more like a bra than a shirt. Her love handles were big enough to make her unable to lower her pudgy arms and dropped over the waistband of her skirt which rode up on her beach ball sized ass cheeks making her panties clearly visible for all eyes to see, forming a gigantic muffin top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thunder tighs, each as thick as a tree trunk, were beginning to drop over her knees, which forced her to move in a constant waddle. The woman's calves weren't helping her mobility either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis expansive young woman was Lucy Heartfilia, a young Sumo Mage. Her magic allowed her to use her fat as a source of strength and durability. At the moment she was able to lift a few dozen tons and despite societies views on her figure she was proud of it and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came upon a crowd of girls, she wanted to know what the commotion was about. She was disappointed when she noticed that they were all starring at a blue haired man doing tricks with his fire magic. She noticed a pull on her mind, but it disappeared as soon as she realized that the guy was using charm magic to alter the minds of all the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Igneel! Igneel! \" a pink haired boy shouted from down the street and begun to run towards the crowd and pushing his way through the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're not Igneel. What a disappointment! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the pink haired boy walked of, but was immediately assaulted by the crowd of fangirls, until the blue haired mage called them of and gave an autograph to the pink headed one. After completely ignoring the slip of paper, the pinky was assaulted again, after which the bluenette and the girls left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm Lucy, nice to meet you. \" Lucy introduced herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu looked at her and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her host sat in front of her, drinking wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tried several attempts at small talk with her, but Lucy was distracted by the feast spread out in front of her, eating everything she could reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Salamander offered her a glass of wine and she didn't refuse. Before she drank it she noticed the look the creep was giving her, which made her suspicious of him, causing her to intentionally spill the wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you noticed it, didn't you? Maybe it would have been wiser to poison the food instead of the wine, looking at you it would have worked better. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few men came into the room, holding Lucy down who played along for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to fetch quite a price, there aren't many girls your size, and even fewer who are still beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment the roof came crashing down, and Natsu jumped into the room, but immediately keeled over, his motion sickness making him unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment Lucy had enough and grabbed one of the two men holding her down and threw him through the wall. She kicked the other one with her thunder tighs into the sky. Now she waddled over to Salamander who ran away after seeing the unnatural strength of the obese girl he tried to bring into slavery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy made her way to the upper deck to see if the other guests were alright, and saw all the girls passed out but otherwise alright. Next, she waddled to the bridge and after taking care of the slavers there she sat herself in front of the steering wheel. The chair was extremely uncomfortable, as it was designed for people a third of her weight. After struggling for a bit she managed to get herself seated, her belly now pressing against the steering wheel and her breasts being pushed up to her chin, her love handles leaking over the armrests like molasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set a new course back to the city, but before she could go outside she heard someone mutter a spell, and Lucy felt like something extremely heavy was dropped on top of her, prohibiting her from moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, what do we got here, somebody is trying to foil my plans. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. As much as you would get me if I sold you as a slave, you're just too troublesome to be left alive. How do you want your death to be? Slow? Fast? Painful? It doesn't matter, because your plan failed. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it certainly didn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is the next step in your brilliant master plan? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crashing this ship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment the ship shook, distracting Salamander for a moment, releasing Lucy from the spell. He was immediately kicked through the the window, sending him into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Lucy went back to the room she was in in the beginning, searching for Natsu, who was thankfully alright, and,  him having told her he was a Fairy Tail mage and inviting her into the guild, practically forced him to fight the now identified faker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Natsu left, she turned around and saw the yet unfinished feast prepared on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a shame to let this go to waste. \"</span></div></div>",

After looking over the request board for some time, she eventually decided on a job that caught her eye &amp; seemed like it was perfect for her. It was a mission to explore a newly discovered forest that appeared to be quite peaceful, the best part was that the reward was 500,000 jewels, which would cover the rent on her apartment for 7 whole months with a little cash left over for her to spend as she pleased. Once she had made her choice, she brought the job over to master Makarov to be approved who then sent word to those who posted the request that Fairy Tail had accepted the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Another plan for Natsu to see her as more than just a friend failed yet again... stupid Ice Stripper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had wanted to ask Natsu to go with her to a festival in a nearby town, but it just so happened that Gray was in a shitty mood and attacked Natsu because... well just because. He attacked Natsu when his guard was down, and unfortunately, it knocked the dragonslayer out. In silent rage, Lucy summoned Scorpio and blasted the Ice mage with sand. To add insult to injury, Juvia tried to get in the way of Scorpio's attack, but the sand went through her and condensed into heavy clumps that pelted Gray enough to knock <i>him</i> out. Sometimes, the silent victories were the best. She thanked Scorpio, who politely told her that he and Aquarius were on a date for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned again as she laid her head on the bar, her notebook to the side of her head. Natsu was in the infirmary being healed up by Wendy, and the festival would be in a few days, but nothing was working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu-chan, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy popped her head up at the voice and saw Levy at her side. She spun to the side on her bar stool to face her. \"hey, Levy-chan, yeah, I'm fine... things just aren't going my way these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette giggled. \"Yeah, you trying to go on a date with Natsu isn't working out so well, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEVY!\" Lucy squeaked in a whisper. \"Not so loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu-chan, I've known Natsu since we were kids, and you're my best friend. Besides,\" Levy pointed behind the blonde. \"Someone else knows too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt a cold spell tingle down her spine, and it wasn't from the ice mage Juvia was sprawled over. She slowly turned her head to see her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Mirajane's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mira was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, not the pleasant smile she gave to all members as a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the smile of a predator. One that had been rearing its head more often these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shipping Demon had risen once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt a fear that was worse than any of the monsters she'd faced. There was no way she could get out of this unscathed. \"Um... Mira-san, c-can I have that back?\" she asked, her voiced unsteady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Mira calmly closed the notebook and held it out for the Celestial Spirit mage. \"Of course you can, Lucy.\" Lucy, a bit shocked at her manner, but grasped her journal. Only for Mirajane to pull her close. \"But only if I get to help you with Natsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'EEEEIIIYAAAAAH!'</i> Lucy screamed in her mind as she was stuck in place. <i>'I knew it was too good to be true!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, Lucy, I can see you've really come up with some good ideas here,\" Mira said calmly, but a simmer of her demon side's sultry tone slipped through. \"but you don't know Natsu like we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy slid up next to her from on top of the bar. \"So let us help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at the two of them in surprised fear. Having them help would be great help, but a part of her pride as a woman to get her man on her own lingered in her thoughts. After a moment of deliberation, she...</span></div></div>",

Mirajane's dress looked tighter across her blouse and she seemed to be packing a bit more in the back, if the way her hips were swaying was true. Cana's tops were digging in with almost gulp of liquor she took. Juvia seemed to be retaining water in the best possible way after a recent rainstorm, a small teasing glare of pride on her face. Obviously she was still thinking Lucy was into Gray - which she wasn't! - and was doing her part to strut her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the main clincher for her abrupt purchase was Lisanna. The Animal Take-Over mage had the same gene her older sister did and was bursting out of small tank tops and miniskirts. Of course, the attention Lisanna was getting from a certain Fire Dragonslayer didn't add on to her motive for buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. Not one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the rational part of her mind was saying that it was just two old friends reconnecting after a long time, but she might have been around the dragonslayer long enough to gain a dragon's possessive streak, be it their territory (her room), hoard (her belongings), or mate (<i>Her</i> Natsu).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly closed the door and made sure it and her windows were locked (Privacy and secrecy went hand in hand here, no matter her teammates' habits) and carefully took off the packaging, wary of pranks some of her guildmates could do. When no bursts of confetti or magic came about she tore the rest off to see her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a spellbook, one that Lucy was lucky to have found when browsing a catalog. It was a hardcover leather-bound tome with a lock similar to a diary that was keyed to the owner's magic, so only they or someone the owner trusted could use it. The title was embossed with gold, saying <span class=\"cyellow\"><u>The Practical Guide for Mage Beauty: Own the Battle and Look Good Doing It!</u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was skeptical at first with such a title, but the reviews were overly positive, and it also said that the effects of the spells increased the users' magic reserves, and that sold her right away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the book and started searching for the right spell, licking her lips so she didn't bumble on the incantation, the last time was bad enough. There were hair spells for color, style, volume, spells for cosmetics so they didn't run or smudge...aha! Body morph spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture showed two women, one looking homely and the other looked stunning, curved like a hillside and an expression of haughty superiority. the picture next to it replaced the homely looking woman with a more stunning figure and double the curves, and looking closely, you could tell it was the same woman as before, with the haughty one in the background seething as the new bombshell was getting a man's attention, but the changed woman's expression was demure, just as before, though she seemed to be enjoying the attention. Below was a description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Inner Beauty Unleashed<br>\r\nAre you feeling inadequate compared to your peers? Feeling you can't stand out because of reasons beyond your control?<br>\r\nWell, now you can! Simply speak the incantation below, and your inner beauty will blossom upon your figure, and then some!</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled at the statement. She could use this! And maybe if it worked well enough, she could let Levy have a spin with it. Remembering her dear friend also silently pining for her own dragonslayer redoubled her efforts for both their chances at happiness. she read the spell first in her mind before reciting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cling to the wall in search of light, knowing that he stands so bright.<br>\r\nI want to claim him as my own, so I need to stand proud as well as well-grown<br>\r\n<i>Culope, Quireshi, Longua Tima<br>\r\nMamma Sae, Mamma Saa, Mammarista</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt her body warm up, and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In between her fingers was a tiny lacrima, slight ovular in shape, and blue in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had seen this shop come in from nowhere, and curiosity beckoned her to check it out. Leading here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes Miss! Accessories like these were incredibly popular with women in the eastern countries! They increase ones magic power, and men adore them! And this little bauble will only cost 500 jewel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, cheaper than I expected. You know what? I'll buy it.\" Lucy placed the money on the counter before her. \"So how does this thing work exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must place it within your navel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Seriously?\" Lucy didn't want to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's popular the eastern countries, and they were mostly deserts. Lots of exotic dancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks anyways.\" With that, Lucy walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, the merchant pulled out a communication lacrima. Someone on the other end picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Did she take it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Soon enough, our master will be reborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(That night, Lucy's home)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had just finished writing another letter to her deceased mother, having changed out of her usual clothes and into her sleepwear. She stretched out a bit as she put her pen down, and saw the tiny lacrima on the side of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh why not? If it works or not, no real skin off my back.\" She pulled her t-shirt up enough to expose her belly, then slipped the object into her navel. Oddly, it felt refreshingly cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, don't really feel any different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of a mirror in her room, and she posed for a bit, flaunting how she looked. \"Not bad. This thing suits me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, she was hit with a wave of drowsiness. Deciding to pack it in for today, she crawled into her bed and sleep soon took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her blanket though, the lacrima had begun glowing, and after that, her belly began to gradually puff up and outwards, causing her shirt to ride up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lacrima was absorbing the magic energy from the air and adding to Lucy's supply, but all the excess power was making her belly grow much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, she was just blushing and rubbing the growing orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What's next?)</span></div></div>",

The job may have been completed, but apparently it was a total disaster. Natsu and the gang (as usual) have completely destroyed the place where they completed the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Oh man. They completely went overboard as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Honestly. You boys should really more careful. You need to take it down a notch. You'll make the master worried sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy quietly: And who are you to talk Erza?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: It's not my fault! Gray was the one to went crazy with his stupid ice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: ME? You're the one who went completely overboard by hit your stupid fire where the dynamite was!! If you hadn't hit that dynamite we wouldn't have blown up the place you dumbass pyro!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: What did you say stripper boy!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You heard me you firey mouth breather!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: That\"s does it!! You're going down you pervy posipicle!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Bring it on loser!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Natsu and Gray started fighting destroying the inside of the guild hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Hey take it easy you guys! Take it outside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the shadows Juvia was watching the whole thing and she was in lovey dovey mode with Gray. She had just bought another crazy concoction to make Gray love her. She got the potion from the same man who gave her the passion potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you don't know what I mean watch episode 50 of Fairy Tail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Oh my beloved Gray. I know the potion I got before didn't work, but this time for sure! Soon you and I will be in a loving embrace and we'll this and that and the other naughty stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she opened the bottle and read the instructions on the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: OK. All I have to do is spray the person I want to love me and it'll happen. OK here goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her water magic to manipulate the liquid in the bottle due to her ability to move water and other liquid. The liquid hovered above Natsu and Gray fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: OK. I have to time this just right. I'll wait till they separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray kept fighting until they stopped to take a breather and then Juvia's chance had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Now Gray drown in my love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of the liquid and it fell straight toward Gray then it happened. Lucy stepped in to break up the fight and the potion was falling straight toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Come on you guys knock it off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late; the liquid splashed all over Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Blah!!! What the....!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Lucy! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: I'm fine. Just completely grossed out. Yuck! What is this gunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: No! Curse you Lucy! How dare you get in the way of my love for Gray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Lucy. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy I don't know. I was trying to break up the fight with Natsu and Gray and then all of a sudden this gunk is all over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: You better go home and clean up otherwise it'll stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: OK. I was gonna go home anyway. I could use a bath anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Lucy went home and got ready to take a bath. She felt really sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yuck I wonder what this stuff is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gunk began to glow and suddenly came to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: what the... it's a-alive!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gunk went all over Lucy again this time it disappeared in her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: what the....what was that all about? Oh well. At least I got the gunk off more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Lucy didn't know was that the gunk that Juvia got all over her has an interesting side effect, but that won't come till later. Anyway after she switched clothes Lucy headed back to the guild to get a job, but on the way something happened. Lucy.......</span></div></div>",

After winning the Magic Games and stopping the Dragon Invasion, jobs have been coming in like crazy thanks to Fairy Tail's rebounding popularity. In addition, getting the guild hall back and in original shape, no, actually better shape. The main hall is bigger, as is the upstairs. Lots of things are bigger now. And it's December too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead's eyes scrolled over the board for S-Class jobs. She wanted a challenge, something interesting and something worthwhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spotted it, underneath a 'Find the Diamond Devil' flyer. She reached in a pulled out the pamphlet. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>HELP NEEDED! 100 YEAR FESTIVAL ABOUT TO BEGIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 100 year festival is a festival that goes on for a year that occurs only once a century. In the town of Hazom in northern Caelum, the festival is to put on a celebration over the course of 5 years. It is a lovely tradition held by our people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to the festival's activities, it attracts various beasts to the town, and to be sure, the town has built walls around the perimeter in order to keep out monsters. However, our mayor needs actual help from a Guild with strong members who can help defend our town over the course of 5 years. Payment will be 30,000,000 Jewels per mage once a year to whoever helps defend our town over the course of these 5 years. Room, boarding, and utilities will be provided for free, and food and other wares, such as clothes bought within the village will be given to you for 50%. You will be given the 10 million Jewels at the end of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease come by December 25th. The 100 year Festival begins on January 1st, X792</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza pondered...this job is clearly one for the long haul, and one that is quite profitable indeed. Thirty million a year! And free room and boarding along with the products bought inside the village fifty percent off. Quite the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was a SS-Class job, mainly due to it's length of time. And who knows what monsters lay down in the southern nation of Caelum?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Gildarts were to become as strong as Makarov due to taking these jobs. So can she. But...who to take along with her? Natsu, Gray, Wendy, and Gajeel were called away to meet this Warrod Cken person, so that leaves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza smiled. \"I got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe will invite Lucy! Along with...</span></div></div>",

The blonde was stunned at the fact that Erza would want to pick her to go on this job, which given it's rank, Lucy figured it was going to be really dangerous. Granted Lucy had been through an awful lot since joining Fairy Tail, and the pacts that she had made with so many of her spirits meant she wasn't some weakling, but she couldn't help but feel she would still be slowing Erza down in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lucy. You were my first choice!\" Erza said as she patted the celestial mage on her back. It really didn't help make her feel much better honestly. As Lucy just sighed in response, a blue haired girl approached the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia is very thankful you would choose her too for this dangerous quest. This will be a chance for Juvia to prove herself to Gray-sama!\" the blue haired water mage exclaimed with stars in her eyes as a day dream played out in her head. This would be just what she needed to finally get Gray's attention: Coming back from a super serious SS rank job. As Lucy continued her sulking and Juvia kept up with her daydream, Mirajane walked to the group, curious about all the fuss they were causing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to take that job huh? Master Makarov thought it would be to your liking!\" she said with a smile. It was almost funny to think that she and Erza had been bitter rivals when they were little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are here Mirajane: I want you to come with the 3 of us as well. It would add to an already impeccable team,\" Erza said, the excitement beginning to build up in her. Mirajane just sighed in response to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love nothing more than to come with you Erza... but the guild needs me to keep things up around here! I can't imagine what would happen if I left...\" Mirajane's crestfallen face. Erza was about to object when a voice managed to do it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on the job!\" It belonged to none other than the Master Makavrov. As the tiny wizard walked next to Mirajane, he grabbed her hand to reassure her. \"You're done more than enough for this guild Mira. You deserve to get out there and spread your wings every once in a while! Besides Natsu and Gray are gone so you don't need to worry about any commotion.\" Mirajane just smiled and giggled slightly in response and turned back to Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that settles it: I will gladly join you on this job Erza!\" Now that the pieces were in place and the group had been assembled (although Lucy was still whining, Erza never knew her to back down), they were all ready to go to this land and start the job. </span></div></div>",

This is going to be one long mission, one lasting five years,\" added Erza. \"So bring along-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh! Five years!\" Gasped Juvia. \"But what if Gray-sama were to-\" Then, Juvia's imagination began to run wild. Images of Gray waiting by the shoreline for her every day...and with her looking out to sea from Caelum every day. She was grasped her cheeks and gave out a \"waaaah...\". But then it hit her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a strong quest, Gray-sama would finally confess his love to her at long last! And the years would only make the reunion sweeter. Who knows, he may even send letters! Distance makes the heart grow more fonder after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!

Erza, we meet up when?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza put a hand on her chin, pondering. \"How about tomorrow afternoon. We'll take a train to Hargeon Town then take our boat to Caelum. The boat ride will take about a day or so, so when we arrive in Caelum it will be morning or afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" said Mirajane. \"I will do the same and tell Lisanna and Elfman.\" She stood up and walked out with Juvia towards Fairy Hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" The two of Team Natsu's teenage females were alone. Lucy scratched her chin. \"I guess I'll do the same? Also, Erza, we should do something before we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something?\" Erza asked. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's going to be a five year quest, so we won't be home for a long time. I will even need to put all of my stuff into a storage unit as I won't be able to maintain my apartment with me gone. So...before we leave, want to do something fun? Like, have a girls night out for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled at the blonde's suggestion. \"I'd be happy to Lucy. You are one of my dearest friends after all.

Upon arriving Erza wasted no time in beginning the long pack. She was known to bring a caravan of stuff with her and this trip was going to be no exception. As she filled her suitcases with all manner of food, costumes, and trinkets, the mountain that was Erza Scarlet's luggage was once again complete. She stood back from her handiwork and took a glance to make sure nothing was forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! how could I have been so dumb!\" She said as she realized she had forgotten her 'spare souvenir' case, because who knows what sort of amazing trinkets she was going to find on this long journey. Satisfied with her packing, she looked at the time and figured she may as well get ready and go meet up with Lucy at the guild. Quickly requipping into one of her many dresses ( this one a tight purple one that showed off a fair amount of her generous cleavage), Erza began her walk to Fairy Tail, eager to see what sort of place Lucy had picked out for their girls night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, I hope they have cake,\" Erza remarked to herself as she licked her lips. It was well known she had a dangerous sweet tooth and wasn't above ordering massive amounts of sweets. She was thankful her job kept her so active or else she would more than likely be monstrously obese by now. As the thought crossed her mind, an image of hugely fat Erza, shoveling cake and cookies into her mouth popped up in her head. This Erza's butt was wide enough to claim 3 or 4 chairs and her flabby arms always seemed to be reaching for more food to stuff into her quadruple chin face. Her globular belly proved too much for any of her armors and thus she had taken to wearing nothing but her sarashi and hakama, the bottom long since disgarded due to the size of her hips and rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza shook her head to dissipate this horrid day dream, and nervously chuckled as she patted her flat tummy. Soon the guild popped up into view and she caught sight of Lucy standing in front. Picking up her pace, Erza wasted no time in closing the distance and meeting her fellow guild member.</span></div></div>",

Strawberry cake heavily preferred.\" Lucy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gotcha there.\" And the two prowled the town, looking at outside menus, and gaining some eyes of wandering men. The two ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's be thankful Ichiya isn't here...\" Commented Erza, pale. \"He'd go berserk in...Ichiya-fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde understood and nodded her head fast. \"Oh yeah. Same with his boy toy goon squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call them goons. They are rather nice. Just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annoying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Erza spotted an all-you-can-eat buffet and inspected the menu. Normally she would avoid buffets but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cake!!!\" She beamed. It was on the menu! Which means it will be in the buffet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess we'll eat here then,\" said Lucy walking up towards a happy Erza. The redhead wasted no time, tugging Lucy along and heading inside and grabbing a table. Erza waved her hand for a waiter to come by and order the all-you-can-eat option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lucy, you going to order the buffet option?\" Asked Erza, eager for the waiter to come along. Lucy shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm trying to watch my figure a bit. I'll order some salad and protein on my end. You can go on ahead though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Her loss,' thought Erza to herself as the waiter finally came around and accepted Erza's order of the buffet and Lucy's order of a Caesar Salad starting off.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes turned to stars as the confectionery treat assaulted her tastebuds with flavor the likes of which she had never experienced before. Quickly she shoveled more of the fluffy treat into her mouth until the first slice was completely gone. Wasting no time, Erza moved onto the second, and then the third. As she was ravenously devouring her fourth slice, Lucy just sat in awe, not even paying attention to her salad's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erza don't you think you should...\" before Lucy could finish her sentence, Erza had finished her fifth and final slice, and stood up from the table. Frosting covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Lucy! This cake is too good to have just these slices. I need it all!\" she remarked as she rushed back over to the buffet and proceeded to place the entire cake on a plate and bring it back to the table. Erza was almost possessed in her consumption of the dessert, not even bothering to cut it into slices. Soon her fork had laid waste to the cake and she leaned back in her chair with a satisfied belch. Her stomach had rounded out slightly from the amount of food she had eaten and it pushed against her dress giving the appearance that she was 3 months pregnant. Lucy just continued to stare, open jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I... What?!\" was all she could muster as Erza just watched her freak out, a look of confusion the only thing appearing on the red-heads face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lucy did you want some? I told you I wasn't through yet and you should get a piece before I ate it all!\" Erza remarked, wishing that there was more cake... she still felt hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not why I\"m freaking out!\" Lucy shouted in response. Before she continued however, she noticed all the looks they were getting, between her outburst and Erza's cake decimation. Sitting back down, blushing profusely, Lucy just played with her salad before finally taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have gotten something better,\" was all she muttered as she chewed the flavorless greens. </span></div></div>",

We'd better get back home if we want to keep out schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it!\" Lucy yawned.  \"I'm about ready to pass out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I, but I don't dare.  If I went right to bed after all that, I'd probably wake up too fat to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry so much,\" Lucy said around another jaw-cracking yawn.  \"We're ...in good... shape, once won't... hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched her arms over her head and moaned with exhaustion and fullness, arcing her back.  Her breasts lifted, and her distended abdomen flexed as muscles tightened and shifted around the mass of food.  There was a snapping noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Lucy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" the blonde said hastily.  \"I mean... not nothing, exactly... more like I just lost the button on my shorts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just <i>bought</i> these!  Help me look for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that is?\"  Erza pointed to the gleam of metal in a patch of moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Lucy waddled forward awkwardly.  \"Could you grab it for me?   Er, because you're closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is your button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're the one who saw it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's your button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Lucy blushed.  \"I don't think I can bend at the waist right now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza sighed and rubbed her bulging abdomen.  \"And I'm so full I can barely breathe, let alone bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I doooo?\"  Lucy wailed, holding her shorts up with one hand.    \"I wish I could just requip like you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, I think the only thing I could requip into would be a pair of sweat pants.\"  Erza covered her mouth and belched softly into the back of her hand.  <i>Burr-ff.</i>  \"Make that a pair of extra-large sweat pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's no helping it,\" Lucy shrugged.  \"Open, Gate of the Celestial--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're using your magic for that?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\"  Lucy said, pounding her fist into her hand.  \"The only spirits I have available right now are ones I ... don't really want to see me in this situation.  Loke... and Aquarius... and <i>Taurus</i>... brr!   If I wait until midnight I can call Plue and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza held up a hand.  \"Somebody's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, a pair of sleazy-looking thugs stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" Erza said.  \"You've been following us for a while, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest thug grinned, revealing a crooked graveyard of white and yellow teeth.  \"Long enough to tell by your stumbles that you two are too drunk to do anything but hand over your money.   Let's have it, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not drunk,\" Erza said.  \"We are full of cake.  And you will not get a single jewel from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we should just give them the money,\" Lucy murmured.  \"They're pretty tough-looking, and neither of us is really in shape to fight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs first thug stepped forward, Erza drew her sword in one quick movement and slammed the flat into the side of the thug's misshapen head.  The sword flashed again, and the second thug yiped in terror as his pants slipped down around his ankles.   He abandoned his friend, running for the safety of the shadows, tripping over the cloth in his flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't bend at the waist, but as long as I can move my arms, there's no problem.\"  Erza burped again, then held her sword out to Lucy.  It took the girl a moment to recognize the object held at its point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like his tailor uses the same brand of buttons your does,\" the redhead said.  \"Not that you need it, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked down.  Beneath her generous chest, the shorts were holding tight to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately for you, you're too bloated for them to slip,\" Erza observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed.  \"Yeah, lucky me.\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't know what to do with herself today. Her friends were off on their own doing what they wanted. The guild hall held nothing of interest for her and she had plenty of cake in her fridge at home. Erza sighed in boredom. With nothing to do, she decided to head home. As she walked she noticed a tightness in her chest plate. '<i>That's odd</i>,' she thought '<i>nothing I can do about it now. I'll have to wait until I get home</i>.' Continuing down the street the feeling grew. She also felt her hips swing more than normal. By the time she made it to her room her armor was killing her. \"Requip!\" She shouted. She changed into a normal shirt and shorts. After the light faded she looked down to see more cleavage than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" She asked. Erza was already well endowed and was quite comfortable with her body. This sudden growth didn't both her, it just seemed unusual for her to be growing. She was passed the age where growth spurts would be normal, and she had not changed her routine in any way that would result in a build up of fat. As she though about this she failed to realize her boobs growing again. A slow and steady growth but they were getting bigger all the same. A similar occurrence was happening with her rear. By the time she noticed, her bust had gone up to an H cup. A split in her pants alerted her to its own growth.</span></div></div>",

With boobs the size of watermelons and basketball sized ass checks, Erza was now growing taller. Already 5 inches added to her height, she continued to grow larger. Erza reached her hand up and placed it flat on the ceiling. \"This is incredible,\" she stated. Her head approached the roof forcing her to kneel down.

A powerful s class wizard with more swords then any swordsmen known to live, she sat at a table waiting in her usual gear of an armour chest plate, a short blue shirt and black boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes and finally the new s class job are posted by the bar girl Mirajane.

It is said this monster was once a human drove by his lust for women, he started a dark guild to try and capture all the beautiful women of the land. However he was cut down by a brave group of wizard who banished him to the depth of the magical world. But now he's back as something horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzra mere huffed at this.

The once strange dark guild hide deep within a dark forest and Ezra being the warrior she is, cuts down all who stand in her way be they bandit or monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arrival at the guild didn't do much to change her nature either, the large building look destroy bit of roof where missing and the front door was missing on the front of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with caution, Ezra entered the guild slowly it was surprising light in the building almost as if someone was living here. Candles were lit which flicked as she passed. The job had said nothing about where the monster would be and so carefully Ezra began to search the rooms of the guild. Most were wreaked and blocked off by large bits of rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet to Ezra surprise the guild seemed to once be very well put together. From her exploring she could see that wizard here seem to have there own room and with that another room where they could all mingle and not far from there was a training hall and a bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So well organised and yet for such a sick cause\" Ezra said moving on through the building. Yet as she made her way back to the front room where she had entered. She saw a figure standing in the centre of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking perhaps she could sneak up on the figure she crept slowly down getting closer an closer to the figure until she was in range and then she swung her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was stopped by  a mass of black and white tentacles coming from the figure left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm a fairy tail wizard..\" the figure said in a dark tone as the tentacles released the sword causing Ezra to stumble back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me are you here to slay the monster of this guild?\" the figure asked not turning around. Ezra told the figure she already knew he was the monster people talked about and at this the figure laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right, fairy tail wizard I am the monster\" the figure said slowly turning around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the monster shocked Ezra for the figure turned out by be a half man, half monster like appearance. He still had short hair but it was green and his right side face of his looked vey normal with pale skin and dark green eye but the left side his skin was dark green and scaly,  his left eye bright yellow like a serpent. His nose a mix between human and monster while his mouth look a normal pale human lip. His right arm as a human hand should be but his left arm and hand were replaced with a mass of black and white tentacles. The rest of him seemed normal two leg and two feet. However with him wearing a grey cloak it was hard for Ezra to tell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I scare you?\" the monster/human says causing Ezra to shake her head and announce she would slay him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the monster gave a small laugh before looking at his warped tentacles made hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps before I die, you would give me you name fairy tail wizard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzra didn't really want to but her honour as a warrior told her to and so she did. With that the two stared at each other for moment before finally they both spurn forward to attack. With a slash of her sword, Ezra managed to cut away the monster tentacle made hand and arm forcing the monster to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah a clever wizard, you knew what my weapon was and so you've taken it from me.\" the monster said getting up and facing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a fairy tail wizard and now before you die I request to know what your name is monster!\" Ezra said point her blade at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster merely sighed as he looked at her. \"I have no name, unlike you my name is worth nothing to me instead all that matter now is this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that suddenly the human/monster tentacles began to grow back as quick as lighting. \"What the?\" Ezra couldn't believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster/human nods moving his newly formed tentacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the power to regrow any part of my body, it was a blessing I accepted when I made the traded my left half of my body with the dark wizards who made me this.\"   The monster explained as he readied himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzra didn't know what to say, however she didn't stop long to think about it as she knew that this monster had to die and with that the battle began again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic clashed as the two began to battle against each other, the monster may have only had one hand but the dark magic he could perform seemed to be the level of a guild master and soon it came to where both were panting for breath. Stood facing like cowboy ready to duel the two stood panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you were the man who build this guild aren't you?\" Ezra asked readying herself with a final breath. The monster/human nodded answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a once power man with desires I became a monster and now, now I must live y life as one. But I am not sad for as long as I live, I still have my dreams.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that the final bout began, a slash of the sword and a mass of tentacles the fight ended when Ezra found herself capture by the tentacles. Her sword knocked away and her arms and legs bound by tentacles she hung in the air as the human/monster looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ezra of fairy tail, but you were not strong enough to stop a dark magic guild master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzra wanted to say something back but tired from the fight she couldn't find the energy too. Instead the human/monster then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Erza gasped, as a gust of cold air hit her, causing her nipples to stand erect. The monster chucked at this, and Erzas face flushed as red as her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I order you beast, release me at once, and I promise to show mercy.\" Erza proclaimed confidently. The monster, however, laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And wry would I let you go when I can have all the fun I want with you?\" The monster grinned a sick grin up at Erza, making her feel uncomfortable. \"How about we start off here?\" The creature continued, one of its large tentacles heading towards Erzas private area. The redhead bit her lip, as the long, thick tentacle rubbed her clit. Against her will, she moaned at the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to most, Erza had never actually been with anyone before. She had been saving herself her while lie for Jellal. She wasn't ashamed that she was a virgin, but she wasn't going to tell that to this monster. As the tentacle pressed against her sensitive area, teasing her, Erza tried to force her legs to close, but the tentacles holding her refused to allow it. The feeling of being forced to feel unwanted pleasure made Erza feel sick, but in her current position, she was utterly helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Titania, how many times have you had sex?\" The monster enquired. After a moment of silence, the creature added, \"ahh I see. So you're a virgin? That explains why your so fucking tight. But it's no wonder that no man ever wanted you. Letting yourself get caught so easily by me. You're pathetic.\" Erzas fear and shame was replaced by anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT. I AM A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD, AND UNLESS Y-\" her sentence was cut off abruptly, as the thick, long tentacle plunged into the redheads vagina. Erza cried out in pain. Any semblance of pleasure that she felt was gone. Pain took over as her virginity was violently stolen from her. The tentacle pushed further inside her, five inches, ten inches. It pushed further still until it was up inside her. He pussy had been stretched apart, and blood fell from in between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as it had entered, the appendage left her. Erza was humiliated, and was panting from the pain. Just then, the tentacle plummeted back inside her, deeper than before, and much harder. Erza screamed. This was pain unlike any other. She had long since given up on struggling, as she had no more energy, let alone magic power. Her only hope was to pray that this torture would end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacle pulled out, and in again, thrusting in and out of Erzas vagina. It was fast now, but every bit as hard, and ten times more painful with each thrust. Two more appendages suddenly curled around her large breasts, squeezing them hard. Two smaller tentacles curled around her nipples, squeezing them hard. This caused Erza to howl even louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stand the immense pain she was in. She put her pride and honour aside, and did the only thing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NATSU! JELLAL! MAVIS! ANYONE, PLEASE SAVE ME!\" The creature laughed, obviously getting some sort of sick pleasure it of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's coming. Nobody's going to save you. You're mine to use now.\" Erza refused to give up hope. Her vision was blury, as she told herself that her eyes were watering from the pain. She refused to admit that she was crying like a baby. Another tentacle reached around to her behind, pressing her hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About here?\" The monster laughed again, as Erzas eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. P-Please. Not there. I'll do anything, just -\" Erza was interrupted again, as a sharp pain spread across her ass. The creature had slappedher ass, causing her to scream, opening her mouth wide. Without hesitation, the monster forced another large tentacle into her mouth, hitting the back of her throat. Erza choked on it, struggling to breathe now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the appendage from earlier forced its way into her tightest hole, causing a muffled scream from Erza. All three tentacles fucked her vagina, ass, and mouth, as two more groped her tits. Reality suddenly hit Erza; this was her lowest point. She was being repeatedly raped by a beast, and was helpless to stop it. She couldn't save herself. She had failed herself, her friends and her guild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza could no longer talk, but her hope was all gone. \"Let me die\" she thought to herself. \"I want this thing to kill me. I'd rather die here than face my guild. They won't respect me. They'll all hate me. And they should. I let them down. I'm a disgrace. I'm just so pathetic, I can't even help myself. Just let me die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of enduring this torture, as well as the monster teasing her, it eventually released a thick, sticky liquid into her vagina, mouth and ass. It tasted rancid, and the feeling of it inside her made her want to hurl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as suddenly as it had begun, the creature dropped her. \"Until I see you again, 'queen of the fairies'\" the creature laughed as it turned and left the room. Erza lay on the cold hard ground, sobbing to herself. Her entire body was in to much pain to move. She was covered in what she regrettably assumed was the creatures cum, and filled with shame and humiliation. She had failed, and she had nothing to live for now. She just wanted to die. However, before she could move, her weak body gave up, sending her to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her dreams, Erza was being raped, abused, humiliated, punished by the creature. The thought never left her. She finally awoke from the reliving of her hell. Looking around, she found t she was...</span></div></div>",

Even after the time skip and after winning the Grand Magic games, things have been rather peaceful for the guild. Somewhat boring for one Erza Scarlet. She was in her normal get up without armor, sipping tea as she looked at the board for mission of her S-class status. Unfortunately one had apparently caught her eye. Pulling it from the board, she began to look at it more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>250,000 jewels to whom can slay the cursed swordsman for the country of Bellum</i>\" is said on the flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirajane, who put this up?\" asked Erza as she looked at Mirajane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been posted there quite sometime no. It appears no one even from the other guilds have decided to take it.\" said Mirajane, as she was filling up booze for Cana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll take it. Seems to have a good payout and I can exercise my sword fighting abilities.\" said Erza as she left the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza couldn't find Lucy, Natsu, or Gray around but according to Elf-man, they're together on another mission. Juvia as always following Gray around like a lovesick puppy that she is. She couldn't ask Laxus since he has is group with him. So she had set sail to the country of Bellum. It was a long journey by train but eventually she arrived there at day break where she was greeted by what seemed to be a heavily armored knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings! Erza Scarlet of Fairy Tail! Welcome to Bellum\" said the knight as Erza could undoubtly see that this was an arms town. Everywhere armories and smitheries lay about with weapons displayed and built for war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have your accomodations ready, Ms. Scarlet. So if you please follow me.\" said knight as Erza nodded and followed the knight to the hotel she was staying where she was granted 1st class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The person who had requested the job you have taken shall be here shortly, Ms. Scarlet. So do kindly wait.\" said the knight. Soon enough the person she was waiting for had arrived. He was a long haired blonde man, worn torn as seen on his scar on his left cheek, having a large sword strapped to his back. The sign on his armor would tell you that this guy is a general. Also with him a bunch of armorclad bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am General Raul of the Bellum army. It is my pleasure to meet you finally Queen Titania.\" as both he and Erza shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem like a strong and courageous army, General Raul. I cannot see why you would post something like that.\" said Erza as they were having tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it displeasures me to ask help from the outside. I have sent many man to try to slay this inhuman being but all have died in doing so.\" said General shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My condolesence, General. Why is this cursed swordsman so strong and why is he called cursed?\" asked Erza<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general began to tell the tale of the cursed swordsman and how it came to be. He was once a brilliant warrior whose skill unmatched by anyone in Bellum. Champion of Champions till one day, the castle he was bound to protect was attacked by a dark guild. Driven back due to his inability to use magic, the castle was taken over and all of his love ones killed. In thirst for revenge and power, he was approached by a legendary dark wizard who gave him the power to decimate this dark guild thus he was born. He had slaughter last one of the dark guild, using the swords ability to harvest souls to increase his power and grant him immortality. But even after killing all the dark guild, when back up had arrived he slaughter them too. His mind corrupt by the power of the Dark Blade. And has been doing this ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is he now?\" asked Erza excited to meet this adversary, The general in surprise looked at the red haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall take you there.\" said The general and soon enough they had left for where the cursed swordsman is now residing.</span></div></div>",

Some of her friends like Cana, Erza and Mira were filling out, with C or D cup breasts, or even bigger! Meanwhile, she was stuck with her A cups. This had never bothered her before, but she had never wanted anyone to notice her before. That was before Gajeel arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she hated him at first, but it was fairly obvious now that she had a crush on him. S often caught him leering at other girls, specifically their breasts.  Assuming he was more of a boobs guy, levy realised she had no hope of getting his attention. Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile reading a book, she found out there was a special lacrima to change the size of anything. It wasn't specifically for breasts, but it ought to work, rght? Levy hastily got her hand on one such lacrima. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructions were quite vague. It stated to warm the lacrima to grow the object, or cool it to shink the object,  and then just rub it on what you want to grow/shrink. However, there was no specific measurements, like for how long, or what temperature to hear it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a guess, levy heated the lacrima, before rubbing the warm surface over her flat chest. It was smooth, and felt quite relaxing. After about a minute of rubbbing, she put the lacrima down. She looked at her breasts, which hadn't grown at all. They tingled slightly, but she felt otherwise the same. She tried again, and waited ten minutes. Nothing. Frustrated, she tried repeatedly, but nothing happened. She slammed the Lacrima back in it's box. She was stupid to think it would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to go to bed, putting on her blue pyjamas to sleep in. She got into bed, and feel asleep, unaware of her breasts growing to a huge size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up the next morning. As she tried to sit up, she felt an unfamiliar weight on her. She could feel the cool air on her chest. She looked down, and almost screamed. Her breasts had grown huge, and had burst her pyjamas. She noticed they were around size...</span></div></div>",

In front of the sofa there were already three empy boxes, each one with 12 donuts. She knew about the two's relationship but she was surprised to see the new fat on her body; Erza was simply softer, with maybe the belly being pretty big, but Mirajane was almost fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what an appetite. Are you sure you can eat lunch then?\" asked Erza without noticing Lucy's arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, especially if you eat some of the donuts\" answered Mira poking Erza's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i can indulge something too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lisanna cleared her throat to let the two lovers notice Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Lucy, sorry i was a bit occupied\" said the knight mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lucy! How much time has been?\" greeted the demon mage, after all, she hasn't seen Lucy since before getting sick,  more than a month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's go to the kitchen, we have to cook alot!\" exclaimed Lisanna rising her fist to the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy followed her, and found the kitchen full of tons of ingrediens of every kinds: tons of vegetables, chocolate, eggs, meat, rice, fish and the list goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do we have to use all these ingredients?\" yelled the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, i know it can take a while, but maybe with  some of your stellar spirits help we can make it faster\" Answered Lisanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but all these ingredients for just three people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four, you can eat with us too!\" said Lisanna with a big smile, while starting to prepare lasagnas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy watched her body: she didn't want to lose her slender figure, she knew she could simply eat normally, but something told her that if she stayed with them she could end up gaining weight; in the end she shook her head, and summoned Virgo for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wish, master?\" asked the stellar spirit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare some of your cakes, we have to make a big lunch\" ordered Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour and half, Lisanna called the two lovers \"The lunch is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza woke up, after the tenth  (and last) box, they decide to rest and digest so they could gorge themselves during lunch, she also slept on Mira's soft belly; the two girls stood up and went to the kitchen:<br>\r\nFor lunch Lisanna prepared something like fifteen steaks, five giant bowls full with onigiri and huge trays of lasagnas; Lucy cooked some fish and chips and salads (she hoped to eat them) while virgo prepared ten huge chocolate cakes with whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You prepared all this in so few time?\" asked Mira in elation sitting on a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and now let's eat!\" cheered Lisanna grabbing a plate of fish and chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked up another cookie and ate it before eating a third. \"That's enough,\" Mira said before closing the box. She craved more but she knew she couldn't eat all 12 right now. She picked up the milk and took a few drinks from then bottle. \"That was really good,\" Mira sighed. Mira capped the bottle before putting it down. She left her apartment and went to the guild hall. The entire time she was working she couldn't stop thinking about the cookies. As she laughed and served beer to her guild mates the cookies haunted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Mira?\" Erza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah, I just have some cookies at home calling to me,\" Mira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. To be honest I have a slice of cake at home that won't leave me alone,\" Erza sympathized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In just a few hours I can go home and eat a few,\" Mira sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck. I hope you can hold out,\" Erza teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Mira entered her room and saw the milk. \"Oops, better throw this away,\" Mira said. She picked it up and noticed it was still cold. Confused, she opened it and sniffed the product. It smelled fine, it was still cold. She took a small sip. It still tasted fine. She closed the bottle and went to put it down but noticed something odd. It was full again. She pondered this for a bit before shrugging. She would much rather munch on some cookies than ponder milk. She opened the box and began to eat. They were so good. Each one was a chocolaty delite. She reached blindly for each one not bothering to count. Eventually she ran out. Mira pouted a little before opening her milk. She drank about half of it before closing in. Mira cleaned her fingers of all the chocolate and whipped the crumbs off her cleavage. She stood up to throw the box away when she noticed the bottle was full again. She picked it up and stared at it. She opened the bottle and dipped her finger in it. It was real. Mira had head about this kind of magic before. It appeared to be food magic that was tied to the bottle. It would take a powerful and talented wizard to pull this off. Unfortunately such items were illegal, do to the fact that it would crash the food market. Mira was going to throw the bottle away but then she had a thought. What if the bottle wasn't the only thing that was charmed? She opened the box and saw a fresh batch of cookies. She took one then closed the box before opening it again to see the cookie she took was replaced. Mira covered her mouth with worry. This was serious. If the magic police found this she could be arrested. She ate the cookie out of anxiety before picking up the box and walking over to the trash can.  </span></div></div>",

She squeezed her eyes shut and grabbed her head trying to stop her headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She asked. She turned over trying to move her eyes out of the light. She brushed a lot of crumbs off the coach and grabbed a pillow. She was so tired. Mira tired to remember what happened. All she could remember was eating cookies and drinking milk. Did she eat cookies all night? If that was the case she must have crashed. Mira wanted to get up to grab some water but she didn't want to move. She was so tired and felt so lazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying around for an hour Mira got up and went to the bathroom. She started the water in her bath and took off her dress before looking at the mirror. She had chocolate all over her face and trails of dried milk down her chin. She took a hand towel and wet it before cleaning her face. When she had finished that her bath was ready. She removed her underwear and slowly got into the tub. She sunk down until her head rested on the carved stone. She just soaked, letting the soothing heat deal with her headache. \"This is nice,\" Mira sighed. She eventually grabbed the soap and began to wash herself. Everything was fine until she reached her belly. It felt softer than normal. Mira pushed down her breasts to look at her stomach. Her once tight tummy was now a slightly pudgy. Her belly now stuck out an inch. Mira poked it. It wasn't taught like it was stuffed with food like it should have been. No, all the cookies she ate had already turned to fat. \"I guess I deserve this,\" Mira grimaced. She finished her bath before drying off and changing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the clock Mira saw it was time to head toward the guild hall. She looked in the mirror and saw that her loose dress hid her new pudge  No one would be able to tell she gained weight. She headed toward the door when she felt something drawing her back in. She looked at the cookie box sitting on the table. </span></div></div>",

The wizards all stopped in their tracks to see what kind of monster was attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna had a deep blush on her face. \"Sorry, everyone. That was me.\" she quietly announced. The guild members then went back to thrashing each other, seeing it was just Lisanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sis, could I you get me something to eat? I'm really hungry all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lisanna! In fact, I was just about to ask if you could taste this for me!\" She turned around and set down a giant 5-foot-tall cake. \"It's a new recipe I found in Sorcerer Weekly. I thought maybe you could be my taste tester?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Lisanna pulled up a chair, got a fork and knife and cut out a slice from the bottom tier. It looked like some sort of red velvet cake, with a thick cream cheese frosting. It was, in fact, a recipe from Sorcerer Weekly, but little did she know that Mira had put some extra ingredients in it, including, but not limited to, saturated trans fats, pure adipose from a Vulcan, and some sugar she had gotten from Virgo, one of Lucy's Celestial Spirits. The Celestial Spirit's food is known for being extremely fattening, due to their needing copious amounts of nutrients. Mira had Lucy try some of the cake earlier to see if it was good enough. Now Lucy weighs ten pounds more than she did before, and she holds it very proudly in her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisanna took her first bite of cake, her face lit up with joy. \"Wow, sis! You've really outdone yourself!\" she exclaimed through another mouthful of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Lisanna! I tried my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, slice after slice went into Lisanna's maw, a seemingly bottomless pit, waiting to be filled with more cake. The lacrima could be seen glowing again, as changes could be seen on the white haired girl's body. Her belly started growing, but not with fullness, but with pure fat. It went from a potbelly to a chubby gut after a few slices of cake. Her tummy wasn't the only part of her body growing, as her boobs started filling out her blue sweater, stretching the limits of her bra underneath. Her lower half was growing, too. Her smooth thighs were slowly getting chunky and jiggly, and her booty made short work of her short shorts, her ass using them as a makeshift thong. Her butt was growing fastest, each adipose filled orb at basketball size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped to take a breather. She looked down at herself and gasped. She...</span></div></div>",

She stumbled a bit for reasons she couldn't explain. Her shirt and shorts became tight as her vision blurred. \"What was in that vial?\" She gasped as she reached for something to steady herself. Her hand landed on a table and she fell to her knees. She panted heavily and closed her eyes tight attempting to ride out this horrible assault on her senses. After a few minutes her head began to clear. \"Thank goodness,\" she sighed as she slowly opened her eyes. Her sight still slightly blurred, Lisanna stood up carefully. Noticing a heavier weigh on her chest she turned to the mirror again and waited for her vision to clear. When she could finally see she was greeted with a surprising sight. Her boobs had grow quiet a bit. Her once meager mounds where now a bountiful bosom. Far superior to her old breast size, she left even her sister behind. Grabbing her new bust in both hands, she squeezed gently marveling at their girth. Each tit was easily bigger than her head. \"Wow, I'm huge. Look at these things,\" she said and took off her shirt. Stripping of her bra as well she got a full view of her mammaries. Despite the size, her boobs were still perky and seemed to defy gravity with their shape. Lisanna lifted her bust with her hands and watched them jiggle slightly. She let them drop and watched them bounce. Nipples fully erect, Lisanna couldn't deny she was a bit turned on by her tits. She started to twist slowly back and forth making her boobs swing. She placed her hands on her bust to stop their motion. \"Why would someone give me these?\" She questioned. She looked down, now unable to see her feet, and pondered this. As she did, she dropped her hands causing them to brush along her hips. Noticing this she looked at the mirror and saw her hips had flared outwards as well. \"It gave me an hourglass?\" Lisanna spoke shocked. Not only were her hips wider than her shoulders, her waist had shrunk and her thighs plumped up. She looked over her shoulder and saw an ass that matched her breasts. A bouncy bubble butt now stuck out prominently causing her shorts to rip. \"What next?\" She asked. She looked over to where the vial was laying and saw that it was full again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Lisanna was not unhappy with her new body; she was confused by the package she had received. Carefully bending over to pick up the vial from the floor, Lisanna stared at the red liquid. \"I have to take this to someone,\" she decided. The master was the safest bet, but she couldn't leave the house like this. None of her clothes would fit her properly anymore and she'd garner a lot of unwanted attention even if she could find clothes. Asking her sister for help was her best option right now. Lisanna rummaged through her drawers to find the biggest shirt she had and slipped it on. Lucky for her the shirt actually belonged to her brother so it fit her just fine. It even covered most of her new ass, which was now free for the world to see since she also removed what remained of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard opened her door slowly and peeked her head out to see if anyone was there. It was only her and her siblings in the house but she'd prefer not to inform Elfman about her growth if she could help it. With a relieved sigh, Lisanna opened the door fully and made her way down the hall. Walking was difficult thanks to all the bouncing her assets were doing. Not to mention the forced swaying of her hips thanks to their new girth. Of course, she couldn't be mad about the sensation because she actually enjoyed it. Her face became flushed as she felt her boobs bounce with each step. Without a bra to contain them, her mammaries were free to jiggle all they wanted inside the shirt. The fact that her nipples were rubbing against the material didn't help either. It was so bad that she had to take a moment once she reached Mira's door to compose herself before knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Came Mirajane's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, it's me. Open the door please. I need your help with something,\" Lisanna panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright? You sound like you're, oh my,\" Mira said as she opened the door to see her <i>big</i> little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come in?\" she asked with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Mira allowed before opening the door fully. As her sister passed her Mira mouthed \"wow\". The older girl looked her sister up and down. While she was happy the potion worked, she was concerned because it may have worked too well. Mira never wanted to upset her sister, and giving her curves like that without her knowledge or permission could potentially make life very hard for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you want an explanation,\" Lisanna spoke  still not facing the older woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes. How...how did this happen?\" She lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I received a package with this in it,\" Lisanna said and revealed the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't drink it?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did, and that's what caused it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is it still full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. After it happened, I found it had somehow been refilled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make any sense. Once you drank it that should have been it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lisanna questioned \"did...did you give this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no,\" the take over mage squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lisanna. I just thought that if you had bigger curves that the boys might notice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mira. Natsu doesn't care about big boobs. I appreciate what you were trying to do, but next time just talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not mad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. To be honest, I actually like it. Being so big and bouncy. I just need some new clothes,\" Lisanna informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go shopping tomorrow. So, how do they feel?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really soft and sensitive. My nipples are rock solid just by them rubbing against this shirt,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as heavy as you might think. They have some heaft to them but it's nothing I can't handle.\"</span></div></div>",

The other two girls watched as the water wizard put away a rather large meal, courtesy of Mirajane, who is an amazing cook. Lisana had noticed recently that Juvia had been eating a lot. She hadn't taken Juvia to be one with a big appetite, but here she was, eating her fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisana had also noticed that Juvia clothes seemed to be getting tighter on her. It didn't take her long to realise that Juvia had been putting on quite a bit of weight recently too. The younger girl hadn't wanted to say anything, but she decided that she'd better address the matter with the bluenette. She waited until Juvia had finished eating, before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Juvia...\" She spoke up. Juvia looked at her friend, as she wiped her mouth on a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lisana?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisana took a breath. \"You, um, you seem to have been eating a bit more than usual lately. It's alright?\" Juvia frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Juvia has just been hungry lately.\" Juvia smiled at the silver haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... You appear to have gained quite a bit of weight recently.\" Lisana half mumbled, not wanting to offend her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia cheeks glowed red with embarrassment. She opened her mouth to object, but before she could, Lisana reached out and prodded a finger into Juvia now round belly. Juvia looked at herself, realising that Lisana was right. Her hips were wider, and her thighs were even pressed together in her seat. The only thing holding together her blue coat was the buttons, which looked as though they were going to pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia felt ashamed. How could she let herself become like this? And in just a few weeks! More importantly, how would Gray react to seeing her this size. Gray had been on a job for almost a month now, along with Natsu, Lucy, Erza and Wendy. She quickly stood up, and hurried out of the guild, back to her room at fairy hills. Lisana made to go after her, but felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned to see her sister, Mirajane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let her come to terms with this for the time being.\" Mira spoke. \"Some women are sensitive about their weight. She's probably a little embarresed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to offend her!\" Lisana protested. \"I actually think she looks rather cute with the extra weight...\" the younger sister muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira smiled. \"Well you can tell her the next time you see her.\" The older sister giggled. \"We both know how much you like big girls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Lisana almost yelled, blushing. \"I just don't think all girls have to be skinny for a guy to want them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Strauss sisters continued on, Juvia was back in her room. She bit her lip as she looked down at the scale. She had been rather light to begin with, but she had gained almost ten stone in four weeks. She stepped off the scale, looking hopelessly at her chubby body. She decided to go out and buy some larger clothes, so that hopefully nobody would notice how much bigger she'd become lately. She put on a loose coat, and headed out of her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she exited the building, she stopped in her tracks, as Gray looked up and saw her. He'd arrived back in Magnolia a few minutes ago, and was waiting outside fairy hills for Erza to drop off some gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gray sama...\" Juvia stuttered. The redness returned to her cheeks, as Grays eyes scanned her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia...\" Gray began. \"You... you're bigger than I remember you.\" Juvia felt ashamed that she had let herself go like this, and that great had seen her before she managed to lose some of the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does great react to Juvias weight gain? </span></div></div>",

He placed his hand on her shoulders, starting down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great.\" He remarked. Juvia looked up at him, shocked. Was this why Gray hadn't liked her before now? Did he only like big girls? 'No' Juvia thought. He was probably just trying to make her feel less uncomfortable. However, she felt his icy hands on her chubby cheeks. She looked up at him, just in time for his ice cold lips to make contact with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this real? Juvia felt in ecstasy. Gray, the only man she'd ever loved, despite her new insecurity, was kissing her, right now. The kiss seemed to go on forever, as Juvia sunk into it, placing her hands on the ice wizards chest. As the two of them pulled away for air, breathing heavier, Juvia looked back into Grays eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray sama...\" Juvia managed. \"Y-You don't mind that Juvia has gained a lot of weight while you were away?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" He replied, asking at her softly. \"In fact, I think a bit of weight makes you all the more desirable.\" Juvia giggled. Gray had actually fallen in love with her too! Any feelings that she had about her weight gain were gone, and we're replaced with good feelings. Grays hands rested on Juvias soft, wider hips, as he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think you'd look even better if you got even bigger.\" Juvia gasped. It was just a few minutes ago she'd been planning to lose weight, and now Gray wanted her to put on more weight? On the one hand, if she became slim again, Gray might not want her. On the other hand, it wasn't right for him to tell her how she should treat her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Juvia decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the middle of a foreign land, amidst a dark forest, there stands a tower that stretches up into the heavens. A structure that has stood tall for centuries, neither wind nor rain nor snow nor time itself had managed to wear away at the tower - rather, the structure still stands as though it were new - as though it was made only yesterday. This tower - decorated with sculptures of curvaceous women that acted much like columns holding the tower up - was said to be the location of a magical artefact. No one had ever been successful in reaching the prize at the top of the tower, but today a group of four dared to take on the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a young man with dark hair clad in baggy, black trousers, a grey sweater and a long white jacket worn open at the front. His expression was neutral as he looked upon the structure, folding his arms in front of himself as he inspected it. He raised a brow at the statues, but made no further comment. Instead, the young man - who went by the name of Gray Fullbuster - looked towards his comrades, as if expecting them to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" questioned a brown-haired woman to the right who caught Gray's gaze. Her outfit consisted of skinny blue jeans, a skimpy, green bikini top and a brown jacket worn open. \"If you want to say something, you should say it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to know what you thought,\" Gray responded defensively. He began to feel a pair of arms wrap around his left arm as a young, blue-haired woman clad in a dark jacket stood rather uncomfortably close. Gray nearly did a double take as he spotted her, practically jumping out of his skin. \"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Gray-sama wish to know what Juvia thinks?\" Juvia asked, her eyes wide and expecting. The dark-haired male found himself at a bit of a loss for words, but fortunately the last member of the group was willing to step in and voice her own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... Interesting...\" the red-head clad in armour mused, catching the attention of the other three. \"They must have been really good sculptors...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The quality of the sculpting isn't what everyone's thinking about, Erza...\" Cana, the brunette, remarked. \"But either way, I guess this is where our mission begins...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia will be sure to do her best!\" the blue-haired woman spoke up with a wide smile, releasing Gray's arm for a moment. The young man took the opportunity to take a step or two away, but Juvia paid it no heed. Although certainly... <i>Enamored</i> with Gray, the truth was that Juvia was also eager to take on the mission out of a sense of pride. She hadn't actually done many missions as a team with the other members of Fairy Tail - most so far had been low-level missions done to pay for her rent. But now she was faced with an opportunity to show what she was capable of in a big mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the blue-haired woman wouldn't also deny that she was eager to show what she was capable of to Gray. It was little secret that Juvia harbored feelings for Gray, but she worried a lot about whether or not he returned those feelings. She wasn't sure if this was necessarily the best way to grasp his attention, but if Juvia could show Gray how dedicated she was, perhaps he'd at least take interest in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go in and get this done with,\" Gray remarked, stepping ahead. With a smile and a nod Juvia quickly followed behind, heading for the doors to the tower. Cana and Erza both followed behind the two, both ready to unleash their magic if it came to it. As Gray and Juvia pressed against the large, heavy doors, they began to slowly push them open and wander into the inner chambers of the tower.</span></div></div>",

They can see what was directly across from the door, as they saw a murky dirt wall. Otherwise, it was completely dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOui, Cana,\u201d Gray asked turning towards the tall brunette. \u201cGot a spell to make a light?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay ahead of ya Gray,\u201d Cana reached into her pocket and brought out one of her Tarot Cards. \u201cLamp Card!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer card began to shine a light, as if was a flashlight through the darkness. Cana used the light to sweep across the dark chamber. She took note of the cobwebs and dust, but nothing particularly of note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for scriptures on the wall showing feminine figures in various poses and stances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why all of these women are posed like that,\u201d pondered Erza as she Requiped into an archeological get up, with deep brown shorts with pockets, a dark blue shirt exposing some cleavage, and a beige jacket and a white hat. She had a magnifying glass on hand looking deep into the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me. All I know is that the guys before us tried to climb this tower but couldn\u2019t reach the top,\u201d replied Gray, hands in his pockets as he looked around, Juvia sticking by his side also observing the architecture of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they say that their memories were erased or something?\u201d Commented the Bluenette. \u201cMaybe something in this tower wipes the memory of those it-\u201c<br>\r\nJuvia paled. She couldn\u2019t even bring herself to finish that sentence. If her memory were to be erased\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would lose her precious Gray-Sama that she deeply carves and etches into her head every day! She can\u2019t lose all of her precious memories of her Gray-Sama! She cannot! She absolutely cannot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026Juvia?\u201d Gray looked down and saw Juvia gripping his hand harder than usual as her face looked as if she has seen a ghost. \u201cYou alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Juvia could respond, Cana spoke up. \u201cHey! I found a door!\u201d Said the brunette as she was searching for anything of a door and came across another small wooden door. The Fairy Tail magi gathered close by and inspected the door, seeing that it had a lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it also had-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, a letter!\u201d Erza said as she took the piece of paper that was nailed to the door and Cana got up behind her to shine her Lamp Card onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IF YOU VALUE YOUR(inllegible writing) DON\u2019T GO UP!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cValue what? Your life?\u201d Asked Juvia as she stepped in with Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. Otherwise we would have never heard of this place. Everyone that has gone in has come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGray\u2019s right,\u201d surmised Erza. \u201cSomething we value\u2026how curious\u2026\u201d then a big grin came to her face. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! Maybe we should think this through,\u201d Juvia said nervously, turning around and had her hands on cheeks. \u201cI mean, Juvia would like to keep her memory of Gray-Sama and meeting Gray-Sama and seeing all the times Gray-Sama stripped intact and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was on a mini rant, the others opened the door, and saw a white mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho first?\u201d Asked Gray as he looked towards the two girls, Cana took a step back. This got her stares from the two members of Team Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not exactly a bruiser like you two. Besides, I got to keep my delicate skin in tact~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray rolled his eyes and turned towards Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, want me to go in first?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few moments of careful discussion, Gray decided to head in first. The reasoning had been that Gray's defensive abilities were the greatest of the group, meaning he could fend off any kind of surprise frontal assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping in through the mists that escaped the doorway the dark-haired mage wandered into the unknown territory beyond. His eyes looked around, trying to see past the strange mists that surrounded him. He began to frown as he continued walking. Nothing had shown up yet, but he couldn't be too cautious. This tower was a mysterious place, after all. Maybe no one who had gone in had died, but it was definitely well worth keeping his guard up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mists were slowly beginning to fade and just at the end of the corridor he could see some faint light from the end of the mists. Gray began to stride towards it, but he found himself stopping as footsteps raced behind him. He turned just in time for another body to collide with him and begin embracing him tightly, nearly knocking the breath out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Juvia-!\" he exclaimed in shock. He looked down to see the blue-haired woman in the dark coat squeezing him tightly, practically crushing his ribcage with how tightly she held on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia cannot allow Gray-sama to go alone! Juvia is worried-!\" the blue haired woman was cut off as Gray took hold of her by the forearms, trying to release the pressure on his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" he insisted. For a moment the young woman stared, her face turning slightly red for a second as she released her hold and stepped back, attempting to maintain a smile in spite of her own embarrassment. She could not afford to turn Gray-sama away, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia is sorry,\" she remarked as he released her, wishing for a moment that he hadn't let go. He turned around and stared back up the corridor. Juvia stepped to the side to gaze a whatever had caught his attention, only to soon realize that it was evidently a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another room?\" Juvia asked, a brow raised. Gray shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something,\" he remarked as he began to wander down the corridor. Quickly following his lead Juvia walked alongside him, briefly basking in the knowledge that right now she had Gray all to herself.As the two neared the end of the corridor the mists finally began to fade away, revealing a new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large, circular room adorned with pillars, atop which stood statues of women. The women were all posed differently, but each seemed to possess a curvier look to their figure than the previous statues they had seen before. Little else stood out within the room, but what they did notice was a door on the other side. It looked large and heavy - not the kind one could simply smash straight through - but above the door was a plaque. The plaque didn't have any kind of ornate sign, but upon it was written a number - 100. What did that mean? Gray frowned as he tried to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Juvia stared at a panel on the floor just in front of the large door, her brow raised in curiosity. It was very slightly raised up from the rest of the floor tiles, almost like a button waiting to be pressed. Although, given how big it was, it almost resembled a weighing scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Juvia wondered aloud to herself. This tower was most certainly not what it seemed...</span></div></div>",

Juvia was in the same state of mind as well, ready to use her magic to save Gray-sama no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead the rock shifting stopped and suddenly, white runes appeared in the center room, gaining the attention of the two mages. \"Eh?

Turns out the unlocking mechanism for these doors is affected by weight,\" said Gray as Juvia came to join him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It even told Juvia's weight too...and right in public...\" Cana wrapped her arm around the depressed bluenette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey easy there girl.

I weigh heavier myself, though it's from muscle mostly. Now,\" Erza said turning towards the dark hallway which leads into a staircase. \"Let's continue.

Juvia concedes and admits she must leave things up to fatter girls like Cana from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana pursed her lips.  \"So happy I comforted you earlier.

Get off the plate!\" Erza cried as the ice mage pulled his foot back.   She approached it, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we're dealing with something similar to Jutsu-Shiki,\" she said.  \"Think of it like a cell with the requirements, 'only those who can match or exceed this weight may pass'.  It's...more archaic, more primitive, obviously.  And if one person passes, it lets us all through.  But the principals are the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why didn't it like me?\" Gray said.  \"I weigh over a hundred and forty easily, without clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Juvia is thinking of Gray-sama without clothes!  Juvia's maidenly nose is leaking liquid love sauce!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the water mage and her nosebleed, Erza looked around the room.  \"There must be unwritten rules.   If I had to guess, then based on all these statues I'd say that it only accepts women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one way to find out if I'm right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza stepped forward on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name: Erza<br>\r\nWeight: 139</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, moments later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>140 is required.  139 is fulfilled.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd,\" Ezra said.  \"I should weigh much more than that with my armor.  Maybe it's sophisticated enough to only count actual female flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana grinned.  \"No problem!  A little more female flesh, coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped onto the plate behind Erza, snuggling into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Erza said.  \"I don't think it will let us both--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was drenched in crimson once more, and filled with the same low, tooth-rattling blast.

The two narrowly avoided the beam, and stood up off the ground as the light flickered and vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that beam does,\" Gray commented \"but I'm not in a hurry to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a bit too close for comfort, I admit.\" Erza said, brushing dust off her shirt. \"but since none of us meet the weight requirements, what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia suggests we leave and go home so that Juvia and Gray-sama can rest and recover together!\" Juvia shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up. You weren't even close to getting hurt.\" Cana snapped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four suddenly paused and looked around as the low rumbling of running water started to reverberate through the room. A statue of a woman holding a vase began to gently pour pinkish-coloroed water from the opening of the vase into a small canal that ran the perimeter of the room. The liquid sparkled and shone as it filled the small rut and flowed around the edge of the chamber, eventually reaching a drain on the opposite side of the room and flowing back out, making a small stream running in a circle around the group. A chime sounded, and the runes above the door shifted to form new words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Requirements not currently met.<br>\r\nPlease drink until requirements have been fulfilled</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Cana wore a mildly dumbfounded expression reading the words \"Please drink? I guess it means the pink stuff, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting... I suppose we are left with little choice. We have no reason to trust this setup, but it would be an odd way to poison a person, and I see no other way to proceed\" Erza summoned a goblet with her requip and filled it with the sweet smelling fluid. \"There are risks to consider, but I see no other way to progress. Cheers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzra took a quick, decisive sip of the water in her glass before any of the others had a chance talk her out of it. The moment the liquid entered her mouth, the armored mage's eyes widened. This was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted! It was like a thousand strawberry shortcakes having a tea party in her mouth. Ezra quickly downed the whole goblet, not even stopping for breath until the entire glass had been consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each gulp, Erza's body changed. Her hips grew subtly wider, her belly softer, her breasts bigger. Even her face was more cherubic and her arms and legs less toned. The changes were subtle enough that Gray, Cana, and Juvia almost didn't notice them, but notice them they did. A single glass of the pink water flowing around the room had made their friend gain almost five whole pounds right in front of their eyes. The three were stunned, only snapping out of it once Erza wiped her mouth and breathed a sigh of shear pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... quite delicious.\" She said, subconsciously tugging at the edge of her shirt \"Oh? My clothes feel a bit tight... What are you all looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana was the first to speak up: \"You just gained a bunch of weight all at once! Don't tell me you didn't notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I am a bit pudgier. I expected as much. This tower seems to be designed to make those who don't meet the weight requirements gain weight until they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell kind of twisted security system is that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But we may need to gain progressively more weight as we go in order to proceed. I am happy to take this burden for the group, if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness!\" Juvia chimed in \"Juvia was worried she would be expected to become a butterball as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let your guard down, Juvia.\" Erza replied \"We still don't know what lies ahead.\" The slightly heavier girl stepped onto the stone plate, and the runes read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name: Erza<br>\r\nWeight: 143</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>140 is required. 143 is fulfilled</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we move on?\"</span></div></div>",

The mage had requipped out of her heavy armor and into normal, if slightly snug, clothing in order to relieve some of the burden of her extra pounds. A heavy sigh escaped her mouth as they reached the top of the stairs.<br>\r\n     \"Uh oh...\"Gray said as she entered the next chamber. The rest of the group knew exactly what he was concerned about: in the center of the room was not one, but two stone squares, and the plaque above the door showed three numbers. In the center read in large font: 350. The bottom corners of the plaque showed two smaller numbers, in both quantity and font size, 180 and 150. <br>\r\n    \"What the heck is this?!\" Cana shouted \"So now two of us have to get big? What are all these extra numbers?\"<br>\r\n    \"I suspect that the 350 in the middle is the total combined weight requirement of both women, and the smaller numbers are the minimum weights of the individuals.\" Erza deduced \"This tower is quickly becoming problematic.\"<br>\r\n   \"NO! Juvia doesn't want to become fat! Juvia wants to stay skinny and sexy for Gray-sama!\" the water mage clung to her beloved's arm, as Gray attempted to shake her off.<br>\r\n   \"Yeah, I'm not thrilled about sacrificing my waistline either.\" Cana said \"Are we sure this is worth it? Maybe we should turn back now before the weight requirements get too high.\"<br>\r\n   Erza rubbed her hand against the layer of softness on her stomach. She knew she <i>should</i> be worried about losing her warrior's physique, but part of her - a large part of her - wanted to keep going, not just to see what was at the top of this strange place, but because she almost liked the idea of growing bigger, curvier, having more presence.<br>\r\n   \"Juvia, Cana, we were hired to do a job. Are we so vain that a little fat will discourage us from keeping our word? We are members of Fairy Tail, and that means that we have a reputation that must be upheld.\"<br>\r\n   \"What?\" Cana exclaimed \"You're nuts! Gray, can you please help me talk some sense into her?\"<br>\r\n   Gray looked to the side \"Actually... Erza has a point. We have a job to do, and we have to see it through. I'd volunteer if I could, but this place doesn't seem to care for men, so...\"<br>\r\n   Cana sighed. She wasn't getting out of this one. \"Fine, but you owe me big time.\"<br>\r\n   The tarot mage and the requip mage stepped onto the plates, Erza on the 180 plate since she was the heavier of the two, and the magic text appeared:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <b>350 total is required. 268 is fulfilled</b><br>\r\n   <b>Name: Erza Weight: 143 Requirement: 180</b><br>\r\n   <b>Name: Cana Weight: 125 Requirement: 150</b><br>\r\n   <b>Requirements not currently met, please eat until requirements have been fulfilled</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A table materialized before the two wizards, and on it was a massive sheet cake that covered it's surface, iced in pink frosting the same color as the water from the previous floor. Erza stepped forward and summoned a pair of plates and eating utensils, handing Cana one of each. The red-haired woman dug in immediately, but Cana hesitated. Steeling herself, she finally cut a piece of cake and began to eat.<br>\r\n  The two women devoured the entire cake within minutes, drawn in by the sheer sweet flavor that it shared with the drink from the floor below. As they ate, they grew curvier, clothes strained and the weight piled on.<br>\r\nErza's hips grew wider and her legs touched together, her breasts and arms were laden with fat, but they were insignificant compared to her large gut, which hung down over her crotch. She flinched a little as a button on her shirt popped off of the large dome, but quickly resumed feasting.<br>\r\n   Cana was smaller than Erza, and didn't eat quite as fast, but she was still getting pretty large. Her butt stuck out several inches and pushed against her skinny jeans. Her thighs did the same. Her stomach was just a small potbelly compared to Erza's gut, but her boobs were easily bigger despite the other woman's head start. Her bra squished into her back fat and caused her boobs to squeeze together to form a black hole of cleavage.<br>\r\n    Once the cake was gone, the two women</span></div></div>",

It started out as a thin line barely the width of his finger, that swirled and curved up and down, gaining height with each step they took. But as they neared the end of the staircase, the line got thicker and thicker, smaller lines seeming to join it, to conglomerate into one larger piece. It looked really cool, he thought. The only sounds they heard though, were of their steps on the stone and the clanking of Erza's armor as she moved. He didn't like silence that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, once we do this, anyone planning to do anything special with the reward we're going to get?\" Gray asked.

It didn't seem like he was intentionally putting off what he intended, but was just focused on the mission. \"So, what do you think, the last one needed 100 pounds, so this is probably 110 or maybe 120, so you can probably do it again Juvia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if Gray-sama wishes it,\" the blue-haired mage said, going to step on the panel.</span></div></div>",

A fork grasped firmly in Erza's hand slammed down on the plate and knocked the cupcake off, right into Erza's waiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... cakes...\" Erza said between bites of the cupcake. Her cheeks were constantly puffed up from having so much pastry in her mouth. Juvia backed up, holding the plate up to her face and covering up everything except her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia just wanted a bite... there's plenty of food...\" she said, sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Erza, let her have some if she wants to eat,\" Gray said. \"Cana can have some too if she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'm good ice-boy, strawberries aren't really my thing,\" the alcoholic mage said in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm under the assumption the food will regenerate as often as needed, so have what you want,\" Erza said, backing away from Juvia so she could continue eating the half of a cheesecake she'd sliced for herself. Already it was getting apparent that the cakes were having an effect on her waistline. The thin, athletic mage was starting to get some fat forming around her sides. The beginnings of a set of love handles and a matching muffintop that was starting to push out over her skirt. She was undeterred by this though, and kept eating. It remained to be seen whether she was still eating to intentionally gain weight, or if the cakes were so delicious she had forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia smiled at Erza's acceptance and grabbed a cupcake, and a few strawberry cookie sandwiches as well. She took a small bite of the cupcake, getting a nice amount of cake and frosting between her lips before swallowing. Her eyes sparkled, and she quickly took another, even bigger, bite. The cute mage let out a happy squeal as she held one cheek in her open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! It tastes like Gray-sama,\" Juvia said, chewing the rest of the cupcake and eating the cream-filled sandwich next. She finished that quickly and then sat down next to Erza so she could get more treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why do you know what I taste like?\" Gray said, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably don't wanna know,\" Cana said, patting the ice mage on his bare back. He had stripped off his shirt in the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia and Erza both continued to eat as much as they could. They just couldn't get enough of the strawberry-flavored treats. Erza was still moaning with ecstasy even after gulping down at least a half-dozen cakes all by herself. Her breasts and butt were beginning to feel tight inside of her default armor, the panties she wore underneath her skirt were slightly wedged up her butt as the formerly firm cheeks became padded with a layer of adipose. Juvia was already showing the signs of a soft pot belly in her dark coat, pushing out about two inches. She at least recognized her growth as she examined it with a few pushes of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, Juvia is starting to get pudgy too!\" she said, having another cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... stop eating Juvia. Only Erza needed to get fatter,\" Gray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray-sama is right,\" Juvia said, standing up and grabbing one more cookie sandwich for the walk back to her beloved. She finished it after a few steps and found herself going back for more. She tried once more to leave, and barely got up from the table before sitting down again. She was piling even more food onto her plate now, matching Erza's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvi, you okay?\" Cana said, putting her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good, Juvia, can't stop! Juvia, mmm, doesn't want to stop, it's so tasty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, mm. If it weren't cakes I'd say I would have stopped ages ago, but, mm, there's something, so good, about these that makes it, ngh, very hard to stop,\" Erza said, her lips coating in strawberry glaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray pressed his palm against his forehead in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now they're addicted, what do we do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shape shifter smiled and filled the mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy,\" Mira smiled and handed her back the mug. Cana took it and swirled the liquid around in the glass before sniffing it. It had a sweet smell. She took a swig and noted the lack of bitterness and a much weaker burn on her throat. A wave washed over her almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Cana stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it?\" Mira questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...different,\" she said before taking another drink. The wave hit her again, this time harder. A tingling sensation appeared in her rear. Without warning Cana downed the entire mug. She sighed in satisfaction and almost fell over when the wave hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" Mira asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It packs quite a punch,\" Cana shrugged. She sat back down on the stool, not noticing she hit it  sooner than she normally did. As she sat down the tingling in her ass intensified for a moment causing her to gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Cana?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...hit me again,\" Cana blushed. 'That felt good,\" she thought. Mira refilled the mug and gave it back. Cana pounded the beer and practical moaned as the rush overcame her. Her pants felt tighter than normal but she didn't care. \"Again.\" The cycle when through a few more times. A red hue covered Cana's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you like it,\" Mira assumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best damn beer I've ever had,\" Cana moaned. Cana undid her belt and readjusted herself on the stool. \"Get me another will you,\" she ordered. As mira refilled the mug she noticed Cana was a little higher over the bar than normal. Not by much. Maybe and inch or two but she was definitely sitting differently. Cana drank the next beer and smiled as she let the alcohol take its affect. As the feeling subsided Cana noticed the tingling in her ass didn't go away. A loud ripping sound went through the guild hall. She examined her behind and saw her pants slightly split on the seem. As she saw this she also noticed some more flesh on her cheeks. She ran a hand over her ass and then shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Cana stated and pointed to her mug.</span></div></div>",

I don't plan to slow down any time soon,\" Cana smiled as she downed the new glass. Cana rubbed her thigh as the tingling spread to her hips. \"What's in this stuff anyway?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know actually. The brewer said they added a new flavoring. Said it was supposed to be really filling,\" Mira elaborated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's filling alright,\"' Cana agreed and downed the next mug. The seems along her legs started to give as her thighs began to fill with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that sound?\" Mira wondered looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Cana said and unbuttoned her pants and unzipped them. Cana sighed and drank the mug a little slower this time. The next one she drank slowly, trying to keep the wave going for as long as she could. Savoring the taste as her butt grew with each swallow. Her ass spilled over the ends of the stool by the time she had finished her drink. Cana got up off the stool and kicked it out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finished?\" Mira asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? I was just tired of sitting,\" Cana said. She looked behind her and examined her new behind. She could see it without having to turn her neck all the way. Her new bubble butt stuck out about 6in and her hips gained 2in on both sides. She grabbed a hand full of ass and shook it gently enjoying how it wobbled. \"Any curves are good curves right?\" Cana said quietly. </span></div></div>",

After the seventh, Mira started to sway her hips more do to her expanding ass and thighs. Cana noticed Mira inflating quicker than she had. She guessed it was do to Mira's lower alcohol resistance. The fun stopped when Cana's panties finally snapped from the growth. Mira looked up and saw her guild mates humongous ass. Cana's hips had to be 4 ft wide and each cheek the size of a beach ball. \"Oh my god Cana! What happened?\" Mira shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the beer,\" Cana calmly stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beer?\" Mira repeated. She slowly turned her head to inspect her own ass.

With each swallow she grew and with each inch she gained she wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>More, more, more. I need more. I need to grow I need to be bigger. I need all of it</i>!' Mira thought. The results were immediate. Mira's ass surged outward and collided with the bar. Cana was sent flying, landing on her new cushion. The take over wizard's hips flared outward making quick work of her skirt. She soon was to large to fit behind the bar and her growing butt destroyed it. Giving her room to grow.

She felt a tingling flow through her before it settled in her ass. \"This is good,\" she agreed. She drank more of her mug taking pleasure in both the buzz and the tingling sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira!\" Cana said almost shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called your name 3 times,\" Cana explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. What do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A refill please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, no problem,\" Mira said and took her mug. She refilled both before giving Cana back her's and returning to her own. Cana would drink her's quickly while Mira would savor her's. Every time Cana would have to pull her guildmate back from her realm of bliss for another drink. Eventually Cana got sick of waiting and moved behind the counter so she could do it herself. Mira didn't seem to notice or care. As they drink both girls butts would expand. Cana's swiftly moved to bubbly butt status while most of Mira's growth went to her hips. The brunette's pants split down the back seam giving her move room to grow. Mira's  long skirt, however, gave her plenty of room. </span></div></div>",

She looked down at her guild mate's hips noticing they had to be about 17 inches in diameter after her two mugs. She couldn't see her ass but Cana was sure it was growing just as fast. Examining her own assets she noticed her pants completely split down her bum. Her panties, being elastic, held on for now. But, as Cana took another swig and saw her cheeks push outwards she knew it would only be a matter of time. She ran her free hand up and down her new ass admiring it's scope. She took another drink and kept her hand firm as the fat pushed against it. She pocked and prodded her hind end and smiled as it jiggled with each touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Mira asked. Cana looked up from her body and saw Mira starring at her eyebrow raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Cana stated taking a big gulp and imagining what her butt looked like now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep looking behind you. Is something wrong? Did you get something on your pants?\" Mira asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like something got out of them,\" Cana chuckled.

Cana's pants groaned as they tried to contain the growing ass flesh. With a pained grunt Cana was able to remove the button of her pants and the zipper was forced down. Her new and improved butt stuck out a full 12 inches from her pelvis. \"Now this is an ass!\" Cana declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's certainly impressive,\" Mira agreed. Realizing what was happening Mira ran a hand along her own rear end. She didn't know how to react at first. She was no stranger to being curvy but this may have been too much. She took another drink and felt her bum expand. She placed her hand on her right cheek and took a few more sips. As her hand was pushed away she decided she liked it. She swayed her hips and felt the momentum they carried. \"It looks like I need to catch up,\" Mira concluded before filling her mug. As the two continued they kept track of the others growth. With time Cana's hips began to expand as well to allow her cheeks more room. With a little magic she removed her pants completely and revealed in the freedom she felt. Mira pulled her skirt up and rested it on her new shelf to get a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I can't get enough of my ass,\" Cana said bending over to give Mira a better view. Each cheek had to be the size of a basketball. \"I have the biggest butt in Fiora!\" She screamed in delight giving it a smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I've grow to be quite the pear,\" Mira spoke with a 3 foot hips diameter. \"A moment of the hips a life time on the hips doesn't seem to do me justice. I won't be able to fit in doors soon.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How cruel is fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel, the former member of the dark guild, Oraci\u00f3n Seis, had to honestly contemplate this more than once. In the past, she was one of many who were subject to being imprisoned in the \"Tower of Heaven\" where she (would have) been used to revive some important old crone she knew nothing about. However, she had managed to get out of this during the slave revolt in the tower and, after meeting Brain, became a member of one of the most powerful dark guilds in Earth Land. For a time, things were good for her; she had freedom, power and a chance to enjoy herself for once...until she met her defeat, that is. After that, Angel was captured and imprisoned yet again, but was done so for her own involvement with the very dark guild she saw as her salvation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Angel's disdain for being where she was, it was clear that it was here in prison she would remain. Time marches on and after seven long years, nothing seems to have changed for the so called 'fallen Angel'. Sure, there were a few occasional prison riots accompanied by the same fools who believed that could escape the walls of this magically enchanted prison. For a time, Angel sought entertainment and even a little hope in these occasional upsets in order. To her, it was good to see the regular escape attempt as this gave her a chance see if she could do the same by analyzing their methods and gauging their success. Unfortunately, the numerous efforts of other prisoners were only met with the prison guards returning with their limp, unconscious body and the return of the stale atmosphere prison life entailed. After the latest failure to escape, involving something about a rocket powered toilet and explosion magic, Angel convinced herself that no one was going to be getting out of here any time soon and agreed to merely turn a blind eye to what she normally saw for both entertainment and analysis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, Angel merely lay on the dank cot in her cell, staring at the ceiling as the moonlight from the window across from her quarters bled into the chamber. It was midnight but, Angel's sense of time was all but broken thanks to her imprisonment and she had lost count of what day it was...or even what month it had become during the beginning weeks here. Angel's face contorted with irritation as her dainty hands rested on her middle, a hungered growl radiating in the vast emptiness of her stomach. Angel was usually a light eater...but, when one doesn't have a decent meal in...well, years, you tend become more than a little ravenous. Angel had lost weight due to her meager prison meals, the grey prison garb she wore having being full with her feminine curves during the start of her prison sentence. Now, it was beginning to loosen with each passing month, her body growing thinner and weaker to reflect an equally hopeless situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never thought she'd feel this same hunger...this same feeling she had when she was trapped in the Tower of Heaven during her younger days... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, this was where she would remain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUD<b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, so she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel brought herself upright as she witnessed a passing guard pass out in front of her cell, an enigmatic purple mist sparkling in the moonlight and saturating the halls. The uncertainty of what this mist was made Angel scoot back on her cot, her mind characterizing the mist as one thing, \"Poison...!?\" Was she...was she on death row after all? Dammit, those bastards told her she only had 50 years not, execution!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blegh, sheesh, mighta used too much...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel paused as the sound of a masculine voice echoed through the prison halls, the mist beginning to clear as it was blown away by a gentle breeze coming from down the hall. The source of this breeze made itself known as a average sized young man with short brown hair came into Angel's view, a paper fan in hand. The young man himself was fairly toned, not being without his fair share of muscle and fitness, this being held true by his exposed arms that jutted from a sleevless green tunic he wore. A pair of brown trousers covered his legs while those of boots did the same for his feet. Large armored gloves fitted around his fists, the fan gripped within his grasp looking comically small due to his large gloves. In a lot of aspects, Angel could liken the young man to a farmer of sorts, if only due to his wide-brimmed straw hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even so...what's a 'farmer' doing breaking into a high security Mage prison in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, are you the girl they call...Angel?\" The man questioned taking a moment to look her over and thumbing through the physical outlook of the one he wished to find. Sure enough, she fit the appearance in his memory perfectly...well, sorta; she was a bit fuller in figure from what people told him, now she just looked a bit too skinny. \"You uh...you fit the description.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Angel saw no point in keeping silent on the questions buzzing underneath her silvery mop. \"First off, who the hell are you?\" She asked with an apprehensive but, rather cold glare. \"Second, what do you even want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I should explain...\" The straw hat man muttered, before he stepped back and reeled his fist back. \"Well, the name's Marco Agaric and, to put it simply...\" His arm mucles bulged as magical energy pulsed through his arm, a large mushroom manifesting in place of his glove as he threw it forward and knocked the sturdy prison bars clean off their hinges. Angel jumping in surprise from the clattering of the steel pitifully falling to the ground and looking up to the escape route this 'Marco' had created for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm bustin' you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...this was a joke, right...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this guy seriously breaking into this prison...to break HER out of it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sure seemed like it, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're joking,\" Angel shook her head in disbelief, the mage being her too long to believe that someone was actually helping her escape. She was supposed to die here...not be rescued by a random mushroom mage farmer guy. \"Why me, why not anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really have time to explain in full but, let's just say you're destined for bigger, better things and I'm willin' to train ya...\" Marco said, his large mutated arm morphing back to normal size and shape as he walked into the cell. The mushroom mage took a brown bag off from his back and rummaged within it, soon coming to produce something odd and propose something odder. \"But first, eat this. You'll need it.\" The mushroom mage pulled out a glowing fruit from his leather bag. Angel's black eyes gazed at the pineapple shaped fruit, it's color being a bright yellow as a lime green energy glowed within it's core. The fruit was big enough to fit in the palm of her hand but when held by Marco, it looked positively microscopic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel's stomach rumbled as she gazed at the luminous fruit, the hunger that gripped her giving all the reason to gobble up this strange fruit and not give two squats what happens after digestion. However, Angel wasn't about to rush into this, she knows of betrayal and was not about to suffer through any of it anytime soon. This was all...so sudden and random that she found it hard to follow through on. \"Hmph, why should I trust you? How do I know you're not going to betray me later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting a little old. \"Look, I know this is all too good to be true, but we ain't got a lot of time.\" He looked back, the guard still asleep as he planned but, he knew the others would not stay like that for long. Time was running out and he needed to get Angel out of here before security tightened like a constricting python. \"My Lazy Spore spell won't last more than 15-20 minutes tops and we're already on the clock. So...unless you want us both going back in the slammer, you'll eat this here fruit, clench your butt and get ready for one hell of an escape. I promise I'll spill the beans whenever we're as far away from this place as we can get.\"</b></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beggers couldn't be choosers, and right now, Angel was being quite the chooser...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like she didn't want to escape from this dreary prison, it was the fact that everything was going so fast and being conducted by someone she didn't really know. Sure he could be leading her on into a trap but, right now, this could be her one and only chance to break free of these chains and make a break for it. Angel weighed her options, and glanced down to the glowing fruit she (supposedly) had to devour. She...didn't know why she needed to eat this but, if it meant getting out of here, then she'd have to trust Marco on his word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my eye on you.\" Angel told the mushroom mage, quickly grabbing the glowing fruit in her hand and cramming it hungrily into her maw. She normally, would have taken bites out of the weird fruit, but her hunger drove her to ditch feminine manners and messily eat the magical fruit and gulp it down. Angel thumped her fist on her chest a bit, the fruit's half chewed and half whole form hitting snags on the way down, but her gesture managing to send it on it's way into her stomach. The taste of the fruit...was actually very good, being sweet and juicy without any seeds (oddly enough). Angel could feel a lot of aspects in her body strengthening by the second, mostly in her waning strength. Her stomach let out a growl of thanks, Angel blushing a bit from her stomach's outburst as it set to digest the fruit and process the nourishment it held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. Now all we have to do is get outta here.\" Marco said, heading out of Angel's cell and checking the halls, everyone was still out cold which meant there was still time to get the funk out of dodge before the gassed beehive of prison guards woke up to sting their asses. \"Annd we're still good on time. Let's scoot, I don't wanna be around when this place starts buzzin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you remember your way back?\" Angel inquired to Marco, as she followed the mushroom mage down the hall to, what she hoped, was her freedom. \"Avernus Rock is built like a labyrinth...only the guards know how to move through the prison.\" A maze like design of the prison was a natural defense against escaping prisoners, and those who wished to infiltrate. Lost enemies were usually captured before they could even figure out which turn they had taken that caused them to get lost in the first place. Marco merely nodded, bringing his arm back and throwing his mushroom fist forward to bust through the first door, the escaping duo coming out in a massive hall of chains, halls and prison cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" Marco trailed off, Angel giving him a flat look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I do, I just need to figure out which way I took getting here.\" Marco said, completely disregarding the fact that it still showed that he didn't recall which way he took getting in. \"Don't worry, I got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a sinking feeling that you don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco ignored Angel's lack of faith in him and continued to examine his surroundings, the ticking of the clock seeming to do him no justice in coming up with any sort of correct answer. \"Bah, screw this.\" Marco said with a click of his teeth as his fist slammed onto the ground. \"Summoning Magic: Agaricus Muttshroom!\" Marco declared, a dark green magic circle manifesting beneath both him and Angel, the silver haired mage looking down in confusion. The glowing runes soon gave rise to a giant, quadrapedal creature, the body being similar to a dog but the head looking more like a lizard with a giant mushroom spurting from it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, trying to navigate this place is bunk, let's just bust through all the walls.\" Marco said, climbing up onto the giant mushroom that grew from the beasts head, Angel would have done the same but...she a bit taken a back to really move from her seat on the creature's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, but won't everyone wake up from the noise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, Lazy Spore functions by time limit, so we can make as much noise as we want!\" And with that, the mushroom monster let out a roar and bolted forward, lunging at the nearest wall and using it's hulking size to break the stone walls of the prison and appearing on another path, this one seeming to be on an incline that lead upward and around to a higher level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this way!\" Angel called out, pointing up the incline. \"We're in S-Block which means we need to go higher!\" Avernus Rock was divided up by 'blocks' each one being relevant to the accused mage's crimes. In Angel's case, her being associated with one of the most powerful dark guilds netted her a nice, cozy cell in S-Block; a place where the worst criminals go and was also the furtherst from the entrance to the prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it! Let's go, Muttshroom!\" Marco shouted, his fungal summon turning around and running forth up the incline and began it's destructive rampage through the once peaceful prison. Angel held on as tight as she could manage, the fungal beast doing it's absolute beast to tear it's way through S-Block and make it to the entrance no matter the cost. Angel had no sense of how long the 'escape' took but, her mind could only guess that Marco and Muttshroom was at this for awhile. However, a quick glance at a passing wall showed Angel that they were actually making progress as her eyes laid witness the word \"B-Block\". As much as she doubted Marco to actually produce results in their escape attempt...he was actually making decent progress despite the less than precise manner he was handling things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we getting close? I can't really tell!\" Marco asked to Angel, seeming to think that she knew at least something of the prison's layout given her hint from earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little farther, we need to get past A-Block and we're home free!\" However, something in Angel's gut told her that it wasn't going to be that easy. Angel may not have had much sense of time, but she knew that a lot of it had passed since Marco's break in and supposed usage of Lazy Spore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all we have to do is make it outta here and we're home free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's far enough!\" Came a cold, womanly voice from below, Angel knowing just who this voice belonged to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her...\" Angel muttered, gritting her teeth as she realized by just hearing this voice their chances for escape, let alone survival, were severely reduced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her? Her who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warden Satanaya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco blinked and looked down to see a tall, domineering woman down below, sporting militaristic look and feel to her. Long, icy blue hair cascaded down from underneath a military cap, her complexion fair and flawless. A pair of crimson eyes burned from behind the oval shaped glasses she doned as light pink lipstick glazed across her full lips. She was a curvaceous woman, having a large bosom and full hips that filled the nooks and reaches of her fitting military uniform. A flowing red cape hung down from behind, further proving her status as this prison's top dog and ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever trick using some form of sleeping magic to put my guards to sleep, I can say that's perhaps the only factor in why you managed to get this far.\" Satanaya remarked, unsheathing her rapier and thrusting it to the two defiant mages (plus one fungal monster). \"But rest assured this is as far as you two will ever get. You should be familiar with Avernus Rock's slogan...once you enter, you may never leave.\" A chilling wind howled through the cavernous halls of A-Block, Satanaya's red gaze glowering of a paradoxical mix of an icy fire that burned of vengeance...a vengeance for Marco and Angel causing such a ruckus in her prison. She was going to make them pay the ultimate price for disturbing her hive of faithful drones and flawless reputation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel didn't like the look of this. Freedom maybe within their grasp but she already knew they were stuck just by the warden being here. If they chose to fight, Satanaya would merely drag on the fight until everyone awoke and then things would <b>really</b> get bad. \"Marco, we have to run!\"</span></div></div>",

Something about the ice queen of a warden told of a tactical and reserved woman that knew exactly of how he was going to work. That said, Marco needed to do the unthinkable...and that meant fighting Warden Satanaya! \"Muttshroom, get Angel out of the way!\" Marco barked, throwing himself off the fungal monster who barked his own acknowledgement as it's summoner hurtled down to the warden awaiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ BGM Load ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rediAz1yBk&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rediAz1y...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to save you!\" Satanaya declared, raising her sword on high. A magic circle expanding beneath her as the an icy magic swelled through her form. The warden was on the attack. \"Ice-Make - Nifelhiem Sabre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco threw his gaze upward as he saw a magical gate manifest from above several large swords made up of ice appearing in it's area and ready to drop at any given second. He landed with a thud and rolled, dashing to Satanaya with his fists transforming for his assault. \"Muttshroom!\" Marco barked, the beast of living fungus leaping out of the attacks vicinity just in time for the icy swords to fall onto it's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matango Knuckle!\" Marco threw his fist forth, his arm swelling many times it's normal size into that of a gigantic fist with mushrooms sprouting from it's muscular length. Naturally, Satanaya set to deal with this by defending focusing on the incoming fist and not moving a single muscle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice Make - Riot Shield!\" A rectangular construct jutted out in between Satanaya and the mushroom mage, the shield buckling slightly underneath Marco's might but holding fast and doing it's job despite the cracks at the center of impact. \"Just by fighting me, you've signed your admission to this prison.\" Satanaya coldly declared, thrusting her rapier forward and shoving the shield forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to take me in kicking and screaming, girly!\" Marco pushed back, attempting to stop it's advance. It didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only one to scream is you...\" Satanaya muttered, eyes narrowed, as she coldly uttered her next words. \"Ice Make - Iron Maiden...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco paused, looking behind him to see the enormous visage of an iron maiden standing a ways behind him, the chilling construction wafting of mist as it creaked open to reveal a death sentence of thousands upon thousands of icicles just waiting to impale him the moment the shield shoved him inside. Marco's eyes went wide as he finally realized how much danger he was in and how little time there was to react. \"Ah shit!\" He stammered, throwing himself to the side of the shield's advance and caught his footing to rush back toward Satanaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy warden was already gearing up for Marco's brazen charge, quite literally even. \"Ice-Make - Gatling Cocytus.\" At her command, a pair of immense gatling guns materialized at Satanaya's side, the warden thrusting her rapier to the advancing Marco. The icy firearms complied in kind by whirring to life, their barrels spinning faster and faster before a volley of icicles fired forth bombarding  Marco's rush forward. The mushroom mage ducked and dodged as best he could, his attention barely able to catch Satanaya as she charged, rapier at the ready to strike him while he was occupied with not getting shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh dip! Mole Truffle!!\" Marco dove forward arms, transforming into mutated mushroom claws as he disappeared into the floor of the battlefield, sending out a thick plume of noxious spores in his wake. Satanaya halted in her charge and covered her nose and mouth with her cape, eyes beginning to itch and water from the spore's presence slowly enveloping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>D-Damn, he went below ground...</i>\" Satanaya cursed, canceling the fire of her Cocytus Gatling to further tune herself into her surroundings for any sudden movements. The prison fell silent, Satanaya's red eyes doing their best to make any sudden motions as her ears picked up the slack to hear anything out of the ordinary. Soon enough, the sound of the floor giving way alerted Satanaya to her left side, the warden turning to see a familiar figure jumping out of the stone floor. \"Found you!\" Satanaya rushed forward and jammed her rapier right into the forehead of the concealed Marco, the dangerously pointed blade making a distinct piercing sound as it impaled the head of her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatanaya's eyes widened with shock as she saw the visage of what she truly stabbed, a mushroom shaped like Marco that had been erected from the ground to throw her off. \"Wh-what!?\" The warden stuttered, her sense of focus thrown off for only a second before she looked to her side and in a split second heard the floor give way right beside her. Impulse took over as she tried to cast another Ice-Make to defend--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matango Knuckle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense force of Marco's enlarged mushroom knuckle slammed into Satanaya's side, as it's bulky mass shot out from the ground just beside Satanaya. Marco shoved his fist forward and sent Satanaya went spiraling off toward Muttshroom of Angel's position, Marco popping his upper body out of the hole and perking up at the opening of a finisher for this entire thing. \"Muttshroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttshroom barked out, raising it's paw and catching Satanaya in mid air and knocking her to the floor, the collision resounding with an earthly boom. The once powerful warden of Avernus Rock now lay in a self made crater, down...but not out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not bad...but that's nothing compared to what I have in store for you...\" She said forcing herself up, trembling a little from the aches in her body but, not about to let those slow her down in the mission to apprehend these two. \"Let me show you just why they appointed me as Warden of Avernus Rock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh damn...she's still got reserve powers!?</i>\" Marco stepped back, now beginning to realize he...probably should have taken Angel's advice and run for it when he had the chance. \"<i>Damn, I think I might fucked this one up...bad.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel, while feeling just as cornered as Marco, had another sensation to deal with; a persistent hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle bubbled from the, supposedly, empty recesses of Angel's gut, the pangs of an untamed hunger twisting in her like a vice. She had thought that fruit would have tied her over until she got out...it seems that the odd fruit wasn't enough after all. She needed something more...filling, something bigger, meatier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt HAD to be meat...but, where was she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Warden Satanaya</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...</span></div></div>",

In no time to spare, the prisoner's maw gapped wide to recieve Satanaya's face and clamped down on her head slurping her up and back into her gullet as her hand guided the rest of her down her yawning throat. Muffled screams and protests rang out from the grotesquely large bulge that was slowly sliding down deeper into Angel's eager gut, the prisoner tilting her head up as Satanaya's large bosom slipped into her mouth and sent the rest of her torso down to join the rest of the hapless warden in Angel's steadily expanding middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco emerged from the hole and looked up to the curious spectacle, thunderous gulps and swallows echoing back to his position and beckoning him forward to lay witness to Angel...actually eating his opponent. \"...Uhm.\" Was all he could say as more and more of Satanaya disappeared behind Angel's lips and deposited itself into the growing pale dome that wriggled and squirmed from underneath her worn out prison blouse. The clatter of metal resounded through the prison as Angel wrenched the rapier loose from Satanaya's hands and tossed it elsewhere, not about to have her belly sliced open by such a pointy object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were reaching the final stretch as only the kicking legs of Satanaya remained outside, Angel pressing onto the struggling warden's large, shapely backside to push her down her throat and with another damning swallow, the stocking clad legs and black high heeled boots disappeared from all outside view and slid down Angel's throat joining the rest of Satanaya's thrashing body in Angel's extremely swollen gut. Angel had very little to say on her actions and merely tried to process this overstuffed sensation, her ebbing midsection far bigger than she would have imagined thanks to her meal's taller stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods...umf...too much...\" Angel was still a novice at...whatever it is she just did and while, she felt like she would wretch Satanaya back up, her stomach clenched all openings and exits as it tried to digest it's immense and thrashing workload. Angel winced as a deep booming rattled within her belly, a flickering of cyan blue light giving hints as to what was going on in her labored gut. Groans rose from both Angel and her stomach as Satanaya tried time after time with her Ice-Make spells to get out...but with litle results save for causing Angel's belly to swell out with each failed attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your gut's pretty tough...\" Marco noted, Angel shooting him an evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you...quit marveling and help me?\" Angel burped, her stomach gurgling around it's tough meal as digestion tried to begin as a means of silencing this active morsel. \"Ugh...really wish she would just *urp* settle down already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to let nature take it's course for this one.\" Marco noted, hoisting Angel up and trying his best to both hold her up and remain standing from how hard Satanaya was struggling inside her. Muttshroom lowered his head down as as Marco helped the bloated Angel up and came to set her down on the beast's back. They were only half way out but, things were only just beginning for the poor stuffed Angel. Marco perked up as he heard the clamoring of the slowly awakening prison staff, his heart skipping several beats as he slapped Muttshroom's back. \"Let's move, Muttshroom. Times up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the mushroom beast burst through the wall of A-Block and through the main gate, it's large form running across the stone pier and disappearing into the forests just seconds before the sirens blared from the revelation that there had been a break in...and one of it's prisoners was missing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It just made her stretched out stomach ache more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay back there?\u201d asked Marco as he controlled the beast as it weaved it\u2019s way past the trees. Angel could only groan and grunt as she tried to massage her engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026what the\u2026hell,\u201d she panted. She gave an \u201cumf\u201d and seethed when Muttshroom bounced over a rock. Her hands went to her stomach as she closed her eyes in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell what?\u201d Responded the Mushroom mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you\u2026feed me!\u201d She glared. Marco opened his mouth to answer, but the two of them heard wailing alarms in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, here come their airships,\u201d growled Marco. Up head, the two saw a cave to the left. He turned his head, his face meeting Angels, who nodded in turn despite the endured expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiyup!\u201d He commanded, and Muttshroom bounded to the cave and went in further and further until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that\u2019s far enough,\u201d said Marco as the mushroom dog-lizard stopped and lowered it\u2019s head to help it\u2019s occupants to the ground. Marco lept off first and offered his arms to the white haired girl, who was struggling to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time now,\u201d muttered Marco, Angel threw him a look. And finally she slided off the beast\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd crashed onto Marco, her giant three-foot distended medicine ball belly smothering him. Angel winced and seethed with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod daaammnit\u2026\u201d She moaned. Marco rolled out under her and offered his hands to help her up. She took them and wobbled up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuttshroom, close the door,\u201d commanded the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait hold on-\u201c Angel was interrupted as the beast began to claw away at the cave walls, making rocks crumble down more and more. Angel looked on in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026you doing!\u201d Yelled Angel in shock. Before long, through all the dust and debris, the cave\u2019s opening, which was about fifty yards away, was now caved in ten yards away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking a hide out. Before I infiltrated the Rock, I scoped out this place as a possible hide out incase we needed to camp out somewhere,\u201d said the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel still gave the man a glare but sighed. \u201cThen how are we gonna get oxygen or water or-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fresh water spring further in the cave and there\u2019s a small outlet near by it for air. Told ya, I scoped it out.\u201d Angel\u2019s mouth shut at Marco\u2019s response and gave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then fine. Let\u2019s hide out there for a few days and we\u2019ll see what we\u2019ll do next,\u201d said the white haired woman. Marco nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d replied the mushroom mage. With a simple snap, Muttshroom was dispelled, and he helped the gravid large-belly woman through the cave with a glow in the dark mushroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit this much, you\u2019re magic is weird,\u201d said Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s Earthland. There\u2019s supposed to an evil gang specializing in farts, if it\u2019s any consolation my magic is self-sustaining. I mean, I can make food and what not.\u201d Angel irked at Marco\u2019s suggestion. She\u2019d rather avoid eating another of those mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn\u2019t want to become like that predator that consumed Satanaya at Avernus Rock. Sure, it got rid of her nemesis and she gained some odd ability that proved useful, but it was so\u2026wrong and odd she couldn\u2019t explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes turned towards her partner-in-crime. Just what is Macro Agaric? Why would he risk himself to bust her out of Avernus Rock prison, so close to Era the Fiore\u2019s magical capital? There\u2019s no way he\u2019d do it out of charity, and she didn\u2019t date when in Oracion Seis, simply due to putting on the appearance of both power and her status was above the likes of Dark Guild buffoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich means he\u2019s working for someone\u2026but why her? Why not Midnight, with his magic cancelling abilities? Or Racer with his extreme speed? Or even Cobra, being a Dragon Slayer and what not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrowed her eyes at the back of the man\u2019s head as she waddled further into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m onto you Agaric, and you better not screw me over or you might end up like the good warden...\u2019</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Freedom was something Angel was always willing to embrace, after her sentence in Avernus Rock she was more than happy to finally spread her wings and taste the air that, for once, was not stagnate and rife with the stench of prison. However, what only seemed to put a cramp in this, otherwise, pleasurable situation was both the one who freed her and the motives in which he had done so. To Angel's current knowledge, nothing the mushroom mage did seemed to make sense and when compared to the fact that there other choices far more suited to being released than her...well, it only made her even more skeptical of just who Marco Agaric was. Thankfully, he agreed to tell Angel all she would know soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk okay?\" Marco asked, glancing back to see that Angel was making due with waddling but, looked as though she was having a lot of difficulties with just that alone. \"The good Warden seems to have calmed down quite a bit now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make her any less heavy. Oof, feels like I've been knocked up or something...\" Angel huffed in exasperation, her dainty hands cupping underneath her huge belly as she hoisted it upward. The swollen gut had pushed the shirt of her prison uniform up, giving partial exposure to the glorious rounded dome of her taut, pink belly that lay beneath. Angel didn't even bother thinking of the inevitable weight gain from such a hefty meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can summon Muttshroom again to help out.\" Marco offered, walking back to Angel's side. \"We're gonna be walking for a while anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another thing,\" Angel began, eyes narrowed with suspicion as she glared to Marco with her inquisition. She was intent on stripping as much information out of the mushroom mage as she possibly could, indigestion be damned. \"Where exactly are we going? You still need to tell me what exactly -urp- it is that you're after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco, much to her surprise, didn't seem entirely dodgy or unwilling to cooperate, the mage nodding to her as he adjusted his straw hat. \"Sure thing, I did promise ya that, after all.\" His eyes pan over to the cavernous path ahead, the way looking to take quite a while to reach the very end...or at least, a point where they could safely rest with little worry of being gibbed by a search party. \"'Sides, we're gonna be walking for a while, it'd be good to have some convo going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel said little, but merely nodded as she waddled along side him, her overblown gut emanating of an oncoming digestion that was going to prolong well into the daytime hours. \"Alright from the top, what are you after, Marco Agaric? I could give you my thanks for freeing me from the Rock but, surely you're aware of the other members of my guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Marco hesitated, the mage rubbing the back of his head as he let out a nervous chuckle or two. Angel's eyes squinted with skeptism as she lay ready to catch any form of lie or fabrication from the strange mage. \"Well, yeah...I did know about your other guild buddies but, me busting you out was more of a personal choice, really.\" Marco answered, with a small blush. Angel rolled her eyes at the thought of Marco having freed her if only due to a grade school crush. \"As for my motives, well...that has more to do with my guild than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh, so he was working for someone else then. The only question was...who were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A guild, huh? Looks like I was right in assuming you worked for someone else. Well...who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viper's Eden.\" Marco answered with folded arms, \"My mission, or at least, the mission of a lot of folks in the guild, is to find folks and recruit them into our ranks. Pretty simple stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, what of that fruit you fed me.\" Angel was especially eager to find out about the nature of this new trait she's acquired, most importantly if that fruit had done anything else to her in the process. Angel is well aware of there being especially nasty variants of fruits that can cause horrific and grotesque bodily mutations and, naturally, she feared that she was going to end up like one of the many unfortunate victims to mutagenic fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the Fruit of Life, Viper's Eden members are kinda required to keep at least one on them when heading out.\" Marco replied, \"The Guildmaster told us that the Fruit of Life helps in facilitating the evolution of magical power. So, by giving folks these fruits, it will help to further enhance their abilities in magic. It's actually pretty neat since we're giving people lots of different magical abilities to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel pondered on his words for a moment, her mind attempting to dissect what Marco told of her. Since she consumed the fruit, that meant that she had some form of enhanced magic besides that of her normal magic that consisted of her summoning Celestial Spirits. The idea of having more power to command did intrigue Angel but, the anonymity of said new abilities proved a hurdle yet crossed. \"So...that means, I have some new kind of power now?\" Angel echoed her thoughts, eyes drifting down to the rumbling protrusion jutting from her midsection, the cream colored and taut dome trying to churn the warden away at a gradual pace. \"...my power isn't eating people, is it?\" Angel inquired, subconsciously rubbing the swollen dome of her gurgling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's...kind of an enigma.\" Marco said, rubbing his chin as he inspected Angel's bloated gut. The angelic mage caught his gaze drifting up from her middle to ample bosom, something she reciprocated with a cold glare of death to which Marco relented at the sight of. \"The type of magic someone gets when they eat the Fruit of Life is usually Caster type Magic. I mean...I got Mushroom Magic when I ate one and I didn't even have magical powers back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel froze, her belly sloshing and jiggling about as she abruptly halted in her tracks. \"You...ate the Fruit of Life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh...yeah, a long time ago when I was a kid. The Guildmaster gave me the fruit back when I was an orphan on the streets...\" Marco recalled, his memory of his origins still fresh and vivid to him despite how long ago it was since then. \"Back then, I didn't think the fruit was anything special since, to me, it was actually something to eat. I didn't know I had magic until years later, after that I joined the Viper's Eden guild since...I owed the Guildmaster for saving me. If he hadn't of given me that fruit, I wouldn't be walking through this cave with you right now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel didn't expect to hear about his past so soon, but it at least gave her an idea of what he was like back in those days. Even so, the mention of the Guildmaster only seemed to quip Angel's interest in who it is that's behind Viper Eden and what their motives were. \"You mentioned the Guildmaster before...know anything about him...or her?\" As strange as it was, Angel has yet to meet too many guild leaders that were actually female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...dunno much about him.\" Marco answered with a shake of his head, \"When I joined Viper's Eden it was like no one knew who he was or where he operated. I only recall two others in the guild who knew of the leader and they...didn't wanna talk much about'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey through the earthen tunnel soon came to an end as the duo were led to an inviting spring located underground, a stream of cool, freshwater ran through the antechamber, and emptied into the mouth of an even deeper cavern off to the east side of the room. The chamber in which the freshwater flowed through was fairly small, albeit the ceiling of the earthly room towered above the duo for quite a ways. A hole from above provided a small amount of illumination via moonlight and would be their source of oxygen as they laid low here until they moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, here we are.\" Marco said, walking into the chamber and giving it a look around. \"We can keep things on the down low here, after some time passes we'll get your to Viper's Eden HQ so you can join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I didn't say I wanted to join!\" Angel declared, waddling into the chamber as her hands cradled her immense belly to prevent it from jostling and swaying about too much. \"What makes you think I want anything to do with your Viper's Eden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's either that or get caught and thrown back into the Rock.\" Marco shrugged as he took a seat on a large stone by the stream. \"Trust me, Angel, you're not the first bad guy to join our guild...there were others who came in and reformed under us. I mean...I dunno what you're all about but, I doubt you'd wanna go back to rot in the Rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true...she didn't want to go back there but, still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's not like I won't be unknown once I join another legal guild.\" Angel argued, waddling to the west wall as she slowly lowered herself down to finally rest her burdened legs and feet. Once her bottom finally touched the ground, it was then that she was able to feel just how heavy her middle truly was. The loud and churning dome still very gravid with Satanaya's remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I know how he does it, but the Guildmaster has like these connections that pardons all previous crimes. It's like...starting over.\" Angel ran those words through her head, the bubbling of her gut working in tandem with her mind as she soon realized, this was a golden opportunity to finally be free. \"Listen, I'm not forcing you to join us, I'm just giving you an option that could make things easier for you. With us, you can drop your fear of getting caught and live life as a free Mage again...what do ya say?\"</span></div></div>",

Marco, sitting across from her, had his hands behind his bed as he leaned back against a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" He asked. The white haired woman opened her eyes, narrow as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll consider joining AFTER I've seen this Guild for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna dip into the water to see how the temp's like? Suit yourself then.\" He then Requiped a blanket into existence and walked over to the prone girl and placed it over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never asked for one,\" she said with an inquistive glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. If I used the blanket for myself then you'd whine that you'd want one.\" Now Angel didn't look as amused or nonchalant as the mushroom mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, all of your body's energy is going into digesting the warden right? So all of the heat will be centered there and not anywhere else,\" He walked back over to his boulder and Requiped a smaller blanket into existence. Angel closed her eyes and slighly nodded, taking in the mushroom mage's advice. He had a good point. It wouldn't do right for her if she just died of hypothermia right after getting out of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am gonna be a bit cold so you will owe me for this,\" remarked Marco. Angel scoffed and rolled her eyes, leaning back and rubbing her gut underneath her blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" She looked up at the small opening in the cave's ceiling, seeing some birds fly about in the night sky thanks to them crossing over the moon, and the white haired girl couldn't help but feel envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as she remembered, she was nothing but a slave at Heaven's Tower. She escaped, but then resigned to serving Brain of Oracion Seis and rose to become one of the most powerful Dark Guilds in Fiore, but even then she was forced to obey Brain, essentially becoming a servant AGAIN. Then she is defeated by that damned blonde girl and that Blue Pegasus pretty boy through the ultimate Celestial Spirit spell, and wound up in the Rock even as she tried to escape the Woodsea, the Rune Knights found her and her guild mates. It didn't help that the no good traitor Hoteye, or Richard as he likes to be called now, sold her out and detailed every single god damned crime she did under Oracion Seis' service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like a twisted joke. She, as one as beautiful as she, as one who has had a terrible childhood growing up, she has been forced to always serve another at some point in her life. And now that cycle continues. She has broken free, and now going to resign herself to some Dark Guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould others know of her reputation? The beautiful but fearsome Angel, the Celestial Spirit Mage? Would she be given a rank? She knows how to lead lesser ranked Dark Guilds and inspire the fear of god into them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, she has no spirits. Her Golden Keys were taken by that damned blonde Fairy Tail mage and her other spirits taken when she was arrested and given away to other mages elsewhere. She knew because one of the guards told her so in person, then spat in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could rise up and this Guild's master? Maybe she could convince this Marco fellow to follow her? But what would he want in return? Not to mention he owes his life for the Master saving her. Maybe she can find others? But Marco already told her that there were others like herself that were indebted to the Master for \"redeeming\" them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave slight scoff, and groaned as her belly gurgled. \"Ah shut up and become body fat already.\" She cursed, flicking her stomach. She leaned her head back and closed her eyes. Nothing but the drip-drops of the cave, Marco's breathing, and the occaisional sound of a fly-by Prison aircraft lulling her to sleep.</span></div></div>",

From high to low, it didn't appear that the search team were going to turn up any form of results at all tonight but...this meant little in proving that they were going to give up. Oh no, twas only the beginning of a long and laborious attempt to locate and apprehend both Angel AND her fungal accomplice. That aside, the tenacious group were not intent on giving up after a night of set backs. Orders were issued to several teams to set up camp in and around the forest and continue searching tomorrow morning. If anything, the search from tonight would only be the beginning of Marco and Angel's difficulties in escaping their relentless mage hunt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came as gently as night had left, the rising sun bathing the forests adjacent to the Avernus Rock prison gradually receiving a shower of sunlight as the grass and leaves practically sparkled with the soft morning dew. All was silent here now, only the chattering song of the melodious birds could contest against the still atmosphere of the thick woodland area. That is...until an earthly crack tore into the silence, the sound of rocks rolling over and opening up . A clawed hand thrust from the face of a ledge as it tore through the earth surrounding it and allowed it's brother to  help in creating an opening in the earthen matter. As the dust rose and cleared off, the figure of Marco walked out from the man made exit as he peered around the surrounding area, checking for anyone suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in the clear for now...\" Marco observed with a nod of his head, his hand adjusting his straw hat as he prepared to escort Angel to both her salvation and his own. \"If we can make it to Viper Eden HQ, then we'll be home free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...dammit.\" Came the frustrated voice of Angel as she waddled and squeezed her way through the opening of the tunnel that led outside, the reasons for her awkward motions being evident in her...expanded figure that was all thanks to the one huge morsel her gut had processed and digested. Just as Angel told it to, her stomach had converted every inch of Satanaya's body into belly fat...but not just belly fat clung to her physique. \"Couldn't you have made the tunnel a bit less cramped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full visage of Angel did wonders in showing how much weight she had packed on; her middle was soft and swollen with excess fat, the jiggling dome swelling noticably from her normally somewhat loose prison shirt. Lower was a set of hips and thighs that flared and billowed outward, the thickset lower section of Angel's body filled out her worn out pants rather nicely, the rounded rump at her behind had also gorging upon the extra fat and gaining quite a bit of heft in each fattened and jiggly cheek. The mage's breasts remained largely unchanged but, did seem to bump up a size bigger or two as they rested comfortably atop her squishy paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make it but so big, Angel.\" Marco shrugged, \"Any bigger and the tunnel woulda caved in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel only narrowed her eyes, finding nothing but bullshit in Marco's answer to her and even a hint of him poking fun at her new size. Even so, she let it go and merely sighed with exasperation and glared down to her noticeable paunch that bulged from her middle. \"When I said turn her into belly-fat...I was kidding...\" Angel muttered, pinching her flabby sides before placing her mind on other matters; like getting out of this forest without getting caught. \"I have a good feeling that there are still guards patrolling the forests around here. It's not like them to give up after a single not of set backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. We're going to hafta move fast if we don't wanna get caught but...if we do, I have my Mushroom Magic to bail us out.\" Marco replied taking another look around as he and Angel stepped forward and began their cautious trek through the wilderness. For a time, Angel walked (which was slowly turning into a waddle) in silence as she kept watch for anyone looking to ambush them as they traveled. However, it wasn't until she realized something that she spoke up to break the silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where you're going this time?\" Angel inquired, giving Marco a skeptical look as she began to doubt the fungal mage's ability to navigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got directions covered.\" Marco answered in confidence, his eyes fixating on an especially large and colorful mushroom that grew from under neath a tree. \"I planted mushrooms on my way through the forest, since I knew I wouldn't be able to navigate these woods.\" The mushroom mage approached his creation, kneeling down to call Angel's attention to the pattern on it's cap, several large spots looking to be like arrows that pointed northward. \"So long as we follow my chain of shrooms, we'll be led right to Viper Eden Headquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so long as you know where you're going.\" Angel nodded, willing to trust Marco with directions for once as she continued to follow her only lead to Viper's Eden HQ. The two, while seeming to not exactly see eye to eye, did have small conversations, albeit through whispers so is not to draw too much attention to themselves. However, as Marco located another two more of his marking mushrooms, something didn't...sit right with Angel, it was a dreadful feeling that tied directly into her paranoia and one that had the (now tubby) mage on edge and looking over her shoulder every so often. Naturally, Marco managed to pick up on this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'the matter? Someone behind us...?\" Marco asked in a whispered voice as she slowed his advance, looking back to look for anything out of the ordinary...</span></div></div>",

It looked to be the size of a small horse, or a very large dog, but it looked hostile and aggressive nonetheless. It was lizard like in appearance, with a Monitor's head hissing and making an open growl as it's maw was open, venomous bacteria leaking from it's mouth. It's legs were those of a lion's, sharp claws pawing at the dirty. And it's tail was that of a scorpion, swishing side to side and it's stinger erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, a Monitorplion Chimera. Just what we need right now,\" growled Marco in frustration and duo taking a step back. Everyone has heard of the Monitorplion being especially venmous and aggressive, and were solitary creatures who created their own territories. Angel turned her head, with a gaze as venomous as the monster before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planted a trail through this guy's turf?\" She snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I didn't know excuse me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel instinctively reached for her side where her keys would be, but found nothing. She cursed to herself slightly as the chimera stalked closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shroom Bomb!\" Called out Marco, throwing a mushroom at the creature, whose tail struck out like lightning, batting the small truffle to a tree and making it detonate. As Marco and Angel backed away slowly and slowly, Marco tried to through more bombs, only for the beast to swat them away with it's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summon your muttshroom thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need time, and that's a luxury we can't have right now!\" Barked back Marco. The chimera was slowly approaching, drooling at the thought of ravaging the intruders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a pang hit Angel in the stomach, a similar to the one before she ate Satanaya. Normally she would try to resist the urge, but they were out of options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it,\" She mumbled, causing Marco to turn towards her with a raised eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right was the chimera leapt, mouth wide and claws extended, so did Angel, her mouth opened wide and chomped down on the beast. The beath fell into her mouth, head and paw first, and Angels hands went up to stop the tail from striking at her, grabbing it by the head, it's stinger near her nose. The beast struggled violently, but Angel hung on, legs steady as the Monitorplion tried to escape. Yet her mouth hung firm, trying to slurp in the beast inside to her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" was all Marco could say with raised eyebrows as Angel sat down, and slurped up the front legs of the beast and onto the midsection, a noticeable bulge in her throat. He rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...gonna use the bathroom. You take care of business,\" he said, wanting to get away from the noise Angel was making. The white haired girl narrowed her eyes at the man, but resumed to consuming the beast, which has slowly stopped struggling, it's head down in her stomach. With a heave, she raised her head and the beast became upright upside down, and Angel slurped and gurgled as her mouth, her already soft gut becoming swollen and taut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a final gulp, she swallowed the Monitorplion Chimera whole, along with it's tail. And she gave a loud belch and coughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have used salt...\" She commented. When she tried to stand, she noticed she had difficulty, and she saw the reason. Her gut was now much larger than yesterday, and she could tell it was heavier than she was prior(she guess to be around 170 pounds), easily the size of a medium sized bean bag chair. And now she was helpless trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave out a large sigh of frustration. \"Marco!\"</span></div></div>",

She stretched and collapsed onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Princess,\" Vigor announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vigor? What are you doing here?\" Lucy asked sitting up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sensed that you were stressed and frustrated. Is there anything I can do for you?\" Vigor offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I feel fine,\" Lucy defended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Vigor asked as she popped behind Lucy. Vigor began to rub her shoulders. \"I could give you a massage,\" she offered. \"Or I can make you a home cooked dinner,\" she said knocking around in the kitchen. \"Or maybe you would like to take a warm bath?\" she said starting the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgo stop, I'm fine,\" Lucy called. She started to stand up but was forced down back down by Virgo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Princess, let me help you,\" Virgo begged. Lucy looked up at her spirit. Virgo's hands were placed firmly on Lucy's shoulders, her arms fully extended. She stared into the spirit's blue eyes. Her jaw slacked slightly. \"Perhaps you simply need a hug,\" Virgo concluded and brought Lucy into her bosom. Lucy blushed and froze as Virgo's warm cleavage brushed her face. \"Is that better Princess?\" She asked. Lucy was confused.Why was she acting like this? Why couldn't she move? Suddenly Virgo released her and went into the bathroom. \"Your bath is ready Princess,\" Virgo informed. Lucy was still stuck on her bed. \"Princess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Virgo,\" Lucy spoke. She stood up and walked into the bathroom. As she undressed she couldn't stop thinking about the hug. Virgo was so warm and caring. Without being asked she came into her world and tried to help Lucy feel better when she herself didn't realize she was upset. She got into the bath and lost herself in thought. She only left her realm of contemplation when the water grew cold. She got out off the tub and dried herself off. She then wrapped a towel around her abdomen and left the bathroom. When she entered her room she saw that Virgo was gone. With a relieved sigh Lucy dropped her towel and went to grab some clothes. As she walked something caught her peripheral. She turned her head and saw Virgo leaning over to get something out of the oven. Thanks to her short skirt Lucy could see the spirit's panties. A shiver went through her and she felt a tingle in her genitals. Virgo stood up and turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Princess. Did you enjoy your bath?\" she asked. For a moment Lucy was once again frozen before she screamed and ran to her towel. She quickly grabbed it and covered herself, her entire face red. \"Do you need my help getting dressed?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, no! I can dress myself!\" Lucy stammered. She threw on clothes and took a moment to calm down. She took a deep breath and then walked over to the table where Virgo was waiting. \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm finishing your dinner Princess,\" Virgo explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to eat Princess and you seem to be distracted so I made you dinner. Please,\" Virgo said gesturing to the chair. Lucy sat down and Virgo brought out the food. The dish was Asian Salmon Sliders with Citrus Yogurt Sauce. Lucy took a bite and was surprised at how good it was. And, was also surprised that Virgo was able to incorporate her favorite food into the dinner. As she ate she got a bit of yogurt on the corner of her mouth. Virgo picked up a towel and dabbed it on her tongue before wiping Lucy's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...\" Lucy said and continued to eat. After she was finished Virgo took the dishes and and brought in dessert. It was a slice of ice cream cake. Lucy took the plate and began to eat. Once again the food was fantastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a whole cake which is in your freezer. You may finish it whenever you like,\" Virgo informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Virgo,\" Lucy said. After she finished Virgo once again took the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you need Princess?\" She asked. Lucy thought about this for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... </span></div></div>",

This weird tingling in her stomach whenever she thought about her spirit was really bothering her. She could feel the jingling of her keys as she walked. She could almost feel that same warmth radiating from Virgo's key that she felt last night from that hug. Virgo had agreed to come by again tonight and Lucy didn't know what to do. As she approached her apartment she stopped short at her door. She took a deep breath before opening the door to find Virgo standing there waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home Princess,\" she greeted \"your bath is ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" Lucy said putting her bag down. Lucy entered the bathroom and noticed a change of clothes already waiting for her. Lucy undressed and stepped into the tub. She used the warm water to relax and calm her nerves. <i>You're okay Lucy. You're fine. There's nothing strange about you wanting Virgo to be here. She's a helpful spirit. She's a maid after all. There's nothing odd going on with you.</i> She thought as she bathed. After drying off and changing clothes Lucy emerged to find dinner on the table. \"What is this?\" Lucy asked sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fillet of Beef Bourguignon,\" Virgo explained. Lucy ate dinner and then Virgo brought her a slice of cake before doing the dishes. Afterward Lucy went to bed. This happened everyday for for the next week. Lucy would come home with a warm bath waiting for her and then Virgo would be standing there with a new and delicious dinner on the plate. That is until Sunday. Lucy got home and placed her stuff down and sat on her bed. She sat on her bed and seemed almost to wait for Virgo to show up even when she knew she wasn't going to. As she waited a pit formed in her stomach. The longer she waited the larger the pit grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!?!?\" Lucy screamed. She fell back and hit her head on her window. After dealing with the pain from her head the pit didn't go away. <i>Why do I  miss her? She's my friend sure but I see her all the time. She's been here everyday the passed week why does it feeling like I need her here?</i> she wondered as she hugged her pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Lucy went about her business in the guild hall and then came home to see Virgo standing in her living room. \"You're here,\" Lucy said a little shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Princess. I assumed you would want me here. If I'm not needed I can go,\" Virgo offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm glad you're here,\" Lucy said \"is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bath is ready,\" Virgo interrupted. After her bath she walked into the living room and saw Virgo standing next to her dinner. Lucy sat down and started to eat. \"Would you like any pepper?\" Virgo asked. Lucy nodded and Virgo bent over to get the pepper grinder over the food. When she did that Lucy got a clear view of her chest. Was it bigger? \"Let me know when Princess,\" Virgo informed. Lucy stared at her spirit's chest. She could have sworn that her breast were bigger. They had to have increased by a cup size. Maybe two. \"Princess?\" Virgo said to get her master's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucy shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that enough pepper for you?\" Virgo asked. Lucy looked down and saw her dish covered with pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you Virgo,\" Lucy smiled. She took a bite of her food before grimacing at the favor. She pushed through every bite and then guzzled down her drink. \"Can you refill this?\" Lucy coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Virgo took the glass and walked away. Lucy couldn't help but look at Virgo's ass as she walked away. Virgo had obtained a slight sway as she walked. Yup, her ass was bigger too. After dessert Virgo left and Lucy went to sleep or she tried to. She couldn't stop thinking about Virgo. </span></div></div>",

Virgo was serving her food like she had every night, except Sundays, for the past two weeks. Lucy was eating a 20oz steak with a large helping of fries. Lucy devoured it, every bite dripping with ranch. After she finished Virgo took the plate and put down a whole 5 layer lasagna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up Princess,\" Virgo said. Lucy without argument began eating. After that Virgo brought out a Shepard's pie. And that's how it went for the next hour. Lucy would eat bigger and bigger meals as Virgo would clean the table and make more and more food. After her 7th meal Lucy pulled back and rubbed her belly. It was the size of a basketball. \"Are you ready for dessert Princess?\" Virgo asked. She placed a whole trifle on her plate. Lucy took a spoon and started eating. Lucy ate until she reached the bottom layer of the trifle. She scooped some fruit but when she did she saw skin. She looked at the plate the trifle was on to discover that it wasn't a plate. It was Virgo. \"More dessert?\" she asked. Virgo's DD cup breast were covered in whip cream and she was wearing edible underwear that clung to her thick thighs. Lucy licked the rest of the trifle off of Virgo's belly before Virgo sat up on the table. Virgo put her hands on Lucy's distended belly and rubbed it. \"Are you full now Princess?\" Virgo asked. She slowly leaned forward. \"You have something on the corner of your mouth. Let me get it for you,\" Virgo said before planting her lips on Lucy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy woke up with a smile. She then frowned as she realized it was a dream. She touched her lips as she realized what had been happening. She had fallen for Virgo. Her stomach rumbled and interrupted her train of thought. When she looked down she was introduced to another realization. She had gotten bigger. Her belly, that used to be flat, now stuck out two inches. She touched it to confirm it was real. She pulled up her shirt and jiggled her tummy. Lucy didn't mind it. She actually enjoyed it a little.</span></div></div>",

This is what Kelp Town is like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, during the summer that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is January for the far northwestern Fiore coastal town, and the clouds have blocked out the sun, the seagulls are annoying as ever, the water is freezing, the sea kelp forests block out most of the harbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slash from her sheathed sword, more kelp leaves became undone, drifting away on the waves. A woman took a deep breath on the boat's ridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kagura Mikazuchi, this was a simple and repetitive job to clear kelp trees to allow boats in and out o the harbor. The town mayor would offer to their local guild: Mermaid Heel, the famous all-girls Guild of Fiore, this job usually once a month. And one can tell that Kagura is the standard bearer of the Guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf reasonable height, she stood on the small dingy\u2019s ledge, her sheathed sword: Nemesis, in hand. Her hair was in a traditional \u201cprincess-cut\u201d, long and dark-brown to the center of her back and bound by a ribbon. She possessed a figure many a female would dream for and many a male would drool over, as confined within her elaborate blazer was a toned yet full figured physique, her breasts full and above average.  She also donned a shirt and tied underneath the blazer, and underneath her mini-skirt were black leg tights and thigh-high boots. With the cold stinging in the air, the extra clothing proved to be a fond choice in keeping the girl warm. She face was set in stone, a permanent scowl locked onto her beautiful visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa-whoa! Kya!\u201d Stammered a girl in another boot not to far from her. Kagura turned her head giving the source of the voice a look from her deep chocolate eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your balance Beth. These Kelp won\u2019t clear themselves should you fall in, not to mention the water\u2019s freezing,\u201d said Kagura sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026just slipped a little and landed on my butt. Sorry about that Kagura-chan,\u201d replied Beth Vanderwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Kagura who was a stone faced beauty of a swordswoman, Beth was a cute farmgirl. She was shorter than Kagura, about a good half-a-head and had deep orange hair done in two braided pig-tails behind her head and had wide blue eyes. She had a child-like face to her, her nose smaller perhaps not even visible when looking at her face to face. Were not for her rather wide hips and thighs underneath her overalls people could have mistaken her for a young teenager, perhaps even a pre-teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have worn sandals. You could have taken into account that the boat may be slippery,\u201d remarked the swordswoman as she made another cut, cutting more of the kelp underwater by sheer air pressure alone from her sheathed sword. Behind her, she heard more of Beth\u2019s Carrot Missile being fired, spearing through the top parts of the kelp trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay I won\u2019t wear sandals again,\u201d said the farm girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you have learned a lesson and walked away from this with a positive experience.\u201d The two continued their job cutting down the kelp trees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMou~,\u201d complained Beth. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Millianna-chan come out with us? She\u2019s back at the harbor probably dozing off again.\u201d She gave a cute pout face puffing her lips out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMillianna detests cold water you know that Beth,\u201d said Kagura as she made another slash. More chopped up kelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but still, she\u2019s not getting a single Jewel for lounging around right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Beth shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me. I need to save up for more gardening tools.\u201d She fired more missiles into the water and Kagura nodded, resuming her task until\u2026</span></div></div>",

She raised her scabbard, about to attack another area of the encroaching plant. She hesitated for a moment though when she saw something was amiss in the murky water. A pale body stuck out like a sore thumb among the green and blue around it. The figure had layers of kelp all around it, including some that covered its face. The skin on the body was incredibly pale, but there was a subtle lift in the chest every few seconds that showed the person in the water was alive. \"Beth,\" Kagura said plainly. \"Stop what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's wrong?\" Beth asked, blinking a few times as she waited for a response. Either way, she stopped firing her Carrot Missiles and came over to where Kagura was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see one of the oars,\" Kagura asked, before Beth handed her one of the wooden implements. \"There's a body over here,\" she noted in case Beth hadn't seen. The swordswoman began to use the oar to pull the figure towards the boat, dragging it through cut kelp on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh,\" Beth said sadly. \"Is she alright?\" she asked, looking at the body. The short dress that seemed to be her only article of clothing was the main hint to Beth that the body was female. When the girl was next to the boat, Kagura calmly placed the oar down and picked it up with little difficulty. The girl was unconscious, and incredibly small. Shorter than even Beth was, she was quite skinny and flat as a rail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear so. We should help return her to the town in case she needs medical attention. Can you please wake her up?\" Kagura asked. Beth nodded, but first she wanted to clean the girl up. She was covered in kelp, so Beth started pulling it off of her. It was messy work, but the farmgirl was used to dirty conditions. There was a thick glob of kelp on the girl's head, covering most of her face. Beth grabbed a good handful and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Beth dropped the kelp, and looked around. Not seeing Kagura in any pain, she tried to pick up the kelp again. \"Owowowow!\" Beth stopped, and moved the kelp to the side to see the girl's face. \"Please stop pulling on my hair...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hair?\" Beth said, confused. She grabbed one piece and tugged lightly, making the girl's head bounce up slightly. \"Oh, my. I'm really darn sorry, I thought it was kelp, I didn't realize it was your hair,\" she said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" the girl said, before coughing. She let out a few deep coughs, having to sit up in order to get the worst of it out. There ended up being a small puddle of water on the bottom of the boat from what she'd coughed up. \"Ack, ptooie, what, where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on the outskirts of Kelp Town,\" Kagura answered her, continuing to lead the boat to the dock. \"My name is Kagura, my companion is Beth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what, what happened to me?\" she asked, letting out one more cough as Beth helped her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hun, we were hoping you'd be able to tell us that. We found you laying in the water covered in kelp. You alright?\" Beth asked, lifting up one of the girl's arms so she could see if the girl was injured. \"Naw, you seem like you're not hurt at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm alright, but I don't really remember what happened to me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's your name?\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think it's Pelk...\" she said, sounding unsure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you sound confused?\" Kagura asked, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

There is no need to blame yourself,\" reassured Kagura. \"I'm sure you'll regain your memory. It will just take some time.\" She turned her head to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take us back to Kelp Town. We'll talk Pelk to the Guild Hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Said the farm girl as she strapped an SE-Plug and started up the boat's engine, steering the rudder towards the harbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelk sat on the boat, hands clenched to the bench under her for support as the boat sped along the water. A bump in the waves made her lose her grip, falling forward onto Kagura. \"Kyah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordswoman managed to maintain her composure, stopping them from falling, although...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pelk, are you alright?\" Asked the brunette as the seaweed-haired girl recovered, looking up...Her face was nestled right inbetween her bosom, Kagura's eyes blinking and neutral.

The farmgirl hopped out and tied the boat with rope connecting it to the metal peg. Kagura stepped out and offered her hand to Pelk, who took it and was pulled up easily onto the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness,\" Beth said looking over the girl up and down. \"We gotta get you some clothes and shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take her back to the guild, we can find some spares for Pelk to wear.

Mermaid Heel isn't one to let a fellow female go without aid, especially when we live so close by,\" Kagura said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you again. That's very kind of you, but I was trying to say earlier that I-\" Pelk was interrupted as Kagura opened the door to the Guild Hall.

Kagura enjoyed the welcome as well. It wasn't as raucous as she heard Fairy Tail was, but her guild was full of kind, strong people she was proud to call her companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Mermaid Heel,\" Kagura said to Pelk, letting go of her hand.

Pelk\u2019s cheeks had a healthy shade of pink when she had her back to her, only donning white panties with carrots on them, her wide hips wiggling as she took off her black t-shirt, leaving her in a similar looking white bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelk threw off her dress and jumped into the hot tub, as Beth\u2019s back was to her she couldn\u2019t see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange-haired girl looked around confused, and saw Pelk in the bath, read right above the hot water. \u201cWell that was sudden. You almost dun\u2019gone scare me there Pelky! Thought you slipped and fell right in.\u201d She then began to unclip her underwear, and Pelk\u2019s cheeks turned a brighter shade of red. It was good thing she couldn\u2019t see her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Beth got into the tub, going up next to the green haired girl with a shampoo bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go clean you up. I\u2019ll bathe ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay\u2026\u201d She felt his hair be saturated with the cleansing product and Beth began to rub her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say, you're hair is a bit tangly, but it's also unique too. Never seen seaweed-lookin' hair before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard the door open in the dressing room and both bath occupants perked up. They saw the woman enter the room and Beth beamed.</span></div></div>",

She continued to massage Pelk's scalp, the girl finding herself able to relax as Beth gave her head a nice scrubbing. Her hair was long so it took a good amount of shampoo to clean it adequately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyaa, wasn't that hard. Just took a simple one while you were doing the seaweed job. Lady just wanted me to find her cat!\" the new bath entrant said. She had an adorable smile on her face, and a very curvaceous figure that she had no problems showing off. The blush on Pelk's face grew even darker as she noticed Millianna only wore a bra for a top, and the only thing she wore below, besides her panties, was a garter belt and striped stockings. She was even more provocatively dressed than Cana of Fairy Tail, and had her matched in bust size it seemed. The catlike girl wore a cloak as well, but it was rarely closed, and she discarded it upon entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, well that sounds like an easy one. Bettin' the cat found you more than you found the cat,\" Beth said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Millianna replied, scratching the side of her hair cutely. The two points of her hair shaped like cat ears bounced cutely when her head shook. She finally noticed the green-haired occupant in the bath. \"Oh? Who's this Beth? Your sis or something?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, nah, this here's Pelk,\" Beth said, patting the young girl's head. \"We found her floating by the dock and brought her back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you kidnapped her?\" Millianna said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No,\" Pelk said. \"They saved me, but, I don't remember what I was doing or how I got there.\" Millianna tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey, welcome to the guild, I see you're getting nice and acquainted with Beth,\" Millianna said, stretching. The act made her bust wobble when she relaxed her muscles again, and then Pelk got a nice view of her backside as she bent over to pick something up. She chuckled again as she held out Beth's panties, the ones adorned with carrots. \"Hehe, I didn't even have to look at you in there to know these were yours Beth.\" Beth blushed a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you should talk, I don't know how many pairs of those pawprint panties you've got,\" she retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyaa, like a dozen or so,\" Millianna said nonchalantly. As if replying to Beth's comment, Milliana started undoing her garter belt, then started removing her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you doing?!\" Pelk said, holding her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cat and I had some fun time rolling around in the grass before I took her back home. I'm dirty, so I'm gonna join ya!\" she said, quickly undoing her bra and exposing her nipples to both girls. Pelk felt dizzy from two cute girls being naked so close to her. It didn't take long for her to be completely naked, and then she slid in with Beth and Pelk, leaving the green-haired girl in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" Beth said, starting to wash Pelk's back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, she seems a bit shook up,\" Milliana said, poking Pelk in the forehead. \"Well, nnnnyaa, a good bath will always fix that!\" she said happily, stretching once again.</span></div></div>",

Beth giggled at the sight. As the two came up Millianna shook her head free of water and Pelk came up for air, the two of them on top of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, cat's gotcha nya-ow~\" Smirked the cat lover as she had one hand on Pelk's chest and other near her crotch and she moved downward and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahn!\" Pelk cooed.

Beth noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millianna, somethin' wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I...imagining things, or is that...\" She moved her head downward...and in her hand cupping was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen's junk.</span></div></div>",

There was suddenly a loud bang as the door to the bathroom was shattered into dozens of tiny wooden pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" Kagura said harshly, holding her sheathed weapon out, ready to strike. She saw Beth and Milliana in the bath, Beth still holding her ears. Millianna had finally let go of Pelk's groin, and the green-haired boy scooched back as far as he could from the women. This made his junk very prominently displayed, however. \"What.... is that...\" Kagura said, glaring daggers at Pelk so sharp he thought the look along would slice off his member before her sword could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, um... uh,\" Pelk stuttered, covering up his groin again.

Regardless, Kagura led them all to a table near the grill, where the high heat of the fire kept them all warm as they looked over the menu. With glasses of water brought to them as a complimentary drink, they ordered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like a half-rack of ribs, with a side of creamed spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and cornbread,\" Kagura said, nodding to the waiter as she handed over her menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Kagura's not dieting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a twofold reason, Pelk.

Um, I'll have the roast beef sandwich and some fries please,\" the young boy said. \"And a glass of cola would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... ooh, fish,\" Millianna said, finally spying something she wanted on the menu. \"I'll have the cod then, with corn and,\" she paused to sniff. \"Hm, the macaroni and cheese smells good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesse then. Pork barbecue sandwich sounds mighty tasty. And I guess let's throw in the mixed greens and some onion rings too.

Where the Kelp Forest was, where you found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were clearing excess kelp that was rising to the surface in great amounts,\" Kagura replied, making the table's occupants turn towards her. \"The town got it's namesake for the plant, but I never known it would grow this much so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's the work of magic?\" Millianna pondered, finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anythin's possible!\" Beth added. \"Mah guess is that the reason on what could be causin' the plants to grow s'much maybe at the bottom of the seaweed forest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may need to dive in then.\" The swordswoman remarked, turning her sharp eyes towards her companions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillianna shook her head. \"I can't imagine what's down there!

I was found out there with amnesia right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. We will go first thing tomorrow morning.\" Kagura sipped from her drink. Meanwhile, Millianna scooted closer to Pelk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, diving with Kagura. I bet you seem stoked on that huh~?\" She asked with a mischievous cat-like grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoked on what?\" Pelk asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, that Kagura might ski-NYYY!\" She cried and she fell face first onto the table. \"Nyooooowwww~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura's sword was missing, but Pelk had a good idea where it was. \"Good thing that was sheathed...\" He commented, he felt Kagura's gaze upon him and he stiffened up, and returned to sipping his drink as Beth tried to get the wind back into her feline-fanatic friend.</span></div></div>",

Une deuxi\u00e8me exposition \u00e0 l'encens, augmenterait ses chances de r\u00e9ussite, mais la blanche pourrait malgr\u00e9-tout tomber amoureuse d'un autre homme.
