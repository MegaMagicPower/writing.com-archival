For a guy his size, his tolerance to alcohol has always been shockingly low\u2014often a huge laugh when Claire can almost match him drink for drink.   Admittedly, the 7 homemade vodka sodas were getting the best of him as he almost frantically locked lips with Leon.  Their sweaty bodies were practically gliding against each other at this point as they embraced and got lost in the heat and desire.  Leon was on his back, legs wrapped around Chris and pulling him tight.  Chris\u2019s larger frame rested against Leon as their chests rubbed together.  For such a lady\u2019s man, Leon sure seemed to enjoy literally being pressed down into a bed.  Chris got himself slick with lube as Leon took a quick huff of some poppers\u2014it sure helped since Chris was packing a robustly thick 9 inch member.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leon felt every muscle in his body relax he practically begged, \u201cGimme that cock, Chris.  Fuckkkk come on and fill me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris\u2019s dick pulsated with desire and leaked a drop of precum.  God damn, Leon seemed to know how to drive him wild.  He pressed the head of his dick against Leon\u2019s opening, barely bobbing the head in before pulling out.  Leon\u2019s toes curled and he tossed his head back against the pillow, biting his tongue in anticipation and frustration as Chris continued to tease him.  He moaned louder and louder, finally sighing in relief as Chris pushed his hips with a forceful grunt and began pushing inch after inch inside Leon in one smooth motion.  They held each other tight as they kissed again, and as Chris began building a rhythm and thrusting in and out of Leon, he was almost drunk enough to picture Piers beneath him, embracing him, loving him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunk vision faded though as the minutes passed\u2014Leon\u2019s groans now elevating in volume and intensity as Chris struck his prostate like no other man ever had.  The normally cocky and cool agent gripped the sheets so tight his knuckles lost their color.  This never got old for him\u2014Chris was the only person who could make him cum so intensely without even touching his cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re getting close,\u201d Chris whispered in Leon\u2019s ear before gently biting his ear lobe and moving his lips down to Leon\u2019s neck. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cnnggggggg holy shit I\u2019m close!!!\u201d Leon gasped out.  \u201cRight there!  Keep fucking me right there!   God yeah harder!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grabbed Leon tighter than ever, sweat dripping onto the writhing Leon who took thrust after thrust, wanting to feel Chris fill him with that steamy seed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was enough for Leon.  \u201cGod Holy FUCK I\u2019m CUMMING!\u201d Leon yelled his whole body jolted against Chris\u2019s tight embrace.   He howled in ecstasy as his untouched cock launched rope after rope of cum between their two bodies\u2014completely covering both men\u2019s abs and pecs in Leon\u2019s seed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis always sent Chris over the edge as that tight canal practically milked his cock during Leon\u2019s orgasms, sending him over the edge as he gave one final thrust, shuddering as he hugged Leon tight and thrust shot after shot of his seed into the spent bottom.  Shouting out as he filled Leon to his limit, shivering as with a few mini bucks of his hips he made sure to eject the very last drops of cum into Leon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis euphoria was what both men were after.  They laid there together for several minutes in a daze\u2014Chris was resting comfortably on top of Leon, softening cock still inside him.  For a few minutes they completely forgot about all of their worries and problems.   And as Chris pulled out of Leon, for the first time in a long time he felt true comfort.  Leon didn\u2019t immediately get dressed and leave Chris\u2019s apartment this time\u2026He actually spent several minutes kissing Chris before drifting to sleep in his arms.  And for the first time since they started hooking up, Chris truly felt like this was more than just sex.  And his last thoughts before finally drifting off were about taking Leon on a proper date.  It had been a devastating 9 months since Piers had passed away, but maybe he was finally coming to terms with things.  Maybe he and Leon could start something meaningful.  Maybe this was his path to closure and moving on\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Chris awoke to a shocking sight.  Leon was still in bed with him, comfortably asleep little spoon style in Chris\u2019s arms.  Chris actually blushed and felt his heart flutter slightly, remembering the previous night and how that seemed like a turning point for him.  Sure, he had fantasized at one point about it being Piers, but by the time he pulled out of Leon, he truly felt glad that Leon was with him.  And he was relieved when Leon didn\u2019t immediately get dressed to leave.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Leon yawned gently and opened his eyes\u2014at first just as surprised as Chris that he was still there, but for Leon this also felt right.  Sure, this had all started as a way for him to bang one out to distract his mind from Ada, but this time was different.  Feeling Chris\u2019s warmth and arms around him made him blush slightly\u2014a feeling of butterflies in his stomach as he daydreamed about this becoming more than a friends with benefits dynamic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d Chris said with a playful smile as he pulled Leon a little tighter, really snuggling their bodies together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon put his hand on Chris\u2019s arm and replied, \u201cLast night was\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething else,\u201d Chris interrupted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook the words right out of my mouth,\u201d Leon said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both eventually got dressed.  Chris made them some killer omelets and they had some laughs recounting some of the more lighthearted moments from their respective adventures.  And Chris finally mustered up the courage to ask Leon if he\u2019d be interested in meeting somewhere besides his apartment for a change.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like a date?\u201d Leon asked point blank.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stuttered on his words for a few seconds before Leon smiled a reassured him, \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey planned to meet at a chic new bar downtown that weekend before Leon gave Chris a quick peck and departed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt like things were on the up and up when he heard his cell phone ring.  It was Jill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris!  You\u2019re never going to believe this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJill!  What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Chris.  This is amazing!  I just exited a meeting with Dr. Yutani at BSAA HQ.  They can bring him back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiers!  Chris, they can bring Piers back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris dropped the phone, shocked beyond belief.  He immediately grabbed his keys and picked up the phone.  \u201cJill, I\u2019ll be at HQ in exactly 20 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up the phone and sped over to HQ.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat path do Chris and Piers enter?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His colleagues were pleasantly surprised to see him since he had been on a leave of absence for several weeks now, but Chris was in no mood for pleasantries.  He saw Jill with the head scientist, Dr. Moira Yutani, and made his way over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?!  Where is Piers?\u201d Chris demanded to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Dr. Yutani said with an optimistic tone.  \u201cNothing is guaranteed, but please join me in my office so I can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yutani went on to explain to an astounded Chris that Piers was not dead, and they had managed to recover his body.  It turns out that Piers\u2019 C-Virus infection had gone into a protective mode.  The virus put Piers into a deep stasis and protected his body from external conditions.  This stasis was so deep that even the mutations halted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, Piers is in Room 237.  We have him connected to an advanced life support system that is maintaining his C-Virus stasis field.  But my lab can reverse the mutations.  Through a combination of antiviral treatments and targeted genetic recoding, we can subdue the virus into a dormant state within his body even after removing him from stasis and we can reverse the tissue mutations.  Miraculously, his brain is unaffected, so we can truly save him, Chris.  We can bring him back.  The only matter is we need your approval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine?\u201d Chris asked, confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  It turns out, Piers has no living family or next of kin.  A few weeks before his incident he entrusted you with his medical power of attorney should he ever be incapacitated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was in shock.  The love of his life could be brought back to him.  He could finally tell Piers everything he had always wanted to say.  And he was in awe that Piers had entrusted him with his medical POA.  Even with Chris never expressing his love, Piers had trusted him enough to do that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Chris told Dr. Yutani.  \u201cIf you can truly bring him back, I consent to whatever needs to be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yutani had Chris sign some consent forms and quickly assembled her team.  Chris was brought to an observatory room with a view inside Room 237.  There he saw Piers, comatose and for better and for worse, exactly as he was the last time they saw each other.  A tear rolled down Chris\u2019s cheek as he remembered Piers saving his life.  How much he wished he had had the courage to tell him in that moment that he loved him.  But this could finally be his chance.  He watched intently as Dr. Yutani and her team prepared what seemed like dozens of injections, systematically targeting all mutated tissue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of Chris expected the dramatic mutations to immediately recede, but Dr. Yutani had been very upfront.  This series of injections would be required daily and it would take one week to begin seeing substantial mutation reversal.  And only then would it be medically safe to remove Piers from his induced coma.  But still, Chris watched on\u2014fighting back tears as he observed the team endlessly inject the man he loved.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, this BOW is able to manipulate chroniton particles.  Theoretically, we can induce the BOW to create a time-space doorway to any moment in the past.  We can\u2019t change our own flow of time, so there is no way to prevent any deaths or disasters that have happened in our own timeline.  But we could extract an individual from the past and bring them into our current timeline.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t think I fully understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Chris replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, we can create a time-space doorway to a moment before Piers was infected with the C-Virus or suffered the severe damage to his arm.  We can bring that Piers back to current day.  Our timeline will not be affected in any way, but the consequence will be that you will create an alternate timeline where Piers was not present to save you.  In an alternate timeline and reality, you will be ensuring your own death because Piers will not be there to sacrifice his life to save yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought on this.  Was he willing to doom an alternate version of himself?  In some other timeline, Piers will literally disappear, and that version of Chris will be obliterated by the BOW that was hunting Chris and Piers.  But all the feelings of longing were returning.  Feelings that finally seemed to be diminishing as he explored the possibility of a future with Leon surged back to the forefront of Chris\u2019s mind.  And with the full commitment of his heart and soul he gave his approval to Dr. Yutani.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our lab only created a handful of viable clones before the project was shuttered.  Piers volunteered a DNA sample that we were able to yield a clone from.  We accelerated his growth until his age matched that of the original and were able to artificially plant a lifetime of memories into the clone.  He truly believed that he was Piers, but the truth is you have never actually met the true Piers Nivans.  But Piers is being relocated from the Tokyo team and will be reassigned to our location.  It was agreed that you should be his assigned partner.  It will certainly help Piers acclimate better, and it may be good for you too.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have built on the work of Dr. Birkin.  Our modified strains have unlocked almost unlimited restorative and therapeutic benefits with full elimination of rampant mutations.  We acquired a sample of Piers\u2019 body, and using a DNA sample, we can rebuild him using our perfected T-Virus and G-Virus variants.  He will be physically perfect, with none of the C-virus mutations he suffered before death and he will have all of his memories from life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was confounded.  \u201cDr. Yutani, if this is true then why isn\u2019t your lab using the new strains to cure cancer or revive the dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is one effect that prevents us from using this on a wide scale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh here we go\u2026\u201d Chris replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRevived subjects will be physically fine with no visible mutations, but they will be enhanced on a cellular level beyond the limits of what is possible for a human being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you just lay it out, Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, if we revive Piers using this technology, he will look the same and mentally be the same, but he will have dramatically enhanced strength, speed, stamina, durability, and possibly even psychokinetic abilities.  We can\u2019t bring this technology to the market because despite all of the benefits, the end result is essentially a metahuman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, so you\u2019re basically turning people into Albert Wesker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh not at all.  We\u2019ve reviewed footage of Wesker\u2019s strength feats and our recent successes far surpass his abilities in every category.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris thought long and hard about this.  On one level, he could never allow this to happen to Piers.  They had spent years together combatting reckless use of super viruses.  Yet, Chris felt the irrational longing return.  The chance to be reunited with Piers\u2026to tell him everything he had always wanted to say\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would Piers ever be able to forgive him?  Dr. Yutani was the most brilliant mind in the world, so Chris fully believed her that Piers would not mutate or turn into some monstrosity\u2014but would Piers ever forgive him if because of Chris, he was never fully human?  Chris was torn and started making excuses to justify his desire.  Maybe Piers would enjoy being enhanced?  Maybe he would be grateful to be beyond human?  Deep down Chris knew this wasn\u2019t true, but he was not going to lose the chance to finally let Piers know how much he loved him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Chris said.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the clone lacked any form of consciousness.  It was essentially braindead and in stasis.  But then Dr. Yutani dropped a true bomb.  It turns out that the BSAA had created mindmaps of their most elite agents.  It turns out that the annual \u201cMRI\u201d scans Dr. Yutani had been claiming to perform on all of them for clinical diagnostic preventative purposes were actually deep brain scans, using a device that uploaded a perfect copy of their full memories, personality, and consciousness into a digital hyper cloud storage mainframe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, this technology is decades ahead of what the world believes to be possible.  We actually have the means to reverse the process and essentially upload a stored consciousness into a functioning body that lacks any base consciousness.  We can bring Piers back.  His last scan was approximately 3 weeks before his death.  We can upload his consciousness into the braindead Wesker clone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if there\u2019s a trace of Wesker in there?  What if Piers is corrupted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Yutani assured Chris that this was a 100% impossibility.  He believed her seeing as how she was the most brilliant human on the planet, but even so\u2026he could never do this.  Bringing back the love of his life essentially into the body of his nemesis!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there another way?  Why can\u2019t you use a donor that\u2019s not Wesker?\u201d Chris wanted to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, as advanced as this technology is, the upload process is still far too taxing for a standard human brain to withstand\u2026that brings me to my next point\u2026The Wesker clone is the only known viable candidate because it has the full extent of Wesker\u2019s T-Virus enhanced abilities\u2026meaning that the clone\u2019s brain will be able to regenerate in response to the strain of the upload.  We have already injected the clone with a T-virus inhibitor that will permanently prevent further mutation, but the body will always have Wesker\u2019s hyper enhanced abilities: his strength, speed, agility, durability, and accelerated healing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was distraught.  It was like a cosmic joke.  Being able to bring the love of his life back, but as the literal embodiment of a man he had spent so many years of his life trying to kill.  Would Piers ever forgive him if he did this?  Would Chris even be able to feel the love he carried for Piers if the eyes looking back at him were Wesker\u2019s glowing red pupils?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris\u2019s logical mind told him that this was a horrible idea in so many ways\u2014that this would be traumatic for both him and Piers\u2026but he convinced himself it was what was on the inside that mattered\u2026and that his love for Piers would conquer all.  His longing to be able to finally tell Piers how he felt overpowered his revulsion to Wesker in that moment and he made sure to blurt out his response before he could think on it any longer and take back his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Howdy!  This is my first time doing something fully in the realm of fanfiction, but I\u2019m seriously so smitten with the NivanField \u201cShip.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I\u2019ll just lay out my plans for this little project.   I decided on an interactive story because there are several ways that I thought Piers could potentially come back into Chris\u2019s life, each with their own issues that Chris and Piers would have to overcome in order to finally get their happy ending.  I want the story to primarily revolve around Piers Nivans and Chris Redfield, but I have no problem with fleshing out other characters from the Resident Evil Universe.  Also, there is going to be a lot of fantasy techno bullshit involved\u2014most of which is definitely NOT canon, but I hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m bending the rules quite a bit from what\u2019s established in the RE Universe.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraphic sex scenes are absolutely encouraged, but please progress the story forward.  And please do not rush sex if the story arc hasn\u2019t resolved certain things first.  For example, in certain paths I envision Piers and Chris dealing with different PTSD issues or intimacy issues that make sex a difficult subject for both men that they\u2019ll eventually overcome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all scenarios, we\u2019re starting 9 months after Piers Nivans sacrificed his life to save Chris Redfield.  We see that Chris honored his promise to Piers to stay within the BSAA, but he is dealing with severe grief and depression.  He struggles with all that was left unsaid\u2014he is haunted by the regret of never telling Piers that he was in love with him.  The depression was very high functioning until recently.  Chris has begun a leave of absence from the BSAA, finally taking some time to just pause and evaluate his life\u2014but most of the time his thoughts fixate on Piers and bring him to a very low place.  Jill and Claire have been an incredibly dedicated support system for him, but lately, Chris has even started pushing them away.  When he\u2019s not working out, practicing his marksmanship at the gun range, or keeping his combat and knife fighting skills sharp, he\u2019s either home alone streaming shows or getting super drunk and having intense sex with Leon Kennedy.  His relationship with Leon has been his only source of comfort lately with Leon sort of being an initially toxic outlet and escape for a lot of Chris\u2019s repressed feelings and issues, but weeks of drunk, hot sex have resulted in them forming a comfortable bond and connection that helps them cope with their respective problems.  I envision their dynamic like Buffy and Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Like at first the sex was just purely hot and chaotic and an escape for both of them as they navigated their depression and misery.  This has blossomed over time into the early semblances of mutual love, but Piers is the equivalent of Angel.  He is Chris Redfield\u2019s one true love.   Leon is bisexual in this universe.  Leon\u2019s true love is Ada Wong, but as we all know, she is beyond flighty and Leon became tired of waiting for her.  Hence, finding an outlet for his frustration in Chris Redfield.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy going on this adventure with me!  You\u2019re welcome to contribute, and I cannot wait to see where we take these various story arcs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
