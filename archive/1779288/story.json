Chelsy was at the mall with her friends doing some post-grad shopping. As they were going into Forever 18, Chelsy's favorit store, she began hearing the voices. They started out as wispers, but were getting louder and louder. And they were her friends voices too. She looked at her friends, thinking that they were having a conversation, but she would here them think something but their lips wouldn't move.</span></div></div>",

They weren't even paying attention to her. <br>\r\n  Finally, Lori turned around. \"What's your problem, Chelsy?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n  \"My PROBLEM?\" Chelsy reply hotly, \"I tell you, I'm hearing VOICES, Lori!

LIKE, I hear your voice!\"<br>\r\n  Marissa laughs. \"This isn't funny, Chelsy.\" She shakes her head, amused.<br>\r\n  \"I'm not trying to be,\" Chelsy insists, \"Look, you have to believe--\"<br>\r\n  Marissa stops her mid-sentence. \"Okay, what am I thinking right now then?\" She challenges Chelsy.<br>\r\n  Chelsy focuses on her inner thoughts and finds Marissa's voice in her mind. 'This is her idea of a joke?' she hears, 'Let's see if she can tell what I'm thinking, ha. Whatever.'<br>\r\n  Chelsy stares at her friend. <br>\r\n  \"So?\" Marissa raises her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Running through her head trying to figure out what was going on. It didn't seem like it would be easy to explain what was happening, to anybody. <br>\r\n'Chelsy, check this out!'<br>\r\nCalled Lori holding up a saucy top - golden and sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Chelsy was getting ready for a night on the town. Wearing her blond hair down and her new golden top, she didn't know if she was in the mood for it. The doorbell rang just as she finished with her makeup, it was Natalie, smirking, holding a bottle of gin and leaning against the doorpost. Chelsy quickly invited her in and grabbed a couple of glasses and some soda water. Chelsy was still hearing the thoughts of Natalie, but she was staying zipped about it for now. It was difficult not to react to them, but she trusted Natalie, and had done for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie had come over quite early so that they could pre-drink. So they sat in Chelsy's room talking about everything under the sun - except of course Chelsy's new found gift. They talked of college and of the future, they talked of boys and the present but not of unspoken words - not of mind reading. This subject was really playing on Chelsy's mind and as she drank more, she felt the words forming in the back of her throat.</span></div></div>",

She did look like she was in pain. \"Oh alright, But you owe me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsy smiled gratefully. Wincing at the bright mall lights and loud music. The walk back to the car was terrible, the mall was packed, and with each person she passed, Chelsy found it harder to keep from crying out. She felt a pressure in her head as more and more thoughts crowded her brain, she was starting to seriously freak out. She only began to feel relief after they were about five miles from the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok? You look kind of green,\" asked Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I'm fine. Just a migraine I think,\" replied Chelsy, trying to give her friend a smile, but only really managing a wonky grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey gave her a quick glance, then turned her eyes back to the road. Chelsy could hear her thoughts. <i>She's lying, something is wrong. Why won't she tell me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty more minutes of driving, Stacy pulled into Chelsy's driveway and parked the car. \" Are you sure you can make it to  the basketball game tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wouldn't miss it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy gave her a long stare. \"I'll call you later,ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, talk to you later.\" Chelsy got out of the car, and waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got inside, she flopped down on the couch and let out a groan. She could hear her mother's thoughts humming away in the kitchen. <i>Oh, Chelsy must be home. I guess I better get dinner started. sigh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsy, go get started on your homework!\" shouted her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Mom,\"she replied weakly. As she was heading up the stairs she heard her mom's thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shoot! I forgot to get the chicken at the store.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsy, I forgot to get the chicken for dinner. I'm just going to run to the store, will you be ok while I'm gone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom, I'll be fine,\"  Chelsy replied tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be back in a few minutes. Call me if you have any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChesly rolled her eyes. How much trouble would she have in just a few minutes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Chelsy tried to read the thoughts of the people at the door, just to see if she could figure out who it was, but oddly enough, she couldn't hear anything coming from whoever it was. She walked over to her window, the one that overlooked the front door, and saw two men in black suits waiting. Alarm was quickly rising inside her. The door bell rang again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was feeling okay, so she decided to stay with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe very quickly learned how to manipulate the volume of the voices in her head so that she could start to deal with the very surprising revelations that were basically being telepathically received. Eventually, it even seemed to be fun. She figured out how to tune into strangers' thoughts, as well. Chelsy spent the next few days rather amused at what she heard people thinking. She was most surprised by the thoughts of the quieter people she knew or of the people she randomly observed. Little did she know that when she decided to eavesdrop on someone's thoughts one fateful day, she would get wrapped up in a most bizarre intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few days later at the dinner table. when Chelsy heard her twin brother Mark, captain of the varsity football team, think, \"I can't believe this is going to happen tonight. Time seems to have flown by since we thought of this scheme a month ago. Now there's no turning back.\" Chelsy began to wonder about what was going to happen tonight. Sure, Mark had a girlfriend, but this didn't seem like it had anything primarily to do with her. What scheme was he talking about? It seemed like the more she was concerned about what she had heard Mark thinking, the less she could hone in on other people's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mark finished his supper, he asked to be excused from the table due to an appointment he had planned with Dr Loshe, his therapist. Mark had been having trouble in school the year prior and their parents found Dr. Loshe. Chelsy had an immense dislike for Dr. Loshe when she met him for an general evaluation around the time Mark started seeing him. Was he the other person Mark was thinking about when his thoughts mentioned the scheme for tonight. The mind reading thing only worked for about a ten foot radius at about a minute at a time before needed recharged with relaxation for a little while. However, Mark was leaving now. Chelsy had to know more, but she didn't want to do the investigating on her own for fear that it might turn out to lead her into a dangerous situation. What will she do? <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't picking up any specific thoughts, but just a general nervousness.  Once they reached the library, Mark stopped the car on the side of the road.  Chelsy began to climb out of the truck and Mark said, \"Meet me back here exactly at 7.

Mark had parked his car, but he hadn't opened the door yet.  When he opened the door, she saw that he was carrying a heavy bag.  Chelsy knew that the bag had something to do with whatever Mark had been thinking about earlier.<br>\r\nMark walked into the building and Chelsy quickly ran up to the side of the office.
