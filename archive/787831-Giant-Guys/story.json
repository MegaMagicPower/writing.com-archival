That thought just makes him more excited, and he decides to give the puny things a show.  He begins to flex his muscles, showing off his entire body.  Even before he grew Gohan had well built muscles from years of martial arts, but the gun had even filled his form out to what Gohan considered the perfect compromise between a more powerful size, and still providing for ease of movement in a fight.  In short, not that anything about him was short, Gohan considered his body perfect, and the only way to improve it was by getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan finished flexing his strong back, he turned to see that his size was now about the same as the earth.  It made him laugh again, although people on the earth couldn't hear him any longer since he was in space.  It was not enough, Gohan wanted more so he aimed the gun and was ready to fire it again.  But this time he got a little arrogant, he felt the people had seen enough of his growing upper body and deserved a chance to watch his back grow.  So he turned his back to the earth and pulled the trigger again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his growth start up again, but what he didn't see behind him was...</span></div></div>",

She had to go to some kind of convention or something and dad's gone into space again, so I thought we'd try this out!\"<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\" Goten asked excitedly entering the house.<br>\r\n\"It can change the size of something! It can make them bigger or smaller, with no limit!\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Try it on me!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay hold on. I've just got set the settings right...\"<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n\"Would you let me work?\"<br>\r\nSoon Trunks had it set up.<br>\r\n\"Okay, this will make you ten feet tall.\"<br>\r\n\"That's it? Turn it up a little why don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"No! It's my gun and we'll do this my way!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm changing it!\"<br>\r\nSo Goten and Trunks wrestled with the gun in which the intensity got turned up and the gun fired at Goten.</span></div></div>",

Within seconds, he was staring straight up at Goten's huge face staring right back down with an equally huge grin on his face. Goten giggled as he lifted up his foot, bringing down on top of Trunks. Luckily, Trunks broke out of his frozen stupor and flew backward, avoiding the massive foot. It maybe impossible for him to win, but he wasn't going to just sit back and get his ass kicked. He quickly powered up to Super Saiyan and charged at Goten, aiming for his stomach. He used his momentum to launch a punch directly on target. His fist sunk into Goten's belly, doing almost no damage. Goten was forced a short step back, but that was it. Before Trunks had a chance to continue his attack, Goten swatted him like a troublesome mosquito. Trunks went flying to the ground, where he made a sizable crater. Before he could get back up, Goten brought his foot down, smashing Trunks deeper into the concrete. He laughed as he removed his foot seeing Trunks bruised on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough yet Trunks?\" Goten asked, hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks managed to get to his feet and growled angrily at his friend. \"No way!

He grinned as he saw the beam of energy arc upwards at Goten. The grin disappeared as Goten raised one hand and caught the beam without trouble, redirecting it upwards to disappear in the night sky. Trunks' lowered his arms in disbelief, not noticing when Goten had his foot hovering over his head. Before he could react, the foot came down again, pinning Trunks to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win!\" Goten shouted out happily, putting just enough pressure on his foot to keep Trunks in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks struggled in vain for a few minutes before just relaxing and settling for glaring at Goten.

Goten was an unstoppable force of power and he, Trunks, was reduced to nothing more than his plaything. Who knew what Goten would do to him when he got back? Who knew what kind of damage he would cause? The answer to that question was soon answered as Trunks saw Goten kick a building, laughing as he saw it crumble. Luckily, it was an office building and no one was in it at this time of night, but there was no guarantee the next one wouldn't be an apartment complex. As Trunks watched, Goten got down on his hands and knees and started playing with the cars, running them down the roads and crashing them into each other. Trunks sighed, wincing as he felt the bruises rising on his poor beaten body. Goten had really given him a run for his money. If they had been on equal terms there was no way Goten would've won. It all came right back down to his first thought as this whole thing had started. This wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought came to Trunks. There was a way to make this fair. What had caused all this in the first place? The size gun! With it, he would be able to even the playing field. Trunks grinned evilly as he imagined Goten as the one beneath his feet! Yes, with that gun Trunks would be in control and things would finally be going his way! There was only one problem. Well, actually two problems. First, there was no guarantee that the gun hadn't been destroyed after Goten's growth spurt. His huge body may very well have crushed it to pieces. Second, even if it was intact Trunks had no idea where it was. This was less of a problem though, as it couldn't have gone far. Trunks slowly floated in the air and looked around trying to decide how wide of a radius he should check. Well, when the gun went off, Trunks remembered Goten flying backward. At that time, he was pretty sure he still had the gun in his hand. He had collapsed after stumbling backward a few steps, and Goten had pretty much just grown around him, his legs on either side. That meant the gun would've been knocked out of his hand when he fell. Coming to this conclusion, Trunks landed in the spot where he had been knocked unconscious. Now, Goten had woken up and they had moved around slightly, probably, at most, sixty feet in either direction. Assuming the gun hadn't got kicked around or covered in rubble by Goten, the gun would have to be either a few feet from the spot he fell unconscious at least, or within a sixty foot radius of the point he had fallen unconscious at most. Trunks began to search, being sure to not miss a single spot as he walked slowly around the spot he had fallen unconscious, widening the circle as he continued moving. His heart was pounding as he searched, occasionally stealing glances at Goten who was still playing around, knocking down buildings, kicking cars, and playing with a late night train. It was a race against time. Would Goten come back before he had time to find the gun? Or would Trunks find it and gain the upper hand? Only time would tell. </span></div></div>",

Heart pounding, and hoping he wasn't just seeing some broken glass, Trunks flew down and shifted some of the rubble. His heart leaped as he saw the gun. His look of surprise at having actually found the thing was replaced with a primal grin as he realized that he now finally had the upper hand over Goten. He turned around, getting ready to fly off to Goten and get some revenge, when he came face to face with Goten's feet. Before he could do anything else, Goten reached down and grabbed Trunks bringing him to his face. Goten grinned at Trunks and said, \"Okay Trunks I'm ready for some more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks was livid. How unfair this all was! He was seconds away from revenge and now he was going to be forced to do who knew what to Goten. A chilling thought occurred to him as Goten looked around for a place to take Trunks. What if Goten got his hands on the gun? What sort of havoc would he wreak? Worse, what would become of Trunks? Trunks tried to wiggle his hands and discovered the barrel of the gun was pressed against Goten's huge fingers. Trunks tried to move his index finger and found that he could press the trigger if he tried hard enough. That left him with two options: take a chance and fire the gun, hoping to shrink Goten, or bide his time until he could check what the setting on the gun was to properly use it but chance having Goten steal it away from him. Neither choice was very safe or appealing but unless Trunks made a decision now it was going to be made for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast Trunks decides to </span></div></div>",

Now he was being asked whether or not he wanted to explore his friend's body? Trunks fumed for awhile but then started thinking about it. So far Goten had done nothing but torture and fight with him before playing with the city. By comparison exploring his body would be a lot less painful and humiliating. So he looked back up into Goten's eyes and said, \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten cheered, his voice echoing for miles. Trunks would've covered his ears if his arms weren't being pinned down by Goten's massive digits. Goten didn't seem to notice the pain his voice could cause but got on with playing. He sat down on the ground knocking a few nearby buildings down with the sheer weight of his body and laid down flat. He held Trunks in front of his eyes and said, \"Alright Trunks. I'm going to put you down by my feet first. I'll let you have an hour of exploring before we do something else. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and sat back up depositing Trunks on his left foot. Trunks looked around from his vantage point on the tip of Goten's big toe. The nail was directly in front of him, thick and hard. Trunks couldn't even get his hand completely around it. He jumped up on the nail and saw Goten's body stretch hundreds of feet into the distance up to his grinning face staring at him. Trunks knew he didn't have too much time so he should get started. This was supposed to be a reward for him and he intended to do something to enjoy himself because there was no telling what Goten would have him do next. </span></div></div>",

He had checked the upstairs, the downstairs, the living room, the kitchen, the office section, the garage, her fathers garden of wild animals. (He forgot to tell her to burn that place down since the incident when Ginyu frog attempted to take his body once again.) Ever since last tuesday she has been vanishing and appearing nonstop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vegeta needed Bulma for many things: Food, sex, how to work the remote, etc. Now if only he could find her this would all be solved. Leaving the house, Veget headed for the lab next door. He hadn't seen his son in awhile as well, adding more to his worryness. \"Women! Are you in here!?\" Vegeta shouted throughout the lab. \"Dammit! I thought for sure she'd be in here!\" Vegeta stated as he walked into the lab, closing the entrance doors. He saw all sorts of things being worked on: New capsule cars and planes, Supercomputers the size of a small box, A capsule device which makes food out of nothing, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like anyone actually needs this stuff.\" Vegeta growled as he walk towards a large device in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a gun with a bunch of wires and tubes attached to its sides. \"Probably a deathray.\" Vegeta said as he examined it. Moving towards the control device, it had printed in big black words \"S&amp;G Ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And how do they expect people to understand what those words mean?\" Looking down at the control device, one was a red button with 'S' below it. The other was a blue button with a 'G' underneath it. The  blue one had underneath it a dial with the numbers 'x2 x5 x10 x100'. The red one also had a dial under neath it that said \"2, 5, 10, 100.\" And they had one extra dial with three words: S, Bi, G.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Honestly, what has that women been working on while i've been training?\" Vegeta said as he examined the device. \"I'll see how this thing works on me to see if this crap is worth not spending time with me.\" Messing with a few dials, Vegeta pressed a white button and watched as the machine turned on. Getting infront of it, Vegeta watched as a golden beam hit him.</span></div></div>",

His already muscular body was growing even more defined as his head pushed through the ceiling and into the room above. His growth continued, and he crashed through floor after floor, his body filling the building completely. His head eventually burst from the ceiling and his shoulders, and entire torso followed. He crouched down as the growth ended, so as not to expose himself to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned in primal pleasure as he felt the new surges of strength rushing through his body.

Thanks to the growths additional changes, it seemed to have given him eagle eyesight. Looking far across the city, Vegeta found his wife at the highest point of Capsule Corp's main office. Seems she was speaking with the Executives about her inventions. Looking down, Vegeta saw that even though his body had smashed against it, the machine was intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"When I get my wife and have her explore my body, i'll have her figure out how to work this thing.\" Vegeta laughed wickedly as he pressed a finger against it with the intent of destroying it. Yet it didn't move. \"Indestructable? To think my wife actually made something this deadly. I wonder if she planned to use this to make me even tinier?\" Vegeta said as he thought about it. \"Definately. Too bad she didn't expect me to use it before her! Ahahahahaha!\" Vegeta laughed as he rose up, his erection hard as it crashed through the building. \"Now to get my Queen! She'll regret ever thinking about such a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With one step outside the building his foot thudded against the ground. The ripples caused what seemed to be a earthquake. As people walked by, those that saw his foot began to scream instantly. They ran away like scurrying mice as Vegeta's foot came down on a car, smashing it into a thin piece of metal and plastic. \"Damn bugs should move their things if they don't want it crushed.\" Vegeta growled as he looked down, amused by the terror in their eyes. \"I could get use to this!\" Vegeta laughed evilly as he walked through a building like it wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quickly he walked, chunks of the building he had crashed into fell onto innocent bystanders. Others were flatten by his feet. Some were even picked up by him and eaten just to see what they taste lick. Having eaten one person whole, Vegeta laughed evilly \"Mmm! Humans taste good! I guess to feed my body i'll have to eat every last one of you!\" He laughed as he continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he was reaching the building Bulma was at, she was giving a important speech. Holding a stick and pointing at certain spots on the board, she was explaining to the Executives about her latest invention. \"And so my g&amp;s gun can shrink massive monsters to a maneagable size. And it can also make food twice to a hundred times it size: Ensuring that every one in the world no longer needs to worry about food or monsters.\" Bulma told them as she pointed to a T-Rex shrunken to hand size. And a Strawberry large enough to be a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But what if someone were to use the gun for evil?\" Executive 1 asked her. \"What if innocent people are shrunken and played with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hardly think anyone would do that. Humans are by nature good and kind\" Bulma told them, but some were not buying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's not true. Human nature is to be both good and evil. There are chances that someone may use the gun to make themselves huge. And you stated yourself that creatures shrunken become indestructable unless they are swallowed whole. And if they grow huge their ability to age stops completly and they no longer need food, oxygen, or water. The earth could very well be conquered if someone did use the gun in those ways.\" Said Executive 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can't see that happen-\" Bulma was stopped as a giant hand crashed through the window. Vegeta had arrive during the bickering and had pulled out Bulma gently in his hand. Then with his other hand pushed the building over like a domino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aaaaaaaaaaah! Wait!? Vegeta?\" Bulma asked as she saw the handsome figure and even more muscular version of her husband stood before her. \"You used the gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course! I wanted to see what you were inventing, so I decided to go see it myself. I must admit it was awesome changing into this perfect body!\" Vegeta growled as he brought a finger down his massive eight pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you going to do wtih me?\"  Bulma asked, fearing what her husband may do at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What else? I am going to let you explore my godly body.\" Vegeta had a huge, evil smirk on his face as he saw her shocked face.</span></div></div>",

Vegeta had a big ego, was rude, obnoxious, and had a inferiority complex. Now he was a giant as well? This was not good for her, he was already hard enough to have sex with in bed. The thoughts of how hard he could make her life for not doing it his way sent shivers down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They are bugs to a god like me!\" Vegeta said as they began to arrive at Mt.

But with a single punch from his fist each fish was tossed on the side of the beach. Soon, Goku had stacked as many twelve giant fish on the side. Lifting most of them up, Goku tossed them back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well that takes there of that. Now Chi-Chi can't complain we don't have enough food.\" Goku said as he looked around the area, his clothes which he had left on a rock were gone. \"Darnit! Looks like one of the fish actually ate my clothes! Oh well, i'll simply carry these two home and worry about clothes later.\" Goku then lifted each fish into a hand and carried it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when he heard it. The earth thundered as he stopped moving, the birds and other animals ran off in the direction he was going. \"Is this an earthquake?\" Goku asked himself aloud as he turned around. \"Whatever it is the animals are pretty spooked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when he saw it, a massive foot landed right before his eyes. Dropping both fish, Goku looked up at whatever the foot was connected too. \"Oh my god.\" Goku said as he saw the giant face of Vegeta towering above him, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well, well. If it isn't the small Saiyan Kakarot! Your going to be happy serving your mighty King.\" Vegeta said with a wicked smirk as he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"King? What are you talking about Vegeta?\" Goku said as he flew up towards Vegetas face. As he flew up, Goku saw Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Goku! Run! He's going to capture you!\" Bulma shouted to him. As Goku was caught off guard by what she said, it was all it took for Vegeta to grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goku tried with all his might to release himself from his prison as Vegeta laughed at him \"Try all you want! Your mine! And you two will serve me as the god I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not if I have anything to say about it!\" Goku said as he went Super Saiyan 3. His hair grew long and golden as he tried to free himself from his prison. \"Can't free myself!\" Goku said as he tried with all his power to free himself. Goku powered down as he lost all of his power trying to gain his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I warned you Kakarot! I am your King and God! I have more power in my pinky than you have in your entire body!\" Looking down at both his captives, Vegeta smiled evilly. \"Now, lets have some fun!\" </span></div></div>",

Finally he could do with him as he saw fit! He sat down his massive butt making a crater in the ground. He laid on his back cupping his two prisoners together in his hands and placing his hands on his chest. Inside, Goku was feeling sluggish due to the amount of Ki he expended from his transformations and attempts at freeing himself. He was woozy but still able to stand. He and Bulma were pressed uncomfortably close together. Bulma was blushing being so close to her old friend. Who happened to be naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulma...What's going on?\" Goku asked. \"What happened to Vegeta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told him the abbreviated version of the story. Behind her words was the steady thump thump thump of Vegeta's heart. She finished and Goku thought about the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only way we can stop him is shrink back down to normal right?\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously!\" Bulma said. \"But there's no way he's going to let us get anywhere near that machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bulma. I have one last question.\" Goku said, looking very serious. \"Is there a limit on that gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma thought about it. \"No. It can make anything as big or as small as the person operating it wants to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shivered at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be a lot worse than it already is.\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma nodded, thinking about the gigantic possibilities. \"In retrospect, I should've been more careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more talk was to be had as Vegeta opened his hands and the two captives tumbled out onto one of Vegeta's mammoth pecs. The skin was firm and they could both feel the powerful muscle pulsing slightly under their feet. His heartbeat was even louder here. They both looked up and saw Vegeta staring at them, his head slightly raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I continue on my conquest of this area...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking small for now. That's good.\" Bulma thought desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you two to pleasure me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stared. So blunt. They didn't move. Vegeta's cocky smile quickly melted into a glower of simmering anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an order. Not a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both turned and ran down Vegeta's body towards his junk. They stumbled over each rise of his abs and skirted his belly button before entering the thicket of his pubic hair. His pubic hair was as black as the hair on his head. They fought through the thick strands until they were before the monolithic dick. It stretched high above them, twitching ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\" Bulma muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"ground\" shifted as Vegeta moved to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does he expect us to do this?\" Bulma said to Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku sweatdropped and said, \"I'm not touching that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma face faulted. She got back up and screamed, \"I can't do anything to that giant prick unless you help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi-Chi'd kill me!\" Goku said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what she'd do!

Faster and faster they rubbed their bodies against his cock when he let out a animalistic growl. Gooey cum came forth from the cock as Goku and Bulma finished, laying exhausted on it as they felt it begin to go limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vegeta raised the upper half of his body, looking down he smiled as he saw the two of them exhausted from serving their Kings needs.

Goku landed next to the tongue between tongue and teeth. It was hot and gusts of hot air constantly rose from the throat and blasted over the pair. Vegeta closed his mouth enjoying the taste of his former rival, his wife, and his own sweet cum. He lolled his tongue around coating Bulma in completely in his saliva. She tried to grab onto something but it was all smooth surfaces. She was flipped over, sideways, backwards, all manner of ways as Vegeta played with her via his tongue. Bulma, despite herself, was starting to get a little hot from this. Vegeta's tongue seemed a creature seperate from the main body. It slithered along the length of her body, pressed into her nether regions, probing apart her tiny vaginal walls as best it could before slipping over her tight butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was having a less sensual time, getting beat over the head with the tongue everytime it flopped around. The last of his ki had been burned out helping Bulma please Vegeta so he couldn't fly up away from the slopping digit. He tried a few times to climb ontop of it at least, but failed in this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Vegeta spit them out into his hand. Bulma was panting from the sexual exertion, her hair pasted down with saliva and her own sweat. She was incredibly aroused but hadn't had the chance to cum herself. Goku was just glad to be out.

Both Goku and Bulma covered their ears, but the sound was so great that it didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a great jump Vegeta flew off towards the nearest village. He wanted to begin his reign as ruler of the humans as soon as he could. And when he had built himself a empire, he would make both Bulma and Goku giants as well, though not as big as him. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The small village was far away from major cities. And almost no one knew about the giant incident that happend in West City. Their homes were made of wood, and only a few had car capsules. All in all, it was a peaceful village. That is until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a swift landing, Vegeta rose above the small building as he landed with a earth shaking thump. The villagers quickly left their homes to see the commotion, only to scream and shout in shock at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do we have here?\" Vegeta laughed wickedly as he looked down. \"Bow before your God and King! Or face my wrath!\" Roared Vegeta as he saw several of them enter their homes, grab their guns, and came back, ready to shoot him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You think your small weapons can harm a god!?\" Vegeta laughed as he walked towards one building. The man who lived their readied his shotgun and fired right at his chest. But each bullet was flattened as soon as it made contact. Vegeta laughed wickedly as he brought his free hand down his chest, feeling his abs. \"You think a mortal weapon can harm a god!?\" Vegeta laughed as he took one more step next to the house. Opening his mouth, a blast of ki energy shot forth, annihilating the home and the man inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking around, he smiled wickedly as he watched all the people with their terrified faces. \"Any one else want to fight me? Cause if you don't, put the guns down and start bowing!\" He smirked as he saw them toss their guns down and start bowing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goku and Bulma meanwhile, were looking angrily at him. \"Their has to be something that can stop him.\" Bulma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, there isn't. The Gods(Kai) are weaker than me! And since he's 10x bigger his power seems to have increased 100x!\" Goku told her. They weren't going to get out of this easily. Nobody what they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that this town is under my divine authority.\" Vegeta smirked as he watched them worship him \"I must move off to the next town mortals!

He had dropped off his bookbag when his mother told him to go get his father who was at Capsule Corp. It didn't long for Goku to get to Capsule Corp, but he was horrified at the destruction that seemed to have befallen it. He ran inside and called out, \"Is anyone here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that you Gohan dear?\" Bunni said, sitting in the half ruined kitchen drinking tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know! Just a little explosion or something.

Nothing. How strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he was about to leave, he ran into someone who was running in the opposite direction. They both fell down. Gohan sat up first and saw it was Mirai Trunks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai sat up and said, \"I just thought I'd come back for a visit, since Mom was out of town in my time. Then when I saw what shape everything was in, I tried to find out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded and said, \"Same here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they both started exploring the wreckage, looking for the cause of the explosion. It didn't take too long before Mira was yelling out, \"Gohan! Come look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan rushed over to Mirai and saw a small area with rubble all around it. It made a little room. They both went in and saw a strange looking gun in the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Gohan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai shrugged and they went to investigate. The gun had a dial with S and G and it, another dial that said 2x, 10x, 20x and 100x times on, and one other dial that said S, Bi, and G.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the wierdest looking machine I've ever seen!\" Mirai said, looking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it does?\" Gohan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try it and find out!\" Mirai said, a gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...it could be dangerous...\" Gohan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! If it is just a regular gun, it's not like it'll kill us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...Okay! Let's try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai fiddled with the gun and pressed a timer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

His muscles bulged as his body started to grow.

But his strength was so great that the front of his shirt was ripped along with it. Gohan moaned as he felt his stomach muscles hardening. A once solid 4-pack became a hard steel cut 8-pack. His pecs grew with and allowed him to have a V-shape down his back. His arm muscles grew and bulged so much that they ripped apart the sleeves. Gohan's shoes were getting tighter as he felt them rip apart, revealing his big powerful feet. His boxers began to grow tighter and tighter until they were ripped apart. Allowing his cock to fly freely in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mirai stood embarassinly unable to hide his erection. Looking up he thought 'I wish I could be as big as him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gohans body grew higher and higher until he stood at a towering 68ft. tall.

In only a few short hours Vegeta had conquered seventeen villages, and each one held total alligance to him (under threat of death of course). But Vegeta was no fool and knew he would have to be bigger to take on the bigger cities. King Furry had a powerful military force. He had to, to be able to keep the entire world under check. Vegeta smirked as he thought about that military. He could probably still take it out with his power alone, but it was better to be safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Vegeta said to his bowing subjects. \"I'm moving on to bigger and better things than you weaklings! But I'll be back and every one of you better still be in alligance with me or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed over a large building to illustrate his point.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vegeta was infuriated! His one chance to build an army, or an army of one, whatever, was gone! Gone in an instant! He knew the machine couldn't be destroyed easily, if at all. After all, with all his new found strength he hadn't been able to even dent it. So the only logical explanation was that someone had stolen it! He made a quick sweep of the area with his senses to see if anyone had used it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head sharply towards something in the distance. It was faint with distance, but it was a ki that had a similar feeling of power with his own. Damn! If someone stronger than him had used the gun to get to his size or bigger, his dominance could be put into question! He didn't want that at all. He burst into the air, flying towards the ki. He'd be there soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vegeta thundered towards Gohan and Mirai, they were getting ready for some alone time. Mirai quickly took off his suit, stripping out of the jacket, tie, white shirt, dress pants, kicking off his dress shoes and pulling off his black socks. Lastly, he pulled off his white boxers revealing his trim yet muscular build and his hardened rod, pointing up at Gohan. Gohan grinned down at him, his own rod rearing high. Gohan was sitting spread eagled so his his sack was laying on the ground, his dick pointing up. Mirai tossed aside those stupid glasses that didn't seem to have a point, except to impressive the tight wad executives, and approached the gigantic organ. He could see the giant testicles pulsing with their own life, anticipating the exercise to come. Mirai touched the balls, reveling in the smooth tight skin, before slowly rising up to the cock head. Gohan was already starting to breathe faster in anticipation. He made absolutely sure no one was around before concentrating fully on Mirai. Mirai placed his hands on Gohan's hot head and wrapped his legs as best he could around Gohan's rod. He slowly, sensually, began to lick the hot, and slightly salty, flesh, his tongue massaging near the slit. Gohan gasped but bit his lip to avoid moaning out loud. Surely his moans would alert someone nearby. So he dug his hands into the ground and reveled in the feeling of his little lover starting to grind against his tool as well as sucking on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai started to sweat as he worked himself up, his own prick quivering with exertion and eroticism. He started going faster and Gohan began to moan in spite of himself. He dug his hands in deeper, the ground coming up in clumps around his massive fingers. Just as Mirai climaxed over Gohan's dick, Gohan himself started coming. Mirai felt it inside the massive tube of flesh. Within seconds the churning turned to full on spurting. He looked up as globs of cum spattered against Gohan's own body as well as landing in thick sticky ropes all over his own body. He licked some of it off his mouth, loving the salty taste of his man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan's breathing started slowing down and he smiled warmly at his tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Before I make you as big as me, I'd better clean you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked Mirai up and stood up, looking for a place to wash him off. Before he'd taken three steps towards a nearby lake, Vegeta landed behind him. Gohan turned around and was surprised to see Vegeta standing before him, a giant too! Albeit, a smaller giant than him. He also looked mighty pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the hell do you think you're doing?\" He yelled at Gohan. \"You stole my machine! Give it back or suffer the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan smirked down at him and said, \"Why should I? There's no way you can stand up to me! Not only am I bigger than you, I'm a lot stronger than you! So you'd better start listening to me or I'll have to make an example out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai smiled up at his man. That's the way to tell him! Even if he was his father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled angrily. He would be the biggest! He had to be!</span></div></div>",

They also noticed that he was holding Mirai in his hands, and that he was naked. \"Well, at least Mirais here of his free will.\" Bulma stated as they were both shocked by this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I just hope Gohan can beat this bastard! I never even tried to overcome him for fun! I just did it to protect the Earth!\" Goku told her as they awaited the next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai stood in Gohans hand, still covered in his juices. Thankfully his clothes were there with the capsule. If he left now he could clean up and Gohan could fight his dad. And he could grow, matching Gohan in size and strength so that they could both stop his power-hungry dad. \"Gohan!\" Mirai yelled up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah?\" He asked as he looked down at him in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can you let me leave with my clothes? I want to get clean!\" Mirai said as Gohan loosened his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure!\" Gohan said as Mirai left his hand, picked up his clothes, and left towards the nearest lake to clean off. That's when he noticed his dad and Bulma were in Vegeta's hands! That monster! \"Before we fight let them go! They'll get killed!\" Gohan shouted as he brought up his fist, ready to punch the Saiyan to HFIL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down at his hand, Vegeta was shocked that they were both in his hands! If he had started fighting with them in his hands they would surely have been crushed. \"I have more plans for you two!\" Vegeta said as he ripped up holes in the ground, then with a simple drop tossed them into two seperate holes. And then he covered them  up to their heads, allowing them to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both of them were too shocked by the fall to notice what was coming next. Landing in the earth, both looked up angrily at Vegeta and then to Goku \"Kick his ass!\" Both shouted in unison as they laid trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Quickly a fling of punches came forth from both giants. Vegeta tossing one at Gohans ribs, Gohan dodging it easily as he went for a kick in the head. Vegeta flew into the air. His new found power would allow him to ensure his dominance over all things! If he made himself big enough Vegeta could rule the entire universe! \"Kamehameha!\" Vegeta roared as he put all but a bit of his energy into the blast, enough to wipe out the solar system and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But all Gohan did was smile as he lifted a finger up at him, and with a simple shot of energy create a baseball size of energy.(To him) The energy quickly shot forward as it hit the Kamehameha wave. \"Nice try but that won't work Vegeta!\" Gohan said as his small energy shot cancelled out the powerful energy. Both vanishing as they collapsed in on themselves. Vegeta slowly flew down, shocked by the battle. It was over that quick!? Even the fight with Cell lasted longer! Even the Buu fight! Feeling this fear pass through him made him even more determined to grow bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But with a simple flash, Gohan had slammed Vegeta headfirst into the ground. The battle was over, and Gohan had won easily. \"Take that Prince of Dirt!\" Gohan said as he rubbed the mans face into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mirai had made sure to clean off every part of his perfect body. He didn't want Gohan to have to see his lovers body unclean and filthy. Having used shampoo from a capsule and soap, Mirai had cleaned himself in the ice cold lake until the water dripped perfectly from his body, slowly moving down his muscular body. And before him stood the towering machine. Humming as it looked ready to zap the half saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Make me into a god! Allow me to join my my new found Saiyan partner!\" Mirai moaned as the beam shot forth, hitting him.</span></div></div>",

The feeling was terribly erotic and watching the trees fall below him turned him on. He could now easily see Gohan grinning savagely as he stomped Vegeta's head into the dust. It was obvious that Gohan was far more powerful than Vegeta without even really trying. He capsulized the machine and approached Gohan, his big feet smooshing trees and bushes and leaving perfectly formed foot prints. Gohan heard him coming and just stared in surprise at his giant lover. Than he grinned. Mirai grinned back and tossed him the tiny capsule that contained the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're the most trustworthy.\" He said as Gohan caught the capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Gohan said, his foot still pressing down on Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are we going to do about him?\" Mirai asked indicating his struggling father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I don't know...\" Gohan thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't know?!?!?\" Bulma shouted angrily. \"Turn him back to normal and shrink yourselves! That's the only way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down Bulma!\" Gohan said. \"I have no plans to shrink myself. Not after achieving this perfect form! Now shut up while I decide what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma closed her mouth, thinking the trouble just got worse. Gohan was still a forgiving person by nature and as long as he had the machine no danger could befall him or his friends. So he removed his foot and allowed Vegeta to look up at him, rubbing grit from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up little man!\" Gohan said, pointing down at Vegeta. \"I'm giving you a second chance! You'll join me and Mirai as we take over this world. Knowing you, some villages are probably under your control. We'll head to them first and tell them their total allegiance belongs to me and Mirai. You will be under us until you can prove yourself trustworthy enough to join us as equals. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled and dug his hands into the dirt. But he couldn't do anything to stop him at this time. So he nodded. At some point Gohan would slip up and then the machine would be his!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to head over to the villages Bulma and Goku in Gohan's hands.</span></div></div>",

He kissed him tenderly and said \"Not yet\". \"So should we do it now?\" Mirai asked as they turned and looked at Vegeta, who was ripping out the dirt from where Bulma and Goku stood. Both were once again in Vegeta's hands. A cruel smile crossed his face. They knew he was happy to have them in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure.\" Gohan said as he popped the Capsule. Once again the gun was before them. But as they popped it, Vegeta turned away and watched his cock stand erect as Gohan fired the beam for the intention to hit the two of them in that one hand. Problem was that when he turned around, the gun had accidentally caused it to hit Vegeta. Instead of affecting just the two of them, Vegeta's entire body along with theirs would grow bigger.</span></div></div>",

His big feet were pressing up against them, his toes growing bigger than them! His muscles grew ever more defined, nearly limitless power now bulged within. Finally it all came to an end. Vegeta laughed loudly and menacingly, a sound that was heard for miles around. Sharing a quick look the two smaller giants quickly launched into the air. They couldn't do anything to stop Vegeta now and if he got hold of them or the machine it would mean curtains! The machine was safely capsulized so they didn't have to worry about dropping it. They'd barely made it a few feet before Vegeta's massive hand blocked their path. It closed around them in a massive fist. He brought them to his face and grinned maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you thought you could overthrow the King of the Saijins just like that? You'll both pay for your crimes, but maybe I'll let you live on as my slaves along with these two.\" He indicated Bulma and Goku.

And then, what's to stop me from growing bigger and bigger and taking over the entire Universe?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four prisoners were chilled by his sentiments.

I shall be the God of New Vegeta!\" Vegeta roared as his cock grew hard, ready to have fun. \"Not yet! First I will transform myself and my toys into true gods!\" Vegeta roared as he pressed the button. Instantly all five of them grew. They rose far above the forests, Vegeta's body capable of being seen several miles away. The four helpless captives also grew, reaching one-fifth of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their muscles bulged and grew as they got bigger. Bulma's breasts grew bigger and bouncier. And the four males had enhancements of their own as they reached their full size. That's when the strangest thing happend. All of their tails grew back. Each and every Saiyan tail had grown. Only Mirai's was different(lavender). \"How big are we gonna be when he stops growing?\" Bulma asked the other three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who knows mom! This IS dad were talking about.\" Mirai replied back. When Mirai said that, a shiver was sent down everyone's spine. Finally, Vegeta had stopped growing. His towering body covered the entire forest in his shadow. His massive body bulging with power as he laughed as he achieved his perfect size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that I am truly a Saiyin god I have no more use for this!\" Vegeta laughed, his voice shaking the very mountains and toppling trees. He brought the device to his face and tossed it into his mouth, swallowing it whole. \"Now no one will be able to match my power or size! Ahahahahaha!\" Vegeta's voice sent shockwaves across the entire region. Forests were ripped from the ground, houses torn apart, even mountains collapsing on themselves. Such was Vegeta's collossal power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now I am truly the Emperor of Earth. Not even the president of the Earth can stop me now!\" Vegeta said with a wicked roar as his Saiyin tail crashed into anything behind him. \"Now to use my new toys!\" Vegeta laughed as he looked down at the four of them.</span></div></div>",

His collosal body was able to be seen from miles around striking fear in the hearts of everyone who saw him and turning a few people on in spite of themselves. Once a normal person's mind could wrap around the immensity of such a being the eye naturally fell to the cluster of giants at his massive toes. Each of these giants were also fantastic beings to look at all the men with strange tails that mystified the populace except for those who remembered the sayjins. Vegeta knew he was being watched and adored the attention. He would make it known to the whole world who was running the show now. But before he could do that he had to destroy that last of the opposition the world possessed. He lifted her god like arm into the air and summoned a massive ki ball in his palm. It grew to the size of his fist (nearly the size of a city) and exploded into millions of smaller ki blasts that flew around the world decimating every army base or base of resistance that could pose any kind of annoyance. Destruction was swift and brutal for them their bodies vaporized along with the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Furry watched all of this in horror. He knew his time as ruler of the Earth was over. There was no way he could oppose this threat. No one could blame him however, as no one else in the Universe stood a chance against the titantic prince. He sat behind his desk and quietly awaited his death. He knew he wouldn't be spared and he was prepared to die with dignity. He looked somberly out the window as the bright golden light of a ki blast illuminated the panes. He sighed and closed his eyes as his body and the entire building was vaporized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned animalistically as he watched these explosions appear all over the world. He turned to find a place to proclaim to the entire populace that he was the new ruler of Earth and that \"Earth\" was no longer the planets name.

The four Saiyans watched as Mirai began to grow in size. Mirai moaned in ectasy as he felt the power enter him. His muscles bulged as power enterd them. His body grew in height as Vegeta placed his son down on the ground. His body was soon half as big as his farther, then it went up even higher. Finally his growth stopped as soon as he was his farthers size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"DAD?\" Mirai asked as he looked around the region and then down at Gohan. \"WHY DID YOU MAKE ME AS BIG AS YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"BECAUSE, YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BROTHER ARE GOING TO HELP ME RULE THE UNIVERSE ONCE HIM AND HIS TOY GOTEN COME OF AGE.

It wouldn't take long to find the dragonballs and make his wishes so he grabbed Goku and Bulma into his fist and said, \"I'm going to go have some fun with my toys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai grinned and said, \"Then so will I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather and son grinned at each other in primal pleasure then turned and went their seperate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grabbed Bulma and shoved her into his hair, deep down. Once she touched his scalp he twisted her until she was trapped, her mouth covered. He'd been with her enough times over the years. He wanted to concentrate on the new meat. Goku noted the look of lust in Vegeta's eyes and began to worry even more. This wasn't going to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai and Gohan had found a nice quiet place to be along. Being so huge, Mirai covered a lot of distance sitting down, so he couldn't help but be near a village or two. His massive left foot was sitting just feet away from a village. All the inhabitants prayed they wouldn't be killed. Mirai was already hard from having ascended to godhood so quickly. He dropped Gohan onto his dick and said, \"I got you off in the woods Gohan. Now its your turn to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan laughed and said, \"Gladly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and jumped up hugging the huge piece of meat as best he could. Mirai felt a shock of pleasure race through him as Gohan began to rub his hot, hard little body all over his cock. His hands dug into the dirt, raising small mountains of soil that caused a landslide in a nearby village. Gohan shimmied his way up the tower until he was at the head. He rubbed the hot tight flesh and then began to lick it. He licked with vigor, spreading his saliva all along the cockhead. A spurt of precum dribbled from Mirai's slit and Gohan spread it around, tasting it and enjoying it. With this new lube he brought himself to kneel on the dickhead and crawled over to the slit. Mirai was breathing heavily in pleasure as Gohan rubbed all around it, before dipping his arms in and rubbing the smooth walls of his urethra. This was too much for Mirai. He screamed in ecstacy and came, the white flood launching high into the air, splashing over Mirai's abs and chest, covering Gohan and flooding a the village by his foot. Mirai collapsed on his back, breathing hard. He brought Gohan up to his chest and held him feeling tired and satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned as heard Mirai's screams of pleasure. He was ready to have his own fun now. He dropped Goku onto his dick and said, \"You know what to do Kakarot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and turned to the tower of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's so big!' was all Goku could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though responding to his thoughts, the dick began to grow larger! Goku stepped back as he watched the dick expand. Vegeta laughed and said, \"I can change the size of any part of my or anyone else's body. The longer you hesitate, the better the chance I'll shrink you until you're a flea living on your god's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku didn't like the idea of pleasuring Vegeta but he liked the idea of living forever on his body even less! He quickly began to rub the giant cock with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely feel that Kakarot!\" Vegeta taunted him. \"You're going to have to try harder than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Goku flew to the dick head and began to rub it all over. Vegeta felt the sharp pangs of pleasure and moaned in pleasure. His deep moans could be heard for miles around causing the citizens of the cities to panic and spread the word faster. Goku had managed to draw out the precum and advanced on the slit. Goku bent over until half his body was inside Vegeta's slit and went to town, rubbing, licking, and tickling the urethra until even Vegeta was screaming in primal lust. Vegeta came explosively, launching Goku into the air to be plastered to Vegeta's abs. Vegeta still had some life left in him and laughed at Goku's exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you're done yet Kakarot. I'm ready for another round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku moaned in sorrow already disliking this new existence.</span></div></div>",

Proclaiming their will across the world, Mankind built small, miniature castles in honor and fear of these gods. Vegeta laughed as he made both castles grow in size. Soon a castle that stood 6 miles how engulfed the surrounding land. As he transformed them, furniture, art, armor, and carpet filled the castle magically. Another sign of Vegeta's power. As he finished the first one, Vegeta did another castle across the world, this one for his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Farther and Son enjoyed their new empire. Vegeta sat upon a mighty throne, pure gold and silver made up the throne of this evil god. Vegeta laughed as he sat down upon the Saiyan throne to rule his empire. Bulma had her own throne built and even though she hated her husband for what he's doing, she couldn't help but feel a strong desire for his giant body. Goku had a throne built with chains that prevented him from escaping, forcing him to be Vegeta's immortal slave and toy. And as the years went by, he even started to like being a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile Mirai also sat upon his own throne, with Gohan having a smaller throne built upon his own. While Goku and Vegeta despised one another, Mirai and Gohan ruled over the land around them equally with terror and fear. Trunks was given his own, massive castle alongside Mirai and Vegeta's castle. Though Vegeta told his son and his future toy Goten(who like the idea of being Trunks toy) that when he was 19 and Goten 18, both would be grown to adequate sizes. Meaning Trunks at 5000ft. and Goten 50ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventaully even those two grew old enough that Vegeta finally made them huge. And Trunks ruled his own kingdom with his loving Goten. But before these events took place, Vegeta had assigned the Warriors of Earth to hunt down the dragon balls. Though they didn't wish too, they were scared of being eaten or tortured like many of Vegetas other prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Krillin, Tien, and Yamcha traveled the world. The three of them gathering the dragonballs. They travelled to the frozen wastelands, the mountains, hidden caves, cities, and even ruins. Finally after 4 years they found all Seven Dragonballs. Once they had brough them back, Vegeta honored them by shrinking them to 5 inches and giving them to his loyal male followers(Except for Krillin, his wife happily took him and treats him like his only reason to live is to be a dildo. Not that he's complaining).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, after Vegeta had gathered all seven dragonballs, he brought his sons and their toys to his castle to begin the new age of Saiyans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He stood before his sons, Goku and Bulma were wrapped up in his tail. Gohan layed snuggled into Mirai's chest as Mirai cradled him. And Goten layed in Trunks hair, watching from above his loves head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sons!\" Vegeta said to them. \"The Time has come! I will consume the dragonballs in order to gain the power to make everyone into Saiyans! Then I shall use my power to keep the planet sufficient with heat and light to survive as I use the planet to travel the universe. Then we shall move from planet to planet, turning every world I do not wish to transform into Saiyans into a battlefield for my children. But before then, we must perform the ceremony of power!\" Vegeta said with lust as he grabbed his wife and Goku from his tail. He looked down on them with a look of hunger</span></div></div>",

As each one entered his stomach it combined with his body as the ray had. There was a massive rumbling from Vegeta's body as the power of the magical artifacts increased his already godly power. His sons backed away as they saw Vegeta start to grow larger! Vegeta dropped his two toys and teleported out of the castle. Goku caught Bulma and landed them both safely on the ground. They didn't even try to think of escaping. Even with Vegeta gone Trunks and Mirai were still there and could easily stop them. Not to mention they didn't really want to leave anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the deep reaches of space Vegeta grew larger and larger, his body growing even more impossibly muscular until the Earth was dwarfed by his massive size. He grinned as he saw the tiny blue dot that had been the Earth hovering around his navel. He exerted control and shrunk himself down until the Earth was the size of an apple to him. He reached out his hand and held it over the Earth. Waves of energy moved down his hand and covered the Earth. The citizens changed from screaming Earthlings to cheering Saiyans. Tails erupted around the Earth like a disease and the newly created Saiyans laughed as they realized the rebirth of their race at the expense of their previous one. Vegeta then used his other hand to create an atmosphere around the Earth that would never run out as well as a light source that shone from the planet itself that would always provide light and warmth. He then used both hands and exerted the most force he had yet utilized and gave the Earth the ability to move throughout space like a gigantic battleship. Since the dragonballs were now a part of his very body Vegeta had unlimited wishes. And since he was now considered the creator of the dragonballs he could grant any wish he wanted giving him the powers of a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving accomplished his task, Vegeta shrank back to his normal 5000 foot height and teleported back to his palace. He swept up Bulma and Goku and said, \"It's done. The Earth is now entirely populated by Saiyans and New Vegeta is a mobile self sustaining battleship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone present cheered at the success of their mission. Bulma admired her new blue tail. She'd always wondered what it would be like to have one.</span></div></div>",

No longer was it Earth, rather New Vegeta, named after their god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny doubters about Vegeta's god hood were quickly swayed the day the world watched as the hand larger than the planet covered it, and a light bathed the world from it, causing new life to grow, and a new race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point on, everybody worshipped their god. The greatest honour in the world was reserved for a select few, and that was to bow before Vegeta and be allowed to kiss his gigantic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world travelled through the galaxy where Vegeta dictated, spreading his message to the masses. It was a simple message. Worship him and no other god, for none deserve to be called gods next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes Vegeta wouldn't want a planet converted, and he would take his sons in a massive rampage as they crushed people and cities like bugs beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor since they were the offspring of god, Trunks and Mirai were worshipped as gods. Both of them enjoyed this, as they enjoyed being young, but also powerful enough to have worlds at or beneath their feet. The only person they served was Vegeta, who was the unquestionable god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in a while, to make sure they knew their place, Vegeta would shrink both boys tiny, where they would spend the day worshipping him, treated like slaves. This kept the gods from becoming too complacent, and reminded them that everyone, including them were ants beneath Vegeta's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir main task would be foot cleaning. Each was given one foot, and they had to clean them completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good for Vegeta. Several times he decided to convert another planet. Each time he expanded larger than the planet and covered it with his hands as he converted the screaming inhabitants to worshipping Sayians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he grew much larger and went on a rampage through space, crushing planets and stars with his fingers and feet. On that time he used his god powers to shrink an entire solar system down and trap it in his crotch. The idea of an entire solar system of bugs worshipping him from his balls was exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter each journey, he always shrunk back to his regular size.<br>\r\nTrunks kept begging to be allowed to have a planet, so once time when Vegeta went out, he enlarged Trunks as well. The two giants floated along until they came across a planet. Vegeta promptly got Trunks to pick it up. Then he shrunk both Trunks and the planet down until he was his normal size. Picking him up he carried Trunks and his planet home where they returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was easy for Vegeta. He had ultimate power, he could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes he wondered about pushing the limits of what he could grow to, but never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you have everything, what else do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, he was happy being with Mirai but he was tired of always being the little one doing all the work. More often than not, Mirai forced him to do things to him instead Mirai doing things for Gohan. He also didn't like the way he was starting to be treated: like a toy and not like a partner. The more Gohan thought about it, the more he realized where it all stemmed. From Vegeta. Ever since this whole thing had started, Vegeta had done things the way he wanted them done and Trunks and Mirai had just got lucky he wasn't being a total ass. Finally Gohan came to a conclusion. He had to find some way to get the power from Vegeta. He mulled ideas over but couldn't think of anything. The ray gun had merged with Vegeta's body as well as the dragon balls. No one could get them out. Then he got an idea. Vegeta had control over the dragon balls and the ray. That's what made him so powerful. But he still had the dragon balls. In theory, Gohan could still possible make a wish on the dragon balls and take Vegeta's power from him in order to create a more fitting ruling. A more just empire with him at the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this could be dangerous. He might need help. So after Mirai fell asleep that night, Gohan flew off and into Trunk's room. Goten was laying on his chest, asleep. He woke him up and said, \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten sleepily did so until they were in the hallway. It was lucky that Trunks had stayed over at Mirai's palace. They'd have to move fast to make it to Vegeta's palace before he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Gohan?\" Goten asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick of being in this position. Aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you tired of Trunks always forcing you to do all the work? When was the last time you relaxed and he did something for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten thought about it and said, \"Probably over a year by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're even worse off then me!\" Gohan said angrily. \"I'm going to go to Vegeta's palace and take the power from him. Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do expect to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Vegeta absorbed the dragon balls, he should be, in theory, a living source of dragon ball magic. If we make a wish while he's asleep, we might be able to take the power from him. Then we would be the giants and they would worship us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten grinned as he imagined that. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan smiled and said, \"Then let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both flew out of the palace and sped off as fast as possible to Vegeta's palace. They managed to get there a few hours before dawn. They quietly flew into Vegeta's bedroom. He was asleep, the covers thrown off to reveal Goku asleep as well, only tangled in Vegeta's pubic hair. The two boys flew over to Vegeta and took a deep breath to make their wish hoping it would work.</span></div></div>",

He was sure Goten would have done the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head he formed the wish: \"I wish I had all of Vegeta's powers and he was in my position now.

Goten looked like he was ready to run at any second. Then, Vegeta's body glowed gold and Gohan's glowed gold as well. Gohan felt a sudden pressure as Vegeta's powers filled him to the brim. Gritting his teeth he controlled his growth and stopped when he was Vegeta's height, 5000 feet. Goten looked dissapointed at first when he didn't grow but brushed it off. Having Gohan a giant was better than Vegeta at least. Then Gohan was suddenly lying down in the bed. He looked down at his pubic hair and was amused to see his small father asleep, tangled in his hairs. Vegeta and himself had truly switched all places. Gohan then felt the power of the dragonballs flow through him and it took all of his willpower to avoid growing larger than the planet. In the other two palaces Mirai and Trunks shrunk in their beds until they were only thirty feet tall, half of Goten's sixty feet. And last but not least, Vegeta shrunk from his 5000 foot height all the way down to his normal five foot four inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this had happened while he was still asleep. Gohan flung the covers back and untangled his father, holding him in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goten, pick up Vegeta. We're going back to where Mirai and Trunks are. I've got a new law to lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten grabbed Vegeta and then climbed into Gohan's hand. Using Instant Transmission, Gohan appeared back inside Mirai's palace. He scooped him up and then did the same with Trunks. He placed them all down on a table and stood before them. Goten couldn't help but admire his collosal brother. The table's surface was level with his perfect abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up!\" Gohan yelled in a commanding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly everyone woke up. Mirai and Trunks looked around confused. Trunks gaped up at the now bigger Goten and Goku's mouth dropped open as he saw the tiny Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three members of Vegeta's family all had the same question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S GOING ON?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up!\" Gohan said. \"I've taken over as god of New Vegeta! And since I'm the new god, you and every other saiyan are under my control! But I intend to be just and not cruel like Vegeta was! No longer will this planet be called New Vegeta, but Planet Gohan! If you all do as I say, then everything will get on okay. But the minute any one of you disobeys me, I'll inflict size changing punishment on you. That includes shrinking you down to the size of a flea living on my body forever to enlarging myself to even greater sizes and crushing you completely. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was grumbling from the fallen rulers of the planet and the empire, but what could they do? They agreed. Gohan grinned and said, \"Good. Then my dad and Goten will inherit the palaces where Mirai and Trunks lived and I will move into the palace Vegeta had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all moved and thus started a new reign on Planet Gohan.</span></div></div>",

Feeling happy, but exhausted, (and also very, very relieved) Gohan sat down on his throne and smiled down at his tiny lover. Mirai was still sulking and Gohan said, \"I did this for everyone's good you know.\" Gohan said. \"You were starting to treat me like a toy and not an equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a lot of years you were so small it was hard not to think of you as a toy.\" Mirai admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you had had been more sincere then you wouldn't be in this position. But you don't have to worry. I was serious when I said I would be just. I don't intend to chain you up and force you to pleasure me or anything. But before all the bad blood between us can be forgiven, you have to do something for me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai looked apprehensive as he asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan smiled and said, \"Just give me a foot rub. It's been a long night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai suddenly had a flash from a few weeks ago. He had forced Gohan to rub his feet after he had gone out on a bout of planet destroying. After this flash more and more images came into his head and he realized just how poorly he had been treating Gohan without realizing it. Feeling bad, he quickly got to work rubbing his god's feet. Gohan sighed and leaned back his arms dangling on either side of his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gohan was relaxing, Goten was having some troubles. Even though he was twice Trunks size, Trunks had been stubborn and uncooperative. He was angry at Goten for helping Gohan overthrow him and his family and was refusing to do anything with Goten. In fact, he was sitting on his bed, staring at the wall, giving Goten the coldest shoulder he could manage. Goten, finally getting frustrated with him, turned to leave. He flew down the hall until he got to the throne room. He landed at Gohan's feet, a little nervous about how he should approach him. Sure, they were brothers, but Gohan had the powers of a god now. Who knows what sort of thoughts are running through his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten looked around and saw Mirai rubbing the left foot. He was working so hard, he didn't even notice Goten arriving. Goten looked up at his brother's face and yelled out, \"Gohan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan didn't seem to hear him. Not wanting to get too close, Goten flew up to Gohan's abs and landed there. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, \"Gohan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. His heart beating fast, Goten flew up to Gohan's chest and yelled out as loud as he could, \"GOHAN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan's head snapped up and he stared down at his brother. Goten stepped back, worried that he had offended Gohan. But his fears were unfounded as Gohan smiled and said, \"What's wrong Goten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten, feeling reassured, said, \"I'm having some trouble with Trunks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan frowned and said, \"Really? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten explained how Trunks blamed him for the recent events and how he was completely ignoring him. Gohan nodded occasionally as Goten recounted this story. When Goten was done, Gohan said, \"So how do you want me to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten glanced down at Mirai and said, \"I noticed that Mirai seemed to understand our reasons and had forgiven you. I think it's because you're so much bigger than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded. He thought so too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was wondering if you could make me your size. Just temporarily so I can explain everything to Trunks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan thought about this. He did enjoy being the only huge saiyan, no use lieing about that. But Goten had helped him overthrow Vegeta and shift leadership. He pondered what he should do...</span></div></div>",

He smiled at Goten and said, \"Sure, I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten's face broke open in a smile and he said, \"Really? Thanks a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan grinned and said, \"But Trunks is a little more stubborn than Mirai, so I'll have to make you a little bigger than my size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten started to look even more excited. Gohan knew there was no danger in this. If Goten tried to dispose of him, he would be shrunken down faster than he would know. And then a punishment would have to be enacted. But he knew Goten wasn't about to try anything stupid like that. Coming to him to ask for a request proved his loyalty. So Gohan concentrated on making Goten larger. He watched happily as his brother flew down to the ground to make room for his growth. Quickly Goten reached his brother's size of 5000 feet and continued growing. His muscles bulged and swelled with power as he continued to enlarge. His head pressed up against the ceiling when the growth finally stopped. Goten grinned and looked himself over, happy with the results. Gohan was only as tall as his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. That should be enough to get Trunks to listen to you!\" Gohan said. \"When you're done, come back to me and I'll shrink you back down to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten quickly agreed and left to go back to his room. As he moved through the palace Gohan enlarged doorways and hallways and Goten's room when he finally arrived there. Trunks was shocked as the bed he was sitting on suddenly swelled to super sized proportions and turned around to see the massive Goten walking towards him. He felt his heart beat faster as he realized he was in trouble. Goten sat down on the bed and picked Trunks up, bringing him to his face. As calmly as he could Goten explained his feelings for overthrowing Vegeta. He told Trunks how he was tired of doing all the work in their relationship, how Trunks had forced him to do menial things like rub his feet, be used as a sponge, being knocked around inside his mouth, and the lists went on. Trunks listened to it all and started to feel guilty. He had done all those things to Goten and here Goten was willing to let it all go just so Trunks would talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Goten.\" Trunks said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I forgive you.\" Goten said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks grinned up at him and said, \"Guess it's my turn to do stuff for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten grinned and said, \"If you insist!\"</span></div></div>",

Vegeta was chained around Goku's neck like a necklace looking disgruntled.

He took a deep breath and began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of New Vegeta!\" He roared. \"There has been a change of control!

He looked in surprise at the speck like galaxy, glittering innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the people in the galaxy the whole experience had been strange. At first they had seen a massive foot come down and crush a continent. This shocked everyone into remembering that no matter how far away Vegeta might appear to be, he was always there to punish those guilty of crimes against him. Then a shadow had been cast over the planet and a massive power level was sensed. It gave everyone a headache at first, but became more bearable the longer they endured it. Then they felt the entire galaxy rumble and tip over and over until they were in a very dark and very warm place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Trunks asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you sense it? Dad's power level is all around us. Wherever we are, it's near dad.\" Mirai explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they continued to roam about the galaxy taking over planets, prepared to take over the entire galaxy for Vegeta when he came back. If he ever came back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in space, Vegeta grabbed Goku and said, \"You're going to stay tiny, but you'll never be small enough to leave my sight. When I want you to, you'll do whatever I say, whether it's to talk about my conquests, pleasure me, or entertain me. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded, feeling privledged that Vegeta had allowed him and him alone to journey with him. He watched as Vegeta started to expand again. At first he could easily make out his whole body, but as he continued to expand faster and faster, more and more of his body was lost to him. Eventually, the only thing he could see was Vegeta's massive godly abs. Then Vegeta stopped growing and Goku quickly caught up until he was his regular tiny size compared to Vegeta. Vegeta had someting held in his fingers and he handed it to Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a galaxy. Keep it under your foreskin until I have time to deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku obediently did so. It felt strange to know he had an entire galaxy under his foreskin, but he would be lieing if he said he didn't enjoy it.</span></div></div>",

Goku sat cross legged and said, \"How big are you planning on growing anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big as I can!\" Vegeta said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku thought about this and said, \"Any particular reason why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned and said, \"Because the Universe needs to know who is the true god in this life!

He didn't want Goku to start going off on some kind of tangent explaining the greater good in the world and how you should protect and not control through intimidation. So he grabbed Goku and started to, almost absently, rub him up and down his dick. Feeling the tiny body there, it didn't take long for it to get hard. Vegeta growled in pleasure as he felt his dick stiffen more and more. He dropped Goku at the base of the tower and started to shrink him. Goku could only watch in amazement as Vegeta's meat pole towered higher and higher until the head was lost to sight. And still higher it grew as Goku became smaller and smaller. Vegeta searched the area around his dick and saw that Goku had shrunk out of sight. No matter. He could still sense his power level. He continued to shrink him, wanting him to see how insignificant he truly was against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Goku's perspective, he lost sight of the dick as a whole completely. Looking to the left or right he saw it simply going on forever. Looking up, it went on forever as well. Looking behind him, the rest of Vegeta's body was obscured by a thick tangle of pubic hair. Goku was in awe of all of this. He was starting to appreciate the kind of control Vegeta had over him.</span></div></div>",

He stretched his body out, his hands questing all around him until he felt another galaxy. Using his enhanced senses he gazed into the tiny speck and looked to see how many planets were in it. A dissapointing number. Only a dozen planets in the whole galaxy. There wouldn't even be a point converting this useless speck of dust. Vegeta let go of the speck and rose above it until his foot was hovering over it. He brought down his foot and felt the small droplet of a galaxy be completely destroyed by his massive foot. He laughed at it's feeble structure and continued hunting for more galaxies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Goku had leaned against the dick and was waiting to see what would happen next. He couldn't very well escape from Vegeta's body as it would take days to move even a fraction of the way up Vegeta's dick and out of the pubic planet. He knew Vegeta would remember he was here eventually and then he would grow him back to a more viewable size. Suddenly Goku saw a huge shining entity falling towards him. Goku flew out of the way as another galaxy fell down to Vegeta's scrotum. To Vegeta, it was no doubt a speck, but to Goku it was over thirty times his size. But he couldn't see individual planets in it so he was still pretty big. Suddenly, he heard Vegeta's voice rumble from above, \"Oops, looks like I dropped one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku fell to his back as he saw the unbelievably huge fingers of Vegeta descend to retrieve the galaxy. Goku was right. The galaxy was barely a speck to Vegeta who had trouble picking it up. Goku knew that Vegeta was putting that galaxy with the Milky Way under his foreskin. As he thought of the Milky Way, he wondered how his sons were getting on. He wondered if anyone in the Milky Way actually knew what had happened and where they were now living. No doubt some people would have trouble comprehending the situation. Goku was having some trouble believing it himself. But he had seen it. Hell, he had a galaxy under his own foreskin! He pulled back his foreskin and smiled down at the small shining speck. It was nice to be able to protect so many people. Vegeta would eventually convert the people in the galaxy and then they wouldn't need protection. But for now Goku was happy to keep them so close.</span></div></div>",

But as he flew Vegeta growled angrily. Being so small had even made his flying speed almost insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Yes! He hasn't noticed me!' Vegeta thought as he was almost past Goku's body. That's when Goku turned around, face to face with the prince. \"Oh crap!\" Vegeta gasped as Goku grabbed him faster than he could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What in the world are you?\" Goku said as he watched the small man. Even though he had seen it for a second, Goku saw that it was flying strangely. Looking closely, Goku gasped. \"Vegeta!?\" Goku said as he saw who the small man was. \"What happend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I came in here to find my wife, then I touched it and shrunk myself when it was activated.\" Vegeta told him as he was held in his hand. \"Now let me go!\" Vegeta demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thinking about it, Goku looked down and said \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And why not!?\" Vegeta spat at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because I was thinking of making you normal size. I figured i'd go take you to your wife.\" Goku told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the first moments since this happend, Vegeta was actually happy. Soon he'll be free of this mess. \"Well then lets go!\" Vegeta said as Goku got up and left, flying towards Capsule Corps Main Office.</span></div></div>",

He put up with it only becuase he knew he'd be normal sized soon and this nightmare would end! Goku came to a sudden stop outside Bulma's door and knocked. Bulma opened the door wearing a pleasant suit-skirt and carrying a briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Goku, you came!\" Bulma said. \"I'm really sorry, but I don't have time to show you my latest invention. The meeting was earlier then I thought it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled and said, \"I think I know what your invention does.\" and with that, he whipped out the tiny Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma gasped and leaned closer to him. \"Vegeta? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled and shouted, \"What the hell do you think happened woman?!?!? Your damn invention shrunk me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma stood up, hands on her hips, and hmmphed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still rude as always! You're not exactly in a position to be saying things like that to me! I'm the only one who can turn you back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta realized this and stopped struggling in Goku's grip. Goku uncurled his fist and Vegeta stood calmly on the center of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better!\" Bulma said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we unshrink him?\" Goku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Bulma thought about it. She could easily reverse the setting on the machine and use it to unshrink Vegeta, ending this whole thing. But then again, why should she? Vegeta had always been rude, obnoxious, egotistical, and almost downright abusive. He'd never hit her or anything of course. If he had, she wouldn't have put up with him for so long. There was genuine love in their relationship. But could she really pass up an oppurtunity like this? No. No she couldn't. She grabbed Vegeta in her fist and said, \"Why don't we keep him like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked shocked and Vegeta shouted out, \"WHAT?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it! Haven't you always wanted to get back at Vegeta for the things he's done to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo...\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma sweatdropped. Goku was too forgiving sometimes. \"Well, don't you think it would be more fun to keep Vegeta like this? Just for a little while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down at Vegeta who glared daggers back at him. He turned back to Bulma and said, \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta felt a doom cloud appear over his head. This wasn't going to be good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Bulma thrust the tiny man into Goku's hands. \"I've got a meeting to get to! You can have him for the hours I'm gone, but I want him when I get back, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and Bulma ran downstairs and out the door. Goku smiled down at Vegeta and Vegeta felt a shiver creep down his spine.</span></div></div>",

Yes I know they wanted the results. But they'll have to wait a week and a half before they see them. Understand? Good.\" Bulma said as she hanged up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking over at Goku, she smiled. \"Ya know. I have the machine on me.

She carefully covered the keypad and typed in a complicated sounding code. The wall slid open and Bulma quickly pulled Goku inside and closed the door. Goku and Vegeta's mouths dropped open at the room. It was gigantic! It had to be at least twenty-five by twenty-five feet in dimension and a huge bed was in the center. It looked like four people could fit on it! It was totally spacious and the walls were painted with imagery of the sky. It was a perfectly soothing place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the best part is,\" Bulma said, \"is that I you can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button a remote control and the walls and ceiling changed to a different image.

Every button hid a convience that proved Bulma could hold up in here for months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma threw out a capsule and the machine appeared in a \"POP\" and a puff of smoke. She turned the dial from S to G and turned the second dial to 2x.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now stand over there.\" She said to Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku quickly moved to where Bulma was pointing, after setting Vegeta aside, under a small glass cup, and Bulma soon joined him. She had set a timer on the machine and soon a golden beam enveloped both of them. Slowly they began to grow larger and larger. Bulma's suit-skirt got shorter and shorter, the buttons on the blouse popping off as she grew taller. Her skirt didn't last long and soon split in half while her panythose ripped. Her feet were in agony in suddenly tiny shoes. She quickly got them off and sighed as the rest of her constricting clothing split off of her leaving her in an extremely tight pair of bra and panties. Being five foot six before the growth, she was now eleven feet two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's growth was even more impressive. His clothes were baggier so they took awhile to fill up, but soon he was looking like a man trying to wear his son's clothes. His pants ripped down the center and fell off revealing his pumped up legs followed by his boots as it massive feet burst them. His undershirt quickly shredded under his giant pecs and his gi top came next, leaving him in nothing but a pair of tight, tight briefs. Being six foot two before the growth, Goku was now an impressive twelve foot four inches tall, a foot and two inches taller than Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta gaped in horror.

Sliding his hands up and down, he was admiring his new body and all the power that seemed to surge within him. That's when he noticed Bulma's body. Big and powerful muscles feeled her arms and legs. A toned six pack had formed on her stomach, long flowing blue hair, a large round butt, and a set of perfect breasts that could make other women jealous. And years seemed to have been taken off by the transformation. She looked at least 21! \"Bulma! I haven't seen a women as beautiful and young as you in a long time.\" Goku said as he moved closer to her, a urge he had never felt for anybody other than his wife coursing through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'What the!?' Vegeta thought as he heard their conversations. While he was turned on by a Amazon for a wife, the fact they were acting differently wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really?\" Bulma asked as she pressed a button on the remote. A mirror had appeared behind Goku and showed her how young and sexy she looked. \"Oh my! I do look younger!\" Bulma said happily as she looked up into Goku's eyes. She slowly looked up and down his body, licking her lips at the sight. Especially the large bulge in those tight straining briefs. She also moved closer to Goku and wrapped her arms around his sides. \"I think your hot as well!\" Bulma purred as she closed the space between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'When I get bigger she is so going to pay for that!' Vegeta growled as he looked at them embrace. 'And he is going under my foot for doing my wife in front of me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? I thought you didn't like younger guys.\" Goku said as he brought his lips to hers. His arms wrapped around her as they kissed passionately. They slowly kissed as they both began to take off the others clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, things change as you get older.\" Bulma said seductively as she left the kiss to pull of his briefs, his erection stood proudly.

Showing her wet pussy. \"Ready for me?\" Goku said hungrily as he  brought her into his arms. Bringing her over to the bed.

He landed face first and quickly pulled his head back to get a breath of fresh air. He was quickly forced back down as Goku's dick pressed into his back. Vegeta could feel the intense heat radiating from Goku's body and felt himself getting pushed deeper inot his wife. Bulma gasped as she felt not only Goku's mammoth meat entering her, but also Vegeta. She drew Goku in closer and Goku slowly but surely began to pump. Bulma was no virgin and eagerly accepted Goku deep into her. Every bump sent a wave of heat through her body. Vegeta, trapped inside the cave of his wife could barely see the walls of the vagina that were contracting and expading around him. In a careful rythm he felt Goku's meat slam into his back, slamming his whole body against Bulma's insides. In a few minutes he felt Goku's thrusts become faster and the battering ram behind him quickly got wet, juice dribbling down Vegeta's back. Bulma, almost to the point of no return, bucked her hips in cadence with Goku's thrusts, and soon, with a scream, she came explosively. At nearly the same instant Goku released his seed blasted into Bulma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta suddenly felt the \"room\" he was in suddenly fill with liquid. It went into his mouth and up his nose. He choked and coughed, gagging on the excessive amount of cum and womanly fluids. Bulma and Goku lay panting next to each other on the bed, Bulma cuddling up to Goku's firm chest. Vegeta, body feeling tired and beaten, barely managed to drag himself out of Bulma's slimy slit. He collapsed in a small, humiliated, exhausted bundle.</span></div></div>",

DEEPER!\" With that the monster slowly retreated back, taking Vegetas beaten body with him. Then he pushed deeper into Bulma, shoving Vegeta back in. He rammed and was pounded by the fleshy walls of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Faster and faster they went until finally Bulma moaned as her juices gushed forth, entering Vegeta once again. And Goku let out his own moan as his seed entered Bulma. Slowly Gokus monster cock left her entrance, leaving Vegeta to be pushed forth by the juices. Once again in a puddle, Vegeta let out a angry growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All the while, the two Titans layed peacefully as they cuddled together.

Vegeta had been beaten, battered, and bruised by a number of sexual games that Bulma and Goku had thought up, each one getting more rough for him than the one before. He was tired and hoping that this would be over soon. Bulma and Goku lay panting next to each other on the bed, having finished having sex for the second time in the last half hour. Vegeta had been unconcious at the time they started, so they left him out of it. But he'd recovered halfway through and had been treated to a porno starring his wife and his greatest rival. Through it all he stared at the machine that had started this whole thing. Bulma had left it uncapsulized after they discovered Vegeta had trouble activating it. Being so small weakened his ki exponentially to his size. So setting the device to a setting to return him to normal size was next to impossible with Goku and Bulma either always watching, or Vegeta always being close to them. Goku and Bulma both sat up, Bulma checking her watch. She gasped as she realized what time it was! Her two weeks were up! The meeting was in a few hours! She jumped up and ran towards the wall, pressing a button on the remote control. The wall slid open revealing a bathroom. Goku sweatdropped at the speed she ran in and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged and walked over to the fridge, grabbing a whole hell of a lot of food to eat for  breakfast. The fridge was a low grade teleporter so it constantly beamed food in from a cold storage beneath Capsule Corp. Most of the food in the fridge was instant and it didn't take Goku long to make up a huge breakfast. He made sure to make something for Bulma too before she had to get back to work. And of course he left a small portion for Vegeta who grudgingly ate. After about ten minutes had passed, Bulma rushed out of the bathroom, showered, hair dried, and make up applied. She uncapsulized her emergency suit and was about to put it on when she realized that it was just a few sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goku! Set the machine up! I have to shrink myself a little smaller to fit into this skirt suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and quickly set the gun to S, left it at S, and turned it to 2x. Goku aimed the machine at her and fired it. The golden energy enveloped her, turning her back into her normal, small chested, unmuscular self. Goku was dissapointed to see her so small, but knew it was only temporary until she got done with her stupid meeting. She quickly dressed, grabbed her briefcase and said, \"I'll leave the machine here for you Goku! Don't do anything too fun without me!\" And with that she closed the door and ran for the front door. She passed Bunni with a quick, \"Hi Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunni barely had time to wave before her daughter was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wonder where she's been for the last two weeks?\" She giggled and walked towards the kitchen. \"That daughter of mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Bulma's Secret Room, Goku eyed the machine appreciatively. He glanced over at Vegeta a few times as though thinking. Bulma wouldn't be too mad if he had a little fun while she was gone. After all, anything he did now, he could do again with her when she got back.</span></div></div>",

He had nearly been eaten on many occasions for disobeying him. He even feared that because Goku had become drunk in his power that he would eventually 'finish it' once and for all. Even his wife wanted Goku to eat him at times. This wouldn't have happend if he didn't try to dominate them because of his inferiority complex. \"Yes master\" Vegeta mumbled as he started to rub himself against the cock, already feeling pre-cum ooze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aaah!

Goku growled as he shouted \"If your the Prince of Saiyans then I must be the God of Saiyans!\" Goku moaned as he cummed, his massive rod shooting forth like a volcano. It had hit Vegeta so hard that he was sent into the air. Goku fell down onto the bed, letting out a satisfied grunt as Vegeta fell upon Gokus abs, getting covered in even more of the Saiyans seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yuck!\" Vegeta groaned as he tried to get up, but the slippery liquid wouldn't allow him. And so he had rached full height, only to fall face first into more of the sex juices. 'Great! I hate this and what Goku is doing to me! At least my wife entertained me with her sexy body!' Vegeta thought as he layed down, exhausted. But thats when he remembered, she was no longer his wife. Just like Chi-Chi was no longer Goku's. Now it was just a god and goddess that shared Bulma's and Goku's names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bulma had hated every moment of her speech to the board of directors. Telling them about her gun, them disbelieving in her foundings. It had taken every thing in her to keep herself from attacking each of them. After all, she wasn't a powerful, sexy goddess at this size. Just another human building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After what had seemed like hours of debate. The board had decided her device was too dangerous and wanted it kept safe. 'And there's no place safer than with me and Goku.' Bulma thought as she listened to each of them brag about how much better they were than her. Even thought without her family they would lose every drop of money the company ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she headed back home, Bulma watched as the insignificant humans walked by as she drove. She watched their small weak forms entertain each other as they stood proudly in the open. And for some reason, Bulma felt NAKED in her clothes. The freedom that she had gained from her time with Goku was lost to her as of right now. The size, the power, and the sexual attractiveness that would make all men bow to her and her goddess glory. It was in all truths a perfect existance. So why pretend to live a life like these mortals?</span></div></div>",

So instead of heading back to Capsule Corp., she headed over to a nearby real estate agency and went inside. She grabbed a bunch of brochures and began rifling through them, looking for a suitable island to buy for herself and Goku. And Vegeta of course. It didn't take long to find one that was perfect. It was out about sixty miles from Budokai island and totally secluded. If she bought it then the condo project that was planned would be disbanded and they'd have complete privacy. She made the arrangements and left a very happy woman. She had the deed to the island and headed over to King Furry's palace, where most government decisions were made, and managed to make the island a no fly zone as well. No one could find them unless they knew where to look. She quickly headed back for Capsule Corp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Goku had fallen asleep again after his sexcapades with Vegeta. Vegeta, still covered in trace bits of Goku's seed, made sure he was totally out. Then he flew over to the machine and began pressing buttons. This was going to end now!</span></div></div>",

Vegeta thought angrily as he was brought before Gokus face. A cruel and vicious smile crossed Gokus face as he watched the helpless Saiyan try to escape from him again. Vegeta used as much power as he could. Which at this size was nothing more than a bee stinging a normal person. And Goku was twice a persons size so that made it impossible for him to hurt the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goku sneered as he watched the helpless prince fail at what he did best. \"It doesn't matter what you do, soon me or Bulma are going to make sure your life ends eventually. So try all you want to fight me. Soon my goddess will arrive and help me deliver 'justice' upon your worthless self.\" Goku tossed the small Saiyan across the room, laughing as he hit the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Meanwhile----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bulma had finished it. Having left her lover for the past several hours she quickly invented a machine that would make food no matter what it was. She made sure it had a growth device built in to make it and the food grow and no living matter would grow just incase Vegeta got ahold of it. She then travelled to the island and dropped it off. Alongside that she uncapsuled a massive house that could fit in 120ft. Giants. Having finished everything they would need for their new home, Bulma had gone and gathered the Dragon Balls. Seducing Yamcha she easily got him to gather all seven. Then saying it wouldn't work out, she dumped him and brought all seven to Capsule Corp. gardens . She then summoned Shenlong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sky went black as dark clouds covered the skies in each direction. A glow in the shape of a serpents body covered the sky as it tangled in each direction, circling itself like a rolller coaster until a large green dragon stood in the glows spot. \"Who wakes me from my slumber?\" Asked the massive dragon as it looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I, Bulma woke you from your slumber!\" Bulma told the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Speak thy wish.\" The dragon told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish that the island which me and Son Goku live upon can only let us have access to it and those that we wish to come near it. All other living things cannot!\" Bulma told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shenlongs eyes glowed and returned to their original red color as he said \"Your wish has been granted. And the second wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish that no one can unwish that wish.\" Bulma told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His eyes glowed again as he spoke \"Your wish has been granted. So long until next time mortals!\" And with that, his body glowed as it vanished into the balls. The clouds began to disappear as the Dragon Balls turned to stone and flew into the air. They then launched themselves across the world until they were ever needed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now to go tell Goku the good news\" Bulma said as she entered Capsule Corp and quickly went into her special room where Goku was waiting. As she arrived, she saw that her massive lover was holding Vegeta with a almost squeezing force. \"Goku, stop hurting him for a moment please and bring the gun please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure thing love.\" Goku said as he tossed Vegeta across the room. He reached over and grabbed the gun as he walked over to his queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First, I want to tell you that I got us a island.\" Bulma told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"An island, so we can do whatever we want?\" Goku smiled evilly as he turned towards Vegeta. Vegeta nearly fainted as he heard the words 'Whatever we want'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yup! I got us a device that could make food for us and a massive house. Both can grow thanks to the device I put in them.\" Bulma said as Vegeta was thinking 'Dumb woman! That means I can get bigger by using those!' only to hear her finish with \"And its made to grow inorganic matter. That means that 'he' won't grow if he tries it.\" Bulma said as Vegeta fell down defeated. \"I also made a wish from the Dragon Balls so that only us and those we want to come to the island can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thats good! Now we can make you bigger.\" Goku said as he readied the gun to shoot  her. In a instant Bulma was once again her 11ft. Amazon size. Her muscles bulging as her breast bounced freely in their bigger and naked glory. Her ass now a big round object that moved as she walked. Her hair was long and flowing as it fell down her back. She smiled as she wrapped her arms around Gokus sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now Goku all thats left is for us to go to the island. I'm all ready once I do this.\" With a flash the Amazon grabbed Vegeta and was already back at Gokus side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And I have the other thing we need.\" Goku said as he showed the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then lets go!\" Bulma purred as Goku  grabbed his lover into his arms and flew off towards the island.</span></div></div>",

Vegeta covered his mouth as he tried to stop himself from puking all over the place. It seems even his bodies ability to withstand such speeds has diminished along with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon Goku stopped as he arrived a merely 13 seconds later above the set of islands. \"Which one is it Bulma?\" Goku asked her as he looked at all the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's that one.\" Bulma said as she pointed to the largest of all the islands. The trees were at least a towering 200ft. high. The island itself was nearly ten times West Cities size! And the only thing around it was a bunch of smaller islands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's go then.\" Goku said as he flew down in the center of the island. A large mountain stood there. As they landed, Goku gently put his new wife down on the ground as they looked at the scenery. A beautiful massive waterfall that stood a thousand feet high. Massive trees that bloomed with tropical flowers. A large house big enough to fit two 120ft. people in it. \"It's beautiful Bulma! So this is where were going to spend the rest of our lives.\" Goku asked her as he wrapped his arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Goku. And to top it all off all you need to do is press that.\" Bulma said as she pointed tot he gun. Knowing what she meant, Goku aimed the gun at themselves. The gun was set at 10xGr as they began to grow gigantic. Their bodies bursting in size along with the gun and Vegeta. By the time they were done, Gokus muscles were even bigger than they were before, his cock even grew a few more inches(to them) in size to fit this transformation. Bulma also grew bigger breasts and a even nicer ass as her muscles grew in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the time they were done, they were both making out with a normal size Vegeta in their hands. He was whooping at the thought of being normal when he heard these words \"Now that were happy. Lets destroy that.\" Bulma stated as she pointed to the gun. Nodding, Goku easily crushed the gun in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nooooooo!\" Vegeta moaned as he saw them crush it. Now he was stuck here with two real gods! Both of them began to get intimate as they kissed the other passionately. The two 110-120 ft. Gods embraced their new sizes as they began to make love.</span></div></div>",

Go first for what? before he could think of anything, Bulma was down on her knees, her arms stretched out in front of her, like some jungle cat and her face was close to Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen good Vegeta!\" She said. \"Me and Goku decided to have ourselves a little 'hunt' with you.

If she does only Kami knows what will happen to me!\" Vegeta said as he flew down to the ground. Flying into a set of bushes,  Vegeta smirked to himself as he hid inside the vegetation. 'There's no way Bulma will find me here!' Vegeta could hear the rustling sounds of bushes being torn and ripped as Bulma ran through the jungle. Vegeta could hear the sounds becoming louder as his wife came towards his direction of falling. \"She won't be able to find me! I'm too small!\" Vegeta thought aloud as he watched his wife appear from the bushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Since he was in her hand and too preoccupied by what the two of them were doing to notice them, Vegeta saw for the first time how beautiful his wife was at this size. Her once short hair had grown long and curly all the way down to the butt. Her breasts bounced freely as they layed upon her chest, her ass had grown massive and perfect, and she had muscles that could make a female wrestler look like a teenager. He even realized her youth had returned to her, easily making her twenty three years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vegeta had always controlled his feelings and urges through his training. But seeing her new and impressive self in full view made Vegeta get a erection. 'NO! I can't let my urges control me. If they do I'll probably fall into her trap.' Vegeta thought as he saw her begin to act strangely. Bulma purred as she rose to her full height, she pressed both her breasts together, almost as if she was begging someone to come and do her. She moaned as she started to rub them together, she gave a animal like moan as she moved herself to the ground. Vegeta watched with wide eyes and a drooling mouth as he saw her move next to a tree. Sitting next to the tree, Bulma stopped rubbing her breasts together and pressed her fingers against her wet sex. She moaned in ectasy as she slowly rubbed her finger up and down. Vegeta could no longer hold himself, he left the bushes and walked forth. He drew closer and closer to see Bulma. His ex-wife was enjoying herself too much to even notice him move between her legs, standing before the dripping wet sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'This is almost like she was waiting for me to come.' Vegeta thought as he moved closer, thats when he felt something push against him. With a simple bolt of strength the large object pushed Vegeta into his wfies vagina. 'It was a trap!' Vegeta thought in horror. That was why it looked like she was begging for a man. Goku was standing in some other bushes, hidden from Vegetas view as he went up to Bulma. As he moved between her legs, Goku swiftly moved up to Bulma. His cock was standing erect as he pushed it against Vegeta and before he had even known it, Vegeta was inside Bulma. Bulma's finger moved away as they both penetrated her. A smile was on he ectasy filled face as Goku moved up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I want him to be crushed inside me Goku!\" Bulma moaned as Goku began to kiss her, his cock moving in and out of her as they made love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goku nodded as he kissed her. \"Yes my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vegeta groaned as he was pushed against the walls. Something was different. When he was in his wife at 5in. he was beated and batted inside her, but nothing this bad. That's when he remembered what his wife said \"At a smaller or larger size when changed by the gun, the subject becomes invulnerable and is unable to be harmed.\" Remembering those words, Vegeta groaned and said \"Damn them.\" Those were his final words as he felt his wifes walls close around him, crushing him as her juices gushed forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Having cummed, both Goku and Bulma got up. Goku removed his cock and saw that a tiny Vegeta was not coming out. He smiled as he wrapped a  arm around his women. \"He's been crushed just like you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. And now we can travel the world and grab as many little people we want. We can destroy cities, and even have new children at this size.\" Bulma said as she pressed her hands against his chest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The meeting was earlier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled and said, \"I think I know what it does!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Goku pulled out the tiny Vegeta.

You should put a warning on that machine or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma sighed and said, \"Probably.\" She checked her watch. \"I've got a little time.

She fiddled with the controls and said, \"Goku, put Vegeta about three feet from the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku set Vegeta down. Vegeta looked up at the gun as it pointed down at him. Finally this would all be over! Bulma fiddled some more than said, \"Okay! It's ready! Goku, stand back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stood behind the machine and Bulma said, \"Ready? In three, two, one..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button and a beam shot out at Vegeta. Nothing seemed to happen. Suddenly, the machine started to sputter and kick. The beam wavered and shot out stronger blasting Vegeta with a large amount of energy. Finally, the thing shut off, smoking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Looks like some of the bugs aren't quite worked out. I thought I had it too!\" Bulma said looking the machine over. \"I might have to cancel that meeting after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about Vegeta?\" Goku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both rushed over to the slightly smoking form of Vegeta.

In a matter of moments, he was only a half inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" Bulma said frustratedely. \"This thing is so complicated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the machine back up and began to tinker with it again. Goku bent down and peered at the tiny Vegeta. He reached out with both hands and very gently scooped him up. Vegeta attempted to fly away and fired ki blasts at the hands, but Goku didn't even feel the ki blasts and keeping Vegeta from flying away was like trying to keep a firefly cupped in your hands. As long as you kept them close enough together, the bug couldn't escape. Vegeta soon got sick of trying and just sat on Goku's giant palm, waiting for Bulma to finish fixing the machine. Finally, she closed the panel and said, \"Okay, I saw the problem and it was easy enough to fix. I can't believe I missed it before! I'm going to go to my meeting, but I'm going to leave the machine here so that you can fix Vegeta Goku. I don't want to risk it malfunctioning at the meeting. I'll be back in a few hours though. See you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a clipboard on her way out that had the specs for the machine and her notes on creating it before dashing out the door. Goku looked at the machine, then looked thoughtfully down at the shrunken Vegeta. Vegeta looked nervous as he saw that look. He knew that look. It was the look Kakarot got whenever he was excited. He didn't know, nor did he want to know, what Goku was finding exciting about this. He would've started shouting and demanding to be returned to his normal size, but Goku probably wouldn't be able to hear him so well even if he shouted. Goku seemed to come to some kind of internal conclusion because he capsulized the machine and put it in his pocket before using Instant Transmission to disappear from Capsule Corp and reappear inside his own house. Vegeta wasn't expecting that, and was disoriented from the sudden dizzying change of scenery. He wanted badly to start chewing Goku out for this, but he knew it would be no good and kept quiet, conserving his energy for when Goku returned him to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF he returns you to normal size.\" a nasty voice piped up from the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta crushed this voice thouroughly. Goku was a goody two shoes, always doing exactly what was right. He would never keep Vegeta captive against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta became less and less sure as Goku set him down on the nightstand next to his bed and sat down on the bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Vegeta, hear me out for awhile then I'll return you to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta was game if it meant helping him, so he crossed his arms and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a rough couple of years since Goten was born. I've been completely unable to have any kind of sexual relationship with Chi-Chi because if I did I would crush her pelvis and who knows what else. I know you've been experiencing the same problems with Bulma after Trunks was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta would never admit it but it was true. He spent more time masturbating these days then was probably good for you. He didn't feel as bad about it now that Goku admitted having the same problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Chi-Chi left to go visit family hundred of miles away and left me, Goten, and Gohan hear alone. I've been masturbating a lot lately, as you probably figured out already, and I need some kind of relationship with someone that will guarantee I won't hurt my partner. You are the only one strong enough to have that kind of relationship with. And before you say no,\" Goku said loudly, because Vegeta looked ready to protest. \"We don't have to do anything too physical. I'd be happy with a blow job, a hand job, anything, as long as I don't have to do it myself. What do you say? We could do some pretty awesome stuff with this machine here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta briefly imagined a tiny Goku crawling like lice through his pubic hair or licking a nipple bigger than he was or slipping down into a tunnel like cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grinned as he saw Vegeta become hard in seconds. He obviously liked the idea. So Goku quickly figured out the machine and set it to Grow, Bi, and 200X before firing a blast at Vegeta. Instantly, Vegeta began to grow, bigger and bigger, until he was his normal height...and then he kept growing! Up past six feet, seven feet, eight feet and three inches tall! His muscles, already impressive, were ballooned to even greater sizes, his abs reaching a steel cut eight pack. Vegeta flexed his muscles, smirking at his new, bigger body. Goku was grinning as well. He said, \"I thought if you still had any doubts, this would make up for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned animalistically at Goku who licked his lips and said, \"Ready when you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta forcefully pushed Goku onto the bed and went over to the machine. It was almost hand held at his new size, but not quite yet. He fiddled with it and looked at Goku. He could use it right now...but he could also wait for awhile before using it.</span></div></div>",

He was going to repay his peasant for not only returning him to normal size, but improving him, and handing him the key to unlimited power. He grabbed Goku's cock in one fist and began to pump Goku, slowly until it was hard. Goku started breathing heavily as he got harder than he'd been in years. Once it was pointing straight up in the air, swaying slightly, Vegeta lowered his head and took Goku's entire length into his mouth, sucking slightly sending shivers of pleasure through Goku's body. Vegeta's tongue moved all around Goku's dick, covering it in saliva and tasting him fully. He began to suck harder and harder, Goku's breathing getting heavier and faster, his hands grabbing the bedsheets and twisting them, his head thrashing from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to cum!\" He growled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta only smirked around the shaft and continued working it. At the last possible moment he pulled away to avoid getting any of Goku's seed into his mouth. The semen arced up into the air and landed on Goku's abs and a small smattering of drops landed on his chest as well. He just layed there panting for awhile, Vegeta sitting back, smirking. Finally, Goku got up and said, \"I'm going to go clean up. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling slightly and in a state of total bliss, Goku went into the bathroom. Vegeta heard the shower running and walked over to the machine, looking it over. He discovered there was more buttons on there then he had thought. There was the setting to shrink or grow, to make a person Gay, Straight, or Bi, and how many times larger you could make something grow, from 2x to 200x. In addition to that, was a dial that made the machine target a specific body part, a timer that set times for the device to go off, and a switch that shifted the ray from growing a person larger with bigger muscles, to growing a person bigger muscles while growing a little larger. Vegeta toyed with the ideas he could use this thing for. He wasn't about to share it with anyone other than Goku right now. Well, he supposed Gohan could get in on it if he wanted, but he wouldn't allow Goten or Trunks in, mostly because they were just kids. He was thinking about letting Mirai in but remembered Mirai had gone back to the future and planned on staying there for a few years to continue rebuilding and to spend time with new friends and family. So that left him, Goku, and Gohan to play with the device. He heard the shower stop and knew Goku had finished washing himself. He turned the device to shrink, then grow, then back to shrink. He was undecided about how he wanted to do this. He wanted Goku to get him off, but he was a patient man. He could wait for awhile if it meant playing with Goku's body. He had found much more interest in rival since he knew he could be as rough as he wanted to without hurting him. It also helped that the device was set on Bi, making him love men as much as women. Finally, he decided. He set the machine and pointed it at the door. He was going to surprise Goku with a sudden change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vegeta's finger hovered over the button on the ray, waiting for the door to open and Goku to step through. As soon as the door opened, Vegeta pressed the button. Goku, who had been towelling off his hair, looked up and saw the beam racing towards him. Before he could do more than gasp, the ray hit him. The towel around Goku's waist quickly came undone as he started to grow. Vegeta smirked, pleased with his work as Goku's head hit the ceiling and proceeded to grow through it. Vegeta watched appreciatevly as his former rivals body not only grew taller, but thickened with muscle. The abs deepening and making room for an eight pack, his chest, which was already grown out of sight, swelling into orbs of solid muscle. His back tapered out into a wide V shape and his legs swelled into pillars of muscle mass. If Vegeta could see Goku's arms, he'd see the biceps swelling up as though they were connected to helium, only instead of getting pumped up with helium, he was getting pumped up with pure, cut size. Vegeta picked up the ray and jumped out the window as Goku's feet pushed across the room and through the wall. Soon, the entire house lay in ruin and Goku stood a huge sixty two and a half feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was stunned by this sudden change of perspective and fell onto his butt, creating a huge earthquake as he hit the ground. Vegeta was knocked to his feet, but quickly stood back up, flying over to Goku's face. Goku blinked and said, \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned and said, \"Thank me later. Right now, I'm going to give you another trip. Then it'll be my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku instantly got hard again at the thought of tiny Vegeta getting him off. Vegeta turned and said, \"Here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku thought, \"I'm going to be coming soon.\" and laughed. His laughter caused his dick to jiggle and smack Vegeta in the head. Vegeta was knocked into Goku's pubic hairs. The hair was slightly prickly and Vegeta quickly stood up and waded through it to the dick. He wrapped his arms and legs around it and began to climb it. Goku gasped and his fingers twitched, wanting to help Vegeta get him off. But he wasn't about to do that. It would defeat the purpose of having Vegeta use the device. So he bit his lower lip and started bucking his hips in rythm to Vegeta's ascent. Soon, he reached the flaring head and pulled himself on top of it. The skin was hot and tight and Vegeta started rubbing it all over. The precum soon came running out and Vegeta used it as lube, rubbing it all over until his legs and hands were covered in it, but so was Goku's dick head. He slipped and slided over the length of Goku's head until Goku shouted out, \"I'm going to cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis roar was so loud, several nearby birds took off for safer areas. Vegeta gave one last rub around the head before flying away. He only barely made it away clean. As soon as he took off, Goku's cock rumbled and exploded like a volcano for the second time in ten minutes. He fell onto his back, causing another earthquake and panted. He didn't care that he had just cleaned himself and was now covered in his own semen again. He grabbed a nearby tree and managed to scrape it all off. Vegeta found the precum was easy to slough off and was no longer covered in it. Goku sat back up and groped for the device. Vegeta pulled it away and said, \"You can't use it like that, you're not paying attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku knew he was right. He would probably cause a problem if he tried to use the device in his current stat of fuzzy euphoria. Vegeta set the device for some growth of his own and flew it up to Goku. He pointed at the activation button and said, \"All you have to do is point at the ray at me and press this button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and waited until Vegeta was on the ground before pointing the ray and firing. Unfortunately, due to his large fingers, Goku reset the device to something else before firing it at Vegeta.</span></div></div>",

Goku stood up and watched, smilingly as Vegeta approached his height. Goku was preparing to give Vegeta a hand job, finishing with a blowjob and maybe running his tongue over his buffing muscles, paying special attention to his nipples standing erect from the recent sexual escapades. But Vegeta grew past his height and Goku decided Vegeta wanted to tower over him a little before Goku got to work. Vegeta grew, and grew, and grew bigger after that. Goku was up to his knees, then his shins, then his ankles. Goku knew something must've been set wrong as Vegeta's toes rose above him. Goku craned his head back and could only just see Vegeta's head past his enormous dick and bulging muscle mass. Vegeta was as shocked as Goku as he reached his full height of sixteen hundred feet tall. He figured Goku must've screwed something up, but it was to his advantage! He smirked down at the tiny Goku, a giant to normal sized people, and a speck to him. He carefully picked him up and sat down, the rubble of Goku's house undistinguishable at his height. Anyone on Mt. Paozu would be able to see Vegeta's huge upper body towering into the sky. He dropped Goku onto his dick and said, \"Time to repay me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice rumbled down to Goku like thunder who grinned and said, \"With pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku instantly began rubbing all over Vegeta's dick head, using all the energy he could to transmit feelings of pleasure through his god like former rival. But Vegeta was barely feeling it. Goku could tell, as Vegeta's hands were hovering by his erection, itching to bring himself to climax. But he resisted as Goku had, looking for something besides self stimulation. Goku got and idea and ran over to Vegeta's piss slit. He reached down into it and rubbed the sensitive walls of the urethra. Vegeta gasped and rocked forward, his mind suddenly, and sharply focused on the bug between his legs, pleasuring him, forcing feelings through his body he hadn't felt in a long time. Vegeta clenched his teeth, feeling climax coming nearer and nearer. He tried to hold it in as long as he could, partly to prolong the pleasure and partly to last longer than Goku. Finally, he gasped out, \"I'm going to come!\" and then came explosively. Goku had no chance to escape and was caught up in the sticky white explosion. Vegeta came and then came, and then came again, each load bigger than the last until he was covered by a thin slimy film of cum. Goku was plastered onto Vegeta's abs, not far from his belly button, tired and sticky, but pleased he was able to please Vegeta that much. Vegeta unwedged him and brought him to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you could use a bath.\" He said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Goku could puzzle out what Vegeta meant, the saiyan prince tossed Goku into his mouth and began sucking on him like a candy. Goku was tossed around the tongue, getting covered in saliva before being run over Vegeta's huge white teeth. He was brought under the tongue and was pinned as the slimy muscle massaged his back, cleaning off every speck of cum. Vegeta then brought Goku to his lips and spit the tiny saiyan onto his palm, wet, but clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, isn't that better?\" Vegeta said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku only nodded. He was tired. Getting off twice, almost in a row, getting a giant off, and being tongue whipped had taken all the energy out of Goku. He closed his eyes and was soon asleep. Vegeta laid Goku on the ground and picked up the device, fiddling with it as best he could at his giant size. He was going to shrink himself down to a smaller size and then have Goku give him another turn when he woke up. He couldn't really see the machine console so well, but he was almost positive he had the right settings. He turned the beam on himself and fired.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ray was set correctly this time, and Vegeta shrank down until he was one hundred and sixty feet tall. He then noticed he was covered in his own cum and stepped into the nearby lake to clean himself off. The water wasn't very deep, coming only up to his waist, but it was enough. Soon, he was clean and ready for another round of fun with his new sex partner. He walked back over to where Goku was laying down and saw a bug flying around his face. He waved it away then stopped. He was too big for a bug to be bothering him! He looked back at the bug and saw that it was Gohan back home from high school. Vegeta grinned and grabbed the tiny half saiyan in his huge fingers. He brought him to his face and said, \"Hello there bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan struggled in Vegeta's grasp and shouted, \"What's going on here?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta laughed at him and sat down next to Goku, shaking him to wake him up. Finally, Goku opened his eyes and said, \"Already? I barely had any time to rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and saw Vegeta holding Gohan and smiled at him. \"Hey son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?!? What's going on?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's kind of complicated.\" Goku said. \"But don't get the wrong idea! You see, I haven't been able to have sex with your mother for the past few years due to my strength and her lack of an ability to take punishment. So...it's been kind of lonely if you get my meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan groaned. The last thing he wanted to hear about was his parent's sex lives! But Goku just went on with no shame whatsoever, \"Anyway, I was sick of masturbating and when I went over to Capsule Corp. I found Vegeta shrunken really small with Bulma's newest invention. So I proposed to Vegeta that we use the machine to have new and exciting sexual experiences since neither of us can have sex with our wives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta then said, \"It's going to happen to you too, you know kid. Faster with you probably. You might be able to have sex with your little girlfriend for awhile, but eventually you won't be able to do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan thought about that. He had been kind of rough with Videl lately. They hadn't had sex yet, because Videl kept saying she wasn't ready, but maybe they really would be incapable of sex! Then what would he do? He looked up at Vegeta and Goku and admitted this whole thing was pretty hot. He nodded to show he understood and said, \"So who's turn is it right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku cocked a thumb at Vegeta and said, \"He gets another turn, since I just add two in a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta's huge cock twitched and he grinned down at Gohan saying, \"You can join if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked at the stiffening tower before him and thought about that. If it was his father, he would say no way, but with Vegeta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan said, \"Okay, I'll help. On one condition. I want a turn next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta and Goku laughed at that and agreed. They had been planning on allowing Gohan in on their games anway. So Gohan took off all his clothes and Goku dropped him on Vegeta's dick. Gohan started rubbing the head as Goku grabbed the entire shaft and started pumping. Vegeta was in another world, feeling two different, but disntinct pleasures. After a few minutes of rubbing, Goku lowered his head and took Vegeta's shaft in his mouth. Gohan, just before Goku did this, fell off the back of the dick head and landed in the soft hair of Vegeta's pubic hair. He just lay there, breathing hard, feeling Vegeta thrust and buck. Gohan's own cock was hard and pointing. This was a sexual experience the likes of which he never would've expected possible. Finally, Vegeta growled out a warning and Goku moved out of the way as Vegeta cummed into the ground, covering the area around Goku's house. Vegeta fell on his back, panting while Goku fished Gohan out of the pubic hair and set him down next to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn Gohan.\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked the machine over and decided what to do. He could grow bigger than even Goku and Vegeta and have them both get him off...or he could shrink them both and force them to worship like that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After setting the gun Gohan pointed it at the two giants and turned the machine on. Instantly Goku and Vegeta began to shrink smaller and smaller. Soon, they were back to their original size but continued getting smaller. Gohan smiled as he watched them shrink smaller and smaller until they were both around three inches tall. For Goku this was the first time being small. He looked up at Gohan in awe never having seen in his son in this light before. For Vegeta it was nothing new. He simply looked up at Gohan, arms crossed waiting for Gohan to get on with whatever it was he was going to do. Gohan was grinning broadly as he bent down and grabbed both tiny men in his hand. Turning to the machine he looked it over, noticing a button he hadn't seen before. He pressed it and the ray part of the machine turned over and fired at itself, shrinking the machine itself down until it fit in Gohan's hand. He grabbed the machine and looked around for his house. Not seeing it he looked down at Goku and said, \"Dad, what happened to the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku laughed a little and said, \"I kind of destroyed it awhile back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan laughed and said, \"Mom's not going to be too happy about that! I guess we'll just have to go somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta said, \"If you want to do it in a building then just go to Capsule Corp. There's so many rooms in that place there's no way we'll get disturbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan decided that was a good idea. However, he didn't like the idea of Bulma or anyone in her family knowing they were inside. Pulling out the machine he pressed the tiny buttons and set Goku down on the ground. Aiming the machine at him he fired it growing Goku back to his normal size. Gohan grabbed onto his arm and said, \"I thought it would be faster if we just used Instant Transmission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and put two fingers to his forehead, seeking out an energy signature to use. Finding Bulma's, he shifted his perception around her until he found an area with no ki signatures for at least two hundred feet around. He used Instant Transmission and all three saiyans disappeared reappearing inside a huge empty room. Judging by the size of the room, Gohan figured they were in some kind of storage facility. Since there weren't any boxes or anything at all in the room, it was safe to assume this was an abandoned storage facility. He fixed the machine again and shrunk Goku back down to three inches before pulling out a few capsules he had taken out of his clothes before he had stripped. He tossed the capsules and they exploded releasing furniture all around the storage facility. Once the smoke cleared the once abandoned storage facility looked like a fully furnished house with all the standard rooms but without the separating walls. Grabbing Goku and Vegeta, Gohan walked over to the bed and laid down on it. Dropping Goku and Vegeta onto his abs he reached over and dropped the machine inside a drawer. Closing the drawer, he grabbed a key that was on the table the drawer was in and locked it. Goku and Vegeta both watched in shock as Gohan then swallowed the key, a slight bulge traveling down his neck. Gohan grinned at the tiny men and said, \"I'm guessing you two had a lot of time together so to be fair, I'm extending my turn. If you both do exactly what I say I'll let you join me in my mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission? What are you talking about?\" Goku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan laughed and said, \"Don't you realize what we have? A machine that can shrink or grow anyone or anything! The entire world is open to us having fun with it! We can be gods of this world, with entire cities shrunken to fit in our hands, to have a host of slaves to pleasure us in any way we want, to grow huge and be able to crush mountains to demonstrate our power! Don't you want to have some REAL fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta grinned wider as Gohan's speech progressed, clearly happy to go along with that mission. Goku looked a little skeptical. That seemed to be a little extreme...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan patted Goku on the head and said, \"Don't worry dad. I'll give you time to think about it. In the meantime, you're going to service my giant body until I'm satisfied. Do a good job or you'll my personal toys forever. Your fates are connected. If either of you disobeys me or is unsuccessful in one of the tasks I give you then both of you will suffer for it. You got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them nodded, waiting for Gohan's first task. Gohan grinned and said, \"Great! Now then, for your first task I want you to...</span></div></div>",

Goku situated himself by the right foot and started rubbing his hands up and down Gohan's sole. Gohan's foot curled as he felt those tiny hands getting to work on his tired, sore feet. Goku looked over at Vegeta and said, \"Come on Vegeta! Do the other foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta looked over at Gohan's left foot and snorted. The last thing he wanted to do was rub some kids feet like he was a slave. He was the prince of the saiyans. He was not a foot toy. Then he remembered Gohan's words. If he didn't do as Gohan said he would be Gohan's pet forever rather than his equal in domination. He couldn't live with that so he made his way over to the left foot and started rubbing as well. Gohan sighed again as he started relaxing further closing his eyes. As Goku and Vegeta moved from the heel and sole to between the toes Gohan started thinking of other ways he could use his new temporary toys. The size of the room they were in allowed for any number of size changes. He could make himself bigger and have Goku and Vegeta explore his body, he could shrink the two down smaller and have them clean other ares of his body. His ears and nose could do with a good cleaning as well as his belly button. Gohan brought the machine in his hand up to his eyes and looked it over. The machine could increase or decrease overall size, the size of separate body parts, it could make someone more durable to be able to have acid or the like against bare skin and have it have no effect, it could make something more pliable so they couldn't be crushed, it could increase muscle mass, and even raise a person's ki. Gohan grinned as he realized all the different things he could do. And doing it with Goku and Vegeta was just the beginning. There were many people in the city, many people in the country, many people in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan thought these lofty thoughts, Goku continued to work his hands between Gohan's huge toes, cleaning off the occasional spot of dirt. Gohan kept his feet pretty darn clean (no doubt under Chi-Chi's strict command) and the worse part of the rubbing was Gohan's sweat. That was the only thing that smelled either. Vegeta thought it was, even though the work was easy, demeaning and awful. A few minutes later Gohan sat up, pushing his feet over top of the two tiny saiyans and said, \"Good work you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled up at his son from between Gohan's toes while Vegeta glared angrily. Gohan held up the machine and said, \"I've already decided what to do next!\"</span></div></div>",

Vegeta already proved that he doesn't deserve to be an equal to me. So I'd suggest you be more cooperative dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku wasn't sure what to do or say. Gohan had always been a good kid never disobeying either of his parents. Was it possible that he was sick of doing everything everyone told him to do and now wanted to take control for himself? It was possible. That machine seemed like it would be something that would bring out the worst in a person. It was so powerful. One could literally do anything with it. Was Bulma aware of how dangerous this thing was when she built it? Probably not. She no doubt had been blinded by all the good that it could do that she had failed to see the bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku obviously wasn't supposed to say anything to Gohan's last statement as he soon found himself falling directly into Gohan's briefs. Goku looked around and found that he had landed on top of Gohan's enormous penis, his pubes surrounding the base of the enormous organ. It was clear that Gohan kept himself well groomed by the only slight smell of musk and the overall fluffiness of the hair. Goku wasn't given much time to look around as Gohan quickly snapped his underwear shut before zipping his fly and doing the button closed. Smirking, he looked around for Vegeta. He saw him sitting on the floor, the blood wiped clean from his face. Vegeta's nose was in no danger of becoming deformed or not healing properly. He had straightened the bones and now only had to wait for his natural saiyan vitality to heal himself. Gohan wasn't concerned about his wellbeing however. He stomped his foot down in front of the tiny and said, \"Now I just have to decide what I'm going to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and grabbed Vegeta bringing the bug sized man to his face. \"You could've had it all with me and dad you know. But you had to let your anger and pride get the best of you. I never really thought you'd last anyway. I'm surprised you actually rubbed my foot. But now I have to decide what to do with you. You could clean somewhere else on my body. Or maybe I'll shrink you even smaller and drop you into my pants with dad. It's really dark in there and there's no guarantee he'll see you. It could be dangerous. You could even get lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta didn't like the sound of that. His nervousness must've shown on his face because Gohan smiled wider and said, \"Just remember you brought this whole thing on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Gohan decide to do?</span></div></div>",

We eat them ALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks smirked and looked back at the ground. He leaped into the air and crashed down in front of the retreating army. The impact shook the ground, knocking over all the soldiers. The destructive boy crouched down and looked right at the army. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked with a smirk. The soldiers screamed in horror and turned around, only to face Goten's giant boots. The two kids smiled as they continued their feast. Tanks and helicopters were bitten into or devoured in one mouthful. Soldiers could do nothing but look up in fear of the young giants, waiting to be picked up and eaten like popcorn. Some were even unlucky enough to be swallowed alive, dying slowing in the digestive acids. Even the lone soldier who refused to attack the kids met the same fate. After Goten swallowed the General, the two saiyans were stuffed and laid down on the city streets with full bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmh. They were yummy.\" muttered Goten as he licked his lips. Trunks nodded in agreement as he rubbed his stomach, feeling its contents churn and digest.        </span></div></div>",

The ruins of the city were almost completely deserted, but far from silent.

Trunks had gulped down soldiers like candy while goten had preferred to snack on the vehicles more. The black haired boy had challenged himself to swallow cars and helicopters whole, so he could enjoy the weight in his belly. Unfortunately this meant his victims actually survived for a short time in their vehicles and could comprehend their end in a childs gut. Breaking down metal was easy for Goten\u2019s stomach at this size, but the process naturally produced large bubbles of gas resulting in the giant kid emitting loud burps in his sleep. A particually long and deep belch actually shattered the few remaining windows and ripping off fixtures in the stadium he was embracing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few good hours of sleep, Goten was the first to wake up.

Trunks merely rolled over wanting to sleep a little longer, however he was brought sharply back to reality. \u2018FRRRRRRTTTTT\u2019 Goten ripped a growling fart, lifting a cloud of dust around his backside. \u201cAnd I guess we really ate a lot huh\u201d Goten said smiling apologetically. \u201cMan you reek Goten\u201d Trunks said covering his nose with both hands to keep the foul air away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting men and their machines of war had been turned into slurry and sent unceremoniously to the back exit of Gotens anatomy.

He yelled out in surprise and tried to rip it off but it wouldn't go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, where shall we begin?\" Miroku pondered. \"Hmm...Of course! I know! Hey Shippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippo stopped rubbing his arms and looked down at Miroku. Miroku indicated that he should pick him up and Shippo did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know you're feeling strange right now, and I can tell you why. It's a natural part of growing up and is a most wonderful thing! Now, you know how I always entertain ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean womanize!\" Sango shouted up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore her.\" He said simply. \"Well, I do that because I want to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiroku explained his wants to Shippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're feeling the same way! Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I'm going to walk around asking woman to bear my children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Shippo and Miroku slapped their foreheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....Not exactly....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try explaining differently!\" Kagome yelled up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets see....Oh! Those feelings you feel will go away if you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiroku explained urges and how to get rid of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...But I'm too big to do that with anyone.\" Shippo said, somewhat sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. All you have to do is get the shards out of you and you'll return to normal.\" Miroku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could do anything else</span></div></div>",

The demoness was of a giant little girl with grey skin, long blue hair, shining blue eyes, two little antannaes sticking out her forehead, and wearing an oriental robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome stares up to her in sheer terror, \"Um... w... who....who's that?!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiroku looks at her in fear, \"I dont know... but Im sensing a powerful aura around this...

She tilts her head and stares at him in pure curiousity while he struggles to break free!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...SHIPPO!!!

WHY THAT NO GOOD--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAY!\" The woman interupted, turning the book back around. \"You're dead and that's all that matters. Now what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...A demon eh? Usually we just send demons to hell, but you're a strange case. Half demon...performed good deeds...slain hundreds of demons...hmmm...Yes it looks like you've been accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned to the giant gates and inserted a key into a small keyhole near the center. The gates swung open with a melodius chime and the woman held out her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome tired soul. Your resting place awaits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha frowned and stood fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm flattered that you're letting me in, but I can't die yet. We still haven't found the last jewel shard and I haven't gotten revenge on Naraku yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's arm dropped and she said, \"I see. Many innocents may die if Naraku isn't stopped...Very well. Consider this a near death experience. You won't remember anything you've seen here when you return to earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman closed the large book and said, \"Farewell Inuyasha. Keep to the right path and I will see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flung out her hand and Inuyasha felt a sudden deep sleep come over him. His soul rushed down from the gates and back into his body on earth. He slowly opened his eyes and groaned. The sutra was off of his mouth and his body was no longer paralyzed. He looked around and saw Shippo getting ready to fight with a strange demon boy. A cursory glance at the ground and he saw Kagome and Sango, held by Miroku, running towards the fight.</span></div></div>",

There was absolutely nothing he could do as he watched Inuyasha write under his name, \"Final Place of Rest: Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those fateful words were written, the clouds under Koga's feet disappeared and he fell from the sky. He fell unnaturally fast, like he had a weight tied to his legs, and he saw Earth appear before him before he hit the ground and passed through it. His eyes were obscured by darkness and an incredible heat suddenly was around him like he'd fallen in an oven. Finally, he came to a stop on some hard surface. Slowly light returned to him and he saw he was in some kind of office. There was only one light and it glowed red, covering everything in an unnatural crimson glow. Koga looked down and realized he was on some kind of desk. Suddenly, a voice came from behind him and said, \"Name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga whipped around and saw a huge man, much the same size as Inuyasha and Cassie the Gatekeeper. He had short cut black hair with two horns just visible poking through his hair, his irises were a strange yellow color and he was dressed in a red and black robe much like Cassie. He wasn't really paying too much attention to Koga. He was leaning back in his chair and reading from a book, a pencil tapping behind his head. Koga didn't know exactly what was going on but he said, \"Koga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange man wrote down his name and said, \"Now please hand me the report on your worldly deeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down at Koga for the first time and said, \"Your report of worldly deeds. You know, what you did on Earth to deserve eternal damnation in the bowels of Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Hell?\" Koga said, looking around the office. \"It doesn't look so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically this is just Hell's Waiting Room.\" The man grinned showing sharp pointed teeth. \"Depending on how bad you were in Life will determine which of the Seven Circles of Hell you'll be sent to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't get any report.\" Koga said, starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man leaned back again and rubbed his eyes. He sighed and said, \"Look, I know all the tricks you mortals try to pull to get out of going \"downstairs\" but it's going to happen anyway. Do you want to make it worse for yourself by angering the Higher Ups?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm telling the truth!\" Koga insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been at this desk since time began and never once has Cassandra ever neglected to bring in a report.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she wasn't at the Gates when I got there. Inuyasha was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh, so she went off again to cause some kind of mischief on Earth. Lucky her. We demons down here don't get to travel to Earth as decreed by the Goddess herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess? I thought God was a guy.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Common misconception. It is a male dominated world up there. But all of Heaven is run by Goddesses and the big kahuna is Washu. There's not a single guy up there running the show. When Washu sent the You Know Who \"downstairs\" she decided we all had to go. Since she can go to Earth she can be with as many guys as she wants. In fact, she always seems to be going back to the same house in Tokyo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great and everything but what am I supposed to do now?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm not sure.\" the man said. \"Usually whenever Cassie goes out she tells the Temp what to do. I suppose I'm going to have to send you to the guy in charge down here. He'll be able to work things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga gulped. He didn't like where this was going. The last thing he wanted to do was see whoever was in charge down here. But the man was already drawing something on the desk. When he was done, a button popped out of the desk and he pressed it. It sank back into the desk and the back wall opened revealing a staircase leading down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is Hell's Staircase. Just go down as far as it goes. There will be seven doors on the stairway but don't go in any of them. Each one leads to a different circle of Hell and once you go in, you don't come back out. By the way, I'm Christopher, Hell's Gatekeeper. Just call me Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Chris flicked Koga off the desk and down the stairs. As soon as Koga hit the stairs, the door slammed closed behind him, leaving him in almost total darkness. Feeling his way down the stairs it didn't take as long as he thought it would to reach the last door at the bottom of the staircase. He hadn't even felt the other doors. He made absolutely sure he was at the bottom of the staircase before knocking on the door. A voice said, \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slowly opened and Koga walked in, feeling extremely nervous.</span></div></div>",

He slowly looked up and met the eyes of the ruler of Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga didn't know quite what to think. But there was no mistaking that he was standing before a huge baby boy. He was sucking on a pacifier and everything. He was wearing a purple robe and a tall hat that had Jr. stamped on it. His hands were folded and he said, \"So what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga said the first thing that came to his head, \"Who are you supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby's eye twitched and he said, \"I'm the ruler of Hell, Koenma. I was sent down here by Washu after we had a falling out. I'm also the ruler of the afterlife in a different Universe, but in the end every person comes to the same place, either Heaven or Hell, no matter what Universe they're from and I'm here in Hell, while Washu is in Heaven. I can make an appearance on Earth only in the Universe where I rule the afterlife. But I digress. What are you here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you and this Washu person have a falling out?\" Koga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoenma sighed and said, \"We just both had different ideas on how things should be run in Heaven, some names were called, some injuries were incurred and I was sent down here with all the other men in Heaven. But we've adapted and it's our job to punish those who were evil in life. So what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have a relationship with her did you?\" Koga asked slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS WITH ALL THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE!!!\" Koenma yelled, slamming his fists against his desk. \"WASHU SENT ME DOWN HERE AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS! IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I I DIDN'T DESERVE IT!!! NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?!?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga was slightly shaken by this angry response but said, \"I don't have my report of worldly deeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Koenma said, settling down. \"Cassandra must be slipping. She never forgets things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a replacement right now.\" Koga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that explains it. Alright then I guess I'll have to make a call to this new Gatekeeper and have him send the report down to Chris.\" Koenma put his hand down over the right side of his desk and a phone appeared in it. He dialed a number and waited for someone to answer.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't find the desk, he didn't have time to deal with this woman who didn't even know how she died, and he didn't want to spend anymore time being the Gatekeeper to Heaven. Just as he was about to lose it, another woman appeared next to the first one. Inuyasha bent down to talk to her, and saw that it was Cassandra! About damn time too! She was laughing about something and said, \"Oh, playing with that guy never gets old! How easily he's hospitilized too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Inuyasha and said, \"Oh right. I should return to my normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the blink of an eye, she was back to Inuyasha's size and in her robes. Inuyasha opened his mouth ready to let loose a stream of curses and insults about his ordeal but Cassie merely held up a hand and said, \"Whatever your problem is, it doesn't matter anymore does it? Be glad I was only gone an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible!\" Inuyasha said. \"You've only been gone for twenty minutes at most!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time moves differently on Earth.\" She said in a tone of voice one uses when one is talking with a fool. \"Now what seems to be the hold up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha explained his problems with the woman not knowning the cause of her death, Koga's need to have a report of worldly deeds, and Koenma's impatience. Cassie sighed and said, \"Leave it to a temp to ruin everything! Step aside and watch me work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in midair and instantly a desk appeared, her clothes changing to those of a secretary. She pushed up rimless glasses that had suddenly appeared on her face and opened up a drawer. She pulled out a sheaf of papers and stapled them together before dropping them in a box labeled Down, which was below another box labeled Up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That takes care of the report!\" She said, pulling a pencil from behind her ear. \"Now on to you.\" She pointed at the woman. \"What's your deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman explained herself and how she couldn't remember how she died. Cassie nodded at her words then opened another drawer. She pulled out what appeared to be a car antennae attached to a calculator. She passed the antennae over the woman. It made a faint whirring sound which gave way to a loud beep from the calculator. She typed something in and said, \"You were killed by a gas explosion near your house. A manhole cover was sent skyrocketing towards you and took your head clean off.\" She dropped the strange equipment back into the drawer and pulled the book towards her. She flipped through it and said, \"And congrats! You've been accepted into Heaven! Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocked the gates with a large key and they swung open with an angelic chime. The woman greatfully stepped through the gates and Cassie pulled them closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, Koenma had recieved the report and was flipping through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, dear...\" He tutted. \"You're not exactly a model citizen are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his finger down a list and muttered, \"This is bad enough to get you to the Second Circle, this one to the Third...the Fourth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga's heart sank with each passing second. Apparently his deeds were heinous enough to land him deep within the torturous bowels of Hell. Finally Koenma dropped the report into a drawer and turned to Koga.

But Koenma sat there calmly, unafraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when a elevator magically erupted from the ground. It landed right behind Koenma and proceeded to open. FLUSH! Like the sound of  a toilet, thousands of rotten fish fell out. But as if they had a will they moved around Koenma and slammed into Koga, causing him to fall face first into Koenma's desk. The entire desk split in half as koga collapsed under thousand of dead rotting fish. \"That was slower than usual.\" Koenma breathed deeply \"And it seems like I need to get a new desk to boot. Good Job Prinnies! You just earned yourself a 2 cent raise!\" Koenma smiled as he gave a thumbs up to his exploding slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Exiting the Elevator was about twelve blue penguins. They had tiny purple demon wings, pouches filled with anvils, nuclear bombs, the Wii, amongst other things, and they had Peg legs. Not to mention that their bodies were stitched up like some ripped up doll. \"Doods! We just earn 2 pennies! Now we'll make 7 cents per hour!\" One of the Prinnies shouted happily. \"All right Doods!\" All of them screamed with joy at earn two extra pennies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But as they jumped for joy, Koga had dug his head from beneath the rotten fish and looked up to see....blue birds? \"What the hell are those things?\" Koga asked as he saw the Prinnies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Those are my exploding slaves. We call them Prinnies. Basically their human souls who have earned a chance at being reincarnated. So they act as slave labor and for all most nothing!\" Koenma laughed wickedly as he explained everything about his slaves. \"They are also good footstools amongst other things. In fact, if you ever feel that your in a life threatening situation then all you need to do is grab one and toss it at your enemies. Then BOOM! Course that's also why all the men were kicked out of heaven cept for the Angels since the angelic men are outnumbered 100 to one by angel women('And they need a angel man by them to release their daily need for sex since any other guy will end up with a limb missing.' Koenma thought as he spoke) and the souls of mortals who have earned a place in Heaven.\" And thinking of why angel women need a angel man only reminded him of that time in Holy Vegas 'Brrr! I am never going to have a threesome with angel women again, their scary when they have sex!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Exploding birds? And their humans?\" Koga was just confused as he was when he came down here. Only now it was about expodable humans. And didn't he say all the men in heaven were kicked out before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. And just so you know, Angel men weren't created until after we were kicked out of Heaven for tossing Prinnies at Washu and the rest of the women. After all, every women especially Washu needs a man to help her with their daily 'needs'.\" Koenma giggled as he remembered how every one of the women in Heaven were transformed into anything amusing from a pig, a weiner dog, to Michael Jackson during the final battle. This Koga reminded him of his last good times before him and the rest of the men were replaced by those male angels. 'Good times. Good Times' Koenma thought as he held back his laughter, he ws afraid his body was gonna break from the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyways, back to your sin.\" Koenma said as the Prinnies surrounded Koga. \"And don't try to fight them. Your level is currently 58 while theirs is 4800.\" That only got Koga even more confused. \"Normally in the second circle you are tossed about by a storm unable to touch the one you desire. But in this case we'll simply make naked versions of her appear around you teasing you for all eternity. And to make it even funnier, we'll have clouds of smoke surround their private area. Now take this fool away!\" Koenma commanded the Prinnies.  Saluting their master, the Prinnies grabbed chains from their pouches and attached them to Koga, carrying him off to the elevator to be carried down to the second circle of hell.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was getting annoyed that she was just ignoring him as she went about her business, filing reports, answering phone calls, opening the gate, pushing the button to Hell. Finally he shouted, \"HEY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and said, \"What are you still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha face faulted and shouted, \"Of course I'm still here! You haven't done a damn thing to bring me back to life yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! How silly of me!\" She said, standing up from behind her desk and changing back into her robes. She clapped her hands, rolled back her sleeves and pulled out what appeared to be a silver base ball bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with that thing?\" Inuyasha asked with some trepidation. He didn't have his Testsusaiga with him and this woman had proved to be mighty tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to use this bat to erase your memories of this place until it's your time to die. It will also send you back down to Earth in your Universe. Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back and was just about to swing when a sudden surge of souls appeared in a line in front of the gate. She faltered and looked as the line got longer, stretching away into the distance. She dropped her bat with a look of shock and said, \"This can't be! Death like this hasn't been seen since the Dark Ages of the Multiverse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about now?\" Inuyasha asked with exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just can't believe it!\" Cassandra said, ignoring Inuyasha's question. \"It was always said that this day would come again! But...Washu will know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new purpose, Cassandra reached to an empty space on her desk and grabbed the phone that appeared under her hand. She dialed a number and put the reciever to her ear. She paused for a few seconds then said, \"This is Cassandra, Boss. It looks like the time has come again. Yes, the line is stretching beyond my sight. Yes, deaths from every Universe. What do you mean 'The Prophecy'? Yes, I have someone here with me...Really? He doesn't seem like he would be up to doing something like that. What? Of course not! No, I--Yes. Yes. Who else? Oh dear, this might be difficult...Of course. He'll be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up the phone and turned back to Inuyasha. She said, \"Washu wishes to speak with you. All I can say is be polite and take whatever she says to heart. This is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha was surprised at this sudden change in Cassandra's behavoir. He nodded and said, \"How to do I get up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an answer, Cassandra drew something on her desk that caused a button to appear. She pressed it, sinking the button back into the woodwork. The Gates swung open but instead of revealing Heaven a tightly spiraling staircase was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take the stairs as high as you can go. But don't get distracted by anything. She's expecting you so don't keep her waiting.\" Cassandra said, sitting down and pulling a huge book towards her. She opened it and started to write something occasionally stopping to talk to a soul. Inuyasha turned towards the staircase and started up. Cassandra was right. It was distracting. After only three minutes of climbing upward the spiral twisted off and Inuyasha was left with dozens of staircases leading to impossible places. Staircases that were upside down hung over his head and trailed down walls. A few staircases even appeared to start nowhere and end nowhere, just kind of hovering in space with no apparent purpose. Inuyasha closed his eyes to block out the dizzying choices and continued on his path upward. Before long, he slammed into a door. Opening his eyes he saw a plain wooden door that stated: Washu's Office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\" Inuyasha said as he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" A voice called from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha opened the door and stepped into the office of the most powerful being in the Universe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inuyasha looked around and was surprised to see a ver plain, simple office. A desk was in the middle of it and there were pictures covering every wall, each of a different man. Below each picture was a small caption that had a name, age, and date on it. Inuyasha looked up and saw even more pictures covering the ceiling. One that caught his eye in particular had a huge X over it. It appeared to be of a young man with brown hair, the word Jr stamped across his forehead, and with what appeared to be a pacifier in his mouth. Inuyasha didn't know quite what to think of this. Suddenly, a voice said, \"You know, it's rude to ignore someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapped down and he saw a small girl with violently pink hair staring at him. She pointed at the foot of her desk and a chair appeared out of nowhere. Inuyasha took the hint and sat down. The girl kept staring at him for awhile then said, \"So you're Inuyasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and?\" Inuyasha said rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu laughed and said, \"Not many people talk back to the Goddess of the Universe. But then again, ignorance is bliss I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha didn't say anything. He just glowered at her. Washu raised and eyebrow and said, \"But we don't really have time for this do we? No.\" She said before Inuyasha could reply. \"I allowed you up here because of what Cassie told me. A long line of souls, stretching beyond sight is one of the signs of Armageddon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the end of the world?\" Inuyasha said surprised. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This throws back all the way to the Dark Ages of the Multiverse.\" Washu said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what the hell is the Dark Ages of the Multiverse?\" Inuyasha asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu folded her hands and said, \"This is going to take awhile, so get comfortable. Now let's see...the Dark Ages of the Multiverse began when all the men were kicked into Hell. The disorder that caused weakened the barriers that seperate the Universes causing untold destruction and death. Then, with the Universes in total chaos, a cabinet of evil was formed. All the most ruthless humans, demons, and monsters banded together with seven of the most evil at their head. Together, they sought to control all Universes, to bend them to their will. They succeeded somewhat, but before things could get too out of hand, a group of seven rose to oppose them. I was, of course, at the head. Unfortunately, I needed that two timing bastard Koenma's help, so he was there too. You can imagine my fury at having to ask for his help after imprisoning him in Hell not two days earlier. Anyway, we managed to overthrow them after a harrowing battle. We fought across the Universes, our size flucuating, our strength changing, our forms fluid. It was crazy I can you tell you that! Finally, we managed to defeat them and fix the barriers around the Universes. Life continued on, the Universes were safe, and we all thought we'd seen the last of major troubles. But a prophecy was made that no one but me knew about that was made a few weeks after the crisis was averted. The prophecy mentioned a strange occurence that would signal the end of all Universes. That was the arrival of a demon in Heaven that would be loyal enough to guard the Gates. Having imprisoned all demons in Hell, I didn't think I had anything to worry about. But now you've shown up. A demon. Who stayed to guard the Gates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't exactly have a choice!\" Inuyasha said angrily. \"That Gatekeeper of yours said she could bring me back to life if I guarded the Gates for an hour! It's not like I planned on making it a permenant job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's irrevelant now. The first sign of the prophecy has been fullfilled and the rest will surely come true. Now, until it happens, I can't tell anyone what the signs are, but I can assemble another team to block the coming threat. I've already got Cassandra working on bringing them in from the different Universes. You'll meet them down at the Gates with this message from me: In order to save the Universes, you must travel through the seven chosen lands. Only then can you defeat your adversaries and find the means to avert catastrophe. That's it. Good luck! I'll be in contact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Inuyasha could say anything else, Washu pressed a button and sent Inuyasha hurtling backwards, back down to the Gates.</span></div></div>",

A new evil group had begun to gather under the name of that which the greatest of evils took. These seven evil warriors would begin a campaign for multiversal destruction and would be known as the First Seven were known as. COOKIE: The darkest and most feared force in existance. More evil than LOVE or BUNNY ever were when they existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the dark corner of existance a great table existed within the shadows. Seven chairs were seated around the table. Each adorned with a jewel that will allow only its chosen owner to sit upon it. And from these shadows, the first member of COOKIE appeared. \"Aha! I knew that I the most perfect creature to ever exist wold be the first to arrive amongst COOKIE!\" Called forth the evil android Cell in his perfect form. He sat down in the Emerald black chair. Villain from=Dragon Ball Z<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That only shows that you are a weakling you fool! A being like me who is a God am far more worthy than you insect.\" Called forth the bishounen boy Bakura. He was wearing the milleniums ring and was currently controlled by the evil of the ring known only as the God Zorc. \"This vessel will be my voice amongst this group.\" Possessed Bakura said as he sat down in the Ruby black Chair. Villain from=Yugioh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bah! Before I! The great good boy Tobi None of you can withstand my sharingan or the tailed beasts that I have gathered.\" Called forth the Orange Masked True leader of Akatsuki. And one of the three surviving members of the Uchiha clan. He sat down in the Black Sapphire chair. Villain from=Naruto(BIG BIG SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ CHAPTER 363-5 at Onemanga.com!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fools! None of you could even survive my tremendous power if I decided to consume you and your planet whole!\" Called forth the fourth member. The evil Unicron. Who was apparently speaking through a small robot designed to sit within one of the chairs. And so he sat down upon the Black Moonstone chair. Villain from= Transformers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are all dark souls who seek nothing but pain and suffering. But In order for the one I care most to be happy, I must become a villain amongst you.\" Called forth the 17th Angel of Free Will. Known also as Kaoru Nagisa. The albino boy sat down in the Lapis Lazuli Chair. Villain from(Well he really isn't evil. I just adore him to much)= Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As if any of you can do anything right! As a representative of this organization I show you all the power of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.\" Called forth Mihawk, one of the Seven Warlords. He sat down in the Opal Black chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"BWAHAHAHAHAHA! All fear me! For I am evil amongst evil! Villain amongst villains! Overlords of Overlords!\" All of them cept Kaoru covered their ears to hide the pain of his evil laugh as none other than Overlord Laharl sat down in the Black Diamond chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Seven Darkest villains looked at a Black Crystal Ball that a mysterious shadowy pair of eyes emerged from. \"Welcome the Dark Seven. Commanders of the Eternal Armies of Darkness.\" Called the voice, a voice that sounded no louder than a Twelve year old. \"If you have a question about your comrades please answer away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I understand why many of these villains are here. But I must know why I, a boy who is actually a hero is amongst this group.\" Kaoru asked calmly as he sat there. Many of the others looked at one another and nodded. Why was a ANGEL who sacrificed himself out of love be a villain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are to act in Naraku's place. Since the Seven Generals are supposed to lead the armies upon the battlefield, Naraku would not join the group. For he is a manipulator and a master of traps. He has no desire to fight on the battlefield, even though his power is equal to all of you who sit here upon this table. Naraku IS a part of this group. But he is the 8th Unofficial Member and shall be known simply as the black hole crystal.\" The child-like voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see. So instead of placing a weaker villain amongst this group, you decided to place a strong hero who would make this group strong instead of placing a weaker villain who would make this group have holes in its defense. That and I am dedicated to rescuing my father no matter the cost.\" Kaoru replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Correct.\" Stated The mysterious child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But there are other villains that could take my place. Ones from non-anime universes such as Albedo, Sephiroth, Darth Vader, or Even Voldemort.\" Kaoru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That is true. But they are BOOK, VIDEO GAMES, AND MOVIE villains. While this new COOKIE is made up of Anime Villains only. They shall be considered minor leaders amongst this group. But only because they are not Anime villains. If they were Anime villains, then several of you would have been replaced by them. Unless they are pieces of crap like the Power Puff Girl Z's Mojo Jojo who is no better than the original\" The voice told them. All of the villains nodded and began to formulate their own plans for unifying the endless armies into one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the wicked anime villains began formulating a plan under their evil mysterious leader, Inuyasha was walking back down the confusing stairway to the Gates of Heaven. It didn't take long and as soon as he got there, Cassandra jumped up from her desk and said, \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha followed her back up the stairs, but they took a different path then the one that led to Washu's office. It didn't take long to reach another door which Cassandra promptly threw open. She pushed him inside and said, \"The others will be here shortly. Once this door closes, you will shrink down to your normal size and the room will contract to fit you. I'm sorry I have to be so blunt, but there's a major line up out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the door closed. Inuyasha didn't feel any different but he must've shrunk along with the room. He looked around and saw he was in a rather large room with a white screen against the far wall as well as a table in the center of the room. Inuyasha sat down in a red chair and waited for the others. He noticed a strange machine that was placed on the table. It looked like someone attached a telescope to a black box of some sort. A wheel with different picture pieces stuck in it could be spun around. Inuyasha was wondering what it was for, when the door opened and Cassandra shoved another person in. He was rather tall with spiky black hair and wearing matching orange pants and shirt. Cassandra said, \"Sit down, don't ask any questions, the others will be here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut again and the man looked around. Finally, he sat down in an orange chair across from Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Inuyasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Goku.\" The man said. \"Do you know what's going on here? I was on my way home with grocercies Chi-Chi asked me to buy, but then I was suddenly in front of these gates and that woman led me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even really sure what's going on!\" Inuyasha said. \"Let's just say we have to save the Universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Goku could ask anymore questions, the door opened again and Cassandra was shoving a kid with spiky blond hair into the room. Like Goku, he was dressed in orange and had these wierd whisker lines down his cheeks. He turned around and shouted out the door, \"Hey, hey! Don't push me old lady! I can walk by myself you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra ignored the old lady remark, but her eye twitched slightly. She contented herself with saying, \"Sit down, shut up, and wait for the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed once again. Instantly the kid turned to the other two and said, \"Alright, just what the heck is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Inuyasha or Goku could say anything the door opened again and another person was shoved in, knocking the first kid down. This new guy had bright orange hair and was dressed all in black with a huge sword on his back. He had managed to stay upright while the kid had been knocked flat on his back. He quickly sat up and said, \"Watch where you're going you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid with orange hair slammed a foot onto the blonde kid's chest and said, \"What did you call me you little punk?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Cassandra was in between the two, pushing them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this right now! You all have to work together, not tear each other apart! Now sit down and wait for the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSulkily, the two boys sat down, the blonde kid in a yellow chair, and the orange haired kid in a black chair. The door closed and an uncomfortable silence spun out. In an attempt to break the silence, Goku asked, \"So who are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde kid instantly jumped up and said, \"My name is Naruto Uzumaki, and someday, I'm going to be the number one ninja in my village!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired kid sighed and said, \"I'm Ichigo Kurosaki, substitute Soul Reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could ask what a Soul Reaper was, the door opened yet again and once more Cassandra was shoving someone through once again. This kid looked abnormally short and had large spiky tri-colored hair. Once more, Cassandra advised him to be quiet, sit down, and wait. The boy sat in a purple chair and looked around. Inuyasha noticed he was wearing a strange gold necklace. The boy broke the silence and said, \"So does anyone know what's going on here? My name is Yugi Moto by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy in the red said we had to save the Universe. Not that, that's a new thing for me.\" Goku said, indicating Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, before Inuyasha could say anything, the door opened. But it opened much wider than it had before. Strangely, a red and blue truck rumbled in and stopped by the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just sit down and wait. Only one more person has yet to arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed and everyone stared at the truck. All of their eyes widened as the truck suddenly transformed into a giant robot. This robot sat down in a huge blue chair at the head of the table and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku leaned over to Ichigo and asked, \"What is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking me?\" Ichigo said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but I'm not a thing!\" The robot said. \"My name is Optimus Prime, leader of the Autobots and sworn enemy of Megatron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jumped up again and shouted, \"What the heck are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptimus was about to answer when the door opened again and the last person arrived. His black hair was slicked back and he was wearing a white shirt with blue jeans and sneakers. His hands were in his pockets and he turned back to Cassandra as she said, \"I'm sorry I can't conduct this meeting myself. I'll be sending someone up as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed, and the boy looked around the table at the assembled crew. He sat down in the only remaining chair, a green one, and said, \"Hey, the name's Yusuke Urameshi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone took this opportunity to introduce themselves. Soon, everyone knew everyone at the table, by name if not by experience. The silence was palpable as they all waited to see who would be conducting this meeting. They didn't have to wait long. The door opened and a cheerful looking girl with blue hair and a pink kimono walked in and said, \"Hello everyone! My name is Botan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke's mouth dropped open in surprise and he said, \"Botan?!? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Yusuke!\" She said, walking to the screen. \"I'm here to conduct this meeting. Now that the Barriers have been broken, anyone can travel to different Universes if they have the means. I just flew here on my oar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat and looked much more serious. \"Now then. To business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a small remote and clicked it at the projector that was on the table. Instantly a picture of a Universe popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a Universe. Normally it's seperated from other Universes by Barriers. These were created at the same time as the multiple Universes to keep the negative and positive energies of each Universe seperate. This is a delicate balance and it has been disrupted by an unknown force. Whoever, or whatever, he is, he's very powerful and he has assembled a force of villains to take over the Universes for himself. We think he might be picking up where the first group of seven left off. It will be your jobs to fix the Barriers and defeat the evil wherever it surfaces. To do this, you will have to travel to various worlds and find seven artifacts that were hidden there long ago. Only with these seven powerful objects will you be able to fight against the armies of darkness. Now, while you seven will be artifact hunting, the evil seven will be amassing its armies to take over. This is a good thing, because their eyes will be directed elsewhere. If they do find out what we're doing, they will surely send someone after you and delay the process of artifact hunting. Be warned: Each of these artifacts holds untold amounts of power. With it, you will be able to obliterate your foes. Combine all seven, and a power will be unleashed that is so enormous, it will eradicate the forces of darkness and fix the Barriers. That is your mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had talked different pictures had gone by and they were now at the end of them. She smiled and said, \"You will now go see Washu and Koenma so they may send you to your first destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Koenma is here too?\" Yusuke asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! He demanded to have a part in organizing this. Washu wasn't very happy as you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she opened the door and ushered everyone out. She closed the door behind them and they all headed up to Washu's office.</span></div></div>",

I mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Inuyasha was sent back down to earth, returned to his body, and his memories were modified. He slowly stood up and faced the demoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped her hands to her mouth and said, \"Whoop! How'd you survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha looked confused and said, \"Survive what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Touch of Death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it doesn't work on me!\" Inuyasha said. \"Now where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness shrieked as Inuyasha picked her up by her collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to be nice, but enough is enough!

No one gets a FOURTH chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Isn't there anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" She said, a sudden idea forming. \"A few hundred years ago a demon found its way into Heaven and stole a magic artifact. It was a weapon forged from Holy Magic and was one of kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Inuyasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a doubled sided rod carved from wood from the eldest tree, hidden in the Mists of Death. The other half was forged from silver and ivory. The rod was imbued with Sacred powers from Heaven and the pure destructive force of Hell. It was originally created as a symbol of balance between good and evil. But when the demon stole it the balance twisted violently and near apocalyptic destruction rained down on the earth. The demon was only slain when a group of High Priests came together and sealed the monster in the mountains. The weapon was lost, apparently in those same mountains. If you can find the weapon and bring it back to me, I'll give you your fourth chance and grant you instant access to Heaven for this momentous good deed. If you don't revert to sin of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! I'll find it and use it to destroy Naraku once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You musn't use it! Its power will twist your body and spirit and use you to bring destruction once more! The rod can't be handled by earthly creatures. After only a day of using the rod, the demon who stole it grew to a monstrous size, horns sprouted from its head and a mane of wild hair grew down the spines of its back. It was a human like demon before it stole the rod and after its body was turned into that of a mindless beast. Beware its power Inuyasha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it.\" Inuyasha said. \"Now send me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember! Find the weapon in the mountains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the guard dismissed Inuyasha back to earth.</span></div></div>",

Now he knew where he heard Kohaku's name. Kagome had told him about a girl called Sango and how this evil youkai Naraku was using her brother as a tool. It was one of the many stories she told him when she came back. \"So your Sango's little brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kohaku looked down and stared in shock. \"How do you know Sango!?\" He spoke to Sota. And so he began to explain the story of Kagome and how she would always return, always telling him of her adventures. Kohaku looked surprise as Sota finished. \"Thanks for that story sister. I didn't know that girl that travels with my sister was from the future. But why are you small when she's normal size?\" Kohaku asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sota looked up at him, puzzled. \"I'd like to know that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, do you want me to return you to your sister so she could help you?\" Kohaku asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure! Would you do that for me Kohaku?\" Sota asked the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course. I don't my new friend to be small forever.\" Kohaku then disappeared in a flash, traveling through the deep woods surrounding the small village he was traveling through. He ran off towards the village Kagome stayed at from time to time. The most embarassing part of this all was that Kohaku was still naked, but was completly oblivious to this.</span></div></div>",

The president made a speech about the company and his success. He looked at Joey and said certain types of people are not ment to be successful. Those puppy people should give up and surrender to their betters, he said, eyeing Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was fuming. He knew Kaiba was doing it delibrately. He went to bed fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night Joey had a dream about Kaiba. Here Joey and Kaiba were dueling, and Joey was winning. Has Joey won, the skys turned darkish and the light vanished. As Kaiba stared at the grinning Joey, his jaw fell down. Joey was 5000 feet tall. The smileing Joey lifted his massive bare foor and slammed down infront of Kaiba. Seto looked at the 134 foot big toe and cringed. The bare dirty toe was massive. He was frozen to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his sleep, Joey moved his foot and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream Joey turned and looked at the tiny bug by his toe. Joey then raises the toe over the tiny Kaiba and lowers it onto Seto, enjoy the feeling of him squirm. Joey then increased the pressure on his toe. He felt the tiny Kaiba squirm and this pleased him,making his day. Having his enemy squirming underneath his single toe. Joey then took his toe off Kaiba and looked at him. He laughed and placed his whole foot over Seto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto was in agony under Joey's Foot. How could one toe be this powerful, he thought. He wriggled and felt an dramatic increase in pressure. His face was presses completely into the massive sole that he couldn't move. When the toe was removed, he sighed with relief. But the an even bigger shadow blocked out the sky. He looked up and saw the massive foot, even bigger now, blocking out everything. The foot was everywhere. He couldnot get away from it. As Joey lowered his foot, Seto watchd in horror as the powerful foot coverd him and crushed him. Joey laughed and watched his foot destroy Kaiba. \"Whos at who's feet now Kaiba\" he gloated, wiping what was left of Kaiba off his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joey woke up, he woke contempt with everything. He had had a very nice dream and felt he could survive another day. He pulled on his shirt and noticed it had become a little tight. His pants were tight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mustave shrunken in the Wash\" he said. Then he noticed his socks were getting tighter, shrinking before his eyes. He watched as his large feet burst out of them, ripping to shreds. He realised all of his clothes were tearing away, trying to escape the madly growing body. Finally Joey realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, the clothes aren't shrinking, I'm growing!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was too. Also luck that it was saturday and his family wass out of town. Specially after what happened with the house. Joey started exxpanding quickly, admiring the perfect muscles growing on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what to do.

He fiddled with it and pointed the pointer to G. He fired the ray and it hit a mirror and blasted back at him engulfing him in green energy. He quickly let go of the trigger and set the gun down. He was feeling a litle dizzy. But soon he was fine. He stood up and something seemed ...wrong. Everything was a lot smaller! The table the gun was on had been at his chest, it was a big table, and now it was around his knees! He grabbed the gun and left the room crawling out through the door looking for a new target.

Yugi sighed and fell back onto his pillows, wondering why such a strange dream had entered his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to go back to sleep, when he felt something cold and metallic in his hands. He looked over and saw, to his horror, the Millennium Necklace! It hadn't been a dream! It had been a premonition! An unusually strong one! He jumped out of bed and got dressed as quickly as he could. He had to make to Kaiba Corp. before Mokuba ever found the gun! He ran as fast as possible and soon entered Kaiba Corp. He ran for the elevator and jammed the button for the fifteenth floor, where the gun would be set on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator door opened, Yugi saw Mokuba open the door to a lab. Realizing he was running out of time, Yugi ran after Mokuba and knocked the gun out of his hands as he picked it up.<br>\r\n\"Yugi! What are you doing here?\" Mokuba asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi didn't answer. He just smashed the gun into a thousand pieces.<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?!?!? That was Seto's!\" Mokuba exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\" Yugi said. \"That thing was nothing but trouble! Tell your brother not to make it again!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...I guess...\" Mokuba said in confusion, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi sighed a breath of relief as he exited Kaiba Corp. and started heading back to his house. Suddenly, his cellphone rang.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Yugi? Don't you know what time it is? You were supposed to have come over here an hour ago!\" Tea's voice said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I slept in and then had to take care of something,\" Yugi apoligized. \"I'll be right over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Yugi prevented a disaster of universal proportions. He checked back later that night with Mokuba to make sure that Seto wasn't going to make another gun and Mokuba said he convinced him not too. Yugi slept easy that night, but still held the Necklace whenever he went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt that this particular storyline had to end soon. For those who think I'm right, rejoice. For those who think I'm wrong, there are still options (in another part of this storyline) to continue the story.</span></div></div>",

Some were lucky to be able to dodge out of the foot but most were crushed by it. The last thing they saw was the sweaty sole of Mako's muscled foot. A few were only able to partially dodge, their lower halves being crushed by the foot. Some people feeling that they were lucky was trapped between the gaps of the huge toes. The sweat raining down on them and the smell making them gag but it was better than dying. Suddenly the foot lifted again and the toes clenched, crushing those in between. People watched as the foot was lifted from the crater. Their eyes trailing the foot, seeing the huge calf, the muscled thigh and the big butt connected to it. They saw the remains of those under the soul, the bright red splotches stuck to the sweaty skin.<br>\r\n\"Shit! He's heading for the city!\"<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n\"Ugh I think I stepped on some ants, Mako said as he felt a crushing sensation.<br>\r\n\"Felt kinda good though, how they popped under my thick soul\"<br>\r\nWhile thinking about this, Mako didn't realize he was already near the city. He didn't see that he was tall as the city's buildings until his foot landed on a crowd of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntototototot(a car  makes this sound right? :3)<br>\r\nThe city as usual was crowded with people. Crowds upon Crowds of people. Mostly because a famous band was playing,One Direction and only the guys (gay guys) showed up which meant almost everyone in the city.<br>\r\nSuddenly tremors were felt,stopping the concert.<br>\r\n*BOOM* *BOOM* *BOOM*.<br>\r\nSuddenly out of nowhere a huge foot appears in the sky and crushes the stage and the people surrounding it.<br>\r\nThe people stared in awe. The huge muscular foot glistening with sweat. The toes moving around, seemingly enjoying the sensation of crushing the people below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Huh\"<br>\r\n\"Did I step on a bug again?\"<br>\r\nMako said as he felt a crushing sensation and the struggling under his sole.<br>\r\nHe looked down and shouted in surprise at what he saw, thousands of people but TINY near his feet.<br>\r\nThen he looked down at his foot and lifted it. he saw the people he crushed. Some still alive and covered in sweat, saved by the curve of his foot.<br>\r\n\"Wha-What did I just do?\"<br>\r\n\"OH GOD DID I JUST CRUSH PEOPLE WITH MY FEET?!\"<br>\r\nHe then looked at his sole and saw all the red splotches that were mixed with sweat.<br>\r\nThe people were all staring at the huge tan muscular giant as he check his feet. They saw all his muscles flexing. His big pecs and his defined abs. Most people noticed the huge bulge forming in his trunks and they feared the worst. Then suddenly they focused onto the handsome giant's face and saw him lick his lips and smile.<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS FUCKING AMAZING\"<br>\r\n\"I'M SO FUCKING HARD\"<br>\r\nHe then lifted his other foot and placed it right above the petrified crowd.<br>\r\nThe people saw the sweaty and the muscular sole. It was littered with body parts and red splotches mixed with sweat.<br>\r\nThey were terrified and could not move, the sweat raining down on them making them smell the foot odor of Mako.<br>\r\nThen he lowered it down and slowly crushed the crowd. He could feel the people wriggling the free them selves. Especially under his toes. The people were trapped under the hot and sweaty hell that is Mako's foot. They could feel their bones breaking under the pressure. Then after a few more seconds of Mako rubbing his foot into the ground, then POP.<br>\r\nMako's foot sunk into the pavement and they could hear the cracking sounds the bodies under the foot made. Blood pooled under the sole and they could see the arms sticking from under the foot. Mako continued to grind his foot into the pavement, savoring the feeling.His bulge hardening, showing the outline of his massive penis. Pre-cum leaking out of the trunks. Mako licked his lips and showed a sadistic smile.<br>\r\n\"Ugh you people are so tiny, I'm so powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople then heard a growl and saw Mako rubbing his abs.<br>\r\n\"Heh I haven't eaten yet, I always wondered what humans would taste like\"<br>\r\nMako then grabbed the fleeing crowd and lifted them up. They got a good look of his muscular thighs and huge bulge. They saw his 8-pack and his huge pecs. Then they saw his handsome face and his sadistic smile. He licked his lips, showing them a peek of what would come.<br>\r\n\"Heh, you guys need some seasoning first\"<br>\r\nHe then rubbed the people onto his abs, pecs and bulging biceps. They were rubbed along the tan and bulging muscles, covering them with sweat and the musk of the giant tan fisherman. He then lifted the crowd to hiss face and smelled them.<br>\r\n\"Ah, thats the stuff\"<br>\r\nHe then opened his mouth and brought out his huge slimy tongue. The people saw the huge cavern that was Mako's mouth. They saw the huge teeth and the saliva pooling in the mouth. Then his tongue started to move and the saliva coating the giant muscle. <br>\r\nMako slowly licked the crowd getting a good taste of the live meat he was about to shove into his mouth.<br>\r\nThe tongue covering the crowd in his hand, moving around and coating the people in saliva. Some got dragged off and was stuck onto the tongue.<br>\r\nMako the dragged his tongue back into his mouth along with the people who got stuck because of the saliva. They could hear him swishing and playing with the people in his mouth. Then he swallowed. They could see the muscled neck bring down the bulge, disappearing to his pecs and down his abs.

His lips sealing them in. The people below could see the cheeks bulging with the live meat. Mako then started swishing the contents of his mouth with saliva. His tongue playing with the crowd. After awhile the crowd was coated in enough saliva, they could feel their battered bodies, played and tasted by the giant tongue. Mako then tilted his head back and then swallowed several times. He swallowed several batches of people. The bulge travelling down his muscular neck and disappearing down towards his pecs and abs. He put his hand near his neck feeling each bulge travel down his neck and disappear inside his body.<br>\r\n*Burp* Mako smacked his lips and rubbed his abs. The people could only imagine what was happening in the hellish stomach behind the sweaty abs.<br>\r\nMako then grabbed more people and did the same. He shoved them in and swallowed them whole. One batch was too big, so he chewed. The people could hear the bones cracking and the cries of agony in his mouth.<br>\r\n\"AHhhh Shit I'm so full\" He could feel the people struggling to survive behind his abs. He could feel his dick straining his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMmmm now I have to fill a different hunger\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mako then clenched his cheeks, crushing the people who were struggling in between. The people were trapped in between his legs could see the giant bulge in his trunks and the musky smell inside.  Mako then grabbed a handful of people and lifted them towards his abs. He then opened his trunks and slid them towards his trunks.<br>\r\n\"Be good toys and pleasure my dick\"<br>\r\nThe people screamed as they were crammed inside the musky cave. The people could feel the sweaty appendage that was Mako's penis. Some  fell and rode his dick like a horse while a few fell to his balls which broke their fall. Some slid under it and was crushed by the sweaty ball flesh. There were even people who fell into his foreskin, pleasuring the giant dickhead and slipping inside the pre-cum producing slit. There were even people struggling in Mako's pubes, getting tangled by the matted hair. Mako could feel all these sensations, he couldn't take in anymore. He started rubbing the bulge in his trunks The people inside getting crushed by the dick. He then opened his shorts and brought his dick out. His giant balls and penis crushing the people near his bulge. The sweaty and musky skin crushing the life out of them. The balls crushing the bodies repeatedly because of the rubbing.  Mako grabbed his shaft and started rubbing it, the precum and the people acting as lube for him. The people were surprised as they were suddenly let out. Then a giant sweaty, veiny hand grabbed the length along with the people. They were trapped between the sweaty palm and the musky dick. Mako then started to rub crushing them against his rod. Mako then ran out of people to use as lube so he got and idea. He stood up and then used all four limbs to stand up, his dick directed towards the crowd. He then started to thrust his dick, in and out, in and out, in and out, hump, hump , hump. All his muscles flexing and his butt clenching and unclenching. His dick crushing hundreds of people, the fleshy spear piercing through the crowd, turning them to lube, the blood mixing with the pre-cum.

He saw the sea on one side of him, but on the other side, there was this odd looking moss and the forest he had been near was completely gone. He decided to stand up and start walking around to find that this plot of land he was on wasn't very big, probably only fifty or so yards across and completely surrounded by ocean. He then sat down to think when, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted movement near the shore. It looked like a little toy dock with miniscule looking toy boats and what appeared to be insects getting into them and attempting to escape. It took him a few minutes to realize what was going on. He had grown to 1000 feet tall!! He quickly checked the bottoms of his sandals to find countless numbers of red splotches amongst all the mud on them. He then realized that he had sat down, probably crushing countless others under his butt. He should have been mortified by this turn of events, but something deep inside of him made him want to try other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the boats and the tiny people trying to escape and, smirking, he grabbed up four or five boats into his hand. Grinning, he decided to pop them into his mouth, the boats themselves only slightly bigger than one of his teeth. He then started to chew up the boats before swallowing them down and laughing.

While it would be fun to have his way with the island, there really wasn't that much to offer.  Mako decided he'd rather spend his time elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This island looks like fun, but I've got bigger fish to fry, if you get my drift.  Looks like you guys are getting off easy this time,\" Mako announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to the sea, Mako scanned the horizon for the coast of the mainland.  After a few minutes of searching, a faint black outline off in the distance became apparent to him.  It was a good hundred miles or so away from the island, but Mako figured he could make it there in only a few hours at his new size.  He guessed that he would probably be able to walk straight across the ocean floor.  But it was still a long way off, and Mako didn't want to get his clothes wet.  A grin began to spread slowly across Mako's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't feel like getting all of this stuff wet,\" Mako told the people on the island.  \"How about this.  I'll make a deal with you guys.  If you watch my stuff while I'm gone and make sure nothing happens to it, I promise I won't destroy the island and all of you with it.  Consider it a free pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing (or expecting) any sort of opposition to his proposal, Mako began to slowly disrobe.  Sliding off his tank top and shorts, Mako kicked off his sandals.  Standing in nothing but his underpants, Mako grinned down at the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready for a treat!\" Mako teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his underpants to the ground and stepped away, revealing himself in his full muscular glory.  Turning around, Mako began to wade into the ocean.  As he walked further out, the water rose up to his chest, but didn't go much higher.  Mako strode purposefully through the water, enjoying the feel on his nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the island was a good distance behind him.  All of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

Sure, he manages to win enough against the no-name duelists, but he always loses to just about any professional that he plays against. After losing yet again, he went back to his apartment and found a package waiting for him. Along with the package was a note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex Raptor,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a huge fan of yours! Ever since I first saw you, I've been your biggest fan! Take some of this to help you win! I took it from my daddy's office! It's supposed to make you big and strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned,<br>\r\nTyranno Hassleberry, Age 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was a weird vial in the box. He didn't know who the kid was, but he was curious. Along with the vial was a bunch of notes written in some super-scientific psychobabble that he couldn't understand. So he called the only brainiac he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Weevil, It's Rex\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want? If you want me to beat you in another duel, just give me a time and place! Hee Hee Heee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing like that! I want you to come to my apartment. I wanna show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence on the other line, \"What's so important that you want to show it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and get over here! If you do, I'll let you have all the bugs you can find in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it's a deal. I'll be right over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Weevil showed up in full bug-catching garb and, straddling a bug catching net twice as large as he was over his shoulder, he cocked an eyebrow and spoke up, \"So what's this that you wanted to show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex showed Weevil the vial, the letter, and the scientific data. After a few minutes, Weevil was stunned as he read the notes, even going so far as falling over in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-Do you realize what you've got here...!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo... that's why I wanted you to come over, so you could tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... this is... Growth Serum! And not some lame prank. This stuff is the real deal!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH, REALLY!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! This is one heck of a breakthrough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex was excited before leering at Weevil, thinking more cautiously, \"Hey Weevil, How about I take that vial back now...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rex's surprise, Weevil calmly handed it back to Rex, \"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? We've both been short all our lives. You really want to throw something like this away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeevil started laughing, \"Are you kidding me? As long as I have this research data, I can replicate the formula easily! I may be evil at times, but you're the only guy I consider a friend. You can keep that and maybe, when I'm done, I can make more for both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex smiled at Weevil, \"Thanks! So, umm... how do I use it? Do I have to do something special with it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeevil shakes his head, \"No, you just drink it and you're all set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex nods and, popping the cork, he drinks the entire vial down. Weevil shrieks in fear, \"You idiot! Don't drink that in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeevil grabs Rex and starts guiding him outside. As he did so, Rex started to grow. Five feet tall, Six feet tall, Seven feet tall. Soon, Weevil managed to get him out the door before Rex would have otherwise been unable to escape. Then Rex continued to grow further. Ten Feet.

He almost mowed Weevil over with his expanding bare feet, but Weevil managed to latch on and get pulled up onto it before he would have gotten crushed. He then walked along the massive foot as he took in the sight of the growth. He looked up to see his best friend reaching 1000 feet tall, almost as tall as the tallest skyscraper! Now Weevil wouldn't ever mention this to Rex, but he always had a crush on his best friend and even had dreams of being bug-sized next to him. Little did he know that Rex felt similar about Weevil, wanting Weevil to shrink down so that he could care for him.Weevil looked up at Rex as Rex looked down at the tiny speck on top of his foot, knowing it to be Weevil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rex and Weevil both realized that Rex's close had torn right off his body! Not only that, but Rex had gotten hard at what had happened. Weevil had gotten hard as well, but tried to cover it up shyly. Rex then bent his knees in a crouch to get a closer look at the little Weevil on his foot, rather embarrassingly, \"Erm... that stuff didn't grow my clothes with me.\" Weevil then looked at Rex's face, which had turned bright red at the sight. He stuttered nervously himself, \"T-T-That's Ob-obvious! Y-You really did-didn't think that you would k-keep your c-c-clothes, would you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex could somehow hear the little Weevil despite his size, but didn't question why as he blushed embarrassingly, \"Well, I suppose not...\" then he noticed the stutter, something he had never heard Weevil do ever except that one time when Rex walked out of the shower nude, forgetting that he had Weevil over for company. He knew that Weevil never had a reaction like that with pictures of nude women, but still couldn't figure it out. However, he decided to play the sarcastic card, \"...and why are you stuttering so much? Usually you have SUCH a way with words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeevil eeped at this. At first, he thought that Rex had figured it out, but that wasn't it. Rex wasn't exactly the most intelligent person in the world, but that's part of why Weevil was attracted to his best friend. He then figured that Rex would never figure it out, so he decided to blurt it out himself and save them both of the awkward silence of a 1000 foot tall naked giant talking to a guy on the top of his foot, \"Rex, you probably wouldn't get it if I tried to tell  you another way, so I'll tell you directly. I... I love you, Rex. More than one friend can love another friend. Even I didn't realize it at first until you took that growth serum, but being in this position, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Weevil was about to keep going, Rex chimed in, \"I love you too, Weevil. In fact, I'm glad things turned out this way. I've always had a thing with you being a bug to me that I would care for and now that dream of mine has come true!\" Weevil heard this wide-eyed and fell over in shock, \"I-I've had the same dream. I wanted to be shrunken down so that I could be yours to do with what you wished and now, it seems both of our dreams have come true, though not in the way either of us expected it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex then grinned, \"Well then. Do you think that you could figure out an antidote for this so I could get back to normal?\" Weevil then shrugged, knowing exactly what Rex was thinking, \"It'd take a lot of time, probably several weeks to figure out the antidote and then another month or two to work on a shrinking potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex frowned, \"But I can't wait that long!\" before Weevil chimed in, \"Well why are you complaining? You have me and you're 1000 feet tall! How about putting me somewhere safe on you and you can have some fun!\" Rex's frown turned into a smirk as he looked at the expanse of his new playground, \"Why didn't I think of that before?\" as he puts Weevil...</span></div></div>",

Yusuke leaned over to talk to her, but she crawled backwards, not wanting to get close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Keiko, it's just me,\" Yusuke said, not knowing how deep his voice had become.

Without speaking to ash, gary unties his right shoe-lace and then pulls it off. He the slowly removes the enormous sock which was about 594 feet long. Ash looked up in fear of the nearly 5000 foot tall god that was gary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO ASH!\" Gary boomed. \"IT SEEMS YOU ARE A LITTLE LOST FOR WORDS. JUST THE SIGHT OF ME MAKES YOU COWER IN FEAR. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE FUN TODAY, ISN'T THAT RIGHT MY SLAVE. THATS YOU I MEAN. YOU'RE MY SLAVE. AND I THINK I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

Here he was at his rival's mercy. A person who has hated Ash since day one. Ash thought it might be dangerous to refuse so he ran up to the huge toe and started to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THATS NICE BUT I THINK YOU CAN GO ONE FURTHER! I KNOW! YOU CAN START TO LICK MY FOOT CLEAN. I NEED A GOOD CLEANING AND YOU ARE JUST THE PERSON TO DO IT. BUT IF YOU DON'T, I HAVE ANITHER PLACE TO RUB...\" he said, looking down at the huge bulge in his pants. \"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL, YOU'D BETTER START LICKING MY FOOT LIKE A GOOD SLAVE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh definitly didn't want to end up in Gary's briefs so he ran to the foot and started to lick the massive thing.

Ring any bells!?\" Gary said beginning to get angry remembering all the pranks and humiliation he'd suffered at the hands of this punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy thought about it, then he figured out who this was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're name is G-G-Gary r-right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Gary said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD......That was you!?

He screamed as he fell, watching Gary's body fly by before hitting the ground hard. He yelped in pain and clutched the arm he fell on. It was surely broken, but that was the least of his problems. His teary eyes gazed back up at Gary, but his vison was blocked by the bottom of the giant boy's dirty shoe. He sobbed and raised his hand up in a fruitless act of defense. \"Please, no! Have mercy, I'm just a kid!\" he begged between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kid? Yeah, well I'm a kid too. Younger, in fact. But if I'm ready to kill you, then you're ready to die. Did you enjoy your life, punk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese cruel words were the last thing the boy heard from this god-like Gary before the foot came down. Josh's final scream echoed in his head and was cut short when the shoe landed. The sounds of his own bones snapping filled his head for just a second before everything went dark. To Gary, a nice crunch was heard and it brought a big smirk to his face. He grinded Josh's body into the dirt, smearing him across the surface.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He would always wait until the moment of orgasm, and get something to spray it on or something so that he could drink it.  He'd continue to stroke until he felt the moment arrive, then he'd let fly.  Sometimes he would have a big one and it would be a lot of cum spraying out of his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest orgasm he had was when he first saw May completely naked.  Her juicy breasts were fixated into his eyes, and he jerked himself off three times in two hours--and ended up with a solid cup of cum.  He drank the whole thing down, loving the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, he was sitting in his bedroom, cup at the ready and spanking himself vigorously.  At the moment of ejaculation, there was a minor earthquake--a 3.2, enough to startle people and make a few things fall.  He sprayed into the container with extreme vigor that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, feeling the earthquakes he was causing by his movements, he was ready to relive that night.  But he wasn't going to let the city go easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in with purpose.  Everything bounced as glass shattered and buildings were rocked off of their foundations, causing massive amounts of rubble to collect on the city streets below him.  He found a relatively intact skyscraper and sized it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his 145 foot long, thick cock and touched the tip of it to the building, smearing it with a drop of pre-cum.  He laughed, then pitched his hips back and smashed his penis through the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground continued to rock.  The skyscraper now had a massive Ash-cock sized hole in it, but remained intact.  He rocked back again, finding another intact spot, and smashed his rod through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarthquake followed earthquake followed earthquake.  He smashed his stick through the building 8 times more before it collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed at the top of his lungs.  He then took his massive hand, planted it around his member, and started pumping away wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to grunt and groan.  People were watching him work his meat, some just standing blindly because everything else was futile.  They knew they were going to die and just accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh Ketchum pulled back on his rod again and felt the familiar feeling of orgasm arrive upon him.  A second later hundreds of gallons of hot, sticky, white goo started to squirt from his tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCars and buildings were crushed under the cum.  It covered everything.  20 seconds went by and he finally finished orgasming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another horrible thing happened: he laughed and proceeded to cum again, drowning another part of his play city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was having fun.  He was ready to continue his rampage.</span></div></div>",

Interestingly enough, the two buildings were about 100 feet apart, but that's no problem for Ash's massive butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and bent over. A shadow of his gargantuan backside loomed over those two buildings. People in the buildings were screaming helplessly as they saw that naked boy plop his ass on the top. Each buttock smothered the buildings completely. The buildings only stood for a minute until they came crashing down by superior weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of his butt to the ground at nearly 500 feet in the air caused the ground to explode. The buildings around him toppled and they knocked each other over like a domino effect. The earthquake was a magnitude 8.0 and the town seized to exist.

Probably filled to the brim with hundreds of people awaiting and close to death. Ash laughed again. His voice creating a echo which went for many miles. Ash then started licking the cum of his hands. Tasting the sweet taste of his own seed. Mixed with the tastes of countless people. To Ash it tasted beautiful , sweet and he could have much more. After finishing the large amount of people and cum in his hand. He moved onto the rest of the city. He left no area unlicked, lapping everything with his huge and wet tounge.

His voice like a megaphone with the volume set to 10,000 to the tiny people.\" As you can see your home is destroyed.\" Ash said with a laugh\" Bending over Ash picked up the small amount of tiny people running away from his body and held them toward his stilll throbbing cock. Letting them go Ash simply let them fall into the slit of his cock. \" There you go your new home, well until the next time i feel like some action anyway.

Actually, she was probably with Brock. Anyway, Ash didn't care and sat on the gym. And it collapsed by his weight. Like the others cities, Cerulean City was now destroyed. Ash felt stronger and was ready for his final target... Celadon City !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Ash reached the city. To destroy this city, he'll use his hand now. First, he punched several buildings and it collapsed rapidly. The giant felt stronger again and continued to smash. People were running as always. Ash grabbed some people and crushed them inside his hand. It was covered with blood but it wasn't important for the giant. Then, Ash used his final punch to destroy the centre mall.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One fine day in Dr. Garcia's laboratory, Dr. Garcia looked through the window and yawned. \"I need to go out and get some fresh air.\" Said Dr. Garcia, as he exited his laboratory, he looked up at his mansion and saw that one of his windows is broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: I never knew that window was broken! I wonder how did that happen... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia starts to investigate the situation and reveals a dead creature nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Hmm... What a wierd-looking creature. It looks like a mouse or maybe a rat, but it's way too big to be a mouse, and I have never seen a mouse whose fur is yellow. It seems to have a couple of pink cheeks and extraordinarily large ears. This might be interesting for me to do some experiments with this strange creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Dr. Garcia took that creature, into his laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Dr. Garcia's Lab, Dr. Garcia inserts that strange little creature into his device to genetically engineer and to revive it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Ha, this ought to work. After I press this button, this creature will be brought back to life, thanks to my genius! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pushing the button, the machine starts rattling and making strange sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: What the... Despite of the uniquely shaped creature, this machine should be able to obtain a thorough scan of this creature. However, this is not suppose to happen according to my theories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the machine starts smoking, leading to an explosion in Garcia's lab. Dr. Garcia hurries and tries to shut off the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Dang! I guess that the machine can't take this strange creature... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the explosion and after the smoke is clear, a creature jumps out of the mess and pronounces, \"Pichu?\" Dr. Garcia looks at the creature with amusement and asks the creature for its name. The creature simply replies, \"Pichu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Ahhh! Pichu is your name? <br>\r\nPichu: Pichu! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu looks at Garcia with enthusiasm and starts approaching to Dr. Garcia slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: What do you want? <br>\r\nPichu: *Drips all over the place and replies,* Pichu! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse, Pichu, is rather one foot tall and when he approaches to Dr. Garcia with hunger, Garcia quickly evades from Pichu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Get away from me! Otherwise, I'm going to destroy you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu walks away into Garcia's labrynth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Pichu! You can't go there!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot willing to listen to Garcia's advice, Pichu enters into Garcia's room. Because Pichu is dying of starvation, he quickly gulps any of the potion found on Garcia's room. When Dr. Garcia enters into the room, he finds out that those chemicals have been consumed by the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Oh no... He drank ALL OF THEM... *Garcia quickly runs away from his room as soon as possible, knowing what will happen next.* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu suddenly feels extremely sick and leans downwards rapidly. After a few minutes, Pichu becomes grizzly and starts to generate electricity and shocks elsewhere. His body is shaking and his mood is constantly changing from happiness to sadness. During this time, the place appears to be shrinking in front of Pichu's eyes. He ponders about this strange dilemma. When he gets up, he stretches himself and breaks the ceiling. Pichu has grown from 1 foot high to over two stories high! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Dr. Garcia knows the consequence when his chemical potions are ingested, he refuses to leave his lab, not wanting to abandon all of his experiments. He decides to go back to his room. Seeing a two-stories high Pichu, Garcia says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Oh My God! What the heck happened here! I guess that this proves that my potions actually work! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Garcia realizes his hair is being soaked by Pichu who starts dripping all over the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Hey buddy! Do you want to help me to complete my experiments? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu kneels down and grabs Dr. Garcia with his chubby arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Let me go, you overgrown RAT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tearing Garcia's clothes apart, Pichu starts patting all over Garcia's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Hey, stop that! That's ticklish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu holds Garcia by the foot and stares at Garcia with huge black eyes. Pichu puts Garcia near his nose and starts sniffing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Aaachoo! Let me down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu then grabs Dr. Garcia and cuddles him very hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: I can't breathe! Please release me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu: Pichu.... Piii--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cuddling Dr. Garcia, Pichu starts licking Dr. Garcia. Afterwards, Pichu coughs since Garcia hasn't showered for weeks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu: Pii... Chuu-eww! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu scratches his head and holds Garcia in one hand, thinking what can Pichu do to remove that disgusting taste. Pichu goes into the bathroom and fills the tub with hot water. He throws Dr. Garcia into the bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu: Pichu! <br>\r\nDr. Garcia: That's too hot, you fool! <br>\r\nPichu: Pichu? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu starts rubbing Garcia on the back and on the front. Pichu even washes Garcia's hair as Dr. Garcia tries to escape from Pichu's grasp. Pichu slaps Dr. Garcia to order Garcia to behave himself. After Garcia is cleansed, Pichu starts licking over Garcia's body and says, while giving an evil grin, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu: Piii.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu picks Garcia up and shows Garcia his claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: What are you going to do...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu throws his claws at Garcia, making a mishmash out of Garcia's bold body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Yeoowwch! Nooo... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu starts licking Garcia's blood with pleasure. He opens his mouth and approaches Dr. Garcia's wounded body. However, Pichu backs off as he got a better idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Oh.. God no! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his fingers, Pichu starts picking Dr. Garcia wounds. After that, he licks his fingers and enjoys the taste pretty much. He grins even more, looking at Dr. Garcia's wounds. Pichu starts punching Dr. Garcia's wounds until some flesh is spilling out of those wounds. Dr Garcia breathes so hard, trying to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia: Why is this happening to me... YEOOWCHH!!... Eeeeeeeehhh... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly dying, Dr. Garcia's body is being torn apart by Pichu. After picking up a chunk of flesh, Pichu engulfs that into his mouth. Pichu starts chewing, seeming to enjoy so much. Pichu looks at the dying doctor and says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu: Pichu... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garcia moans in pain while Pichu finishes chewing that chunk of flesh. Pichu decides to take a bite of out one of Dr. Garcia's legs. Pichu rips Dr. Garcia legs apart and puts it into the mouth. Dr. Garcia is completely speechless as he's in a coma, knowing that one of his limbs has been ripped apart. Dr. Garcia still struggles to survive, wishing to complete his ultimate experiments. It's just too bad that Garcia has to be conceded by one of his guinea pigs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pichu finishes chewing the leg, Pichu cleans the blood from his face by licking them thoroughly. Thinking that it tastes so good, Pichu decides to add some flavors to the almost cadaver of Garcia. Pichu lays Dr. Garcia on the table and rushes to the kitchen to pick up a bunch of hot sauce, the Tobasco Sauce. He sprays all the hot sauce to Garcia's body. Dr. Garcia cries out in pain and eventually dies in agony. Pichu looks at the cadaver, thinking that it's no fun tormenting the body. He decides to just gulp the body directly. In addition, since Pichu likes to enjoy tasting human's flesh, Pichu starts eating the corpse gradually by tasting all of the tendons, nerves, flesh, and even the bones piece by piece. When the body is completely crushed, Pichu finally swallows it. Nonetheless, as Pichu is still hungry, he decides to leave the place in order to look for bigger meals. Where will this monstrous man-eating mouse go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while of devouring many humans in the large city, the army finally arrived onto the scene in jets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pichu noticed this, he was a little frightened, and in spite of his size and power over his puny surroundings, he felt a little scared. The incoming Jet caught his attention. It was flying very low, and would be difficult to catch under any circumstances.<br>\r\nHe braced himself for the catch with a loud \"Pichu!\". From a crawl, he adjusted his position to a low crouch, and had to smile, looking down between his feet at the tiny cars and buses in the parking lot thinking about the view anyone below might be seeing if they looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerican Airline flight 77 was coming in low and fast, Pichu took a deep breath, and held it as the plane zoomed in. He grabbed it almost at ground level, his angle was just a little off, and the right wing hit the ground, bent and snapped in his paw, but other than that, he held the plane firmly but securely in his grasp. The Mayor of the city, watching on a monitor whistled and said,<br>\r\n\"Damn!! I'm hurry up and destroy this beast!\" The staff had been worried about the sudden appearance of the colossus in their precious city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were six rmy jets among the sixty eight passengers. Pichu roared \"Pichu!\" and at the same time, his stomach growled. Apparently he was still hungry and wanted more human cuisine. <br>\r\nPichu then started shaking the jet in his paw in an attempt to get the human of the plane so he could eat them and fill his hungry belly, so the six army men were pushed out the door forcibly by violent shaking, Pichu looked at the pathetic tiny figures in his paw, staring up at him with fear. <br>\r\nHe picked up one squiggling little figure holding it between his thumb and paw finger. Pichu licked his lips as he stared with hungry eyes at the small kicking figure. Then after a few secounds, Pichu opened it's seemingly large jaws and brang the first victim towards it's mouth while the other soldiers watched in hypnotic fascination as it's tongue snaked out to tease the little man and coat him with saliva, then nudged him into it's gaping mouth. <br>\r\nThe man\u2019s head had progressed deep into Pichu\u2019s throat and he was in mortal peril of vanishing forever if Pichu should swallow. He no longer struggled.  Probably paralyzed in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu\u2019s lustful eyes went from his tiny victim to the army men as it's tongue formed a semi-circular channel running back to it's terrible throat. Pichu was rising up to engulf it's little victim, whose head was just now nudging it's uvula as he convulsed at the prospect of what waited below for him.<br>\r\nIn slow motion Pichu\u2019s throat contracted, embracing the man's head and shoulders in hot slick flesh taking him inexorably deeper and then re-opening. Pichu repeated this taking him still deeper. With practiced expertise, he was swallowing him down just as a snake swallows its\u2019 prey, engulfing him a gulp at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Pichu\u2019s peristaltic reflexes erupted, it's throat completely embracing the little army man and dispatching him swiftly with a loud satisfied gulp. Pichu sighed and patted his belly wich responded with a hearty growl. Pichu then looked down at his other victims with an evil grin.<br>\r\nBut instead of eating them right away, like the little men sitting in Pichu's paw had expected. Pichu whisked them all down to just below it's chest and pressed them against the warm, soft, yellow flesh of it's stomach. As Pichu held them close to his stomach, they could distinctly hear cries of anguish from deep inside, reaching them through the imprisoning walls of this Pokemons belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen at this moment Pichu quickly threw them high into the air over it. All of the men were still shocked from the throw when they landed deep into Pichu\u2019s wide opened maw. Pichu then promptly closed his maw and swallowed all the men down! The wiggling bulge in Pichu\u2019s neck quickly disappeared into his belly, where anyone that entered it, would die of both asphyxiation and acid burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it for the brave troops of flight 93\" The Mayor thought, sad that he could not save them.<br>\r\nAfter that horroriffic scene, Pichu was still hungry! And his belly even growled as proof that he was. So he desperately tried to grab the remainder of the jets, in an attempt the break them open like nuts to get the real meat inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pichu stood high on his feet and tried to grab them, but the jets fired itty bitty rockets at him. This did not hurt Pichu, but it definetely annoyed him. So Pichu then used his thunder shock attack! And easily fried each and every rocket to ashes. Pichu giggled with excitement and squealed \"Pichu!\" triumphantly, then continued to destroy the city in search of more humans to fill his unmerciful belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing this, the Mayor cried out in anguish \"No!\" realizing that their was no hope left for his precious city... So, what will happen next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Pichu continued his chaos and feasting, he finally got full and patted his belly. Even though he wasn't hungry anymore, he definetely wasn't done playing.<br>\r\nHe wanted to see the peoples reaction. He knelt down to look closer at the nearest building.<br>\r\nLooking into the windows of the top floors He could make out the people.<br>\r\nThe people were no more than an inch tall, He could hold about a dozen in one hand alone.<br>\r\nStill kneeling before the first building, he placed his paw firmly on the top floor, and gave it a push. The building gave way under his yellow paw, it rocked a little, and then at the base of the building, puffs of smoke and dust billowed out, indicating that the base of the structure was damaged and the building would collapse. People dove from the upper floors, to fall to their death,<br>\r\nthe ones inside would be crushed and buried under the rubble. The<br>\r\nbuilding crumpled under his hand, as the building disintegrated. This<br>\r\npleased the Pichu, who then stood up, and took a step over to the next<br>\r\nbuilding, that looked just like the first. He noticed that the people<br>\r\nin the building were streaming out, trying to escape. He slowly placed<br>\r\nhis foot on the tiny people, first holding back, and then pushing down<br>\r\nwith his full weight. Then, like someone stamping out a cigarette butt,<br>\r\nhe ground the bodies into a mushy red paste it oozed up between his toes. Lifting his foot now, he placed the ball of his foot onto the roof of the structure. The<br>\r\nbuilding crumpled under his yellow foot, kicking up a cloud of dust and<br>\r\nsmoke. \"Pichu!\" Pichu exclaimed excitedly, delighting in all the damage he was causing. Though Pichu wanted to take a closer look at the people, so he reached<br>\r\ndown and managed to pick up a handful, He held them in his left paw, It was fantastic, they were like helpless squirming maggots. He threw them to the ground where they plopped by his feet.<br>\r\nPichu then decided to walk directly into the heart of the city.<br>\r\nEach step was different, and each step was a delight. Cars and trucks flattened like tin foil, roads buckled, underground water mains would shoot up tiny<br>\r\nsprays misting his feet and ankles, gas lines ruptured and exploded beneath him as he walked. The concrete gave way, and broke like thin ice over a puddle. Pichu<br>\r\nenjoyed every step, taking the time to grind a crowded bus under his heel, or<br>\r\nto drag his foot through the crowds at a shopping mall.<br>\r\nThe streets were more and more crowded as he approached the tall downtown buildings. More and more people were crushed under his foot, every time he took a step. He could hear the sounds of traffic, emergency sirens, and the din of people screaming, all as if coming from very far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buildings, now were far taller than the ones along the outskirts of the city, Pichu laughed with a hearty \"Pichu!\" as he very much enjoyed antagonizing this little town. Most of the buildings were clothed in a skin of glass and metal, unlike the smaller ones of brick. At one point Pichu caught a glimpse of himself reflected in the shiny mirror like surface. He liked what he saw and smiled cutely, upon reaching to touch his reflection, the building was taller than him though, but that didn't mean that he could'nt easily destroy it, a portion of the glass fell away, revealing a mesh of exposed floors, these were the offices with a view, and what a view they had now, of this gigantic Pichu. His skin was yellow, and he had long pointy ears, and a nimble black nose. Pichu scraped away the first layer from the tall office building, like a cat clawing at a scratching post. Mortar, furniture and people plummeted down sixty stories below as Pichu giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore offices, walls, and tiny furniture was revealed, tiny people bolted through the doors, hoping to escape into the heart of the building. Pichu opened his paw like a wedge, and pushed through the thin inner walls. The outside of the building swayed, showering glass down below. It would be easy to push all the way through to the other side.<br>\r\nPichu grabbed another handful of people, these he squeezed, making a fist. He then opened his hand to examine the results to see if there were any left alive, there were none. Pichu wiped his paw on another building, leaving a red streak, this gave him an idea. Using the red pulp, like paint, he put a streak across his pink cheeks and forehead, then, using his thumb paw, he made a series of red dots across his yellow chest.<br>\r\nChecking out his reflection in another building, he was pleased with<br>\r\nthe results and squealed \"Pi, Pichu, Chu!\", it looked like war paint. Pichu knocked the top floors off the skyscraper, looking down now, he could see the many cubicles revealed for the first time under the blue sky. This time Pichu made a fist, and plunged it down the center of the structure. Once more the building quaked, loosing more glass and concrete. Little fires erupted from inside the building, Pichu could make out tiny figures enwrapped in the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu leaned his huge body against the building, leaning into it, until its exterior collapsed inward, making an impression of the Pichu's body, as if it were sand. People clung to the boys immense paw, to escape the fatal drop. Pichu in turn squashed these people against him, leaving spatters of red. Pichu kneed the lower stories of the building, and the structure gave way, it collapsed upon itself with a series of explosions, Pichu could'nt help but laugh as the structure slipped and shrunk before him. he placed his foot on the remaining heap like it was a trophy, and wiped his paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the next few minutes stepping on and mashing the mobs, rushing by his giant feet. it was like stepping on raspberries. they mashed to juice and pulp under his foot. Occasionally he would bend down to pick up individuals to squeeze between his thumb paw and knuckle, he liked the way they seemed to pop, after considerable wiggling. His thumb nicely covered the whole of the people, only leaving their head, hands and feet showing. He could only slightly feel the bones shatter as he applied pressure. Pinching heads off made him giggle and stick out his tongue, what a mess he was making. Pichu then sighed and looked around. What will this Pokemonzilla do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young Pichu stooped down to look at the marquise of a department store. Bending down into a crouching position like a kid above an ant hill, he put his enormous paw onto the buildings glass and brick wall, as his hand pressed against it, windows shattered sending tiny flecks of glass down to the street below. Traffic was stopped in all directions as terrified people fled their cars, but right now the giant Pichu was preoccupied examining the model-like building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could try to look in the windows of the tall structure, but everything was so small and weak. If he wanted to, he could easily push a hole through the wall. He noticed tiny people running away, down on the sidewalk. A lot of them disappeared beneath the marquis that shaded the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu figured that there must be a lot of people in the structure before him. Reaching down, he grabbed the overhang between his thumb paw and paw, and ripped it off the wall. Plaster shattered and metal gave way, revealing the shattered glass entrance beneath. As he pushed his paw into the entrance, he could see the tiny people trying to escape his grasp. He grabbed a handful, some clung to his paw to avoid falling, others were grabbing on to each other. He brought his hand before his black innocent-looking eyes and watched the panicking worms. Slowly he closed his hand, it felt like a hand full of cooked green beens. He could almost hear the screams. Though he didn't know why, it affected him in a pleasing way. Their tiny bodies popped, like packets filled with ketchup. As he opened his hand, it was spotted red, with twisted bits of what looked like brown, white and red mangled clay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the surviving bug people, sought to run to the outside of Pichu's paw, to avoid another death grip. Pichu smiled and flicked them off his paw. with a shake, then he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building was just above him, but it would'nt give him any problem in destroying it, he made a fist, and crashed his paw through the structure. Bricks and mortar showered down inside, it gave him the reaction he wanted. Crowds started flooding out the door, by his yellow feet, some would look up and scream, others would push those in front of them down, causing a pile up of bodies. Pichu smiled down at them, and let the first surge, pass his giant feet, then lifting his foot he carefully placed it over the swirling mass below. As he slowly lowered his foot, they tickled him, brushing the sensitive bottom of his massive sole. He could feel the panic, as those under his great foot realized they would soon be mashed to jelly into the concrete. <br>\r\nSome tried to crawl up onto his foot, from between his toes, as he bore his foot down harder, the tickle stopped moving, red spurts gushed from below his heel and the ball of his foot. He lifted his foot again, another surge rushed out the shattered store front. Pichu placed his heel on the ground lifting his arch and toes over the escaping mob, again he slowly lowered his foot, the bottom of which was slippery with gore and clinging articles of clothing. Twenty more were trapped beneath his foot. He crouched down again to get a closer look at the damage his foot was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA policeman with a gun ran as close as he could and fired a fuselage of bullets, Pichu didn't feel anything, but was angered by the nerve of this tiny person, he bumped the policeman gently with his toe, the officer fell backwards, Pichu broke the legs of the helpless victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worm like squirming excited Pichu, who then placed his toe directly over the head and shoulder of the tiny man, as he put his weight on the figure, he pushed his toe forward, leaving a long red steak on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up again to his huge height, he was beginning to tire of this game. The ten story, block sized department store below him was severely damaged. Pichu would finish off the job by electrocuting it, and letting it collapse to rubble beneath the incredible surge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shocked the building, it crumpled like a multi layer wedding cake. About the ruined structure, a plume of dust and smoke arose. Pichu could see water, fire and tiny people jumping from the windows of the collapsing walls, this was great fun, and there was still so much to do before him. Pichu roared \"Pichu!\" content with excitement. The city was his. Now what?</span></div></div>",

Up and<br>\r\ndown the river, Pichu could see the numerous bridges and spans that<br>\r\nallowed traffic to flow in and out of the city. Some were simple<br>\r\nrailroad bridges, while others were complex multi level constructions,<br>\r\nas intricate with their woven spans, as piano strings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water of the river was only up to the Pichu's stomach, the bottom was soft and mushy silt, Pichu was careful so as not to slip. As he approached the first fairly large bridge, he marveled at it in curiosity, it's tallest spires were really tall. There were four lanes in each direction, and the cars were<br>\r\nlike matchbox toys. Most were the size of one of Pichu's paw single paw.<br>\r\nA bus was the length one of it's arms.

Pichu nudged the structure with his elbow, the trestles swayed, as if in a fierce storm. A few cars actually flew off the<br>\r\nbridge, plunging into the river below, Pichu nudged the bridge again,<br>\r\na little harder this time, the center portion rocked like a swing,<br>\r\ncracks formed all across the base of the structure, and the two towers<br>\r\nthat supported the span, showed the slightest signs of bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now all traffic had come to a halt on the bridge, Pichu looked at all the traffic surrounding it and<br>\r\ncould see the tiny people abandoning their vehicles to make run for the safty of either side. They were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu managed to lift its foot out of the water, and brought it over<br>\r\nthe bridge, so that he easily straddled it. A long yellow bus was right<br>\r\nbelow him, he reached out towards it and grabbed the bus, then brang it close to it's face. As Pichu held it close to his face, the driver gunned the engine futily. Holding the bus with both arms, he gently pressed his thumb paws together, the windows shattered as the metal sides collapsed inward, crushing the helpless riders. Casually, Pichu tossed the bus into the river at his feet. it bubbled and sank quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu again lifted his foot, only this time he set it directly on the bridge, as he bared his weight upon it, the steel cables snapped, portions of asphalt and iron collapsed into the waters. Could the bridge support Pichu? Not a chance! The center part of the span, snapped throwing all the cars into the water. Pichu continued to wade up the river, noting how the houses were getting larger and taller. <br>\r\nOn either bank of the river there were warehouses, docks, and shipyards. The largest of the buildings were still only the size of a bed, Pichu was heading up the river where the \"tall\" buildings were. <br>\r\nComing down the river was a large tanker, it must of been five feet long, to Pichu, who splashed down into the shallow water to get a better close-up look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gray and rust colored, and had two smoke stacks that billowed dark<br>\r\nsmoke. It couldn't maneuver very well, and it couldn't go very fast either.<br>\r\nEven lying flat on his belly, the river wasn't deep enough to cover his<br>\r\nback, Pichu smiled and chuckled \"Chu!\" as the water he displaced, rushed up the banks, knocking down some of the smaller wooden buildings. The water felt good against his bare skin, and it cooled him off a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu grabbed the freighter and lifted it clear of the water. The props were spinning wildly in the air. As Pichu clutched the boat tighter, the metal crumpled like a tin soda can, Pichu grabbed the rest of the ship with his other paw, and pulled it in half, the crew spilled out into the waters. Squeezing tighter, the metal compressed like tin foil. The Pichu scooped up a group of people that were bobbing in the water, he<br>\r\nsquashed them easily. His paw was red with the remains, he rinsed in the water which also turned red, and discarded the crumpled ship, it quickly disappeared beneath the murky waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu stood up again, volumes of water poured off of him. Pichu wanted to walk off the side of the river, but Pichu also wanted to I'll dry off a bit.<br>\r\nThe city is up ahead, but for now, Pichu wanted to have some fun with these little buildings. Stepping onshore, he placed his foot carefully onto a waterfront<br>\r\nwarehouse. It collapsed to splinters beneath his foot. His next step<br>\r\nhit a water tower that gushed it's contents before falling. All the<br>\r\nwhile, people, hundreds of them scurried from before his massive form.<br>\r\nPichu shuffled his feet, watching smoke and dust lift, from wherever<br>\r\nhe placed his foot. The stack of power lines, at the generator plant,<br>\r\nsparked and glowed blue and pink as they fell under his foot. The high<br>\r\nvoltage gently tingled him, but no more. Cars speeding along the riverside freeway were flattened like roaches, picking up a car, Pichu was delighted to see the driver and his passenger dive out the door onto his paw. Pichu crumpled the car and discarded it, being careful not to let these two people get away. They stood almost about as tall as a paper clip, and Pichu could make out that one was a man, and the other a plump lady. She screamed when she realized the boy was looking directly at her. The man pulled a gun and quickly emptied it, as if it could even be felt by the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu carefully lifted the man out of his right paw, where the woman was lying, she had lost her balance and slipped backwards. Pichu held the man out over empty space, at it's shoulders. The man would have been lucky if Pichu just dropped him to his death. Instead, Pichu placed the man gently on the ground, he set the woman not far from the man carefully. The woman was screaming all the time. Then the<br>\r\nboy stood up to his full height. The whole time, Pichu had a wicked smile as if he knew what he was about to do. The man was trying to make a run for it, when the Pichu lowered his toe, breaking the mans feet. The tiny man tumbled over. The woman screamed some more. Pichu moved his foot just a tiny bit, placing his toe directly over the mans rump, then he slowly pressed down, the man<br>\r\nsquirmed, a red puddle forming from his mashed lower limbs. The boy,<br>\r\nlifting his toe again just a little more, he placed it over his victims<br>\r\nbelly and chest. He could almost hear the little man screaming \"No,<br>\r\nnooo\" more blood actually gushed, drenching the woman who could only<br>\r\nwatch and scream herself silly. Was the man dead yet? Pichu lifted his<br>\r\nfoot away to look at the mangled pulp with two arms and a head. It<br>\r\nreminded him of some of the bugs that it had seen in the past that had been mooshed, only now there was this pretty red. Pichu knelt down, tempted to see more of what the human body looked like, so Pichu placed his thumb paw directly on the head, he pushed down, it easily gave with a pleasing pop. The brains, it seems were a light pink, like shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming lady was paralyzed with fear, there was a spot of brown, and yellow. Pichu became angered with all the screaming and yelled \"Pichuuuuu!\", as he pinched her between his thumb paw and paw and squeezed her like a tube of tooth paste. She gave way to moosh, between in his, as a jet of blood spurted, drops of it sprayed the Pichu face. He licked it of, reminding him of how good it tasted (back with the incident of Dr. Garcia), and then placed the red on his finger, to his tongue. there wasn't enough to taste, but Pichu was starting to get hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu at first didn't notice more Apache helicopters (like the last ones) that were combat ready, approaching him. Pichu grinned, \"Pichu...\". Will Pichu fight them, or just ignore them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The armies were massing on the hills, on the outskirts of the city, it was clear that they wanted to confront the gigantic Pichu, with the minimum of damage to the civilian buildings.<br>\r\nIsn't that just too bad for Pichu, who did not like being the target of a sting of hits from the cannons of the war helicopters.<br>\r\nTwelve Apaches in formation headed towards his face, each with a ruby laser sight line, pointing to his eyes. Puffs of smoke indicated the launch of the air to ground heat seeking missiles, while vapor trails marked the trajectory of the ground based missiles. <br>\r\nA line up of sixty tanks approached in formation, their cannons blasting, their sights were focused on the Pichu's exposed stomach area. A number of surveillance jets passed over Pichu's head, reporting back to their base commanders, observing far from the melee. Then there was the ground troops, like a marching swath, the tiny soldiers covered the ground, behind the tanks. Their swastikas flying behind the fighting troops, indicating where the command units were stationed. This was their concentrated effort as saving their city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat seeking missiles struck Pichu on his sides and stomach area, the made large explosions, but they might as well have been blasting at twelve foot thick steel plates. Pichu felt a slight sting, this did little but anger him, another volley was launched, It was the shot's toward his eyes, that bothered Pichu, he shielded them with his wrist, as the cannons let loose. Again, the blasts exploded on Pichu's arm, without so much as breaking his skin.<br>\r\nThe Helicopters backed off, and circled around for another pass at the giant Pokemon. They were fast, but Pichu's mouse-like reflexes were terrific, Pichu whipped his hand, grabbing the first machine, and like swatting at a gnat, Pichu easily knocked it out of the sky, it plummeted to the ground in a fiery explosion.<br>\r\nThe Apaches broke formation, now each one was zooming in toward a different body part, hoping for a more massive hit. They were desperate to draw blood. One flew behind Pichu's, and came up behind his head, cannons blasting, Pichu swatted it like a mosquito, it squashed against Pichu's back, tickling it slightly. With Full weaponry blazing, five helicopters made a charge towards Pichu's face, They had accurately surmised that the only place Pichu might be vulnerable would be at his eyes, they were going in for a point blank hit. Pichu swung around with furious \"Pichu!\"s, the blasts directly hitting the side of Pichu's face sending a trickle of blood down the boys cheek, now they were sending their most powerful weapons up against the titanic Chu. Most of the missiles had no effect, other than a short flash followed by a sting, more often than not, Pichu was able to nimbly dodge the trails, and then retaliate by charging the launchers. At the first volley, Pichu just stood still, seeking to gauge the worst that they could dish out, but after being hit, although not hard enough to be anything more than a nuisance, He decided to go on the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, all the Helicopters had to go. The Jets were trickier, but after the air forces were taken over, he would mop up the ground assault. They attacked savagely and just as quickly were dispatched. Pichu swung, with speedy reflexes, at speeds that the ground troops could not anticipate, knocking aircraft out of the sky, and directing the fiery wrecks toward the forces below. Pichu could catch even the fastest helicopters in his hand, with crushing force. He jabbed and punched, dodged and blocked, all the while delivering death blows toward his attackers. The jet bombers were flying higher than his reach, dropping their most powerful payload, one hit, actually made a substantial gash. A river of blood ran down the Pichu's arm, this gave the ground troops some hope. Pichu searched quickly for some projectile to launch back at them, he had to do something to bring the speedy high flying craft down. Pilots soon realized the folly of flying low, Pichu pulled them from out of the air in mid-flight, and dashed them to the ground, the smart ones kept their altitude. Pichu swooped to the ground, grabbing a hand full of tanks, these he jettisoned, like a child skipping stones on a lake, at the high flyers. Pichu laughed as a tank tore through the fuselage of one of the slower moving bombers, as the plane broke up, a puff of twenty parachutes dotted the sky. Drifting closer and closer to Pichu's anxious grasp. Pichu tore the screaming paratroopers to bloody shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pichuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!\" he roared, Like David defending himself against Goliath, the Pichu proved to be an uncanny shot, The sky was full of parachuters abandoning their doomed craft. He grabbed handfuls of tanks, directing them at the remaining jets, and sometimes at the ground based launchers.<br>\r\nTerrified, the tank commanders, reversed their weapons, not aware of the ground forces that were following close behind. Many of their own men were caught under the treds of the retreating tanks. The generals seeing how their own tanks were being used as weapons against the aircraft, commanded the tanks to get out of there, but where could they go to escape Pichu's clutches? The larger slow flying bombers all met fiery ends, but there was one last bomber quickly entering the range, it was flying twice as fast, and Pichu figured that this was probably the biggest weapon yet, it was flying so fast that it made a pass at the young pre-evolved form of Pikachu, shooting a red beam, Pichu grabbed at it, without strain and missed it, it got by him, leaving a long but shallow cut along his side. \"Pichu?\", the cut didn't bother him, it was only a scratch. He followed the path of the jet, as it banked left and circled around while climbing to safety. It was going to make another pass. As it started its next run, Pichu noticed a bay door opening in the front, it was armed with some kind of missile, it was aimed straight at his chest, it was approaching super fast, Pichu didn't wait for the launch, he ducked low, the jet didn't fire it's main weapon, but it darted past Pichu's large diamond-shaped ear, he had been cut again! \"Pichu!\" wined Pichu.<br>\r\nAngrily he grabbed a handful of tanks, and flung them at the retreating bomber, it still had it's major bomb, and was going to make another attempt. As a race car entering it's final curve, the plane banked and adjusted altitude for the approach. Pichu crouched like a catcher waiting for the plane, he had a plan. The jet was flying low now, the pilots watched the mountain of a Pichu loom larger, they set the data and came up with a path that would lead to a direct hit. Just the concussion from the impact alone would stop the giant Pokemon's heart, all they needed was one shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith grim determination to carry out his plan, Pichu held his position. The jet was darting in racing toward it's target. Pichu stood still and stuck out it's tongue a little, the countdown came, Ready, Aim... The boy at the last moment, like a bullfighter stepped to the side, and spun to his right, the jet passed too close, the pilot and crew were jolted as Pichu grabbed the wing of the craft in his spinning left paw. Without letting up speed, Pichu spun the jet back in the direction of the troops. The weapon fired and the boy watched as many of the ground troops in the back, were incinerated by their own weaponry. The jet itself could not right itself and adjust it's course. It slammed like a fireball into the headquarter station, setting off a second ground explosion. \"Chu, Pi, Chu!\" Shouted the Pichu, Now it's Pichu's turn...<br>\r\nHe vented his fury on the ground troops. Their weapons were useless. Die you miserable scum, Pichu's expression seemed to say, as he stomped on the retreating forces, heads were smashed for miles around, The ground ran red with the blood of the fallen. Pichu was breathing heavy, after the slaughter, but he was elated. Now he would do his job and finish off the city. Pichu sang as he trotted along the path towards it's next stop. Where will Pichu head next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The row of apartments blocked Pichu's path, each was about twenty stories tall, they stood in formation. For some reason they reminded Pichu of dogs, German Shepherds standing still in six rows of four.<br>\r\nEach was a broad standing structure, Thick in mass, brick and glass, just above the boys kneecaps. All were remarkably identical, like they were stamped out. Dog size dominos, lying on edge.<br>\r\nThe boy approched the complex from the middle of the broad side of the buildings. This was a major complex, Pichu figured the buildings to be older than some of the skyscrapers he had leveled downtown. <br>\r\nThose were mostly metal and glass, these were all made of bricks, with smaller windows. This is going to be fun, Pichu liked the way the brick structures crumpled, as they kind of fell into themselves.<br>\r\nSurrounding all the buildings were the parking lots, filled with toy-sized sized cars. Pichu placed both of his feet in the parking lot, compressing about 5 vehicles beneath his weight.<br>\r\nThe people were trying to escape in their cars, but the parking lots were hopelessly jammed, even if Pichu hadn't blocked their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPedestrians were fleeing from the structures in droves, still there was no way they could totally evacuate their buildings in the short time they had left. <br>\r\nPichu took another step closer, wiping out some more vehicles. It would be easy to smash the buildings with it's arms, bringing them down to the ground, but Pichu wanted to do something different.<br>\r\nHe crouched down to get a better look at the crowds swarming around his feet. This was just so neat. The little people were so easily dashed, <br>\r\nHe crushed them with his paws, then with his feet. Their reactions were pretty much the same, as he reached for them; they fell and screamed.<br>\r\nSome tried to evade him, and suffered the worse for bringing themselves to his attention. These he would make special work of.<br>\r\nOne man fancied he could escape by dodging the Pichu hands. When he was caught, the boy proceeded to tear the tiny figure apart. First the arms were plucked off with a spray of blood, then the feet, then the legs. Pichu squashed the rest of the body with his thumb paw, then he put his thumb paw to his mouth. Pichu began to salivate as he licked the plood with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu was hungry. Pichu was standing up before the broad side of the middle building in the row. The buildings now reached up to his head. <br>\r\nPichu found another person, this time a woman. \"Pichu...\", Pichu licked its maw as it quickly popped her alive into it's mouth. She had the consistency of a marshmallow. Pichu used his front teeth to biting her, she abruptly stopped moving, then Pichu chewed a little then swallowed with a loud \"gulp!\".<br>\r\nPichu plucked another screaming victim, this time from the parking lot. As Pichu brought the tiny figure to its mouth, Pichu could almost imagine it screaming \"noooo..\". This one Pichu mashed with it's molars.<br>\r\nHowever, eating them one at a time just wasn't enough to fill Pichu's hungry belly. He dragged the edge of his paw like a scoop, Pichu counted 4 people in his paw, then Pichu leaned its head back and dropped them, struggling, directly into it's mouth. Pichu held them in it's mouth for a moment before deciding to chew. Pichu could feel them moving on its tounge. <br>\r\nThey made a good mouthful, and Pichu chewed way past the last kicking and struggling. The warm blood tasted good. Their clothing was swallowed with the carcasses. The clothing left a stringy aftertase in Pichu's maw, Pichu didn't like it though.<br>\r\nPichu grabbed another handful, these Pichu gobbled up quickly. As Pichu chewed, blood would dribble from its mouth, Pichu used his bare arm to wipe the excess from its lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu still standing up, decided to do in the buildings by just plowing into them. As Pichu slowly approached the first structure like a bulldozer, Pichu saw people leaping from the windows. Better to die in the fall, than be crushed in the collapsing building they use to call home.<br>\r\nPichu's stomach touched the first building, lightly at first. The bricks gave the walls a softer feeling, like a pie crust. Pichu savored the sensation as the building collapsed about its chest.<br>\r\nThe brick walls gave way, then the inner structures, these collapsed like cookie wafers, inward, revealing more furniture, crumbling drywall, and trapped people.<br>\r\n\"Pichu, Pi, Pichu, Chu!\", Pichu laughed, giggling as it raised its paws above its head and continued stomping, plowing into the next structure. Still hungry, Pichu took another handful of people to his mouth. These Pichu chewed slowly and thoughtfully. Then another. Pichu kept the clothing in a wad in its mouth, rather than swallow it. <br>\r\nThe building actually tickled Pichu as he plowed through it, Pichu continued on his stomoping through the next building in the row. Like an unstoppable moving mountain, Pichu laughed as each building collapsed. <br>\r\nPichu noticed on top of the structures, what looked like little cups, a water reservoir it appeared to be, Pichu lifted one up, and poured the water into its mouth it was cool and refreshing after the warm blood. Excellent! Three on each building, about forty gallons each, Pichu would be able to drink his full with his meal.<br>\r\nAfter about eight mouthfulls, Pichu was getting a little more picky. Pichu spit out the chewed wad of clothing it had collected in its mouth. Pichu thought it could do without the clothing, though peeling each, one by one would take forever. Pichu picked up a little boy about the age of 9, and ripped the shirt off, then the pants and shoes. Pichu observed the tiny figure kicking in its paw and sighed \"Pichu...\".<br>\r\nPichu compared the figure to itself. He could make out the tiny hands in detail, the figure was a pale flesh tone, the boy had long silky hair and had bright blue eyes. After a moment of silence, Pichu began laughing.<br>\r\nJust perfect in every detail. Pichu brought the figure to its awaiting maw, and virtually sucked him in like you do with spaghetti. It struggled and pounded at the Pichu's jaws, as Pichu severed the figure in half with his front teeth, then swallowed.<br>\r\nActually, undressed was much better. Pichu continued in a straight path, deliberately plowing into the structures against his chest and belly, while occasionally selecting delicate morsels from the surrounding grounds.<br>\r\nPichu decided after sampling, that woman tasted a little better than men, though Pichu couldn't say why, even its language. Pichu examined a particularly well formed screaming lady more carefully than the man. She curled up each time Pichu tried to touch her with its enormous hand. She was pinker than the guy. Pichu casually smashed anther building while examining her. Hundreds of people crushed between the collapsing brick walls and Pichu's feet. Pichu tossed the woman high in the air and caught her in its teeth, like a piece of popcorn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu had carved out a U shaped niche between the buildings Pichu had already leveled. It resembled a horse shoe shape, or maybe an old armchair, with two buildings extended on each side, as the arms. <br>\r\nPichu spun around in a sitting position, with its back toward the building. Its feet were extended outwards, flat on the ground dangling over the ruins of two buildings and the parking lots. He looked at the two \"armrest\" buildings flanking it on either side. They both had entrances, in their center that poured little people towards it, into the street, from both sides. Pichu casually placed its hands plam down, into the fleeing crowd. This position wasn't all that comfortable, so Pichu decided to lean back a little, using the building behind for support. As Pichu leaned his body back, it could feel the soft crumbling of the moldings and cornices.<br>\r\nThe corners of the broad building fell foward, as the center was pushed in by the Pichu's back. Uh-oh, it's going to go, Pichu leaned back a little futher, the building gave way as the girders bent back, the structure seemed to become soft and toppled, Pichu fell backwards, laughing like a little child \"Pichu, Pi!!\" Pichu shouted having so much fun. <br>\r\nPichu was now lying flat on its back, the bumps of rubble, cars and people under him were hardly felt by the Pichu's thick yellow skin.<br>\r\nWith his large enormous ears close to the ground, Pichu could better hear their screams, without looking, Pichu scooped up a handful of people and placed them on his chest and belly for observation.<br>\r\nThey were bewildered and tried to stand and run for safty, away from the boys gaze. Some appeared hurt, and unable to scurry, Pichu flattened the lame ones with paw finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu wasn't hungry anymore, but this was too much fun. Pichu scooped its paw to catch them and watched as they tried to avoid the Pokemon's enormous hand. Pichu dangled one, just holding the human by his leg, then Pichu pinched the other leg, and holding the figure like a wish bone, between its two paws, Pichu gently split the figure in half, looking intently as first the clothing was sprayed red, then as Pichu tore the figure, Pichu could make out the intestines untwining, he ripped further and could make out the messy deep red purple blob or the lungs and heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this wrapped up in one neat little package. The little buggers tickled as they scurried across the long field of yellow that was Pichu's belly, its belly was large and slippery, causing some of the people to slip off.<br>\r\nTired of lying down, Pichu leaned up again, brushing the cars, trees and people off its back, Pichu ran its paws through its silky large ears. How'd the little buggers get up there? Pichu sat up, the survivors on its chest and belly slid down and tumbled off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building next to Pichu resembled a saddle ready to be sat on, so Pichu stood up. \"Pichu!\" Pichu chuckled, Placeing its feet on either side of the building, Pichu slowly lowered himself down to a crouching jocky like position, Pichu straddled the building, hovering just above the structure, it slowly lowered himself on top of the \"saddle\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe center of the building sagged down, as Pichu rested its weight upon it, the roof buckled, Pichu brought its feet together to get better balance but just the opposite happened, Pichu tarted to fall to the side as the building gave way. It was like sitting on a cake. <br>\r\nActually it crumpled more like a building made of saltines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere a building went down, smoke and dust exploded into the sky. Pichu was standing up again, looking at the figures clinging to its yellow form. Pichu examined the ruins between its feet, standing up, looking at the people holding on to it, from its sides to its feet, Pichu brushed them to the ground and mashed them mercilessly under its toes.<br>\r\nKicking up hills of ruined people, Pichu's feet stained red, like the one who mashes wine grapes. The more Pichu stomped, for some reason, the more its anger and contempt of them grew. It was more than their being so small and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu grabbed lightly a hand full of people so as not to damage them, and deposited them on the roof of the last remaining building of the complex. Pichu smiled in anticipation of its next accomplishment.<br>\r\nPichu piled another handfull onto the roof, high above the ground, then another and then still more, till the whole roof was filled with the panicing crowd.<br>\r\nPichu filled the roof till there was no more room for any others. Pichu smiled at the soft cushion it had made for itself. Slowly Pichu turned and lowered his rear onto the squirming mass of people beneath him. They kicked, punched and tried to hold off the decending weight, as its rear squashed them down, the roof of the building caved in. Two stories compressing upon themselves, puffing smoke and dust.<br>\r\nPichu laughed. \"Chu!\" Pichu said, as it rode it all the way to the ground. \"Pi!\", Pichu shouted in glee. Should Pichu continue its mass killing</span></div></div>",

Finding no alternative, Matt began to climb. Since T.K was so big, climbing the balls was like climbing a rock climbing wall. It took awhile, but he managed to reach the top.</span></div></div>",

He stretched and sat up, rubbing his eyes, wondering where he was. Then he remembered! The cave, the growing, the fighting. He stood up, way, way up, and looked around. He was enormous. His feet alone covered miles of ground and his head was nestled amongst the clouds. He looked down and saw several tiny specks moving around his feet. He assumed they were Digimon. Then he remembered his little big brother. He bent down and searched for him, not knowing he had become trapped in his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Matt was trying to keep his balance as T.K constantly moved around. Finally, he slipped out through a hole in his briefs and landed on his pant leg. When T.K stood up again, Matt fell a great distance and landed on his soft foot. T.K stratched his head as he wondered where Matt had gotten too. Suddenly a strange light engulfed him and he began to shrink. It seemed the rock that had granted him this massive size was finally wearing off. Unfortunately for Matt and Tai, they were both shrinking with him! When T.K regained his normal size, Matt was an eigth of an inch tall and Tai was a sixteenth of an inch tall! T.K grabbed the rocks, one with the Crest of Courage, one with the Crest of Friendship, and one with the Crest of Hope, and headed back to the Real World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Matt and Tai, wherever they are, are fine.\" T.K thought. \"They're both old enough to take care of themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to his room, he hung up his hat and started to do homework. Matt, meanwhile, had jumped off his enormous brother's foot and was standing in carpet that was twice as tall as he was! That was when he noticed the rock with the Crest of Friendship on it. If he could reach that, then he could return to normal size. T.K had left it by the foot of his bed. Matt started to run towards it.</span></div></div>",

W...wouldnt you rather a foot massage?\" he tried to bargain, \"I give a great foot massage!\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that response only made the grip around Matt a little tighter!  To make matters worse, Tai mocked the little punk even more! \"Aww... dont tell me my widdle master's getting scawed! You know Matt, you look small from up here! Just like a bug! ...A bug ready to be squashed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. Of all the things to come back to bite Matt in the ass... nonetheless, that's cruel irony for ya!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tai had Matt firmly in the grip of his left hand and his boxers firmly in the grip of his right. He was starting to get impatient and that wasn't good on any level for Matt. His mind raced as he tried to think of something to do. He could just swallow his pride and wank his best friend and then all would be forgiven...or so Tai said. What proof did Matt have that Tai meant what he said? He could easily just be lieing to get a free whole body hand job from Matt as a hybrid revenge/pleasure punishment...thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was decided. There was absolutely no way he was going to wrestle with Tai's thing no matter what Tai did. So now the only course of action would be to escape. And so Matt devised a simple plan to escape from Tai once and for all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tai. I'll do it.\" Matt said, hanging his head in a posture of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai grinned and said, \"That's sensible of you. Now get ready for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai pulled down his boxers and Matt got a huge eyeful of Tai's hard, pointing dick. It was bigger than he thought it would be, even at his shrunken size. Matt tensed up, looking beyond the cock to the floor. As soon as Tai released him he would jump and escape from this horrifying punishment. Slowly, Tai lowered Matt until he was hovering over the phallic monument and then dropped him. Matt landed on his feet and bolted for the dick head. Before Tai knew what was happening Matt had reached the head and jumped off into the wide open blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt fell and landed safely on the leaf strewn ground of the Digiworld. He hit the ground running, heading towards the dense undergrowth. Tai, cursing this turn of events, quickly pulled his pants up and ran after Matt. Unfortunately, for Tai, Matt had disappeared safely into the jungle like grass and flowers. He frantically began to search for him, but slowly and surely, made his way in the opposite direction of the one Matt had escaped to. Matt watched Tai slowly move away with relief, glad he had escaped from his horrible fate. It didn't take long for Tai to disappear down a path leading deeper into the jungle. Soon, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt walked out into the open space and looked around. Nearby there had to be a terminal he could use to get back to the Real World and find help. He began to search, hoping it wouldn't take too long. However, not a three minutes had passed before there was rustling in the bushes. Panicing, Matt looked for a place to hide. He only just managed to conceal himself before the massive form of one of his friends appeared.</span></div></div>",

Matt recognizes this colossal boy as Davis Motomiya, fellow digi-destined and close friend of his little brother... at least that's what he heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like him and Matt are very close, but at least Davis doesnt hold any huge grudge against him. He would probably be a better choice to help Matt get his size back than Tai... but then again, Myotismon would be a better choice than Tai!<br>\r\nNonetheless, Matt sighed and took a big step toward the towering teen... and took an even bigger step way the hell back to avoid being stomped by Davis's pacing around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked up and stared at the giant's disgruntled as he constantly stomped around in circles. 'Geez, what's his problem?' Matt wondered.<br>\r\n\"Arrgghh...\" Davis growled in frustration as he continued to stomp huge footprints all over the ground... finally, he vented a little anger by punching a tree! Whether it hurt or not didnt really matter at this point!<br>\r\n\"I dont get it!\" he pouts, \"Ive been working my butt off for Kari! Ive given her plenty of attention, did the things she wanted to do, hell, I even lent her MY shoulder to cry on! And yet she STILL continues to cling to T.K.!\" Finally, Davis stops in his tracks and sighs, \"Im 10 times a man T.K. is... what does Kari see in that jerk that she doesnt see in me?\" His little blue digimon Veemon just stares up at the sky as if he's deep in thought as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aint got a clue,\" Veemon answered, \"probably the same thing my lovely Gatomon sees in that little twerp, Patamon. Pst! I can digivolve into an angelic stallion if I wanted to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet. It wasnt enough that Matt's enormous reign of terror blew up in his face, let alone being left at the mercy of Tai's wang! Now the only other hope of being rescued lies with someone that has a grudge against his brother that seems to be close to the sister of someone that's holding a grudge against HIM! Lord can only imagine what Davis would do to Matt to 'vent his anger' if he found Matt. The best idea would be to stay as far away from Davis as possible until he cools down... too bad a certain writer thinks otherwise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOINK!\" before Matt could even think of running away, a pair of blue fingers with untrimmed nails picked his tiny body off of the floor and brought him to redeyed-level. Normally, Matt would scream... but he tried to hold it in just to make sure Davis wont hear him. BUT...<br>\r\n\"Whatcha got there, Veemon?\" the purple-haired tamer noticed his digimon snagged someone and went in for a closer look. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened at what Veemon caught! Veemon just looked at Matt strangely, \"I think it's a bug that bears a striking resemblance to T.K.'s brother, Matt. ...Want me to kill it?\"<br>\r\n\"M...MATT?!!\" he rubbed his eyes in disbelief, \"What happened to you?! How did you get so....??!!\" Not wanting to get into TOO much detail, Matt just cut to the point, \"Im not too sure, but it had something to do with a crystal. Look, there isnt much time! We need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as Matt tried to explain himself, Veemon was constantly tapping his tamer's shoulder as if he had a GOOD idea! \"Hey Davis! I know how we can get T.K. and Patamon to stop seeing our women! We use Matt as blackmail. We'll tell them that if they dont promise to stop seeing Kari and Gatomon, we'll squash Matt like a bug! Not a bad idea, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse even, his tamer looked back at him with an intrigued look on his face! \"You dont say...!\" Matt constantly shook his head, \"NO! WAIT!!! DONT DO IT!! HEAR ME OUT!!\" He even thought of the worst outcome... what if T.K. decided to let Davis and Veemon kill him? What if he's got a grudge against Matt for something he did in the past, too?!<br>\r\nThat was a risk he couldnt afford to take... so without any other choice, he bargained. \"Wait!\" Matt spoke up, \"You dont have to do this! There are plenty other ways to win a girl's heart. And I know a lot of 'em!\"<br>\r\nThis actually caused both Davis and Veemon to raise their eyebrows in unison, \"Oh really? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt waved his little finger, \"Uh uh uh! Im not revealing any of my secrets... not for free anyway! All I need you to do is help me back to normal size, and I'll teach you all my special tricks to winning over your precious Kari &amp; Gatomon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should we believe you?\" Davis asked him. Matt just flashed a devious grin, \"Trust me! This is Matt Ishida. No girl has yet to resist MY charms... and neither will they resist yours if you help me out!\"<br>\r\nHe was cocky, but he wasnt lying! Women fell head over heels for Matt on a regular basis. Being quite the teendream, it was understandable! No straight woman could resist his charms just like no gay man could resist Rick Astley's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was up to his captors to decide whether to take up his generous offer... or just stick to blackmailing their rivals!<br>\r\nWhich was more of a benefit to them? Extortion... or charm?</span></div></div>",

Well, to Matt at least. Tai took his friend and plopped him quickly down at the base of his cock. Matt landed and slipped, grabbing onto the skin to hold on.<br>\r\nTai let out a bellowing laugh at Matt's Misfortune, pushing him back on with a finger. Matt straddled the cock, and looked around, not really knowing where to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"here, I'll help ya out little guy!\" Tai said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai then spit on his hand and lubed up his cock, making it slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now climb to my head!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt began the slimy slippery climb, pleasuring his master all the way, by slipping. When he arrived, Tai flexed his cock, causing Matt to slip back down again. Tai let out a moan of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"awww yeah, keep that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt continued repeating this motion, climbing up and sliding back down till a good amount of pre was dripping from Tai's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

Tai wasn't even recognizable anymore; just a small, red stain on his flawless sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a bug.\" Matt looked down at his sock, seeing that it had also been stained with Tai's messy innards. \"Ugh, he ruined a perfectly good sock.

Which i remind you are over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBB's giant socks were next to the ocean, which had turned a little green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking toward the city. \"Should we stop him?\" asked Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing we can do..\" answered Cyborg. \"He'll stink up the while city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy entered the city. People felt the ground shake and saw the giant green teen, and an from his incredibly smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy watched a big green foot pass by him. \"Cool.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy was crossing the street, and saw Beast Boy. He was too frozen in fear to move. The giant sole came toward him. He was still too scared. The foot came down but fortunately, he was in a good spot, when the foot landed he was between BB's big and second toes. The foot lifted up and went on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy!\" a scared woman yelled. She ran into the street and hugged her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jimmy, I thought you were going to be squished!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Starfire were at a grocery store, in the checkout line. They felt the ground shake. Robin looked out a window and and say a giant green foto come down and lift back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..\" he said. \"Wait a minute...that foot was green! Beast Boy? It couldn't be!\"</span></div></div>",

How could you not notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was absorbed in choosing this paper or plastic.\" She said, indicating the two different kinds of bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'd better check it out.\" Robin said. Even if it wasn't Beast Boy he still had to be sure that whoever, or whatever, was walking through the city wasn't planning on destroying it. Although the stink was bad enough. So Robin and Starfire, still holding a paper bag full of groceries, ran outside to go after the giant. By this time, Beast Boy had already walked to a different part of town, but there were quite a few foot prints left behind so they could follow. Robin jumped on his motorcycle while Starfire flew after him, trying to keep the bag from spilling. Robing was having a tough time trying to avoid falling into one of the foot prints since they were all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all distractions and what not aside, they managed to finally catch up with Beast Boy. Starfire landed next to Robin's motorcycle and said, \"Robin why is Beast Boy so very much larger than normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Robin said, shocked at seeing their former shortest member so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to go and ask him.\" Starfire said, flying towards Beast Boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy turned around as he heard Starfire fly towards him. He grinned and said, \"Hey Star! Pretty impressive huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but how did it happen? Is this normal for your species?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, Cyborg invented some crazy growth ray and it hit me by mistake. But I decided fighting crime would be easier now, not to mention it's a whole lot easier getting around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I woud imagine so, but--Oh my word! What is that smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor whatever reason, Starfire had not noticed the enormous stench rising from Beast Boy's feet until now. She felt a little dizzy as she covered her nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude come on! My feet do not stink that bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was staying right where he was, at least fifty feet away from BB's massive smelly feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should go wash them somewhere.\" Starfire suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you should just shrink back down to normal!\" Robin yelled from where he was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I haven't got to do anything yet! Well, if all you're going to do is lecture me, I'll have fun on my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Beast Boy left Robin and Starfire behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now Robin?\" Starfire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't sure. Beast Boy looked mad and if they kept bothering him who knows what he might do? Then again, if he was mad he might cause damage to the city in his 'fun'. What to do...</span></div></div>",

Cyborg and Raven also called towards her saying \"Don't lose to him Starfire.

He paid no attention as he stepped on cars or people. Heck, he sometimes stopped just to kick over a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile Robin was looking up furiously at what Beast Boy had done. 'He'll pay for this! I'll make him suffer in ways that people can't suffer.' Thats when it dawned on him what Beast Boy said. \"Cyborg what does he mean that she'll become a giant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well from the way I had made the device, it can genetically change a person to the point that they can pass on the virus that turns one into a giant.\" Cyborg told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And you were planning on sharing this info with us when?\" Raven asked him, her arms crossed as the top of the tower was blown right off the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Umm!? Never!\" Cyborg croaked as their two of them gave him the greatest death glares he had ever gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"NEVER!?\" Both screamed at him at once.

How was I suppose to know that in a person who is completly organic that it turns them into a 1000ft. giant?\" Cyborg asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"By testing it first!\" Both screamed at him, Cyborg instantly shrank down to a chibi form.</span></div></div>",

The landing of her body had sent a thunderous shock through the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The regular titans fell down on their faces from the strength of it. \"Man she's big if she can do that.\" Cyborg said as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddnly a fist hit the back of his head, sending pain through it. \"That's the girl I like that your talking about!\" Robin said angrily as he stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay! Okay! I won't say that anymore!\" Cyborg said as he rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So she grew too. Why did you make the virus do this?\" Raven asked him, confused by how he could do such a ominous thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well in a body part machine and organic it would never leave the body and constantly keep it organic. As such, it wouldn't be passed on to another person. But if it was in someone who is organic then the virus spreads. It was a side affect I could never get out of the system.\" Cyborg told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Robin and Starfire were angry about the virus. But to them that could wait till later. \"In anycase what do we do about that?\" Raven said as she pointed to the giant Beast Boy as he headed over for Starfire. He bent down and wrapped his arms around her from behind and began to whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Starfire, join me in my crusade. Together the world could be ruled by a King and a Queen. We could rule it together\" Beast Boy said huskily as he felt her rising up from the ground. Turning around, Starfire looked into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She wrapped her arms around his shoulders and bean to kiss him. The two giants embraced happily as if this was some sort of dream. \"Yes BB! Of course I will!\" Starfire said happily as they kissed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile the other three looked up, their mouthes gaping open as they saw what was going on before them. \"I don't believe this.\" Rave said, her usually emotionless face showing emotions she didn't think she would show in a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Neither can I!\" Robin said angrily \"When did they become..\" But was interuppted by Cyborg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About two months ago.\" He told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"YOU KNEW!\" Both screamed at the top of their lungs, Cyborg backed off by a few feet and sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, they told me to keep it a secret. It was around the time that you spent all your time focused on Slade.\" Cyborg explained to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just great!

Not very long, it seemed. Beast Boy felt the pole hitting him over and over again like a gnat biting. He reached down and plucked up Robin in his hands. Still Robin fought, kicking, biting, whacking the monolithic white gloved fingers with all his might.

With a big huff he shouted \"HEY! I THINK YOUR JOKES AREN'T FUNNY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was all it took the giant as he was cuddling his girlfriend, crashing into buildings as they made out. His eyes were filled with anger as he looked away from Star towards Aqualad. \"I need to take care of something.\" Beast Boy told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know.\" Starfire giggled as Beast Boy walked into the water as Aqualad swam away. Changing into a super sized Giant Squid, Beast Boy went under the water. Not realizing that was what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Beast Boy was changing into a squid, Aqualad had summoned a armada of Sharks, Whales, Squids, Eels, Rays, Dolphins, and more. The swarms attacked the giant squid with all their might. Some using electricity. Others their teeth, tentacles, horns, and more. But nothing even dented the giants skin. And thats when Beast Boy thought 'This is too easy!' And began to spin in a tornado fashion. Soon a vachuum like tornado had opened, sucking in all the water life and Aqualad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh Great!\" Aqualad said as he vanished into it. Rising higher into the air, the tornado touched the clouds, mixing water and aquatic life in the clouds. Soon, animals began to fall from the sky. Each of them landing in the water. Only Aqualad had fallen onto the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Azerath Metrione Zinthos!\" Raven said as her dark magic gently glided Aqualad down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are ya alright?\" Cyborg asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, he's too strong.\" Aqualad said as he fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess that means its my turn!\" Kid flash smirked as he zoomed off, not hearing Robin stating \"Wait!!!! Dammit!  He left before we could tell him we should work together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry.\" Superboy said as he flew into the air. \"I'll fight Beast Boy while he fights Starfire.\" Superboy told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, but be careful.\" Robin told him as he flew off towards the emerging Beast Boy, now back in his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did they even listen when I said 'DO NOT HARM THEM?'\" Rave asked Cyborg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I dunno.\" Cyborg told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Starfire giggled as she watched Kidflash zoom after her. 'This is so funny!' Starfire giggled as she saw Kid flash start zooming around her at superspeed. Giggling, Starfiring moved her hand down in front of the circle he was making. Causing him to crash into a hard wall. Flattening him into paper with a sweatdrop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ouch.\" Kidflash said as he was wrapped in the giantess hand. As Starfire brought him up to her face, Kidflash couldn't help but gulp at what thoughts may be running in her mind. Thats when she pushed him between her breasts. 'This is heaven!' Kidflash smirked as he totally forgot about what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Superboy was having a much harder time though. As Beast Boy rose up from the water, Superboy tried everything to harm him. He zapped him with his laser beams on his cheek, leg, feet, chest, and even his eye. No affect at all. Beast Boy was also spending his own time trying to stop him by slowing swatting his hand. Didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then with as much power as he could, Superboy hit Beast Boy in the chest. \"There!\" He said as he flew a few feet away. Nothing happend. \"Wha!?\" Superboy said as he saw how his superpower did nothing against the changeling. That's when Beast Boy caught him, holding him up to his head he smirked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks like your nothin to me. And it looks like Kidflash couldn't do anything against Star either! Me and her are gonna rule the world and theirs nothing you can do about it!\" Beast Boy laughed as he walked through the city, reaching back to his love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is that for me?\" Star giggled as she brought Kidflash away from her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yap!\" Beast Boy told her as he brought Superboy into her hands. \"He's your gift for our one hour giant anniversary!\" Beast Boy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's so cute!\" Star said as she hugged her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile the other Titans stood there shocked by the strength of them. \"Is there anything that can stop them?\" Robin asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I dunno. Maybe Aqualad will know when he wakes up.\" Cyborg told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Maybe...' Raven thought as she looked at the others, knowing what may stop them.</span></div></div>",

With that simple kiss Starfire had unknowingly transferred the virus to her toys. And they weren't going to be toys for long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and the other watched in horror as Superboy and Kidflash quickly grew to match Beast Boy and Starfire in size. Okay...now she needed to resort to drastic measures. She took in a deep breath and said, \"Guys, I have a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg and Robin stared at her and Robin said, \"What is it Raven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to mention it before because it's a very dangerous plan. It involves a lot of magic and the effects will be unpredictable. Do you want to try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have nothing else to lose.\" Cyborg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Then follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven led the boys, Cyborg carrying Aqualad, to her room. She quickly pulled down book after book flipping to several different pages and lighting candles before measuring powder and setting it inside a pentacle. Robin quickly began to get anxious, looking out the window and seeing a giant Superboy and Kidflash grinning at this new development. Beast Boy didn't look to happy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm done.\" Raven said, standing up and dusting her hands off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is all this?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's powerful and ancient sorcery of an advanced kind. It borrows on the Life Force of a person and grants them abilities that were otherwise latent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, \"Borrows Life Force\"?\" Cyborg asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it takes away the energy that keeps you alive and turns it into a conduit for powers you didn't know you possessed. It works but can be taxing if used too long. I can cast this spell on all of you if you want, but that could prove dangerous. I'm not even sure what latent powers you might have. I don't think I'll be able to cast it on Cyborg though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we have a decision to make.\" Cyborg said. \"Should we cast the spell on Robin or Aqualad?\"</span></div></div>",

So why should we be fighting each other?\" Superboy asked them. Both Star and Beast Boy looked at each other again, unsure if they should agree to such terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But it was me and BB's dream to rule the world. To make it a better place.\" Starfire told them \"Why would you want to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because you can't rule the world alone. They won't obey a single group of giants everywhere. So why not rule it with others!?\" Kidflash asked them. Both BB and Star thought about it, it did make sense after all. I mean who could honestly rule the world alone!? And thats not including the paperwork that goes with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Having reached their conclusion, Beast Boy and Starfire nodded as he spoke. \"Alright then! Lets rule the world together!\" Beast Boy told them. All of them high fived each other.(Except Starfire, she hugged them all to death.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There is only one thing we want though.\" Superboy and Kid flash told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And whats that?\" Beast Boy asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We want Starfire to be our girlfriends too.\" Kidflash tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\" Beast Boy roared.

'Time for some payback for my girlfriend Beast Boy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Azera No Mazura Des Invididios Kelmarjal Lalmanax Des Zemonos!\" Raven chanted over and over.

Nothing did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It had to.\" Raven said, flipping to a reference page in one of her reference almanacs of magic. \"I did the spell exactly as it was recorded, I specified a target, and I chanted the spell correctly. You now have unlocked a latent power within you. Whatever it is, you should know a little bit about it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin searched his mind for the answer. He delved deep into his memories and found a small patch of glowing black and white in his mind's eye. Yes, there it was! An ability he forgot he knew! He pulled a small tendril of that glowing pool from the dark recesses of his mind and brought it to the surface. He felt a little strength leave him, but nothing too bad. He activated that power, sending a mental note reverberating around the area. Everyone waited with bated breath to see what would happen next. Suddenly, they heard a splash and the sound of several feet slapping against pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Robin shouted, leading the way to the outside of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they saw there both shocked them, and left them in a wondering awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenguins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of penguins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" was all Robin could managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched as the penguins waddled around on the island, picking at the joints of their wings and some carrying tiny fluffly grey penguin babies.

One squaked and saluted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqualad suddenly groaned and sat up, holding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? And why are there penguins all over the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic.\" Raven said. \"Your latent talents are controlling penguins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault!\" He argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this just sucks!\" Cyborg said. \"We have three giants on the loose, no way to shrink them, and the most powerful spell in the world gave our leader the ability to control penguins! Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should cast the spell again...\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they discussed, the giants were just finishing their negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Beast Boy said. \"So we all share Star but I get special treatment because I was the first giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Everyone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also since I was first, I'm the leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Everyone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we just have to decide who's going to rule what. There's seven continents right? Depending on the size of the continents we'll have to have more giants loyal to us to help rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could just get bigger.\" Kidflash suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too.\" Beast Boy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever we do, I'm sure it will be the best we can do!\" Starfire said.</span></div></div>",

Robin thought as he turned away from the others, more penguins coming over to comfort him. 'Thanks' he thought as they hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright then, I shall repeat the spell once more.\" Raven said as she began to chant once again.

Let me see...\" Aqualad said as he felt some of his life force leave him, nothing that a week on a cell phone wouldn't do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So?\" Cyborg asked him as they waited for the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel it!\" Aqualad said as his mouth started to grow longer, becoming a snout. His hands shrunk until they were a perfect fin size. His back began to grow another fin, ripping his clothes from behind a large curved fin appeared. His lands began to shrink until he was out of his pants, underwear, and more as they regrew into a single long tail. His shirt fell off as a large, white belly had appeared in its place. His hair started to fall off as his skin became a grey color. His muscles vanished as fat took its place. Soon, what was once a titan was now a dolphin, jumping up and down in the air on its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All three regular titans slapped their heads as they saw his transformation. 'So what am I guys!?' He asked them telepathically, none wanting to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your a dolphin! And from the looks of thing s telepathic one at that!\" Cyborg said as he grabbed him, and quickly tossed him into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'What!?' Aqualad said as he realized the change. 'Thats so lame!' Aqualad said as he swim around, suddenly feeling the urge to eat fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Tell me about it.' Raven and Cyborg thought as they realized that maybe these hidden powers aren't so powerful after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So now what?\" Robin asked as he laughed at Dolphinlad, getting back at the fact he called his power weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, we'll think of something when the time comes. Right now, we should leave.\" Raven said as the others nodded, preparing to leave the city before the giants began their conquest.</span></div></div>",

He looked up and his nose brushed up against the ceiling, he quickly crouched down. He saw the door, which was now smaller than usual. So was everything else in his room. And he suddenly realized, HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT! He quickly rushed to the door and carefully opened it. His body was obviously too large to fit through. But he realized he had to try or else he'd be stuck in his room forever! He then began squeezing himself through the tiny doorframe. He managed to get his head through but his body still remained on the other side. He struggled and strained to get through, causing cracks in the wall as his body strained the small doorframe. Then with a final strain his body burst through the doorframe, causing it to be reduced to rubble. As he panted and tried to catch his breath. He realized how big he really was. He stood up to his full height, now only his hair brushing up against the ceiling in the hallway. He turned around and saw the big hole in the wall where his door used to be. ''uh...this is gonna be pretty hard to explain to the guys'' he said to himself. Then he realized, that all of this would be pretty hard to explain. He looked down, and saw his bare legs and manhood. ''Oh yeah this is just great, not only am i big, i'm naked too!'' He thought, and knowing full well that none of his clothes would fit him. He walked down the hall, towards the living room. As he walked, he began to think his situation over. He estimated he was over 9 ft. tall! ''oh yeah, this is wonderful'' he said as he stomped nude down the hallway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well then again i would run to if there was a huge teenager in the city.\" Watching them run some more Kira thought of an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his huge fingers he ripped a solid whole in the concrete, Creating a large square shaped hole. It size made it impossible to escape from. Kira smiled down at the people and brought his face even closer. Considering they couldn't escape he decided to lick them of the ground and into his mouth. \"Wow Kira said, they don't even taste that bad, swallowing some more Kira patted his stomach deciding that was enough. He then lay down flat on his back. Crushing even more of the city beneath is huge body. Kira smiled knowing what power he had and that no one could oppose him. \" Hey maybe i can take over the world, Know one would be able to stop me at this size. I may just do that. No one to stop me anymore anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira proceeded to destroy the rest of the city and its residents. Just a quick stomp fest with his huge feet and their was hardly anything left of the once huge city. Its population greatly diminished the 1000 feet tall 18 year old just looked at the destruction he caused and smiled. \" This is gonna be better than i thought\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stomped away, leaving behind mass rubble with very few survivors</span></div></div>",

Kira roared. He then ran full speed toward the beach and the city. The people in the city had no idea what hit them. At first all they heard were earthquakes. Until they simply ceased to be. None of them even knew what the threat was. They were to late to be aware of the danger till it hit them.Kira reached the beach filled to the brim with tourists giving out an enthusatic hello people screamed and ran in all directions. Eager to get away from the giant teenager. Kari picked a large amount of the fleeing tourists in his hand. Then pulled his briefs down while in a sitting position. His huge cock covered the entire beach with a shadow. Causing nearly everyone to look up in shock. Kira started pumping away for the second time in the day. This time using the people in his hands as a stimulator. Even as their bodies were crushed against his giant cock Kira simply picked up more. Moaning in pleasure of the tiny beigns against him. He took it slow this time, making it build up a lot more. He finally reached his climax again and he simply let his cum fly lose everywhere. The remaining people left on the beach and the city watched in horror as an 300 feet tall amount of white good sprayed from the teenagers body and crushed them and their city. Killing millions. With all the destruction around him which he caused Kira just laughed. He then looked the entire city covered in his cum. He decided to </span></div></div>",

I told you this stuff was dangerous!\" Ed yelled, desperatley trying to get the dust off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anymore could be said, Roy began to grow.

YOU'RE CRAZY!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now there's no need to get angry, I just...\" Roy suddenly stopped as he realized he couldn't stand up, being wedged in his chair. The best he could do was bend over and fall onto his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help?\" He said crossly to Ed and Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl instantly ran over and began pulling on the chair, while Ed just stood by and laughed. It took a little bit, but Al managed to pull the chair off. Roy stood up and cracked his head on his office ceiling, that being about ten feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take some getting used too...\"<br>\r\n\"You're not really planning on staying that size are you Colonel?\" Al asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Of course not Al,\" Roy said. \"It would be impractical. I'm sure someone in East or Central can fix this.\"<br>\r\n\"And what about me?\" Ed asked, indicating the thick coating of dust.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be fine Fullmetal,\" Roy said impatiently, waving his hand. \"Now if you don't mind, I have a few phone calls to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al left Roy as he tried to use a phone that just a little bit too small for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on a rooftop across from Eastern HQ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is an interesting development!\" Envy said, as he watched the events in Roy's office.<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Lust said, deep in thought. \"But who do you suppose sent them that Alchemy Dust?\"<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Envy said shrugging. \"It's safe to say it might be someone they know...\"<br>\r\n\"But who?\" Lust said. \"This could get out of hand if we're not careful.\"<br>\r\n\"What's the worst that can happen?\" Envy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside HQ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHavoc was about to go into Roy's office with a what appeared to be a file of some sort when Ed stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go in there right now.\" Ed said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHavoc just stared at Ed, covered completely in the white dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably don't want to know, but what are you covered in?\" Havoc asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Ed said with a sigh. \"Safe to say, I need a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ed headed back to his hotel while Al told Havoc, Hawkeye, and the rest of the group at Eastern HQ what happened in Roy's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what, Roy's some kind of giant in there?\" Havoc asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's about it.\" Al said.<br>\r\n\"And how does he plan on fixing it?\" Havoc said.<br>\r\n\"He's calling for help right now.\" Al said.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Hawkeye said. \"I think it's best we finish this business before it gets worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though waiting for her to say that, a huge thump was heard from inside Roy's office as well as a loud curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHavoc threw open the door and revealed a strange sight. The dust hadn't been through with it's power and Roy had grown again. His head was still at the ceiling, but he was sitting down and his back was pressed against the far wall.

Finally it was over. Ed, panting slightly, checked himself over to see if he was hurt in any way. After he was sure he was okay, he began to grow.

He could feel the strain of the walls and saw that the wall was beginning to crumble a bit. His head was also pressing against the celing pretty hard as the ceiling of the bathroom began to slowly split apart. His knees were doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, who was still stuck aginst the wall, was being pushed by the growing foot and had less room to move. The walls seem to break apart as Ed's leg grew longer. Suddenly, the wall crumbled into almost crumbled behind the armor with the soul and he began to fall back. Thankfully, Al didn't feel pain because he wasn't in his human body, but his armor was a bit flattened. He was now lying against the tree that was next to the Elric's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I didn't see that coming. Hm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alphonse noticed the ceiling slowly beginning to burst open. A very long strand of hair stuck out from one of the holes. Along with more blonde hair. All of the sudden, Edward's whole head, from neck up, came up from the ceiling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great...\" Ed mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall around the bathroom door had crumbled almost completely, both his legs extending from it, giving him, along with his arms. He was in a sitting position, with his shoulders still under the part of the ceiling which hadn't fallen yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother! are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked down to see his brother lying against a tree, a bit dented in the chest plate, but not hurt at all. \"Al! Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" Al answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward sighed in relief, but remembered the predicament he was in. He was still stuck, and now very noticable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't get any worse than this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Armstrong wasted no time. He questioned everyone about what had happened and then examined the powder left on the box, careful not to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come to a conclusion!\" He yelled out suddenly. \"This is Alchemy Dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is Alchemy Dust?\" Falman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a powerful tincture in powder form. It has less power than a complete Philosopher's Stone but is still quite powerful. The dust is infused with a burst of alchemic energy and is contained for a set period of time. When the dust has contact with a living organism or inanimate object, depending on the desire of the one who infused it, the alchemy activates! Also, like the Philosopher's Stone, it can perform human transmutation, but to a much less extreme degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very interesting Major.\" Hawkeye said. \"But how do you propose we fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that is a more difficult problem. Obviously the dust was intended to change size, but who did it? We'd have to track down the one who performed this alchemy before we could fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sighed again. They had no idea where the package could've come from, so finding whoever sent it would be nearly impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Fullmetal was covered in a lot more dust than the Col. I wonder what happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably grew larger than the Col. and is stuck some where.\" Armstrong said. \"I will take it upon myself to find and rescue him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his arms as his shirt seemed to dissapear. Hawkeye, Havoc, and Breda shoved him out the door saying, \"You do that.\"</span></div></div>",

Sanji picked up a chicken and grinned evilly. He stuffed the whole thing in his mouth and was shocked to see Luffy eat it, bones and all, in one gulp! Something strange was going on...Not even Luffy could do that before!</span></div></div>",

He quickly ran to where the scroll was being held and snuck in. He didn't want to actually take the scroll away, lest he get in trouble for it. So he opened it and pulled as hard as he could. At least fifteen feet of the scroll pulled out. Naruto picked a jutsu at random and wrote it down.

Her hair was tied back in a bun and her face was covered by a veil. It was slightly transparent, and you could see the beautiful visage that lay behind it, tantalizing and distant.

What's our mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi sweatdropped at Naruto's boundless enthusiasm, then spotted something strange. Naruto's clothes looked a little small on him. With every arm thrust into the air, his shirt would ride up revealing more of Naruto's skin then was normal. Looking down he saw the pants looked a little tight as well. Even his toes were pressing a little further out of his sandals than usual. Kakashi just brushed this aside. It was normal for boys Naruto's age to get growth spurts, and was nothing to get worked up over. So he simply said, \"Naruto, shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped jumping around and merely settled for quivering in anticipation. Sasuke sighed with a mutter that sounded suspiciously like, \"Idiot.\" while Sakura hauled off and smacked him in the head. The girl raised a hand to her face in shock and Kakashi said, \"Don't worry about them. They're always like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, Kakashi-sensei, who's the chick?\" Naruto asked, pointing at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our A-ranked mission. She is the daughter of a powerful lord that lives quite a ways away from the village. His family has been in conflict with another branch of the family and as such she's been the target of many assassinations and kidnappings hoping to use her as leverage to gain ground for their own family, none of which have been succesful. However, the lord informed the village that these would be assassins and kidnappers have finally turned to ninja for help. It will be our mission to escort her safely to her father's house where she will be held safe until this family fued is over. It shouldn't take more than a few days to get there, if we move fast. So let's get moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group left the village and headed for the lord's mansion.

They traveled for hours upon the safest roads, traveling for hours with no ninja or assassin in sight. And while the Maiden, Kakashi, and Sakura were thankful for this. All this did was anger Naruto. Who wanted to fight some strong ninja. \"Aw man! Why aren't there any ninja coming out to say 'We've come for the girl! Give her to us or prepare to be killed!' This is getting boring!\" Naruto groaned as he walked, completely oblivious to his clothes getting smaller and smaller on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura and Kakashi simply groaned over Naruto's complaining. \"Naruto! Moaning isn't going to get them to come so just stop all ready!\" Sakura commanded him as she walked behind the group. Making sure no ninja would strike the Maiden from behind. But the Maiden simply laughed, thinking that Naruto's complaint over his boredom was humorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well it seems to be keeping her happy.\" Naruto said as he pointed to the maiden, who simply nodded and began to quiet down. Sakura and Kakashi looked at each other weirdly as they saw the Maiden they were watching laughing at Naruto. But Several more hours passed as they traveled closer to the border along with Naruto complaining even more as no ninja came after them. Not a single ninja seemed to be after the Maiden. And he was so ready to fight. He didn't know why, but he felt big and strong enough to take on the world. Sakura was noticing the changes as well, and she couldn't help but be turned on a little by his growing body. Though she couldn't tell him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But as they arrived upon the Fire Nation's border, Kakashi halted. \"It's getting late everyone. So tonight we will be resting out here.\" Kakashi told them. \"You don't mind do you miss? You will have to sleep in a sleeping bag.\" But the Maiden simply nodded in agreement. The group moved into the forest to hide themselves much better as they slept. Laying traps around the two small patches of treeless land, the group decided to sleep in each spot, with only eight feet of thick trees blocking each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw man! And here I was all excited about fighting!\" Naruto complained as he tossed some kunai at a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well it doesn't matter for today. They will probably find out soon about us being her escorts and attack. So i'll take the maiden and we'll slept in the left side while you two sleep on the right in order to help her in case of an emergency.\" Kakashi said as both him and the maiden left the two to be alone on the right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More like he's going to watch her get naked.\" Naruto and Sakura both said simultaneously. Causing them to blush and look away from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Umm. Sakura, should I look away while you change?\" Naruto asked politely. Even though it was one of his greatest fantasies of seeing her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course moron! You should never look at a girl naked!\" Sakura commanded. Instantly Naruto turned away as she changed into a red nightgown, which was very weird for her to be wearing since any one could hump her in the night and get away with it. \"Like it?\" She said as Naruto turned to see it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'OMG!' Naruto thought as he held back a nosebleed. \"It looks good on you!\" Naruto gasped as he turned away from her to clean his nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks Naruto. Now i'll turn while you change.\" Sakura said as she turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to take off his clothes. But they wouldn't come off. 'Darn it come off! Why are they so tight?!' Naruto thought as he tore his shirt. \"Damn!\" Naruto growled as he attempted to take off his pants. Only for them to tear off as well. He then attempted to put his night clothes on. Only for them tear as he desperately tried to get them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is everything all right?\" Sakura asked as she looked away. 'It doesn't sound good.' She thought as she heard tearing sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No Sakura. My clothes are all tight and my night clothes don't fit me. I guess I have to sleep in my boxers.\" Naruto sighed, knowing what Sakura was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah right! Your just trying to give yourself a excuse-\" As she turned around, she was shocked to see his clothes torn to shreds. And all he had on was boxers. But that wasn't what caught her attention. Naruto seemed bigger and his muscles were far more define and toned. \"Naruto. You seem to be getting bigger.\" Sakura said with a bit of shock in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? I guess so!\" Naruto chuckled as Sakura looked at him. \"Oh! There's something I want to ask you.\" Naruto suddenly remembered how the giant jutsu didn't work when he tried it. And so he told Sakura about how he tried the jutsu and how it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well you probably didn't do it right.\" Sakura told him as she  got into the middle of the clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I thought so as well.\" Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All right then. Then watch me!\" Sakura said with enthusiasm as she began the jutsu. \"Giant no jutsu!\" She said as she finished making the symbols. Yet nothing happend as she finished. \"Wait. What's going on? That should've worked!\" She was in total shock as she found the jutsu not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's not your fault. It did the same for me.\" Naruto told her. Giving her a sense of relief. \"Well lets go to bed for the night. We have to guard that lady tomorrow after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, yeah.\" Sakura sighed as she proceeded to get in her sleeping bag and Naruto his. And like Naruto, she was oblivious to her growing body. Just like Naruto. And so the two went to bed across from one another. Not realizing they were growing bigger, stronger, and sexier.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night passed rather uneventfully, with no sudden ninja attacks in the night, which annoyed Naruto greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of being bigger and stronger, if you can't do anything with it?\" He had thought grumpily before he went to bed last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the morning was upon them and that meant another chance to risk your life in a bloody battle. Naruto was quick to get out of his sleeping bag and start packing up. He was eager to move on. Sakura got up much more slowly, annoyed at Naruto who was already ready to go. Sakura noticed he had altered a spare pair of clothes slightly. He was wearing only his jacket which was open, revealing his increasingly muscular chest and abs, while his pants were cut to make shorts. The whole thing was still pretty tight and uncomfortable, but at least he wouldn't have to fight ninja in his underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sakura!\" Naruto said, practically quivering with excitement. \"Let's go already! I'll bet Kakashi-sensei and that girl are already to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura noticed he didn't mention Sasuke, but was too tired to say anything. She groaned and got out of her sleeping bag. As she stood, Naruto couldn't help but stare. Her nightgown, which had been so long the night before, was hiked up a foot higher than normal going from reaching her shins to reaching to just below her thighs. She hadn't noticed this yet and when she bent over to roll up her sleeping back Naruto got a full look at her panty clad bottom. He quickly turned around and snorted out his nosebleed, before turning back and saying, \"Uh Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said, looking back at him, still bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nightclothes are a little short and I can, um..see things.\" He said, blushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura quickly stood up and saw he was right! She had been showing Naruto her nearly exposed butt! Instantly she grabbed a nearby rock and threw it as hard as she could at Naruto's head. It hit him squarely on the forehead, knocking him over and creating a lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you stare at me like that you pervert!\" Sakura screamed scandalized. \"Don't you know it's not polite to stare at a lady you freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could do or say anything Sakura had disappeared behind a tree to get dressed. Her usual outfit was a little shorter and tighter than normal, but at least it still fit reasonably well. Sakura was so angry at Naruto that she didn't notice the small amount of new muscle she had developed. It was nowhere close to Naruto's gain, but it was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished getting dressed, Naruto and Sakura made their way through the trees to where Kakashi, the Maiden, and Sasuke were waiting. Kakashi and Sasuke both looked shocked as Naruto and Sakura came approached and not just because Naruto looked so ridiculous wearing clothes too small for him. Despite the fact that Naruto had been growing slowly throughout the day and night, he was still just a few inches shorter than Kakashi, but he wasn't far from surpassing him. However, he was much taller than Sasuke now, a fact which he gleefully noted. Even Sakura was taller than Sasuke, but she was shorter than Kakashi by a fair bit. Everyone just stood around for awhile, wondering what the heck was going on. Naruto started shifting around, getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, are we going or what?\" He asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\" Kakashi said sensibly. \"I think it's slightly more important we find out why, in one day and night, you've grown over a foot taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called puberty Kakashi-sensei!\" Naruto said. \"I'm just getting mine all at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work that way you moron!\" Sakura yelled smacking him in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks to me like a jutsu gone wrong.\" Kakashi said. \"What were you two doing last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly explained the Giant Justsu and how it seemed to fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's obvious that you messed up somehow and now the jutsu is working, but at a slower rate.\" Kakashi said. \"So just reverse it and you'll go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura instantly tried to release the jutsu, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working!\" She said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi looked surprised as well. But then he looked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly did you find this jutsu Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto instantly looked guilty and everyone knew he must've stolen it from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I found it...in a scroll...\" He said vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What scroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Scroll of Sealing?\" Naruto said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone present, except the Maiden, slapped a hand to their foreheads. Jutsu in the Scroll of Sealing was powerful and hard to control. Naruto had no idea what he was tampering with. Now they were stuck with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose there's nothing we can do about it for now.\" Kakashi said. \"We'll finish the  mission and then when we get back sort out this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they were back on the road again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Soon the group was once again on the road, passing the border of the Fire Nation and onto the neighboring countries. All the while Naruto and Sakura felt themselves getting bigger. Not by much, but enough that they could feel their clothes tightening on their bodies. Sasuke and Kakashi looked on with worried looks as they saw the two of them at their new sizes. Along with the fact that they were both still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Should we still be travelling like this?\" Sasuke asked Kakashi as the two of them stood in the front. Guarding the Maiden from frontal assaults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I'm not sure what to do currently. But I know stopping a mission as high ranked as this would get Naruto angry. And do you want to make the new Naruto angry?\" Kakashi asked him. Sasuke turned and could feel it. Gallons of Chakra seemed to be oozing out of his body. The chakra amounts alone surpassed the amount he used during the battle against Gaara. He turned to Kakashi and he nodded in agreement. They both knew that making this Naruto would be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But what surprises me most is that she's taking this with all most no shock.\" Sasuke said as he pointed towards the maiden. Who simply hummed as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well from what I hear her home country is a little...weird.\" Kakashi whispered to Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How weird could it be?\" Sasuke asked, not realizing what kind of answer he would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well for starters fish tend to fly and birds swim.\" He told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha?\" Sasuke said dumbfounded. \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, well that's the beginning of the weirdness.\" Kakashi told him. And so he accurately starting saying things about her home country that just make no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As those two talked in the front, both Sakura and Naruto were in the back. Talking to each other. \"Sorry about saying you did that jutsu wrong Naruto.\" Sakura told him as she bowed. She knew she was at fault(for once) and that she had to make it up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's all right. I thought I had messed up because it was me. But it turn's out you can fail at it just as badly!\" Naruto chuckled. BAM! Sakura punched him hard enough to leave bruises his grandchildren would feel. \"Sorry Sakura! I'll never say anything insensitive like that again!\" He lied through his teeth. He knew he would say something insensitive eventually, he just wouldn't know HOW he would say something rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyways. At least you won't grow into a giant alone.\" Sakura said with a cheerful look. Naruto blushed and nodded 'She's beautiful when she's nice. Well she's beautiful when she's angry too.' He thought as he looked at her clothes. He blushed even more as he saw her breasts were much larger than they were a day before. They were bigger than should be even if she had grown in size. 'I wonder if she would let me touch them?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n But his perverted thoughts were interrupted as Kakashi looked into the woods. \"Sasuke. Grab her.\" He said as he revealed his sharingan. Sasuke nodded as he jumped and grabbed the maiden into his arms. Both Naruto and Sakura saw what the other two were doing and grabbed kunai from their sides, ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on milady! I'll be taking you away from here!\" Sasuke told her as he held her tightly and jumped away from the battlefield. \"We'll be waiting at that place!\" Sasuke told Kakashi as he vanished into the forest, taking the maiden to their next meeting spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Several dozen Ninja attempted to follow him, only for about 5 Naruto shadow clones to appear and beat them all up with ease. Their muscles showing off as they beat up the ones who attempted to follow them. With that about four dozen ninja appeared around the group. \"I've been looking for a good fight!\" Naruto said as he flexed a arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Normally I wouldn't say this. But I feel ready to crush a army of ANBU!\" Sakura laughed as she flexed off her own smaller, but defined biceps. Immediately the entire enemy ninja force prepared to attack.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the number of foes they faced, Kakashi, Naruto, and Sakura knew it was over five minutes after it had begun. Unfortunately for their opponents, they too knew the effort was futile, but were unable to retreat from their mission. So it went from a fight to a beating. Kakashi had fought for awhile, but then realized that his intervention was not needed. Naruto and Sakura could easily dispatch the ninja, with using hardly any chakra. In fact, it was almost cruel to consider using chakra against such weak opponents. Kakashi was bemused to see how easily his students were winning, but this bemusement changed swiftly to alarm as he saw them growing more than ever. As he watched, he saw Naruto inching upward, higher and higher, his jacket eventually ripping straight down the back, revealing his broader shoulders and his muscular back, flexing as he fought. As Naruto grew taller, Kakashi's viewpoint was changed (without him moving his head) from looking at his chest (with steadily growing pecs and killer abs to boot) down to his legs which were wide and thick with muscle. A few minutes later, his pants gave up the ghost and ripped as well leaving Naruto in skintight boxers that were in great danger of destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi quickly looked from the impressive boxer bulge over to Sakura who was a ways behind Naruto. She was growing much more slowly, but he could tell she would be only, at most, up to his chest. Her clothes too had suffered greatly, but in different areas. The fabric around her chest area was straining greatly to hold in her expanding boobs which were developing quickly. Her muscles, though less impressive than Naruto's, were still something to behold. They were not unaware of their growth, going from punches and kicks to stomping on their enemies, kicking them away. By the time their was only two ninja left, they both knew they were beat. Rationalizing the situation, they suddenly decided they wouldn't be abandoning the mission if they were to report the situation to their clients. With this thought in mind, they turned tail and ran as fast as they could away from the giant ninja. Kakashi sighed and covered his Sharingan again, wondering what else might happen in this strange mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto and Sakura, their growth fueled by the fight, were back to expanding at their slow rate. But the fight had increased their height greatly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surveying the area, Naruto and Sakura stood in awe of their massive growthspurts. All of their clothes had been destroyed, and they were as naked as the day they were born.   Their bodies were so massive that the trees surrounding them as they grew were all but crushed. And their two comrades had fled with the Maiden back to the Leaf Village. Naruto could even swear that when she saw how 'big' he was down there she must've had a nosebleed before they took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura's breasts had all but torn free of her clothes. And whatever had remained was torn apart and fallen off by the time she had hit 20ft. Her muscles were defined and large, similar to a swimmer. Her breasts had grown into DD cup sized breasts. Bouncing freely as her tits hardened from the cold air. Embarissingly she placed her hands over them, trying to hide them from view. But she had completely forgotten about her pussy. Which she was unable to cover since she was trying to hide her breasts. Her body had grown into that of a older women, giving her the appearance of a twenty-one year old. Her hair which she had kept short ever since the Chunin Exams was now long and flowing, going all the way down to her ass. Which was round and perfect in the form of a bubble butt.  And to top it all off she was easily 10 feet shorter than Naruto. Making her about 110ft. tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto's body was larger than her however. Thanks to using the jutsu before she did. He was easily 120ft. tall. His body was big and thick, giving him the appearance of a bodybuilder with a chiseled body and a 8-pack of steel. His body had lost all babyfat as he grew from a 12 year old kid into a twenty-one year old man. It gave his face the appeal of a man. His ass, like Sakura's, had hardened and become rounder. Perfecting its former shape into one that was perfect. His cock had grown to 13 inches hard(To them.) and was ready for love-making. Blushing, he covered his own cock. He knew Sakura didn't want to look at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're big!\" Sakura said in disbelief. Shocked by their tremendous growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No Sakura. Were huge!\" Naruto chuckled as he looked at his surroundings. Their bodies grew past the road and had crashed into the forest, destroying the trees that were no taller than their feet. \"Not just huge! We could be gods at this size!\" Naruto exclaimed happily as he looked around. Amazed by how small the world had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Were big Naruto, but were not big enough to be Gods.\" Sakura told him, moving her  arms away from her breasts. Allowing them to bounce back into place as she scolded him for what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well we might as well be. Even that Fat guy Choiji's clan only grows as high as 60 feet. And were twice that!\" Naruto laughed as he flexed a bicep. The hard diamond like muscle growing beneath his skin. \"And were strong enough to make anyone we want do whatever we want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. I kind know what you mean.\" Sakura blushed in shock. She had never agreed with Naruto over most things, but seeing how small the region around them was. She could get use to this size. \"But we should use new size to help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah right.\" Naruto said as he walked over to Sakura. Leaving a small bit of space between them. His cock rubbed against her left thigh, sending a sensation of lust through the girl. \"At this size we can make anyone aknowledge us. Were gods. And if they obey us. Then we just crush them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's good and all, but can you make some space between us? It's getting a little uncomfortable.\" Sakura said as Naruto moved a bit closer, his cock rubbing against her silky skin even more. Sending even more sensations through her. She felt a sudden need to wrap her arms around him, to kiss him, to fuck him. 'NO! NO! NO! Don't do it! SAVE YOURSELF FOR SASUKE!' Called forth Inner Sakura, but for some reason she had remained her same size in Sakura's mind. Now she was half the size a tree when compared to Sakura and her growth. Making her words seem feeble and insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why Sakura? Don't you like this?\" Naruto asked as he moved his arms around her. Sakura proceeded to allow them to wrap around her, and then she moved closer into his chest. She looked up at him. His cock had risen and layed against her belly, causing her to get turned on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I do like this. But-\" But she was cut short as Naruto kissed her. Sakura smiled and felt a primal instinct take over as she kissed him back. For a few minutes the kissed lasted, until Naruto and Sakura moved their heads away from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've always like you Sakura. And I always wanted you to be my Queen.\" He told her as he send a hand through her long, pink hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Naruto. I've always had feelings for you. But I also liked Sasu-\" Sakura was unable to finish as Naruto came in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't mention his name all right? It's just you and me now. God and Goddess of our own world. And everyone else are our worshippers and food.\" Naruto said as he held her chin gently with his hand. \"So forget him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All right.\" Sakura told him as she embraced him. And for the first time in her life, Sakura had given up on Sasuke.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto's cock on the side of her thigh had caused her to start getting hot and aroused.  She reached out with her large arm and touched Naruto on the shoulder.  \"Please wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped, turned and faced his teammate who smiled at him for the first time in a while.  The Giant Jutsu was mearly the means, and the time for both of their feelings was now at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I've pushed you away because I worshipped Sasuke.  He seemed like everything I wanted in a boyfriend, yet he never returned my feelings for him.  You have tried to get my attention and I have shoved you aside.\"  A tear started to drop from her eyes.  \"And I'm sorry.  I do...like you a lot.  Maybe even love you.  The Jutsu just helped me see that, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sakura, I do.  I wanted you to pay attention to me and stop beating me up all the time, even when I did things to deserve it.  I don't want to force anything in your heart.  But...I like you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled, tears falling from her eyes and landing on the ground, making impact and forming a small puddle.  \"Naruto...I can't fight this feeling of warmth inside of me.  I know about...y'know...that thing men and women do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got excited and his face showed it, and he shouted \"YOU MEAN SEX?\".  Sakura growled, slapped him in the face and banged him on the head, but then took his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so loud, you idiot!  Normally privacy is desired!  You keep it up and I won't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...you seriously want to have sex?  We could get in a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.  \"Naruto, who exactly is going to stop us, hmm?  We're giants.  Naruto Uzumaki, fuck me.  Grab my tits and make love to me right here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and did as Sakura said for him to do.  He reached out his hands and softly grabbed Sakura's soft breasts, squeezing them gently.  She moaned, a shiver running through her body as her hand reached down to her pink-haired pussy and began to finger it, sending more sensations through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss me, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes closed, looked at the ninja, and their lips met.  It was a deep, warm, longing kiss.  It only accentuated to the pleasure being created by his hand massaging her boobs.  Their kiss finally ended after about 20 seconds of loving affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...can I stick my cock inside of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Naruto...I want your cock.  It's so big, isn't it?\"  She reached down and grabbed his penis gently, giving it a gentle stroke.  \"I bet it tastes pretty good too...\" She smiled, got down on her knees and put her mouth around his rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shivered as Sakura started to suck his stick.  Her tongue lapped and licked at it, and she sucked passionately around it.  Naruto placed his hands on her head, stroking her soft pink hair.  \"Sakura...oh, Sakura, I think I'm going to...no, I *know* I'm going toooooooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura heeded Naruto's warning and was ready as he exploded inside of her mouth, shooting hot cum into her throat.  She pulled back a little bit so she could taste more of his semen as it was being shot from his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Sakura...I've got this little thing...I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, licking her lips as he recovered from his orgasm.  She loved the taste of his goo.  \"Yes, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can cum more than once.  Actually can about...6 times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have 6 orgasms, and cum each time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.  \"It's an Uzumaki family secret recipe.  Nobody else knows it but me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely shouldn't share it with anybody else.  Come on, Naruto, I want to feel more...I need to cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto happily smiled.  \"Get on your hands and knees, Sakura, it'll be easier this way.  Besides, we won't cause much of a ruckus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, and quickly turned and got down like Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for me, Sakura?  I know it's your first time.  It's mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm ready for that huge dick of yours!  Stick it in me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto placed the tip of his throbbing member, still dripping white semen, against Sakura's hot wet pussy.  She was well lubricated, and he pushed in and encountered her hymen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, I think this might hurt a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded and said \"Go ahead.\"  Naruto pushed in further, through the skin barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura let out a little yelp.  \"Oww...that kinda hurt but it feels better now.\"  Naruto smiled in relief.  He didn't want to hurt his lover.  Pushing himself all the way in, he got up onto her back and started to thrust in and out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura started to gasp every time his cock smashed into her.  She loved the feeling of his massive pole being inside of her.  She felt a warmth spread as she continued to moan and gasp with ecstacy.  \"Oh, goodness...Naruto, keep doing that, it feels so goood....OH, NARUTO...KEEP FUCKING ME!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecker spewed forth cum into her pussy, and Sakura Haruno orgasmed.  Her scream pierced the night, and her body shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stayed that way for a while, Naruto continuing to smash Sakura's pussy and cumming three more times.  Sakura had five more orgasms, each one more intense than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, this will be the biggest cum...it lasts almost a minute...you...still...up...for it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP FUCKING ME!\" she commanded, and he did not wait.  More massive strokes, and finally he exploded again.  Sakura's pussy trembled, and this time her orgasm caused a small earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside Sasuke's tent, he was trying to sleep.  The day had been long, eventful and very tiring.  The ground was colder than he was expecting it to be, far colder than it was during the Chunin Exam inside the Forest of Death.  His dreams were clouded by their mission with the woman they were protecting.  What preoccupied his mind more though was Naruto and Sakura's growth.  They both were now 100 feet tall, and he had to stop himself from looking at Sakura's chest every few seconds.  It was hard to deny the secret feelings he truly did have inside for her, the feelings he solemnly refused to articulate in any form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dream got cloudier.  He found himself seeming farther and farther away from the other member's of his team, being called by Itachi and wanting to run away from him.  The quiet child inside of his mind started to run any direction but towards his brother.  A cry sounded--Sakura, in some sort of trouble.  He then saw Kisame use Sharkskin to slice Sakura asunder, watching blood dribble from the fresh slash through her whole body.  She couldn't utter any other words, her throat slashed as her corpse fell away from the center where she stood the second before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook himself awake.  He then looked outside to see the stars.  Standing up, he took the flap of his tent and pulled it to the side.  The sight he saw irritated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was on her hands and knees with Naruto on top of her, sliding his massive penis in and out of her rhythmically.  Sasuke fought the desire to use his Lions Barrage on the giant Naruto.  He knew that he could, even at his size.  And a second later he was mesmerized at the sight of his rival and his teammate having sex.  Sakura's breasts bounced back and forth, shaking leaves off of the trees to the ground that seemed to be rocking gently all of the sudden.  Naruto looked down at Sakura's back as he continued to ram into her.  He wasn't being violent, but definitely was enjoying his first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted loudly and shot cum inside of Sakura for the fourth time.  Sakura loved it as drops of white goop dripped down her thighs and landed on the ground...forcefully.  There were impact craters from the large drops that fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, this is one way to see and not get caught...if I even saw Sakura naked and she was aware of it, she'd smack me into next week and make sure I stayed there.'  His thought was interrupted by loud moans from the pink-haired giantess as she had another orgasm.  The ground rumbled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...she's making earthquakes?  They must be big.  Nothing damaging, but I can feel the ground shake.  And...hell, what a way to do it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke stood there for a few minutes. Naruto and Sakura continued their lovemaking for ten more minutes, Naruto having another orgasm as did Sakura.  Sasuke was trying to ignore his erection from watching the two titans go at it, and he was doing a relatively good job.  All of the sudden, though, they started to fuck more intently.  Sakura shook her body, letting her monstrous tits smack the ground as Naruto mashed his rod in and out of her faster than he had before.  They spoke, slightly loudly to Sasuke's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, this will be the biggest cum...it lasts almost a minute...you...still...up...for it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP FUCKING ME!\" she commanded, and he did not wait. More massive strokes, and finally he exploded again. Sakura's pussy trembled, and this time her orgasm caused a small earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was shaken to the ground, and then he witnessed something *awful*.  Sakura started to spasm and get larger.  So did Naruto as he continued to smash his cock into her rippling pussy.  \"Uh-oh\" Sasuke finally said as the two of them continued their growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, we're getting bigger!\" Sakura exclaimed, feeling her body expand as her orgasm continued to rumble through her body and the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can FEEL it, Sakura!  We're going to be the biggest ninjas ever!\"  Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally stopped expanding, and now were both 200 feet tall or so.  Finally the two looked ateach other, and finally noticed Sasuke down below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Naruto-chan...I think we had an observer.  What should we do with him?\"  Sakura mused, her entire attitude changed.  She was already over him.  Sakura Haruno wasn't going to be ignored anymore, and she had decided who to give her heart to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sasuke...I didn't know that the Uchiha stooped to the level of watching people have sex.  What do you have to say for yourself?\"  Naruto's tone wasn't light.  He was irked as he sat down, causing a gentle tremor.  Sakura had also created a gentle shake as she set her ass down on the ground, crushing a few trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the two of you get so big?  And what do you think you're doing at 2 in the morning?  You should be sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was interested in Sasuke's question, but not amused with his commanding about his and Sakura's activities.  \"Well, little Sasuke, and I do mean that--you're so tiny I could use my finger and squash you like a bug.  I won't do that though because I'm not going to start killing people.  I'll answer your question.\"  Naruto then explained what had happened, telling about the Scroll of Sealing and the Giant Jutsu that both he and Sakura had used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...now that you're both two hundred feet tall..what do you plan on doing?\"  Sasuke pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, Sasuke.  You have to do one thing for me.\" Sakura said, looking at him.  Sasuke was surprised he was being paid attention to by the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come up on my breasts and cum on me.  You've got 5 minutes, and I'll even give you a head start.\"  She reached down, plucked him up gently and placed him on her thigh.  \"Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke jumped quickly.  This was easy, almost too easy a test for him.  'Hmph!  That's all I have to do?  No problem.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty second later Sasuke had jumped his was up to Sakura's massive cleavage, each breast 16 feet wide.  He sat down on Sakura's tit, pulled down his pants and revealed a rather large erection, 11 inches.  \"Oh my word!  It's a shame I never saw that before, Sasuke...I would have jumped you and raped you to get that inside of me...but now I have Naruto...and your almost foot isn't anywhere near his eighteen foot cock!  Now CUM on me.  You've got 2 minutes.  And I better feel it, or you're going to get punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was panicked now, but focused and stroked his massive dick rapidly.  He groaned and grunted.  Naruto was watching, his right hand on his giant cock, stroking it gently.  After 90 seconds, Sasuke shook horribly and hot white cum sprayed from his penishead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm impressed, Sasuke.  Now get off of me.\"  Sasuke didn't even have time to pull his pants back up before Sakura took her right hand and bounced the breast he was sitting on.  He fell for 80 feet before balancing himself and landed without hurting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Naruto had decided to just finish his erection off and was mashing his pole vigorously.  \"Let me show you how it's done, you shrimp!\"  Naruto said, laughing at Sasuke's size and knowing that he was about to be soaked with Naruto's semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke managed to finally get his footing as Naruto grunted loudly and began to spurt hot cum right onto Sasuke, who was knocked down by the power of his orgasm.  Naruto laughed, amused that he could so easily knock over his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Naruto-chan!  That's showing him who's the bigger man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, believe it!  So what should we do with him, anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Well I think we should keep him as pet. I've always wanted to carry a tiny man between my breasts.\" Sakura said with a innocent tone as she lifted her breasts for a few seconds. But Sasuke could definitely tell that there was some evil that voice as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That sounds like a good idea Sakura. You could keep him so that you have a tiny to play with in your spare time.\" Naruto replied cheerfully as he kissed her on the cheek. Getting a small blush from Sakura. Naruto looked down on Sasuke and smirked in triumph. No matter what Sasuke could do, he couldn't get Sakura. And if he's just a toy for her to play with then that made things all the better. He was surprisingly smart enough not to show Sasuke how to do the giant jutsu and neither had Sakura. Meaning Sasuke had no hope of growing into a giant alongside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But Sasuke didn't like this plan of theirs. He was going to be their pet? Unacceptable! 'If anything i'll be the one in charge' Sasuke said as he prepared himself to attack. Sasuke steathily grabbed several shuriken from his side pocket as he placed them in each hand, ready to be tossed at the giants. Looking down at Sasuke, both Naruto and Sakura had a smirk of arrogance that just angered Sasuke so much for some reason. Sakura he could understand, having deep feelings for the pink-haired giantess that blinded him from blaming her. But Naruto shouldn't be looking down on him. Not now, not ever. He was the better of the two of them. And he would show him exactly how better he was than the yellow-haired giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto bent down, looking at the tiny in triumph. He was going to give Sasuke to Sakura as a pet and there was nothing he could do to stop them. \"Now come here little Sasuke. Sakura wants to hold you.\" He spoked arrogantly as he reached down for the tiny. As soon as Sasuke saw his hands ready to wrap themself around him, he jumped into the air. \"Take this!\" Sasuke shouted as he tossed a dozen kunai at Naruto's arm. Naruto didn't even bother to dodge as the kunai hit him. Sasuke smirked in triumph as he land on top of a tree, watching the damage that his kunai had done. Instead, he stared in shock as each kunai evaporated upon touching Naruto's skin. All most like Naruto had a shield of chakra surrounding his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto simply smirked as he looked down at Sasuke \"Is that the best you've got our little pet?\" Sasuke's left eye started twitching as he heard those words again. Jumping into the air, he moved as closed as he could to Naruto's face as he began to make handsigns. \"I. AM. NOT. YOUR. PET!\" Sasuke roared as he moved within ten feet of Naruto's gigantic face. He breathed in and exhaled as he unleashed his fireball jutsu upon the Kitsune. The massive fireball emerged from his throat as it went towards Naruto's face. BOOM! Smoke engulfed Naruto's head as the fireball reached it's target. Sasuke landed carefully on a tree, watching in  triumph of his defeat of Naruto. He failed to notice the smirk Naruto made as the Fireball made impact. Looking over at Sakura, he smiled in triumph. \"Now do you see why this idiot isn't even worth your time Sakura?\" Sasuke gloated as he pointed at himself. \"I am the only one who should be with you. Not some loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura however, did not cheer him in agreement. Nor did she swoon over how great he was. Instead she simply giggled. \"Ahuh. You sure are the greatest Sasuke. I mean there's no way that Naruto can beat you!\" She replied sarcastically. Sasuke eye started to twitch again as he heard her speak. \"What do you mean by that. I beat-\" That's when he realized a massive shadow was behind him, blocking out his view. \"He's right behind me isn't he?\" Sasuke asked her. She nodded in a fit of giggles as he turned around to see Naruto was looking down at him, his hand surrounding Sasuke. \"Oh crap.\" With a swoosh Naruto's hand wrapped itself around Sasuke's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Argh!\" Sasuke groaned as he attempted to escape. But it was no use, something was draining him of his chakra. And with each passing second he lost more and more of his strength. After five minutes of struggling, Sasuke finally lost his battle. Naruto watched him with a arrogant smile on his face. A show of his dominance. \"*huff* Okay *huff* answer me this *huff* question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right little guy. What is it?\" Naruto told the normal sized Uchiha. \"Why *huff* did you *huff* not get *huff* hurt by *huff* my attacks?\" He asked him as he rested his body int he giants hand. Naruto began to ponder the question himself, scratching his back a little as he thought it over. \"I don't know really. I guess I'm just better than you!\" Naruto chuckled as he held onto Sakura's new pet, Sasuke would have complained were it not for his body being tuckered out. Walking over to her, Naruto held the tired Sasuke in his hand as he offered him to his giantess. \"Sakura, here's your pet Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakura blushed as she wrapped her hands around the tiny Sasuke, placing him in both hands. \"Thank you Naruto for the gift. I'll make sure to take good care of him.\" The two giants shared a kiss as she finished speaking, a sign of the deep affection both giants have for each other. Looking back down at Sasuke, Sakura began to ponder where to put him. 'Hmm...' She thought it over for only a minute. But she knew the perfect spot. \"I know where to put you.\" She told him as she placed him between her breasts.\" Sasuke, while tired. Blushed embarassingly as he saw himself being placed being her large, bouncy breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well what do you want to do now Sakura?\" Naruto asked her, he was bored instantly after that little game with Sasuke. He wanted to have some fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was thinking. That sex we had not to long ago made me a tad dirty. So I want to go take a bath in a neraby lake.\" Sakura told Naruto as she looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Cool. I could use a bath myself.\" Naruto chuckled as he stretched for a moment. \"Their should be a lake on the path we were going as tinies. I saw it on Kakashi's map earlier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good. We could clean ourselves off. And maybe even have some fun.\" Sakura gave him a wink as she began to follow the path. Naruto blushed embarassingly as he followed suit. With Sasuke  making gagging sounds at their affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was hoping the walk to the lake wasn't going to take too long.  Naruto stayed behind Sakura a few feet, but then caught up to her and put his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Sakura...I just...still like being inside of you...so warm, tight...\"  Naruto said quietly.  Sakura stopped and looked his way.  \"I think it wouldn't be good if I snapped you off by accident, Naruto-kun.  You can wait until we reach the lake.  Besides, I want to torture Sasuke by making him watch us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke blushed slightly, becoming aware of his location planted between Sakura's tits.  The thought of watching them have sex again didn't appeal to him.  If the chance arose, he would swap positions with Naruto in a heartbeat and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, actually...he wouldn't.  He would not give in to that desire.  He still thought Sakura was annoying, even though she loved him.  He was angry with Naruto about that, too...they both just happen to grow and all of the sudden they go right to screwing each other?  At least he would have had patience with Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was soon over.  Naruto took a glance at the lake.  \"Pretty decently sized...should fit us just right.  Well...do you want to take him out of there or let him get a washing too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled.  \"Yeah...I don't think he wants to smell like your cum for the rest of his life.  But make it challenging for him.  You listening, Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe \"hmph\"d quietly, which didn't please either Naruto or Sakura.  Sakura wasn't going to let this tiny thing disrespect him, so she reached down and grabbed him forcefully from between her boobs.  \"Listen, you little punk...I don't like your attitude.  So you get punished.  Naruto, stick him back in between my tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto plucked Sasuke from Sakura's fingers.  Sakura pulled her normally 48DD breasts apart a little bit and looked at Naruto, who figured out what she was going to do.  Naruto shoved Sasuke into the middle of Sakura's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke screamed a little, but had no time before he was trapped inside of Sakura's humungous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sasuke...time for some squeezing.\"  Sakura giggled, then took her hands and smashed her breasts together, rubbing them back and forth.  She then got down on her knees in front of Naruto, playing heavily with her boobs. Naruto was loving her squeeze her soft flesh in front of him.  What he was liking more was that Sasuke was feeling each squeeze and grab, radiating as painful input rather than pleasure.  Fifteen seconds of breastplay passed before Sakura felt that the punishment was sufficient.  She then stopped squeezing her tits.  A moment later she reached for Sasuke's form, pulling him free and setting him down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...have we learned our lesson now, little man?\"  Sakura eyed Sasuke, hoping for an answer from him.  He nodded profusely.  \"Good.  Now I suggest you take off your clothes...do you have any bathing supplies with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke finally had something he could offer them--aside from being used for sexual satiation.  \"Yes...I have soap, shampoo...just promise you won't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sakura and Naruto looked at each other.  \"Why would we want to hurt you, Sasuke?  We just want to have some fun.  Don't worry...we're not going to do anything stupid...not kill you or anything.  You're our teammate, and we're not going to do anything that dumb.  You get to test the waters...and make sure you have enough room for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke takes out his supplies...two bottles of shampoo, three bars of soap and two towels.  \"I don't know if there will be enough for you two...I guess you'll just have to wash the more...exercised areas with what I can give you.\"  He finished stripping, and a moment later jumped into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came back up a second later. \"COLD!  At least at the outset.  Come on in, guys...the water's okay.  I just wouldn't dive in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wondering why Sasuke mentioned that, they looked at him swimming around.  \"Oh...you're probably wondering...we want to have some water left in the lake, and if you jump in...there'll be a lot of rain...and besides, none of us know how deep it is.  Just slink in.\"</span></div></div>",

How about we show him that jutsu as well! There's more fun for all of us that way! Sakura stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure...

However, out of his own clumsiness, he left a sign out, mainly due to his own stupidity, and the fact he couldn't think straight since Sakura started licking his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke performed it, and waited for a few minutes. \"Nothing's happening!\" He yelled in annoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes some time. Don't get your panties in a twist!\" Sakura yelled, as she forced Naruto down to the ground, and shoved his giant cock into her womanhood. \"Oh yeah! Like that!\" She yelled, as Naruto started thrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just shrugged, and sat around, waiting to get bigger.</span></div></div>",

I expected better of you Kakashi. Don't tell me even simple escort missions are beyond you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Kakashi said. \"We've just got a rather big problem on our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade threw down the pencil she was holding and put her face in her hands. \"Alright. Just give it to me slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kakashi and Sasuke explained about what had been going on with Naruto and Sakura. Kakashi finished by explaining how big they were and the likelihood that they would come back to the village when they noticed that Sasuke and himself were gone. Tsunade sighed and reached under her desk. She pulled out a bottle of sake and poured herself some into a small glass. She was about to drink it when she saw Sasuke and Kakashi watching her. \"Don't tell Shizune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Naruto and Sakura, the giant pair had reached the outskirts of the village and already there was an uproar. Naruto grinned at the havoc he was causing with his mere prescense while Sakura was torn between being embarrased and being turned on by Naruto's lack of shame. They advanced to the village until they reached the Hokage building. Along the way, they had accidently caused a lot of destruction, simply by walking. Buildings lay in ruin, people lay crushed, but Naruto didn't seem to care. As he reached out to grab the top of the Hokage building and rip it off, Anbu came out of nowhere and started attacking them. Naruto smirked as he felt their kunai bounce off of him, their paper bombs fail to leave even a soot mark, and their jutsu all fail. He casually reached out and grabbed three of the Anbu. Even though there was no one in sight, he knew most of the village was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what's going to happen to anyone who disobeys us!\" He yelled out, his voice echoing around the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought the three struggling ninja to his mouth, opened it, and swallowed them all whole. Even inside, their bombs did no damage. It wouldn't be long before they were digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Sakura yelled out. \"What the heck are you doing?!?! You can't just eat people, it's barbaric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto crossed his arms and looked down at Sakura. \"Come on, they're nothing to us now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was surpised by this. What happened to the Naruto that wanted to protect the village at all costs? Who didn't hurt anyone who didn't deserve it? She didn't have much time to contemplate this total twist of character however. Tsunade was calmly walking out onto the balcony to talk with Naruto.</span></div></div>",

A bottle of sake was in her hand and she was taking large swigs of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course! Because soon I am about to become Hokage!\" Naruto laughed at the small women. Sakura stood there, prefering to listen to what the two of them will say. But she was nevertheless worried about what was going on in Narutos mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hokage! Ha! You'd have to get rid of me first before you can become Hokage. And then you have to deal with the elders who choose the next Hokage as well.\" Tsunade told him as she took another swig of her sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Taking out a prehistoric dinosaur like you won't be too hard.\" Naruto boomed for the entire village to hear. \"And they say fear can make a person do anything, even choosing me as the next Hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So your going to use fear? Nice motivation skills you seem to have learned. I need to remind myself to beat the teachers who passed you.\" Tsunade chuckled as she took another swig. Getting herself drunk of her drink. \"But even so. What about the Fire Country? I'm sure that the Fire Lord wouldn't want a giant teen ruling over the land's Ninja village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then I'll conquer and make myself both the Fire Lord AND Hokage!\" Naruto smiled as he stared down at Tsunade. 'Like anyone can stop me or Sakura.' He thought villainously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So is that what your going to do? Conquer everything that opposes you!\" Tsunade said angrily as her face flushed. It had turned beet red from all the sake she drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If it gets me what I want then yes! I'll make myself Emperor of the World!\" Naruto boomed across the village, quickly grabbing the 5th Hokage from her Balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Put me down you oversized brat!\" Tsunade growled as she infused as much of her chakra into her fists as she could. Naruto looked down with a evil light in his eyes and shaked his head no. \"You'll regret that!\" She slamed her fist into Naruto's hand. The resulting impact sent a shockwave that would send any normal sized man or women flying. But it didn't even leave a dent on Narutos giant hands. \"What the?! That punch could crush a mountain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto simply cackled as he looked down at the pathetic and shocked Tsunade. Not  noticing that many ANBU and other ninja had appeared around the Hokages manor and on the building surrounding Naruto and Sakura. Sakura started to get worried as she saw them pull out their weapons. Yet Naruto ignored them and focused on tiny Tsunade. \"That punch could crush a mountain! But ya see, here is your problem hag!\" Naruto explained, a twitch developed in Tsunade's eye. \"Me and Sakura are powerful enough that you would need to have the strength to crush a continent before you could beat us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Many of the ANBU and other ninja started to get worried. If they had that much power, who could stop them? Sasuke and Kakashi had left the Hokages hq and was with the maiden, deciding to flee with her and hide out in her country. Because Sasuke and Kakashi knew it would be only a matter of time before Naruto tried to gain his revenge on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And now behold my power mortals! And see the strength of your God and Goddess!\" Naruto laughed as he pushed Tsunade into Sakura's mouth. On instinct the pink-haired girl had swallowed the old lady whole. Cursing Naruto, Tsunade feel into Sakura's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now witness the rise of the Uzumaki Empire!\" Naruto shouted with glee down to the mortals.</span></div></div>",

One specific thing caught his interest: captains manipulating the size of their Soul Reaper.

Maybe the best evidence that it could work was Kenpachi Zaraki who used it to make himself so physically strong that even someone on a captain level would have trouble wounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ichigo began to experiment, and he discovered...</span></div></div>",

After his visit to Soul Society he had seen some impressive things done with it, and decided it was time he learned how to do something impressive.  Today he was experimenting with channeling spiritual pressure to different parts of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile training, a strange thought entered his mind, a Menos Grande.  There was no real reason to think of one, but he did.  So in his mind, every slice of his sword was a one-shot victory.  Even still, he couldn't stop thinking about them, how big they were, how unstoppable they seemed when he first saw one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Ichigo didn't notice his perspective changing, he was probably 7 feet tall at this point.  He continued his training, continuing to slash at hallows that were only there in his mind as he past 10 feet.  He stopped moving and steadied his breathing after that round of his training, and as he watched the world around him he finally noticed his perspective on it changing. Ichigo was 15 feet tall and still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, then decided it wasn't the weirdest thing he had ever seen so he might as well continue his training.  He took a deep breath, then started in again with his constant movement and slashing through the air.  This time, something was different, Ichigo wasn't thinking of looking up and a Menos Grande, he was thinking of looking <i>down</i> on hallows.  He past 20 feet in hight, but just kept growing.  Ichigo smirked, he actually found this entertaining and he wanted to see where things would end up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew to over 25 feet, which gave way to 30 feet, even that was surpassed as he reached 40 feet, and finally his impressive growth leveled off at 50 feet.    He stopped and looked at the world from his new perspective.  Everything was smaller, trees looked like they would fall over if he just pushed them with one hand.  Somehow, hollows didn't seem quite so threatening anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked over and saw, to his horror, the Millennium Necklace! It hadn't been a dream! It had been a premonition! An unusually strong one! He jumped out of bed and got dressed as quickly as he could. He had to make to Kaiba Corp. before Mokuba ever found the gun! He ran as fast as possible and soon entered Kaiba Corp. He ran for the elevator and jammed the button for the fifteenth floor, where the gun would be set on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator door opened, Yugi saw Mokuba open the door to a lab. Realizing he was running out of time, Yugi ran after Mokuba and knocked the gun out of his hands as he picked it up.<br>\r\n\"Yugi! What are you doing here?\" Mokuba asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi didn't answer. He just smashed the gun into a thousand pieces.<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?!?!? That was Seto's!\" Mokuba exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\" Yugi said. \"That thing was nothing but trouble! Tell your brother not to make it again!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...I guess...\" Mokuba said in confusion, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi sighed a breath of relief as he exited Kaiba Corp. and started heading back to his house. Suddenly, his cellphone rang.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Yugi? Don't you know what time it is? You were supposed to have come over here an hour ago!\" Tea's voice said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I slept in and then had to take care of something,\" Yugi apoligized. \"I'll be right over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Yugi prevented a disaster of universal proportions. He checked back later that night with Mokuba to make sure that Seto wasn't going to make another gun and Mokuba said he convinced him not too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n And so Yugi continued on with his life believing the incident was never going to happen again. Too bad that wasn't meant to be....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While Mokuba HAD said his brother would never make another gun that makes people large. Instead Seto had begun experiments on a special chemical that would continue his experiment. After all, Seto would NEVER let Yugi tell him what to do. Even if his brother asked him to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---In Setos office---<br>\r\n Seto was sitting at his desk. Watching his desks built in television. His top scientist was explaining the affects of Project:ENERGY GROWTH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The serum itself begins to change the body greatly. As they feed in order to give their body energy, their body quickly uses that to apply muscle and height to the body. The more food they eat, the faster their growth and the hungrier they get. After reaching 10 feet the target begins to absorb other energy sources to feed its growth. Electricity, solar energy, even wind energy can all add to its growth. It no longer needs to feed on food unless it wishes too. After reaching a eventual size the target will actually stop growing and will be sustained by the energy it gets from the sun.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good. Now explain to me the dangers.\" Seto told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes sir. The only danger besides falling into someone who will allow the power to control them is too much growth. Should the person cause enough damage as a gaint that the govt.'s resort to nuclear power. Well lets just say that its not good. They would grow from the release of energy until they are around 1/2 to 100x the size of Earth. This is the only danger we know of. Well, other than their sex drive.\" The scientist told Seto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And what about the other affects?\" Seto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. In order to adapt to their new bodies, they gain regenerative powers, a adaptable body temp., ability to breath carbon dioxide and other gases, immunity to radiation's bad affects along with the ability to make their duel devices and their duel monster decks larger with them. How they do that is still unknown though. The bad affects result in them gaining a large ego, a need to mate with someone close to them, and a large temper should someone anger them and unleash their wrath.\" The scientist explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good then. I want the suppy shipped to Duel Academy to be tested on some monkeys. Make sure no one finds out about this, got it!?\" Seto commanded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The scientist gulped and gasped as he stuttered. \"Y-ye-yes si-si-sir mister Seto!\" And with that Seto turned off the television. Soon he would begin a plan to make himself larger and more powerful than Yugi ever could be. Though he would wait until his experiment is proven successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And so the serum was shipped in 8 vials. All of which were  being transported to Duel Academy by Helicopter. And by dawn the shipments would be placed in a secret lab that was ironically placed next to the Academy's cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the vials were being transported, one of them was tipping alongside the case as it moved. The lunch ladies were readying to move breakfast into the cafeteria as they crossed paths with the scientists and the case with the vials. Secretly one vial oozed out the blue substance on one single breakfast sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While all of this was happening, Jaden and the gang were standing at the lunch line. They were all wearing eager faces as they prepared to grab a sandwich of their choosing.</span></div></div>",

It was placed on a plate surrounded by other types of sandwiches and kids were grabbing them left and right. Jaden grabbed a sandwich that was to the left of the infected food item, while Tyranno grabbed one from the other side. Syrus, however, reached out and took the infected sandwich, putting it on his tray next to his other selections. The three friends looked around for a table and saw one near the back of the cafeteria. Jaden sat down near the end of it and Syrus sat down next to him. Before he could start eating, however, Tyranno pushed him over onto the floor in order to sit next to Jaden. With a loud, \"Oof!\" Syrus hit the ground hard, his glasses nearly jounced from his face. He angrily stood up and said, \"What did you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno grinned at him and said, \"Sorry, but shouldn't best friends close as brothers sit next to each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus growled at this, but wasn't fool enough to pick a fight with Tyranno. Not only was he a lot taller than Syrus, he was also a lot stronger and buffer. Picking a fight with him would be suicide. He just took his tray and moved it to sit across from the other two. He sighed and picked up his sandwich, taking a bite of it. He was so tired of constantly getting pushed around by everyone. It didn't help he had a poor self image of himself, but he was also short for his age and pathetic when it came to fighting in an actual fight. Ever since Tyranno had come into the picture, he had constantly gotten into verbal brawls with him but never took it far enough to actually fist fight with him. Sometimes, he wished he was bigger and stronger, able to defend himself and his friends not only in duels but also in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to finish the breakfast sandwich and after it was gone, Syrus felt a strange uplifting of his spirits. He felt like he had more energy and was also hungrier. He happily ate the rest of his breakfast, eating and listening rather than joining in with his friend's conversations. After awhile, they noticed how much and how fast he was eating and Jaden said, \"Ah, Syrus? Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus nodded and said, \"Sure, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you never usually eat so much. I was just wondering if you were sick or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus shook his head and said, \"I just feel really hungry this morning, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden shrugged and didn't press the subject. Everyone had days when they felt like they were starving. They finished breakfast and dropped their trays and dishes off before heading for their first class.</span></div></div>",

Tyranno had kicked Syrus out of his usual seat next to Jaden and had forced him into the row behind Jaden. He had wanted to sit on the other side of Jaden; but that was impossible since the new Jaden clone Johan had arrived. Since he arrived Jaden had been spending more time with him or Tyranno since he forces himself onto Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Syrus sat behind Jaden, sorrow in his eyes. Professor Crowler was teaching and was constantly bringing down members of Slyther Red. He did it to everyone but Jaden since he had aknowledged Jaden as a real duelist (Though he would never say that aloud.). Jaden just sat there looking down at Jaden while Crowler went on and on. 'It's not fair.' Syrus said  angrily. 'Everyone keeps on taking Jaden away from me! When will I get some alone time to talk with Jaden? I'd even duel him if it would get some time with him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, Syrus mind began to focus on something else as the class went on. He heard a rumbling sound. At first he didn't know where it was coming from. But then he heard the rumbling sound get louder and louder. Syrus rubbed his stomach in pain as felt it rumble again. 'Why am I so hungry all of a sudden? Why do I feel like eating a huge feast!? I just ate before school started!' Syrus thought as the rumbling continued to worsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And so class the new series of duel monster cards called-\" Professor Crowler spoke until he heard a huge rumbling sound erupt throughout the room. His eyes twitched angrily as everyone looked around to see who it was. \"Who is making that inconsiderate racket!? If you don't tell me right now it's detention for the next eight weeks and ten extra assignments each day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few seconds passed until Syrus raised his hand and gulped. \"It's my stomach sir. I'm really hungry!\" Syrus told him as another rumble emerge from his stomach, this one even louder than the last. Jaden and the gang looked up at Syrus, concern filling their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well get on out of here and see the school's nurse! I don't want that racket disturbing my classes!\" Crowler instructed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes sir!\" Syrus said as he got out of his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden looked up at Syrus concerned. \"Are you going to be all right Syrus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah Jaden! Don't worry about me!\" Syrus said cheerfully as he left. Jaden looked on as he left till he was gone, and then he sat there thinking for the rest of the class about what was wrong with Syrus. Syrus soon had a depressed look on his face. 'Great stupid! The one time I could spend time with Jaden and I told him not to worry!' Syrus told himself bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he headed for the nurse's office, his stomach rumbled so loud that half the school could hear it. Syrus rubbed his stomach in pain and let out a soft moan. \"Darn it! Darn it! Forget the Nurses! I need to eat and fast!\" Syrus told himself aloud as he ran towards the Cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Within minutes Syrus had arrived at the Academy's cafeteria. He saw no one in there, no doubt on their break before lunch. He entered the kitchen and was awestruck by what he saw. crates full of freshly cooked sandwiches, gallons of milk and other drinks, sweets as far as the eye can see, and loads of fattening foods that could turn a skinny kid into the blob in about 3 seconds. Syrus licked his lips hungrily as he looked on at the food. \"Time to feast!\" Syrus smiled as he jumped in.</span></div></div>",

Drool was practically running out of his mouth as he grabbed two of them at the same time. It took literally a minute to cram both sandwiches into his mouth and swallow them down with a quarter gallon of milk. Moving as fast as his hands would allow he jammed sandwich after sandwich down his throat until they were all gone. Syrus sighed and finished off his tenth gallon of milk. Even though he had eaten enough for the entire school, his stomach was only slightly distended. It was as if his body had distributed the food all over his body evenly. Thinking that would be enough, Syrus started heading for the exit of the cafeteria. He hadn't even made if halfway before his stomach roared at him to go back and keep eating. Groaning, grabbing his growling belly, Syrus ran back to the food and started eating the fruit next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, the lunch ladies were making their way back into the cafeteria to set out the lunch they had just made, but were astonished to see not a speck of food was in sight! It was like a wild animal had stormed in and devoured all the food, leaving nothing but wrappers, empty bottles, and spotless cans. The lunch ladies slowly made there way through the devestation, wondering who could've done all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" One of the youngest ladies asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is obviously some student prank!\" The senior lunch lady said, kicking aside an empty can of beans. \"We're going to tell the headmaster and have him find the culprits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the senior lunch lady called the headmaster and demanded that he find out what was going on or they were walking! Fearing a mass revolt over the loss of the lunch ladies, and therefore the loss of all cooked food, the headmaster instantly sent Professor Crowler to find the mischief makers at once. He was, of course, outraged that his precious time was being wasted finding some snot nose brats who stole an entire schools worth of food. He knew it had to be delinquents from Slifer Red. Who else would bother to orchestrate such an elaborate trick. He made a beeline for the Red dorms, eager to find out who did this and have them severely punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Crowler went on the prowl, Syrus had hid in his room. His stomach was finally quiet but he was worried it might start growling again. He had never ate so much in his life. He didn't even think it was possible for a human being of his size and weight to eat like that. What really freaked him out though, was that he hadn't gained any weight whatsoever. It wasn't natural and Syrus was starting to get worried that something was wrong with him. He jumped off his bed, a decision having been reached. He would go to the Nurses to see what was wrong with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Syrus decided that the only one that could help him was the Nurse. And he had to hurry. Dr. Crowler was on a witch hunt for anyone nearby the Cafteria. \"If he heard from another student that I was near their then that would be all that Crowler need's to hang me on the school's flagpole!\" Syrus said as he ran towards the Nurse's office. He wasted no time trying to get there. Every second could be a second too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But Syrus didn't realize what was happening inside his body. The serum was in a sense sentient, and wanted to bring forth what the serum sensed was what Syrus wanted. As it had merged with every molecule of Syrus being, the sentient serum soon realized what Syrus wanted. It knew he wanted to be stronger and faster than anyone else. And so it began a complicated system of transforming his body into a giant of muscle. Yet it didn't have the nutrients needed to activate this evolutionary change. So the serum made Syrus body crave food beyond anything. After he finished eating, the Serum knew it had achieved a vast amount of nutrients. More than enough to make it's host easily twice his height. Yet it did not want people to get suspicious of what it was doing. And so it began by slowly making Syrus body bigger. The next part of its step in achieving its host wishes was to get this 'Jaden Yuki' and make him the hosts mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden sat outside the nurses office. As soon as class had ended Jaden had left the class. He told the others he would be back after checking up on Syrus. He sat there outside. He had even skipped lunch, though he heard that all the food was gone. After he had arrived at the Nurses, the main nurse told him that Syrus hadn't come by all day. \"I hope Syrus comes by soon. I'm afraid he might be hurt real badly.\" Jaden said as he sat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Syrus quickly ran towards the Nurses office. He took all the routes and hallways that most people didn't travel, knowing Crowler wound't be bright enough to know he was taking the long way instead of the short way. As he ran, his muscles slowly started to grow larger. His legs started to thicken as his pants grew tighter. His arms started to become shorten and his arms thickened. His shirt slowly ride up to reveal a hardening six pack. His shoes grew tighter as he ran. 'What is wrong with my clothes?' Syrus thought desparately as he ran into the main hallway that lead to the Nurses. That's when he saw who was sitting outside the office. \"Jaden!\" Syrus exclaimed happily and then realized what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Sy!\" Jaden said as Syrus stopped running in front of Jaden. \"Sy why weren't you here by now? I thought you would've have them do every treatment possibly to cure whatever was wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Very funny!\" Syrus said with a laugh. Being around Jaden was so easy, so natural. \"I am going to tell you, but you've got to keep a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah Sy I promise? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was the one who  ate all the food in the cafeteria.\" Syrus whispered to Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden's eyes turned white with shock \"Really!? You ate all that food! Then why aren't you a blob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know! All I know is that hunger I felt made me so hungry I just ate and ate. I didn't gain a single ounce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden looked up and down Syrus body. Syrus was right that he didn't gain any fat from eating. But there was something else about him. He was taller, easily up to Jaden's neck in height. And he saw those muscles that were appearing all across Syrus body. \"Syrus, your taller and you like you've been at the gym!\" Jaden told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha?\" Syrus said in surprise. He looked down at his body and how his clothes were tighter against his new muscles. His clothes were also shorter against his body. Revealing his abs and leg muscles. \"I am bigger! No wonder I felt my clothes growing tighter when I was running!\" Suddenly Syrus let out another rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not again! I'm still hungry!\" Syrus said as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sy. You might need to go see the doctor. Though if you want we can go to Slifer Red. I have some food there for you.\" Jaden said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Syrus began to ponder this. Should he see the Nurses or should he got eat some more.</span></div></div>",

If he went to the nurses now, chances were he wouldn't be able to get anything to eat for a long time. He looked at Jaden and realized this was a perfect chance to be alone with him. If he chose to go to the nurses, he'd lose that opportunity until who knew when.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather go back to Slifer Red and get something to eat.\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then let's go!\" Jaden said, grabbing Syrus' hand and leading back to their dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus' heart leapt at the contact. He smiled and hurried along behind Jaden. It didn't take them long to reach the Slifer Red dorm but it was long enough. Syrus' stomach growled even louder as Jaden closed the door. He then went to his desk and pulled open the biggest drawer on the bottom. It was a surprisingly shallow drawer, only about the size of the other drawers. That is, it was until Jaden pulled off the false bottom. Inside the drawer was a large multitude of different chips,candies, and sodas all cleverly concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd need this someday since we're not allowed to have food in the dorm rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come I've never seen this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden shrugged. \"Didn't look hard enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus shrugged as well and said, \"Well, I guess it doesn't really matter. How much can I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden laughed and said, \"Have as much as you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus greatfully grabbed two sodas, a bag of chips, and three candy bars and started eating and drinking them all. Jaden just looked on in surprise as he saw Syrus stuff himself with as much food as he could get his hands on. He watched as his hidden supply of food dwindled down, down, down...nothing. Syrus burped and laid back on his bed, a content smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great!\" He said. \"Thanks Jaden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden looked at Syrus laying on the bed and said, \"You know, those clothes are really too small for you now. Until you get some new ones I'll lend you some of mine okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus jumped up and said, \"Really? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure!\" He said, opening his closet. \"You can't go walking around the school like that can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus shook his head and grabbed the clothes Jaden passed out to him. He then began to strip off his old clothes, giving Jaden a better look at his new bigger body. He was really shocked to see such a drastic change in his friend, especially since he'd been normal that same morning. But it also felt right. Syrus had taken a lot of crap from a lot of people over the years and if anyone deserved something like this it was Syrus. Yet he was also worried about his friend. Changes like this weren't normal. He should really see a doctor. He snapped out of these thoughts as Syrus said, \"Thanks Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was bemused to see that his clothes were still a little tight on Syrus. Even though Syrus was still shorter than Jaden, he was quite a bit thicker. Syrus felt a strange, heady feeling being in Jaden's clothes. It took him a little while to realize that he could smell Jaden's scent on his clothes. He had washed them, but under the smell of detergent was the unmistakable smell of his friend. This would be what it felt like if they were close, holding each other, perhaps even kissing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus' face heated up like a steamed vegetable. He coughed to break the silence and said, \"Thanks.\" again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem buddy!\" Jaden said cheerfully. He looked at the clock and said, \"We'd better get going if we want to make the next class on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus nodded and bit his lip. He didn't want to go. Not yet. Who knew when he'd get to spend more time with Jaden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syrus?\" Jaden said, concern in his voice. \"Are you alright?\"</span></div></div>",

Syrus enjoyed the touch and was saddened by the release. \"It's alright buddy! Stay here for now. That way you won't have to worry about him going to the Obelisk Blue dorm!\" Jaden told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks Jaden.\" Syrus said happily, smelling a strange scent that was even more overpowering of Jaden's scent from the clothes. It smelled like a sweet, sugary scent with a tough and calmness about it. It was Jaden's regular scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I have to get back to class. I got a couple more hours of the chef professor from Ra Yellow. Need to catch up on my sleep!\" Jaden chuckled as he got up. The thought of Jaden leaving him was a bit too much for Syrus right now. Syrus grabbed his hand and felt the warm touch of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jaden. Will you stay here with me? I feel a bit tired. And I don't want you to leave just so you could get caught by Dr. Crowler.\" Syrus explained to him. He had big puppy dog eyes as he stared at Jaden. With his eyes magnified by his new growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All right Sy. I do feel *yawn* a bit tired.\" Jaden told him as he yawned. He layed himself upon his bed, ready to go to sleep. \"Well? Are you joining me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Syrus jumped as Jaden asked him that question. \"But are you sure? There isn't much room on your bed!\" Syrus told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden laughed \"Well yeah! But were friends. So it's okay if you lay here.\" Jaden said as he got underneath the blankets. Syrus swallowed hard and began to crawl underneath to the blankets. As he layed there, he felt Jaden's hands on his hips. Syrus let out a silent gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jaden. Your hands are wrapped around me.\" But Syrus soon learned it was futlile, Jaden was completly asleep. That was all it took for him to go to bed. Just let him stay there for any time longer than 3 seconds and he was out like a lightbulb. Syrus smiled as he brought his lips to Jadens. They kissed quickly, with Syrus blushing and Jaden happily snoozing. Completly oblivious to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Night Jaden.\" Syrus said as he buried himself into Jaden's chest. Not realizing that a blue glow encompassed the two of them, forever marking them as each other's. And Syrus fell into a deep slumber.</span></div></div>",

But that was just too bad for him wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued working, his phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Kaiba, sir, I have some bad news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It had better not be about the growth serum tests.\" Seto said dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually sir...that's exactly what this is about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto growled and slammed his fist on his desk. Every freakin time! As soon as money went into a project the idiots that worked for him had to find a way to screw it up! He composed himself as best he could and said, \"Just spit it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes sir! We recieved a call from the research branch at Duelist Academy saying they had succesfully recieved the vials of the serum. Unfortunately, between the time of the vials arriving and the time of the scientists down there picking them up, two of the vials went missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?!?\" Seto yelled into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm afraid two of the vials are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're secure in the lab at this time. We decided it would be best if we talked to you first before deciding to commence the tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto thought about it for awhile. He was eager to test out the growth serum and get some results, but this was a top secret project. If something went wrong, he wanted no connection with it. It would be best to try and find the two missing vials before someone got a hold of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Postpone the tests for now.\" He said at last. \"Concentrate all your time on locating the missing vials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!

If those vials were consumed and a couple of uncontrollable giants suddenly appeared, it would ruin his company and his reputation. And this whole endeavor had already cost a fortune from the prototypes of his size chaning ray all the way to the growth serum. He didn't want lawsuits thrown on top of this whole mess. He turned back to his computer and closed the program he was in. He started typing letters to various branches of his business. He needed to be ready if anything went wrong...</span></div></div>",

As he fully opened his eyes; Jaden looked into someone's chest. His pecs were rippling and thick, straining the shirt he had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden stared in awe as he saw the muscles tearing the shirt. Jaden looked over this tall muscular human's body and was amazed by what he saw. His arms were thick and bulging, the sleeves having been torn by the muscles as they grew through the day. His jeans were tight and ripping at the sides, barely able to hold back the thick muscles bulging in the legs. Jaden blushed as he felt the arms holding his sides, Jaden felt the large hands of this grown human holding with a gentle yet strong force. Jaden finally decided to look up into the face of this growing human and was shocked(not really) by who it belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden stared at the peaceful slumbering face of Syrus. He was easily a foot taller than Jaden, something neither of them could conceive before his growth.

They had been through a lot together but did he really love him in another way? Jaden didn't know and with Syrus in a deep sleep, grinding against him, it wasn't exactly a good time to find out. He didn't want to hurt Syrus and he didn't want to wake him up, so he eased himself out of the bed and tip toed to the door. He opened it and stepped outside, closing the door as quietly as he could. Syrus slept on, not really noticing the lack of Jaden next to him, though he did sense something had changed. He continued to dream, his hard on subsiding without Jaden to fuel his lust. He wasn't in the least bit confused about his feelings for Jaden. He loved him and wanted to be with him for the rest of his life no matter what. Jaden was the best thing that ever happened to him and he wouldn't lose him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were not new feelings, but lately Syrus had been starting to feel more bold and less timid. He couldn't explain these new feelings anymore than he could explain his sudden growth and hunger. But it didn't matter. He knew what he wanted and his body was slowly growing larger to help ensure he got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Syrus slept on, Jaden had discovered that it was night already, somewhat late night. There had only been three classes left before he and Syrus had slept for eight hours, meaning everyone was supposed to be in their dorms. Jaden wasn't too worried about being out late though. He had often wandered around the school grounds at night to help clear his mind on the days he actually needed to seriously think about something (which was, admittedly, not often). But he needed to think on his feelings now before he ended up doing something that hurt Syrus and even himself. He thought about the last few days and how he felt about Syrus then. As he replayed the days nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the way he felt about Syrus. Even after Syrus started growing he hadn't felt any different about him. But as soon as he had woke up with Syrus holding him in his newly muscled arms, his peaceful face smiling down on him, his erection a reassuring pillar against his own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden felt his face heating up just thinking about it. It didn't really matter how he felt about Syrus. They were close friends, maybe closer, and they had to be there for each other.

And it made things all the more creepier. 'Must be my imagination.' Jaden thought as he continued to walk towards the Slyther Dorm. He took no more than three steps before the sound of rustling bushes went through his ears once again. He turned around just as it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello!? Is anyone out there at all?\" Jaden called, yet STILL nothing. He rubbed his forehead \"I don't have time for this!\" He grunted as he went back to the dorms. That's when it struck.

So Jaden shouted \"Someone help m-!\" But he was stopped as the Goliath moved at superspeed and covered Jaden's mouth before he could call out for help. \"Mmmf!\" He moaned as the goliath shadow wrapped his other arm around Jaden's body. Jaden tried to struggle against the behemoth, but he was simply too massive. That's when Jaden realized something 'This guy must be changing like Syrus!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not knowing what this giant wanted scared him and made him struggle all the more. The goliath somehow knew Jaden's fear, and wrapped his arms in a more gentle embrace around Jaden. Yet he still struggled, seeing it's attempts to calm him fail the goliath began to release a strange scent from it's body. As Jaden smelled it he felt like barfing 'ugh! This smellllllllls sooooo nnn-' Jaden began to feel the affects of the barf smelling scent put him to sleep. The giant sighed in pity as it nestled Jaden into one of it's massively muscled arms, cradling him against his hard pecs and the larger than a bowling ball biceps in his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n And all that Jaden could faintly hear before falling asleep was this \"Don't worry Jaden. Everything will be all right once I make you mine.\" The Goliath told him in a hushed and husky voice as the barf scent vanished and he jumped in a hulk like manner into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----5 hours later-----<br>\r\n A bright light touched Jaden's eyes, forcing him to awaken. \"Yawwwn! What a bizarre dream, I had been dreaming about a muscled Syrus and a equally muscular if  even larger than Syrus behemoth kidnapped me!\" Jaden cheerfully laughed. \"Thank goodness it was just a dr-\" Jaden looked around as he stretched, feeling a breeze against his skin. Looking down, he blushed embarassingly as he saw he was naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My clothes! Where are they?\" Jaden said as he looked around. They were nowhere in site. \"And where am I?\" He thought as he saw he was at the edge of a cave's entrance. Which appeared to have been hidden behind a waterfall, but not enough to hide sunlight from entering a opening on the side. \"That must mean everything that happend did...\" He trailed off, hoping the events weren't true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your awake. That's good. I was getting worried after I used that on you.\" Said a deep voice from deeper inside the cave. Turning around,  Jaden was shocked as he saw....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaden was at a loss for words. Now not only was his best friend Syrus going through some crazy growth spurt so was his other best friend Tyranno! How was this all happening?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaden thought these thoughts, Tyranno stood up, his head nearly hitting the top of the cave. Jaden looked up at his huge body, not a single stitch of clothing in sight. Jaden slowly backed away as Tyranno advanced. Jaden was almost positive Tyranno wouldn't hurt him. But then again, he was positive before that he'd never kidnap him either. Tyranno had a look in his eye Jaden had never seen before: a savage, wild look like an animal. This made Jaden even more uneasy and he turned and ran for the entrance to the cave. Unfortunately, the waterfall was far too powerful for him to move under. Jaden guessed the only way Tyranno had made it under here was due to his enormous size. Before Jaden could even think of a backup plan, he felt Tyranno's huge arms envelope him from behind. Jaden didn't struggle this time, not wanting that awful smell to come out again. Jaden was pressed against Tyranno's chest feeling his massive heart beat. Jaden began to relax as Tyranno didn't do anything else. When Jaden was totally relaxed Tyranno let him go and pushed him onto his back. Leaning over him he whispered, \"Now that I have you, I'm not letting you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden gulped and said, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno grinned and licked his lips. \"I mean that from this moment on you're mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden replied, \"Well, actually, I don't feel that way about you. We're just friends after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno stopped suddenly and looked into Jaden's eyes. He said, \"But you smelled my scent. That marks you as mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden's eyes shifted and he said, \"What you mean that horrible reek? Yeah I smelled it and it knocked me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno looked hurt as he said, \"You mean you weren't swooning from love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fraid not.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno sat back looking disconsolate. \"But that should have worked! There isn't anyone else on this island who could've marked you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus suddenly leapt into Jaden's mind and he coughed slightly. This was an odd new development. Had Syrus ever bombarded him with a strange smell? No, the only thing Jaden had ever smelled was Syrus' normal, sweet smell. The more Jaden thought of Syrus, the more his heart raced, the more he felt a desire to be near to him. Jaden shook his head slightly, but it still felt fuzzy with longing. But now was not the time! This was his chance to get some questions answered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyranno how did this happen to you?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno sighed and said, \"It happened earlier today. I was looking for some food to eat since someone had ate all the food in the cafeteria and I nearly tripped over a small glass vial. Since no one was around I grabbed it and smelled it. Since it smelled like strawberries I assumed it was from the cafeteria, so I swiped it and drank it. That hadn't done much good, as a few hours later I was starving. I mean, real deep down starving! I stumbled into the kitchens and was able to break into the food storage. The lunch ladies had all gone on strike until they found whoever ate all the food. Anyway, I just kept eating and eating, never really feeling satisfied. But the more I ate, the more I changed. After I eaten all the food I found I was at least a foot taller and my muscles were even bigger than normal. My clothes were too tight in places, and totally ripped apart in other places so I just went back to my dorm room and took them off. I was tired so I took a nap. And I dreamed. I dreamed of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\" Jaden asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Tyranno said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no?\" Jaden said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno sighed again and said, \"I love you Jaden! There, I came right out and said it! You were supposed to be mine! Ever since I got to know you I've known you're the one for me! But that idiot Johan and that wimp Syrus were always getting in my way! So something inside me let me grow bigger and stronger to be able to make you mine forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was starting to get nervous as Tyranno had that animalistic look in his eye again. Before he could move Tyranno pinned him down. Jaden looked down and saw Tyranno's cock swollen and hard, aiming like a spear. Jaden's eyes bugged out as he saw that thing. This wouldn't end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to make you mine, smell or no smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden whimpered and closed his eyes. Hopefully it would be quick!</span></div></div>",

And yet it was different. Jaden opened his eyes to see that Tyranno had placed Jaden on the ground and was covering his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ugh! That smell is so nasty!\" Tyranno groaned as his face turned green. Even though he had protected his nose, the scent was still overpowering him. \"I can't let this stop me!\" Tyranno said as he let go of his nose and grabbed Jadens shoulders with his massive hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jaden braced himself to be lifted into the air. But was surprised as Tyranno let go. His entire body felt over and he hit his head upon the side of the cave. The wall cracked all along the side thanks to the sheer strength of Tyrannos skull. He layed there peacefully, his head perfectly fine and his body stretching from one wall to the other. \"Thank goodness he's out.\" Jaden sighed as he stood up. Suddenly he heard a massive animal like snoring coming from Tyranno. His snoring was so loud and painful that Jaden just couldn't stay in the waterfall cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess it's time to go.\" So he started to move towards the exit. He could still smell that sweet scent even now. \"I wonder if Syrus is standing out around the lake. After all the waterfall slides off the volcano and into it.\" Jaden stated as he stepped inches away from the waterfall. 'How strong is the water?' He thought as he moved his hand into it. The water hit his hand with such force that it felt like someone had smashed a rock into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ouch! Damn that hurts!\" Jaden said angrily as he looked at the speeding water as it fell. With something like this blocking his way, he would never get out. \"And the one person who could use his body to shield me\" He looked over at Tyranno's sleeping body \"Is fast asleep. Though that's probably for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That's when Jaden realized that there was someone else he could get help from! There had been a scent all most like Syrus that was coming from outside. And to Tyranno it stank like vomit and knock out gas. 'I could get their help!' He thought cheerfully. \"Anyone whose out there!\" He shouted into the waterfall as loud as he could \"Please save me!\" Stepping back a bit, Jaden stood five feet away as he saw a towering giant emerge from the other side of the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the giant emerged, Jaden was embarassed when he saw it was....</span></div></div>",

He instantly felt around with his arm, trying to find Jaden and was dismayed to discover he was gone. He slowly started sitting up and smacked his head on the ceiling. This woke him up completely and he looked around. He was currently trapped in the dorm room, his body much, much bigger than it had been before. In fact, by Syrus' own calculations, he estimated himself to be around twenty feet tall! Not only that, his muscles were huge! Whatever had been going on in his body had certainly gone into overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Syrus know, the liquid knew that competition for Jaden was currently active, having a connection with the other vials of liquid, and knew that two others sought Jaden's affections. To combat that, it had worked Syrus' body larger, stronger, with a fiercer desire to protect and hold. Syrus tried to move around, but was unable. The dorm room was far too small. Syrus could feel the walls pressing into him, feel the crushed bed under his backside, feel his feet bent up against the opposite wall. He knew there was only one way out of this. He had to break down the walls. Since his arms were hopelessly cramped to his sides he put pressure on the opposite wall with his feet. Within seconds the wall crumbled with a loud crack, stones raining on Syrus' bare feet like pebbles. With his feet firmly planted, sticking halfway out of the building, Syrus braced his legs and pushed his feet up, causing his knees to smash into the ceiling and break it apart. Finally, he brought his legs pistoning downward, angling them against the  opposite wall at the last second, shattering it completely. Dressers, a bed, and a chair fell through the hole in the ceiling from the room above this one. With his legs now free, Syrus turned his attention to his arms. He flexed his massive biceps, forcing his elbows into either wall, making two more holes. Bringing his arms out of the flex, he smashed his fists into each wall, bringing it down and revealing the rooms next to this one. With his arms free, Syrus braced himself against the floor and pushed backward, smashing through the wall behind him. Now only a small part of his body was still inside the room.  Planting his hands on the ground and pushing with his feet, he managed to shimmy himself out of the room without causing further damage. Standing up to his full height, Syrus wiped his forehead and sighed. He didn't even register he was naked, his manhood dangling proudly before him. He walked around the building, his footsteps loud and shaking, and was taken aback by what he saw. Apparently, his attempts to free himself had not gone unnoticed. The entire dorm was standing outside the building, gazing open mouthed at Syrus. Syrus, now acutely aware of the fact that he was naked, blushed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The entire dorm stared up in awe. They all looked at Syrus. His mountainous, godlike form shining in the sun. Most of the girls had fainted, nosebleeds oozing from their nostrils(and a few guys as well). The students who hadn't fainted were either extremly embarassed or helping the faintees. But Syrus couldn't care about that. He was worried about something far more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Jaden.' Syrus thought as he looked down at the tinies. He somehow knew Jaden wasn't here. He wasn't sure, but he felt a strange urge. Like he could sense where he was. \"Jaden.\" Was all the muscular giant called out. His erection was hard as he thought of the easy-going duelist. He even felt like towering over Jaden, showing his godlike form. If he was normal size, Syrus would look like his normal size self, except he would have muscles rivaling bodybuilders. He could show off for the entire school, showing how he was the biggest and strongest duelist(literally!). 'But none of that matters. Only Jaden does.' He though as he started to take steps. Slifer students in his way quickly moved as he began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Each step crashed into the earth, sending a small earthquake that knocked down students. The sheer weight of each foot as he walked made massive craters into the ground. The footprints of a giant human could be seen where he had stepped. With the ground surrounding it cracked and ripped apart. Unable to handle the stress. \"I'm so powerful.\" Syrus chuckled as he walked through the forest. the trees were slightly shorter than him. But that could not stop this god. He continued to press forward. His large hard cock slammed into trees, bending them over as he walked over them. He flattened every tree in his way. Nothing and I repeat nothing would get in Syrus's way! Jaden was his, and he couldn't help but feel that there were others that threatened that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Syrus made his way to Jaden, Jaden himself was staring at the enormous shadow just on the other side of the waterfall. Before he could react, a gigantic hand darted forward through the crashing spray and reached for Jaden. Jaden fell back and instinctively crawled  away from it. The massive hand, connected to an equally massive arm felt around the cave, trying to grab Jaden, the bicep flexing. Jaden forced himself to stop. He had called out for this giant and he needed a way out of this cave before Tyranno woke up. Jaden glanced back at Tyranno and saw he was still asleep. After confirming this, Jaden walked forward and allowed the hand to touch him. Gently, the hand wrapped around Jaden's body  until he was sitting on the palm, his back resting against the fingers. Slowly the hand began to curl closed and Jaden quickly turned on his side, curling into a ball so that the hand could make a fist around him. Combined with the intoxicating scent of the giant, the warmth of his hand was very relaxing and Jaden sighed and felt tired. All sound was muffled including the pounding of the waterfall as the hand passed smoothly under it, not a drop of water getting inside to get Jaden's vulnerable body wet. Jaden felt the fingers loosening around him and slowly sat up, looked up to see who had saved him. His eyes met those of Jesse, looking to be around twenty five feet tall at least. Jaden's eyes widened as he took in Jesse's enormous body, his massive chest, his bulging biceps, his abs, cut so deep Jaden knew he could probably hang from them. The ground around his feet was broken up, with long cracks jutting around his footprints. Even though Jaden couldn't see around this massive god like duelist, he knew there would be several more footprints behind him, each one shattering the ground. Jaden looked back up and said, \"Thank you for saving me Jesse. I almost had a really bad experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse smiled and said, \"Well, you're safe now Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the smaller duelist close to him and Jaden felt lightheaded with the smell coming from his body. Jaden's heart was pounding, much like it was doing when he had been with Syrus. Did this mean he liked Jesse and Syrus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought was like a spike through his head. What would Syrus think if he saw this? Just sitting this close to Jesse felt like a betrayal to Syrus. Jesse noticed his look and, with concern in his voice, asked, \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden looked up at him and said, \"This...doesn't feel right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse frowned and said, \"You don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! It's not that!\" Jaden said, waving his hands around. \"It's just...things between me and Syrus have been so confusing...and lately everything has been kind of...strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange like me being a giant, or strange emotionally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked Jaden straight in the eye and said, \"I love you Jaden. I want you to realize that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden blushed as he heard this. Deep in his heart, he knew he loved Jesse as well. But he still had feelings, strong feelings, for Syrus. Would it be unfair to think that all three of them could be together? Probably. Yet both Jesse and Syrus had the same scent...obviously that meant all three of them were meant to be together, right? Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden's head was filled with conflicting emotions and thoughts. It was all too much to take in right now. Suddenly, the ground began to rumble, pushing all thoughts out of both Jaden and Jesse's minds. A loud grinding crack filled the air, drawing the boys attention to the cave. The waterfall was shivering, as rocks started falling off the forty foot mountain, splashing into the pool at the bottom of the waterfall. The whole front half of the mountain seemed to be falling apart! Jaden, remembering that Tyranno was still inside, had a strange feeling of foreboding. Suddenly, a huge fist punched through the mountain face, sending a waved of cold spray over Jesse, who quickly shielded Jaden, keeping him dry. Another fist broke out, followed by a huge foot, then another. With a fierce grinding the entire face of the mountain exploded outward showering the landscape with rocks and water. Once all the debris had cleared Jaden peered between Jesse's fingers and nearly fainted at what he saw. Tyranno was standing where the cave had been, ten feet taller than the mountain itself. His muscles had bulged to even greater sizes, his shadow engulfing Jesse. He grinned down at him and said, \"Trying to steal Jaden from me huh? Big mistake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranno cracked his knuckles and advanced on Jesse, ready to take Jaden back by force if need be.</span></div></div>",

The Merry Go was currently docked at an island while the crew was exploring. Nami, Usopp, Nico, and Chopper had stayed behind to collect supplies leaving Zoro, Luffy, and Sanji to follow a map Nami had found. It wasn't a very detailed map. All it showed was two islands and a path that connected them. They had found the island, but so far it was nothing special. It appeared to be totally deserted. Each crew member was searching a different part of the island and so far, no luck. Frustrations were running high, especially for Luffy who was starting to get really hungry. Just when he was about to give up and head back to the Merry Go, he pushed aside a clump of bushes and saw something strange. Immense ruins lay in the middle of a clearing. Luffy was amazed by the sheer size of the structure that was shielded from view from the outside world by the enormous trees that grew around it. Luffy quickly ran into the entrance, eager to see what he could find. Dissapointingly the ruins seemed to consist of only one room. An entirely empty room. Luffy walked around the length of it but couldn't find anything. He turned back to leave when he spotted a table. He looked around wondering where it had come from. On it were three items: A bottle full of green liquid, a box full of cookies, and a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy tried to pick up the book but it seemed to be glued to the table. He flipped through it and saw a few pictures of the items on the table with what appeared to be instructions of some sort next to them. He closed the book again. It was too boring to bother with. He grabbed the bottle and the box and started heading back to the Merry Go.</span></div></div>",

Before he could stuff them in his mouth, Zoro grabbed his arm and said, \"One! If they're poison one shouldn't be fatal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy emptied his hand of cookies except for one and Zora let him go. He popped the small cookie in his mouth and chewed it up. It didn't taste like much, just a regular sugar cookie. He swallowed it and said, \"Seems fine to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro still looked skeptical and said, \"Let's just wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they waited. A few minutes later, Luffy's stomach growled and he said, \"Can I have another one yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zoro could answer, something very strange happened. Luffy started to grow! Zoro backed away as Luffy's body expanded, breaking the chair he was sitting in. His legs lengthened on either side of Zoro until his feet were hanging over the bow of the ship. His head traveled higher and higher into the sky until it was level with the crow's nest. Finally, his butt ended up resting on the stern of the ship with his hands gripping the sides of the ship for balance. The whole thing was rocking back and forth due to the sudden change in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro gaped up at his huge captain, completely at a loss for words. Before either one could say anything there was a frenetic pounding from below deck. Zoro looked over at the door leading below deck and saw Luffy was sitting in a way that blocked it. Sanji was probably wondering what the heck was going on. Suddenly, Luffy laughed and said, \"Didn't see that coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sweatdropped at the casualness of this statement and yelled, \"I told you, you shouldn't have eaten them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy looked down at Zoro and said, \"Now can I have another one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! YOU CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER ONE!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Sanji's voice came from behind the door. \"What's going on out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered him and Luffy couldn't shift his position without falling off the boat.</span></div></div>",

Carefully he proceeded to get up off the boat and placed his feet in the cold water which was small enough to be insignificant and non-threatening. Luffy lifted himself off the boat. Causing it to tumble and shake for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoa!\" Shouted Zoro as he was backed on his feet. As he did, he noticed Luffy's hands were moving down to the cookies. \"Oh no you don't!\" He shouted angrily as he went for the cookies.</span></div></div>",

This is just the effects of the Big Big Fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Devil Fruit huh?\" Zoro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I'll explain everything when we meet up with the others. This island is pretty much deserted and we found an empty house in the woods we can use. Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped off the side of the ship and started running into the woods.

You think you can let us down now!?!?\" Sanji yelled up at the giant captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy set them down and they walked into the house. Luffy tried to see into the window but was unable. Finally, he grabbed the roof in his hands and pulled it off, looking inside the house. Nami had already set out the box and the bottle and was about to start explaining. Ussop, Chopper, and Robin all looked up at the giant Luffy and each one opened their mouth to ask a question but Nami said, \"Save it! I'm going to explain everything I know first, then we can discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mouths snapped shut and Nami began explaining the powers of the Big Big Fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I learned about this fruit a long time ago when I was just getting started working for Arlong. The Fish Men pirates were looking for it all over the place but could never find it. Legend has it, that only somehow who isn't looking for it, can find it. So since every single one of the pirates knew about it, they could never find it. They managed to get quite a bit of information on it, and I of course stole it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid out a piece of paper with a picture on it showing a strange fruit shaped like a heart. There seemed to be two distinct fruit conjoined at the base, but on closer inspection, it proved to be a single piece of fruit. Tiny black lettering in a foreign language was crammed onto every availabe inch of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took forever for me to translate it.\" Nami said, continuing her story. \"But I finally found someone who spoke this language and got is deciphered. The Big Big Fruit is unique to other Devil Fruits in that it has two effects. One is to make a person grow larger at will, while the other is to make the person grow smaller at will. Unfortunately, it was so difficult to locate that only one man ever found it. Despite having found it, he never ate it himself but instead dehydrated it until it was compressed into two forms. They are what you see before you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the box and revealed the cookies. \"These cookies are from the growing side of the fruit, while this liquid is from the shrinking side of the fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Luffy's not stuck like this then?\" Zoro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. To shrink him back to normal, all we have to do is give him some of the liquid. Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but I don't want to go back to normal!\" Luffy said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Luffy! How are we supposed to sail through the Grand Line when you're too big to fit in the boat?\" Zoro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's no way I'm going to cook for you when you're that huge! Sanji said. \"You'd clean out our whole store of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're right Luffy.\" Robin said. \"It's just not practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy crossed his arms and said, \"It doesn't matter. I'm staying like this to help me become King of the Pirates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crew sighed and tried to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

I may look like a kid, but I'm older than any of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Zoro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ryohei Kisimura! I've been charged with keeping watch over the Big Big Fruit! Honestly, I fall asleep for a few years and people just walk into my house and steal my stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one quite knew what to make of this boy. He had short spiky red hair and was wearing a long shirt that reached his knees. He was holding a teddy bear in one hand and a huge key in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait.\" Nami said. \"How can you be the keeper of the Big Big Fruit? It's been lost for decades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei sighed and said, \"Like I said, I only look like a kid! My great grandfather charged me with keeping that particular Devil Fruit after he dehydrated it. The fruit is too dangerous to fall into human hands, so he disguised it and hid it in a huge temple. Then he gave me the key to the temple and put me to sleep in a stone coffin. If anyone was ever to remove the fruit from its hididng place, I would be woken up and sent to catch the thieves! And now I've found you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you plan on doing now?\" Sanji asked, leaning back in his chair. \"You're just a little kid! Even Ussop could kill you without trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!?!?\" Ussop demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei growled and said, \"My grandfather gave me this key so I could stop anyone! I've already locked the temple I was sleeping in and retrieved my grandfather's other treasure! The Buff Buff Fruit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the kid dropped both the key and the teddy bear and gritted his teeth in concentration. At first, it didn't look like anything was happening. Then, before the startled Straw Hats, his muscles started growing! Slowly his arms thickened, ripping the sleeves of the shirt, his legs strengthened, rippling and pushing his feet into the floor, cracking the tile. The shirt split down his back as he continued growing, the material falling away to show off his deep six pack and his ripped pecs. He was left standing in his underwear, a seven foot tall muscle monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I didn't see that coming...\" Sanji said from the floor, having fallen in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody do something!\" Nami shrieked, grabbing the bag and stuffing everything back into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving fast, Chopper changed into his human form and locked hands with Ryohei. Knowing he wouldn't be able to hold him for long, the others ran out of the house into Luffy's hands. He stood up and said, \"Couldn't I just squash him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Luffy!\" Nami shouted. \"The Buff Buff fruit does more than just increase muscle mass! Not even you could beat him now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can I have another cookie?\" Luffy asked. \"That would help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would just make more problems!\" Everyone else yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy 'humphed' and started walking away with his crew.</span></div></div>",

But his crew were now worried about how big he could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thinking on impulse, both Zoro and Nami jumped out and shouted \"Oh no you don't!\" and jumped into the air to catch the rising box full of growth cookies. \"We can't have you getting any bigger!\" Zoro stated angrily as he held onto to the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah! If you get any bigger then most of this island wouldn't even make suitable living space for you! And do you think we'll be able to move you on a ship? Of course not!\" Nami stated angrily \"Plus you ate the cursed fruit and you'll fall into the ocean if you try to swim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If i'm big enough then all I have to do is a gomu gomu toss and send myself towards the nearest island!\" Luffy told them as they held on for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile the others looked on from below. \"What do we do!? What do we do!?\" Chopper cried in terror as he ran around in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How should we know? It's not like we can do anything when their 40 feet in the air!\" Usopp stated as he looked up from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I could have grabbed if I could see it. But both Zoro's and Nami's bodies are blocking my sight.\" Robin said as she looked up at the rising hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However none of them needed to worry as the box began to slip thanks to Luffy squeezing the box between his fingers and the weight of Nami and Zoro making it slip between the fingers. Soon the fingers lost their grip with the box and it fell along with Zoro and Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My beloved Nami! I'll catch you!\" Sanji stated happily as he stood under her and held his arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her body and Zoro's fell faster than the box and sped towards the ground. But instead of landing in Sanji's arms, Nami crash landed on top of  Sanji's head. \"Ouch!\" She shouted as her body flattened Sanji's in order to soften the blow. \"Thanks for saving me Sanji.\" Nami told him as she petted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anything for you my precious Nami!\" He mumbled from underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry Zoro! I'll get you!\" Robin stated as she used her powers to create hands beneath Zoro, stopping him from crashing into the ground. The hands placed him on the  ground after their job was done and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks Nico.\" Zoro replied as he looked up at the box that was falling. And that's when he noticed what was wrong. The box was open and a cookie out before Luffy caught it. \"He's got the box!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nami who had just gotten off Sanji. She dusted herself off and looked up into the air as well along with the rest of the crew. \"Great! Now what are we supposed to do?!\" Not realizing a cookie was falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The group stared up with their mouths open at as Luffy brought the box to his face. No doubt wondering if he should eat one or all the cookies. That's when the cookie landed into the mouth of....</span></div></div>",

Zoro gagged as he felt something land inside his mouth and convulsively swallowed. The cookie went down hard and Zoro nearly choked on it. But what was done, was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Zoro said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's gaze, even Luffy's, was drawn downwards as Zoro started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew was forced to take steps back as Zoro grew taller and taller, his feet covering more and more ground. Eventually, one of Zoro's heels smashed a wall to the now tiny house behind him, forcing Zoro to take a step forward. The whole ordeal was dizzying for the now giant swordsman as his view constantly changed. Finally the growth stopped when he was normal sized compared to Luffy. Thinking fast, Zoro grabbed the box and said, \"There! That's one problem solved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solved? SOLVED!?!?!? How has anything been solved?!?!?\" Ussop screamed up at Zoro. \"Now you're both giants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really getting out of hand!\" Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least Zoro can keep Luffy in line.\" Robin said shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy frowned and said, \"Aw come on Zoro! I want to eat those cookies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy made a grab for the box, but Zoro kept it out of his reach. \"I don't think so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small scuffle broke out between the crew mates, their feet constantly moving. The tiny crew members had to run and dodge Zoro's huge black shoes, and Luffy's massive sandal clad feet lest they get squashed. Chopper was making an annoying racket, screaming and running around like a madman. Finally, Luffy gave up and sat down, crossing his arms with a \"humph!\". Now that things were finally settling down, Nami pulled the liquid out of the bag and said, \"Now both of you drink this and get back to normal! We're on a mission remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants looked down at the bottle, then at each other. Zoro looked down at Nami and said...</span></div></div>",

A wicked smile crossing his face. \"On second thought. Being  a giant isn't so bad.\" And then he chugged the liquid out into the sky. In seconds it vanished into the horizon and was lost, landing somewhere in the North Blue. He put his swords on the ground as he looked down at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luffy looked on and was in disbelief for ten seconds. He had thought Zoro was going to make him shrink. Instead he found out he was his ally. \"Good job Zoro!\" Luffy chuckled as he waved his hands in the air in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The entire crew was stunned in shock as they saw Zoro betray them. For several minutes none of them talked. At least until Nami stepped forward after gaining her composure. \"Zoro! How could you do that?!\" Nami said angrily as she looked up at him. \"Now we have no way to shrink you or Luffy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Exactly.\" Zoro stated as he looked down at them. \"The feeling I have now since I grew big is intoxicating. Why I am so strong now now I could slice a mountain in half with just a slight swing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But that still isn't a reason for you to go and do this! There must be some other reason why you choose to act like this.\" Robin said as she looked on with the others. Usopp and Chopper were flinging their arms around in terror and Sanji took this chance to wrap his arms around Nami. Only to get beaten to a pulp by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What possible reason could you have for doing this?\" Nami asked the giant swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What reason? What reason? We'll allow me to show you why I would like to become a giant alongside Luffy.\" Zoro quickly grabs Luffy's arm and pulls him into his lap. Luffy made a yelp and blushed as he fell into Zoro's lap. Two arms wrapped around the Captain as he was put into Zoro's arms. The only problem was this-Luffy wasn't trying to resist at all. Looking down at the rest of the crew, Zoro smiled evilly as he spoke down to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But now it doesn't matter.\" he said, holding Luffy tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on!\" Nami said. \"How does something like this happen without anyone noticing? We all sleep in the same room!\" (Have you seen the ending theme? They're all in there together.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple.\" Zoro said. \"Every night we take turns up in the crows nest to watch out for land and other ships. So whenever Luffy or I have to keep a lookout, the other comes up to keep them company. That's how started anyway. Needless to say, on some of those nights there isn't much looking going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!?\" Chopper screeched. \"You mean we could've crashed the ship just because you two were...were....uhh...\" Chopper fell onto his back in disbelief, Ussop fanning him, both to help revive him and stay out of this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro grinned down and reached around Luffy, heading straight for Nami. Sanji instantly sprang into action, lashing out at Zoro's hand with a fierce kick. Of course, this did nothing to discourage him. The kick was barely felt. Nami yelled in surprise as she was suddenly swept up in Zoro's huge, and slightly calloused, hand. She peered between two of his fingers and saw it was a long fall down. And Sanji might be there in time to catch her again. She turned and found herself face to face with both Zoro and Luffy. Zoro had an evil grin on his face while Luffy looked as happy and clueless as ever. Zoro tossed Nami slightly, up and down on his hand. She yelped with every movement and Zoro said, \"So Luffy...what should we do with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy seemed to be thinking about it. Nami held her breath, hoping against hope that Luffy would see the light and put a stop to this madness. Her hopes were in vain as Luffy said, \"I don't care. Whatever you want to do Zoro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's grin got, if possible, even bigger. He stopped tossing Nami up and down and held her in his palm. The other Straw Hats looked up in trepidation, wondering what was going to happen next. Obviously, things were going to change drastically from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro finally came to a decision and announced it to the crew.</span></div></div>",

She was covering her mouth, her face green and ready to releash vomit unless the tossing stopped. Zoro's other hand was on Luffy's ass, and had pushed him even closer into Zoro's body. But all Luffy did was smile and giggle as he snuggled into Zoro. He didn't have any care about what happend to the rest of his crew now that he was big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Release my beautiful, exotic, all-mighty goddess Nami from your hands right now!\" Sanji commanded Zoro. Yet the giant swordsman ignored the cook as he shouted words so bad that they would have caused his grandma to faint in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chopper and Usopp huddled together in fear, awaiting whatever the giant swordsman had to say. Robin watched emotionless as she crossed her arms, but she was in fact greatly worried. Out of concern for Nami and the rest, she spoke \"What are these changes Zoro?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad you asked Robin!\" Zoro told her as looked down at her. \"First off, our journey in finding One Piece isn't over. Isn't that right Luffy?\" Zoro asked his rubber captain. Finally Zoro stopped tossing Nami around his hand, the girl sighed in relief as her face turned from vomit green to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boy was enjoying his snuggle into Zoro's chest when he heard Zoro speak to him. \"Off course! I'm going to be King of the Pirates!\" Luffy said in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And how exactly is a giant suppose to become the King of the Pirates when he doesn't have a ship big enough to fit him!\" Screamed Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Plus you can't swim thanks to the power of the cursed fruit!\" Usopp screamed as well as he pointed at them in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's true.\" Luffy thought for a second. But then his face was filled with joy \"But then Zoro must know how I can become the King and have my own ship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's right Luffy.\" Zoro said as he kissed him for a second. But then he went back to speaking. \"You all must have realized that this island isn't a ordinary island right?\" Everyone on the ground looked at the each other, confused. Even Luffy looked confused by what Zoro was saying. Nami was the only one who didn't look confuse. In fact she realized that Zoro knew the one thing she kept secret when explaining about the cookies and vial. \"Nami! I didin't realize you did not trust us enough the group enough to tell them about this island's secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you know what he's talking about Nami?\" Robin asked her as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes I do.\" She told Robin as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what's the secret!?\" Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper asked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you all know, this island isn't big enough to support a couple of giants for too long.  While it is large when we see it, to Luffy and Zoro it is much smaller. And at their current sizes, the island would only be able to feed the two of them for less than 10 weeks before the island is picked clean.\" Nami explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But great goddess Nami! What does that have to do with this island.\" Sanji asked as he held out his hands to grab her should she jump from Zoro's palm. But she stayed right where she was. Not wanting to anger the giant swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And while Nami had not yet said it, Robin had figured it out all on her own. \"This island is actually a giant ship!\" Robin stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper gasped in joy. \"It's a giant ship! COOOL!\" Both Usopp and Chopper forgot their fear for a few minutes, but went back to huddling together as soon as they remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. It was a small ship designed to act like a island by the person who separated the   big-shrink fruit. The ancient ruins stated that if one were to put the cookies into the core of this ship it causes the island to grow in size.\" Nami told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see. But that doesn't explain anything. We didn't find the fruit on this island. And Luffy ate it while we were on the ship. So how did we just happen to land on the island that is actually a ship built for people who eat the fruit?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah! I mean the chances of that happening is zero to none!\" Chopper stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because it's like the fruit itself. But you can only find this island when someone has already eaten a cookie.\" Zoro told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah! That makes sense. If you only find the fruit when your not looking for it, then finding the island in order to get a giant off your ship must be how you find the island ship.\" Robin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That makes sense I guess?\" Luffy smiled as he thought about it. But the way they had worded it left him in confusion. \"Well it doesn't matter does it?! I'm still going to be king of the Pirates!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's right.\" Zoro hugged Luffy as he kissed him again. \"Now I am going to explain the changes.\" He told the tinies as they looked up at them. \"Now, the cookies are ours and we'll going to use them to make ourselves  bigger. And the island so we can travel across the Grand Line.\" Zoro said as he placed the box inside a secret compartment at the bottom of the handle of his strongest sword. \"And don't even think of trying to break through the handle. It's made of the worlds strongest metal, and at it's current size none of you can even hope of popping it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dang it!\" Sanji said in frustration. 'Now how am I suppose to save my Goddess Nami?!' He thought as he looked at them and then at Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Second change. You are all mine and Luffy's servants. You'll do what we say or else you'll end up like Nami once we start using her.\" Zoro told them. The group shuddered at the thought. And Nami felt a shiver of fear travel down her spine at the thought. Luffy just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The third change is that the Merry Go will never be used again.\" Zoro told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What! Are you going to destroy the ship that was given to us by the woman I love?!\" Shouted Usopp. He couldn't believe Zoro would destroy the precious treasure given to him by the girl he loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" Zoro told him. In seconds Usopp was off, ready to get the ship to sail. Ten minutes passed as Usopp got on the ship, and began to get the ship to sail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He does realize that the ship has been damaged by Luffy when he was on it, so it can't go anywhere right?\" Chopper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"WHY WON'T THIS THING MOVE!?\" Usopp shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'He hasn't realized it' The group thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luffy just laughed for joy. And the remaining normal sized crew returned to listening to Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And what are the rest of the changes?\" Robin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as Zoro was about to speak, Luffy interrupted him......</span></div></div>",

I wanna see the inside of the ship Zoro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but Zora face faulted at Luffy's words. All that dramatic tension totally wasted! Zoro just smiled at his lover and said, \"Sure, why not? They're not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled down at the tinies as he said this, in a somewhat vicious way. The crew got the message. They weren't going to go anywhere. With that decided, Zoro stuck Nami carelessly in his right pant pocket and stood up with Luffy. Luffy eagerly began to make his way back to the center of the island where the temple was. Obviously the way into the hold of the ship would be somewhere over there, right? It was that thought that drove Luffy and Zoro followed, smiling at his excitement. Nami peeked her head out and looked around worriedly. She didn't like leaving the others behind. It would only be a matter of time before Luffy and Zoro desired their own alone time and then she'd be in trouble. But there wasn't much she could do except watch the group grow smaller in the distance until they were gone completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the giants were out of sight, Robin turned to the other crew members and said, \"So what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, what are we going to do?!?!?\" Sanji yelled in anger. \"We're obviously going to save Nami and teach those two giant bastards a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant plan.\" Robin said, rolling her eyes. \"And how do you plan to accomplish this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot skipping a beat, Sanji said, \"Still working on that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed and turned to Chopper. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper quivered in terror and said, \"What can we do? Unless we can somehow trick Zoro and Luffy into drinking some of that liquid, we don't stand a chance against them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUssop took that moment to arrive back on the scene after trying to work the Merry Go. Robin turned to him and said, \"What do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUssop looked worried and said, \"There's really nothing we can do. I think we should just do what they say! I don't want to end up like Nami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji turned on him and punched him in the head, yelling, \"You lousy coward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other crew members argued and tried to discuss various courses of actions, Zoro and Luffy had arrived back in the temple. Luffy looked around and said, \"How are we supposed to get down into the ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro pointed at the altar where the box had originally sat. Luffy looked down at it in annoyance and said, \"Yeah, so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro pushed it down with his foot and it sank into the floor. Instantly, lights raced along the floor, up the walls and into the ceiling. Luffy looked around in amazement as the floor creaked and groaned under their feet. Slowly, it started moving down, into the depths of the island ship. Luffy started bouncing up and down in excitement, eager to explore this new phenomenon. He didn't have to wait long. The elevator began to pick up speed, moving down faster and faster until it came to a sickening halt. Instantly, Luffy jumped off and began looking around. It seemed to be set up as a standard ship except everything seemed to be more metal than wood. It was like being inside a massive engine room, yet there were no comforts spared. The most uncomfortable was obviously where the engine itself was. It looked extremely complicated, with flashing lights and various dials, chugging steam out in various places. Luckily the entire thing seemed to be self sufficient so they wouldn't have to worry about maintaining it. There was also a bedroom complete with a huge four poster bed big enough for two, covered in silk sheets, an adjoining bathroom with a large bath (made for two, of course.), and a porthole that allowed them to see under the ocean. Another room was the library filled with what appeared to be hundreds of books and atlases. Nami poked her head out and immediately caught site of a huge atlas she'd never seen, or even heard of, before. She longed to look through it, to see how whoever built this ship drew a map. The possibility of treasure also rose up in her mind. This room, however, did little to capture Luffy's attention and Zoro didn't really care either. A room that did draw their interest was a fitness room complete with a giant sized weight set. Finally, their was a kitchen stocked with a variety of implements and food they'd never seen before. Luffy grinned and said, \"It's going to be funny watching Sanji try to cook with giant utensils!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro smiled at that thought and drew Luffy in close. Luffy laughed and said, \"Shouldn't we go back to the others first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush?\" Zoro asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy felt Zoro's hardening member pressing against his leg. He was ready for some action. Nami, also feeling the stiffening member, started sweating in fear. Was the time already at hand?</span></div></div>",

She looked up and saw her captain and his swordsman making out. Her heart started beating faster, wondering she was going to be pulled out and when her part would start. Luffy and Zoro broke their embrace only for Zoro to start unbuttoning Luffy's shirt. Luffy pushed his hands away and started doing it himself, letting Zoro remove his own shirt. Zoro tossed the clothing item aside and Luffy did the same, kicking off his sandals and trying to pull off his pants at the same time. Zoro, being more methodical, set his swords down on the table and was unbuckling his pants when he remembered Nami. He pulled her out and Nami was practically trembling in fear as Zoro smiled down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry.\" He said dropping her down next to the swords. \"I want Luffy all to myself for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami stood up, looking indignant. \"So what, I'm not good enough for you?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Zoro either didn't hear her or chose to ignore her. She looked around and saw the swords were arranged around her to keep her in. She could probably make it over the swords if she tried hard enough though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back until she was pressed up against one of the swords before running as fast as she could towards the other sword. Just as she reached the other sword she bent her knees and jumped as hard as she could. She actually managed to see over the other sword before Zoro's pants came flying at her, forcing her back into the ring of the swords and covering her completely. She couldn't see anything around her, the material of Zoro's pants blocking out all light, but she knew the pants covered the area of the swords, making escape impossible. Even if she could get high enough to move over the swords, the material was heavy enough that she wouldn't be able to lift it. As she sat down, prepared to wait this mess out, Zoro tossed aside his boxers, leaving him completely naked before an equally naked Luffy waiting in the silk sheets his expression eager. Zoro smiled and climbed in next to Luffy. He brought Luffy's face closer and started kissing him again. Luffy returned the kiss, following Zoro's lead as Zoro pulled him on top of him. Luffy ran his hands over Zoro's chest, feeling the hardness of his boyfriend's muscles. He broke the kiss and slowly  moved down, kissing Zoro's neck, then his chest, his abs, and then, completely under the covers, he licked straight up Zoro's shaft, ending with a little flick of the tongue. Zoro laid back, eyes closed, and enjoyed the feeling of Luffy, licking, then taking the shaft into his mouth, slowly drawing his breath in, letting his saliva coat the shaft. Zoro moaned at this teasing and Luffy pressed his lips completely around Zoro's dick and started sucking in earnest. This sudden move caused Zoro to gasp and sit up slightly, his arms bracing against the bed. His breathing increased as Luffy continued sucking and sucking, his tongue probing Zoro's slit. Feeling Luffy's hot little tongue pressing into the sensitive urethra as much as it could. With a shuddering intake of breath, Zoro gripped the sheets in his fists and came explosively. Luffy quickly swallowed as much as he could, the rest spilling out around his lips. He licked his lips clean, wiping away what he couldn't reach and crawled back out from under the sheets, grinning at Zoro. Zoro grinned right back and said, \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy quickly sat up, the covers draping around his shoulders and said, \"How do you want to do it this time?\"</span></div></div>",

A result of Ros sending him through Demon King Ruki's gate earlier unprotected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>still</i> going on about that? I thought we already went over how lame it is that you keep wanting me to fix them.\" Ros sighed as he looked at him with boredom. \"It's not like healing them will make you stop being useless. After all, the only thing you're good for is complaining about how absurd everything is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still like them fixed!\" Alba retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could try fixing them with my rib fixing jutsu.\" Janua said as he cracked his knuckles. \"That is if you'll personally take care of Miichan as after I leave for the demon world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I'd probably end up with more broken ribs.\" Alba sighed as he sat down. This was the second time in a few days that he'd been thrown in jail, and now he had to deal with even more crazy people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what might help you!\" The small Rchi replied cheerfully as she opened a gate. Sticking her hand inside it, she pulled out a small bottle with green liquid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Rchi-chan?\" Alba asked as he saw the green substance sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Demon Kings super secret formula for making someone big and strong. It even heals you as you grow.\" Rchimedes happily told him before turning away from the others and whispering \"With a few side effects. Heh heh heh.\" as she made a small evil chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame. If he got big enough I might do zero damage to him when I stab him.

It was a stone tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's that?\" Hugo said questioning Fubar \"I don't know but it appears to be a spell spelled in Griffin It say's 'Power of Size shall be yours that shall be hit by this tablet' I wonder what that means? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fubar checked it when the Tablet shot a beam at Hugo. \"Aaaaah!\" he screamed in fear but he glowed for a second and it stopped \"Huh? that's it? I thought somethin like me blowing up would happen!\" he said angrily grabbing the tablet and breaking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well it appears the sun is going down so we should rest here\" Hugo said friendly to the bird. \"Yeah, well if you break something I'm trying to read, This won't be a time to nap!

Hugo slowly slipped himself into the water and swam calmly towards the village of unsuspecting ducks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it the edge of the village in about thirty seconds with about another thirty to go before his breathe ran out. Some of the ducks caught site of the strange shadow and watched curiously. Hugo timed it carefully and his arm snatched an empty boat just outside of two and held it up high. Ducks began squawking and running every which direction while Sergeant Joe approached the disaster and readied his pole Axe. It was then he stopped. Hugo picked up an isolated house carefully and lifted it up before bringing his head up for a breath of air. He froze at the sight of Sgt. Joe. \"Hugo!?\" He squawked. \"How'd you get so...big!?\" He was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....long story...\" Hugo mumbled lowering his arms and placing the objects back down. \"Come one Sgt. I was just joking around!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hugo, you scared away my entire village! Aren't you a bit old for this kind of stunt?!\" Sgt. Joe scolded.

Warning. Maverick attack. Maverick attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX and Zero looked towards the horizon and saw an army of Mavericks closing in and fast! Zero readied his sword, prepared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to fight in a towel?\" X asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero looked at himself and swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time...\" X said, not worried in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacking Mavericks were being led by someone far away, as a quick scan detected no traces of higher powered Mavericks. Swarms of the little robots approached the base. But they didn't attack. X stared at them until one stepped forward and yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've come for the gun you stole from us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX rolled his eyes and said, \"Like I'm going to just give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he stomped on the offending Maverick. This seemed to trigger the other Mavericks, as they all began to attack. The base's defense systems kicked in and helped X as he made quick work of the attaking Mavericks.</span></div></div>",

But I do want to try out my new strength.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With one swift kick, X had knocked out hundreds of mavericks out and destroyed them with a quick kick that had left a shockwave that was still wiping out enemies. 'I'm faster and stronger! That attack was o nly 1/10 of my stength!' X thought as he looked up the enemy armies. He bent down and blew with his mouth a gust of wind so powerful that mavericks were slamming into the canyons and blowing up. 'This is so easy!' X thought as he brought a hand down and swatted thousands of mavericks into grinded dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Now to test out my most powerful attack!' X thought as he jumped out of the center of the Mavericks. Since the Hunters were still preparing for battle he had nothing to worry. He watched as his X buster charged instantly. \"X BUSTER!\" He roared as a  massive ball of energy engulfed every Maverick. The entire army was completly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There!\" He said as he heard the speakers speaking \"Attention! Attention! Maverick Hunter X has defeated all maverick forces! No longer a need to enter battle!\" And it signed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But this was not happening before Zero had arrived back outside. He was ready for battle as he brought his Z Saber out. \"Where are they!?\" He stated as he heard the announcement. Moaning, he looked up at the Giant X. \"Show off!\" He said only loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I heard that little guy!\" X said as he wrapped a hand gently around his friend. Bringing him up to his face, X smiled. \"Were going to enjoy this new life aren't we!?

Halfway there, Axl said, \"Can you make me a giant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX thought about if for a second. He like being the only giant around and being able to take out entire armies by himself. That effect would be diminished with another giant. But it could also make things a lot easier if the Mavericks sent out even bigger armies.</span></div></div>",

It was an envelope. She slit it open and removed the short letter inside. Her eyes quickly moved over the letter and she raised an eyebrow. Apparently the tools had already arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was certainly fast...\" She said to herself. She shrugged. \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way to the docking bay and found a gigantic box. She sighed and called a group of workers to prepare a crane for her to open the box. It didn't take long to open the box and remove the giant sized instruments. As the other doctors were preparing the instruments for the coming examination, Alia herself went to find X. It didn't take her long to discover he was in the gym with Axl and Zero. She opened the door saying, \"Good news X. The instruments are--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrow at the sight in the gym. X was sitting cross legged next to an equally huge Axl, with a normal sized Zero held tightly in Axl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" She said a little coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX and Axl grinned sheepishly while Zero fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, the instruments have arrived. Now if you'd kindly put Zero down, we can start the examination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to go?\" Axl asked. He was hoping to have some time alone with the little Zero. Much fun was to be had after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to make sure everything is running smoothly in both of your bodies.\" She said. \"There could be an abnormality in one of you that might not show up in the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxl begrudginly put Zero down and followed X and Alia to the docking bay. Once again, the armor was removed, but instead of the nodes being attached, Alia began to take samples from the two. Using a massive syringe she took a \"small\" blood sample. Indicating two equally large jars, she told them to make a urine sample. Everyone left them alone for that one. Blood pressure was taken, heart rate, respiration rate, until the last thing left to take was a semen sample. That too was done in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's enough for now.\" Alia said, scribbling something onto a clipboard. \"I'll have these samples analyzed as soon as possible. In the meantime, NO MORE GIANTS. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants, who had no intention of adding Zero to their ranks yet, nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You can go back to the gym now if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left as Alia supervised the analysis process. It could take awhile.</span></div></div>",

Arrving at her lab, Alia began to experiment with all synthetic and metallic parts of the two giant reploids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Amazing!\" Alia said as she saw millions of nanomachines working to fix any problems the body has. Using a scrapel she cut into synthetic skin sample. Instantly the machines went to work, repairing it until it was back to normal. She tested them all out. Slicing, cutting, infecting with viruses, and more. \"That gun can revolutionize the entire way of life for reploids! Why with it Reploids can even become immune to the Maverick Virus! I wonder why the mavericks would make it to do that though?\" Alia said as she examined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she exmained them even more, Alia noticed the one side affect it causes. \"It seems to inflate peoples egos to the point that they could believe themselves to be gods.

And I thought you were starting to catch up!\" Sonic laughed as the large robot's sluggish movement allowed him to just /WALK/ out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh will you just be quiet!?\" Eggman snapped. Sonic rolled his eyes. \"It's an old one. I'm trying to give it one last chance to avoid being reduced to scrap metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh. A little harsh, isn't it? But hey, either way, I'm losing.\" Sonic laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How are /you/ LOSING!!!!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so SLOW!! I'm getting /REALLY/ bored! I mean, normally, I have to move fast to keep from getting shot, but this thing's so slow I hardly even have to walk!!! I'm not getting my usual end of the fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman gave Sonic an annoyed groan. \"Right now, I'm thinking the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Not very common, is it? Us agreeing on something. But hey, if ya' fixed him up a bit, this would be at least a little more fun.\" Eggman nodded and they both sighed. \"Hey, Eggy, how long do ya' think it's gonna take for it to make a turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out in a minute. Well, if you're bored, you could help me turn it into scrap metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic noticed that something in the back of the machine was starting to open, and a green light could be seen starting to come through. \"Umm\u2026can ya' turn it off? I think it's gonna burst if ya' don't.\" Sonic said nervously, taking a step back. A sudden beam shout out from the back of the machine, hitting Sonic directly in the stomach. \" AH!!!!!!\" Sonic cried, being flung through the air by the mere energy of the beam. Eggman laughed at this. \"Ugh\u2026why do I feel so weird? Almost\u2026 sick?\" Sonic groaned. Eggman laughed a little louder. \"I'm not joking. Quit laughing at me already. I feel like I'm gonna vomit.\" Eggman laughed harder, only to wind being grabbed in a huge, white fist. \"I said quit laughing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman looked up in awe at how much Sonic had just grown after having been shot. \"What in the-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have Tails help me out. Mind if I take that? Of course you don't. Thanks. Bye.\" Sonic said weakly as he grabbed the robot, set Eggman down, and walked away. He began heading to Tails's workshop, which wasn't that far away. </span></div></div>",

However, due to how much bigger he was, he had extreme difficulty not stepping on anyone or anything. A car blared its horns at him as it drove down the road. He immediately moved his foot, only to lose his balance. \"LOOK OUT BELOW!!!!!!!!!\" Sonic cried, trying to delay his fall enough for everyone to move out of his way. He could hear people screaming, and all he could do was hope they were running. He fell on his back, crushing a few buildings that had been behind him. He sat up quickly and looked around. He hadn't hurt anyone, but a few homes had been completely destroyed. \"S-Sorry!!!! I didn't mean to. I'm just trying to get through here and make it to my friend's house!!! So if everybody could just\u2026well\u2026keep outta the way long enough for me to get through here, I'd be really glad!!! Cuz right now you guys are really making this hard for me!!!\" Sonic said loudly, hoping everyone heard him. Fortunately for him, the majority did and moved out of his way, allowing him an easy walk. He still had to avoid cars, but with so fewer people in his way, it was much easier to walk through. Once out of the city, he walked the now much shorter distance to Tails's workshop. \"YO', TAILS, YA' HERE, LIL' BRO?!!!!!!!!!\" Sonic shouted.</span></div></div>",

Tails backed up towards the house. \"Hey, where ya' goin'?\" Sonic asked, his smile fading away. Tails fled back into his house. \"Hey! Come on! I need some help! Don't just leave me all alone!\" Sonic flustered, but Tails didn't come back out. Sonic plopped down and hugged his knees. \"What did I do that was so bad? I only came to ask for some help\u2026\" Sonic mumbled, sighing heavily. \"I'd better go. He's not coming back\u2026\" Sonic stood up and began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails took a deep breath and ran outside. \"SONIC, WAIT A MINUTE!!!!!!!!!\" he screamed. Sonic looked back at Tails, and the look on Sonic's face made him feel awful. Sonic shook his head, looked away, and continued walking. Tails ran after him, then took to the air in hopes of catching up. \"SONIC, COME ON!!!!!!!! I JUST WASN'T READY!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!! SLOW DOWN!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T KEEP UP!!!!!!!!!!!\" Tails screamed as loud as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic turned and looked down at Tails. Tails flew up to him, completely out of breath. \"Hey, Tails, you okay? You don't look too good, buddy.\" Sonic asked. Tails suddenly dropped. \"TAILS!!!!!!!!!\" Sonic yelped, immediately bending down and catching the exhausted fox.

Back at the school Odd and William still couldn't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Jeremy you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Ya, did you find anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \" Einstien are you sure that xana did anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Positive why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Cause me and William looked everywhere and there's nothing out of the ordinary here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Ok come back to the factory and help me try and get a hold of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"On my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd and William started to go back to the factory.  While on the way to the factory something came flinging and hitting Odd in the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Ouch, stupid squrels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled.  He was gonna go and give him a peice of his mind when William came and told him they had to go quick.  Odd explained what happened to William on the way to the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"You can go back and show them a peice of your mind later, right now we have to help Jeremy get a hold of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the factory.

I want to name this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita: \"Xana didn't make a monster, just revive one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"What monster did he revive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"The colossus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"WHAT! How did he manage to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita: \"We already told you, the activated tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Not only that but xana kept the tower activated.  I need you two to go to the the scanner room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd and William headed down to the scanner room.  They went in the scanners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: Scanning Odd, scanning William.  Virtualization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd and William made to lyoko and started heard to the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"William can you here me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Loud and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"I did so stuff to you and now you can deactivate the tower too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Great I bet xana is not gonna see that coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Look there's the tower and no monsters around.  Did xana abandon this tower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Odd I think you spoke to soon. The colossus is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs William points to behind the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"What are we gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"I got that covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: I made a program that can make you the size of the colossus.  I'll make both of you the size of it then shrink you back after you bear that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: What are you waiting for? Make us big already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd and William grew to the size of the colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Alright that colossus better watch its back because here comes giant Odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"And giant William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Ok and William.  Now lets go kick his butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant Odd and Giant William made there way to the tower.<br>\r\nWhen they got there the colossus was guarding it but in only took a couple seconds for William and Odd to take it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Guess it can't take on someone it's on size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Jeremy shrink us back to normal so we can deactivate the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K it might take a couple seconds.  I'll do You first William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"Even though I like being this size I don't think I could fit obit the school or factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"You should start to shrink right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said those words William shrank back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K Odd now you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Do you have to? I like being this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Yes Odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: sigh \"fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K just a sec, you should start shrinking back to your normal size now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"I'm still a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Hold on, I'm seeing something off about your scan Odd. Did anything weird happen to you while you were coming here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Ya a squirrel threw an acorn at me, could that be it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K I'll try and find out why your big bit until then your gonna have to stay in lyoko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Couldn't we just do a return to the pass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"I guess.  William go deactivate the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"On it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam went to deactivate the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Return to the pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7:00am<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Odd you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich went to go and check Odds bed. When he did Odd wasn't there.  Ulrich went to go tell Yumi, Jeremy,Aelita and William. He told them to meat at the factory.  When he got there William wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Has anyone seen Odd and William?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"I think I know where Odd is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Where\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"On lyoko. For some reason the return to the pass didn't shrink him back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi: \"I think I know why it didn't shrink Odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi: \"Because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got interrupted but I tiny William on the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi: \"That's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"You better fix me soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita: \"Don't worry. Me and Jeremy will think of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Can anyone here me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Loud and clear Odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Hey Einstein can you send me to the real world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"I think there would be less of a panic if you stayed on lyoko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Well can someone com over hear I think xana activated a tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"What why didn't the computer pick that up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Probably because he intercepted it with the guardian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"I'll go. With Odd being a giant it won't be that much trouble to deactivate the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K go to the scanner room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich makes his way down to the scanner room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Scanning Ulrich. Virtualization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Jeremy what sector is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"The desert section why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen: \"Why am I on a purple mountain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Ulrich your on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd grabs Ulrich and goes to the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"there are two crabs there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"Don't worry Einstein I got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd goes and stomps on them like it was nothing.  After that the guardian was so afraid it left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"How come he gets to be a giant and I'm the mouse sized one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi: \"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam: \"No need to snap it was just a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Jeremy I deactivate the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K hold on I'll bring you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd: \"No don't I need someone here or else I'll be board out of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Jeremy just bring him back too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"But he might destroy the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich: \"Might not you never know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"K I will...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the first time in his life, he was on a proper outing, and to the zoo even! True, Dudley didn't want him there, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't buy him very much for lunch (they wouldn't have bought him anything if not for the funny looks they'd get otherwise). And he supposed he looked silly in the small circus tent of a shirt he'd inherited from his large cousin, with his trousers cinched up underneath nearly at his chest. Even so, he was at the zoo, and nobody would ruin it for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry briefly considered heading toward the reptile house next, as like most ten (almost eleven!) year old boys, he thought snakes and lizards were almost the most brilliant animals ever. But he already saw Dudley waddling off in that direction with his ratty friend Piers slinking behind him, so he decided to give it a miss for now, and headed over toward a red, eastern-style bridge he'd heard Uncle Vernon muttering something unpleasant about earlier. To his mind, this just meant the Dursleys were likely to leave it - and him - alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the red painted bridge, he stood on tiptoes to try and peer over the side. Sadly, he was still too small to see much over the edge. Nearby, it sounded as though a nice sounding lady working for the zoo was talking about whatever was in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Below,\" the lady said, \"are something called Koi fish. Koi fish are very special, and one of the most fascinating things about them is that they keep growing until they can't get enough food in their environment. So, a Koi in a small bowl that's not given much to eat is a very tiny fish, but one let into a large lake will grow to dozens, maybe a hundred times that size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther kids on the bridge made noises of awe at this, and Harry decided to scramble up onto the railing of the bridge so that he could see. He wanted to see a big fish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a minute after he'd clambered up, leaning further out than he probably should have, he felt a hard shove at his back. With a frightened shout, Harry toppled off the bridge and into the fishy water. Sputtering and making faces at the taste in his mouth, Harry scowled up at the bridge where he saw Dudley and Piers laughing and pointing down at them. The nice zoo lady was looking down as well, and after seeing he was alright grabbed his cousin and Piers by the arms and marched them away, asking about their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the muddy water, Harry glanced down at his hands to make sure he got up safely, and finally got a look at a Koi fish. It was a tiny little thing, barely as long as his pinky (and his hand was really quite small itself). He could see further away a bunch of big shapes in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just alike, you and me,\" he muttered at the tiny fish. \"I bet those big fish over there hog all the food and pick on you all the time right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish, being a fish, didn't answer. Harry nodded anyway, and stuck his pinky out at the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'll show them one day, right? It's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInexplicably, the tiny fish swam forward and rubbed his pinky, like it was agreeing with the plan. Harry grinned a bit, and slopped his way over out of the muck. He couldn't explain it, but when the fish touched him, he'd felt a tingle seem to zip through his entire body. Almost the same thing that he'd felt when he somehow traveled to the roof of his school, or turned his teacher's hair blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dursleys were, after the zoo lady found him again, asked to leave because of the disruption. Dudley blamed Harry entirely, of course, and the Dursleys sided with him as usual. While Dudley was comforted with new toys and more sweets, Harry spent a sad few weeks mostly locked up in his tiny cupboard with little food, for \"ruining Diddy's outing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed to himself in the tiny room, thinking of what the zoo lady said, and picturing a tiny black Koi fish with a lightning scar in a tiny, tiny bowl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confused, but pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't buy the Dursleys' excuse of him \"getting a bit big\" for his cupboard for one second. Something in that letter had spooked them. Still, even if he really wanted to know what the letter said, at least it had gotten him out of that tiny prison he'd been calling his room. For some reason, ever since the zoo visit, he'd been more bothered by being forced into such a tight space all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked around at his new room, slowly getting used to having a lot of open space around him. He frowned as he looked at the clutter of old and broken toys and clothing scattered on the floor. Setting his face in determination, he took his already-rolled-up sleeves and gave them a few more rolls for good measure to clear his elbows and set to work.  Completely broken things were piled in a corner by the small trash basket he'd been allowed. Less broken things he eyed speculatively. Dudley would likely whine about him keeping any of it, even if Dudley himself had thrown them in here and forgotten about them. In the end, Harry kept things he thought would be useful, but weren't very colorful or shiny, thinking Dudley might not care much about them. The rest was piled up near the door for Dudley to inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Harry was left with an old bed that creaked a bit (but was at least longer than his cupboard's floor cot), a dresser with the finish peeling up and sticking drawers, a writing desk with a broken leg (he'd splinted it to a lone croquet mallet), a desk chair with no backrest, and a slightly bent floor lamp. Among some of the piles near the closet he'd found a few more sets of Dudley's old clothes that were, of course, too big on him, but looked much newer as Dudley apparently didn't like the way they looked and had chucked them unworn into this room, as well as a set of jogging trainers about 3 sizes too big. Harry kept these anyway; they weren't worse than he had, and they looked nicer. Maybe he'd eventually grow into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with happy accomplishment, Harry fell back onto his new (sort of) mattress.  <i>{Creak/i}.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good; he had a room with real furniture, and it was all his!  And with the clutter taken care of it felt like even more space opened up around him. Harry grinned, spreading out his arms until his fingers could barely curl around the sides of his bigger mattress, and flexed his feet which were at least a foot from the end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, wide open spaces. And all his!<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry awoke to a tapping sound.  Not quite conscious, he began his usual routine of rolling off of the floor mat in his cupboard to get the door only to tumble over the end of his new bed with a startled yelp.  Wincing at the sting in his elbows and knees, Harry quickly scrambled up and moved to face the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that he realized two things. First, that it was still very dark. And second, that the tapping was coming from his bedroom window. Harry quietly padded over to the glass pane, and stared dubiously at the fluffed-up owl perching just outside. It glared back with what he'd swear was an impatient look, and stuck out a skinny little bird leg that...seemed to have an envelope tied to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry considered his options for a moment, including going back to bed, as it was far too early in the morning for something like this to be happening. He almost immediately decided that this was the coolest thing that had ever happened to him and that he didn't really care if the owl outside was <i>supposed</i> to come to his room or not.  He quickly slid up the lower pane and watched with a grin as the owl struggled to fit through the tiny opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a bit as the owl squeezed down, but couldn't fit through as every time it lost balance it flared its big wings and became too wide for the opening. The owl glared again, and shuffled as if about to leave. Biting his lip, Harry did the bravest thing he'd done so far this morning and thrust his arm out the window. The bird made no move to peck him, and allowed him to remove the letter without difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying over to his desk, Harry flicked on the lamp and started in surprise at seeing the same green ink, the same odd paper as the envelope he'd gotten in the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter<br>\r\nThe Littlest Bedroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry huffed a bit at the address; the room seemed plenty big to him, after all! But he put that thought aside quickly as he continued to read the letter with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...a wizard?\" He asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that even mean? Was it some sort of joke? He didn't think the Dursleys would go to the trouble of getting a trained bird to play a trick on him, and they'd treated the last letter pretty seriously.  Harry was very confused.  Thinking fast, he scribbled a quick response with far too many questions on the back of the letter and thrust it back out at the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a brief stare-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird took the letter and flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry went back to bed.  It really was far too early for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Harry woke for the second time, and continued where he'd left off tidying his room.  The Dursleys had been very clear; he was to have the room, but stay out of their way as much as possible, preferably <i>inside</i> the room where they wouldn't have to hear or look at him. And he was on reduced meals for the trouble with the letter. His stomach gave an unhappy grumble at the thought. He couldn't really be sure if he hadn't dreamed what happened before with the owl and the second letter. It seemed like a very nice dream, if a bit strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question of whether or not it was a dream was answered near lunchtime (he hoped) by a smart knocking on his door.  Harry quickly hid the construction blocks he'd kept of Dudley's under the bed for safe keeping and scampered over to the door. Opening it, he looked up into the face of a strangely dressed older woman. She ran her eyes up and down him a moment, went back up to his face again, and the she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Potter, my name is Professor Minerva Mcgonagall. I'm hear about Hogwarts, and your letter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blinked, before he started and tried to tug the woman into his room. He wasn't strong enough, but she started walking right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...it's real, then?\" he asked. \"Hogwarts, and magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer, the older woman pulled out a stick and waved it at his desk. The mallet he'd used as a splint popped off and the desk leg mended itself.  A second wave had the mallet turn into a backrest for the desk chair, and a third was directed right at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wriggled a bit as his extremely over-sized clothes shrank on him, sliding over his arms and legs until they fit his body. It was a strange feeling. Almost tight after what he was used to; he wasn't sure how he felt about that. But the older woman...the witch had fixed his things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have taken today to explain your heritage to you,\" Professor Mcgonagall stated briskly, as she seated herself on the edge of Harry's bed. <i>creak</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth wave of the wand, Harry guessed, fixed the creaking in his mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your relatives were meant to explain things to you themselves; we've...spoken\" her tone grew a bit chilly, \"about it this morning. You will be allowed to attend Hogwarts and learn magic. However, they have insisted that you keep all school things and activities in your room, and your cousin is not to be told about magic at all. They don't want him to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded, still mostly wrapping his head around the '<i>magic is real</i>' bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a list of school things,\" Harry mentioned hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to go, then?\" The professor asked, her lips quirking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Harry shouted.  \"Er, I mean yes please ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" McGonagall stated, holding out her arm. \"Take my arm then, and we will travel by magic to get your things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Harry taken her arm then he felt like he was being squeezed through a tiny tube. He found he absolutely <i>hated</i> the feeling.  The world went dark and when light returned he and the professor appeared inside a red stone square in a wide open building with a pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall explained that they were in Gringotts, and that between his father's family inheritance and the \"Ministry\" paying full value for his family home after it was destroyed to be used as a monument, he had enough money to not need to worry about it if he was sensible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explanation led to more questions, and by the time they were properly shopping the older woman had told Harry about his parents, the night of their death, and all sorts of other things that he thought to ask about. She guided him through the shops, letting him buy the odd extra item but mostly telling him with a frown 'not to be too silly with his money' when he started toward the next shiny, noisy, or extremely expensive object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn oddly loud rumble from his stomach saw the two of them seated in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry shocked himself by polishing off a full adult meal with dessert and an extra side.  McGonagall only said he looked too skinny anyway, and after he'd sheepishly admitted the Dursleys weren't providing much in food she'd quickly taken him back to the alley to pick up a magical cold box for his bedroom and stocked it with healthy meals. She'd even let him buy an irresponsible (her words) amount of Florean's Ice Cream for snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's one request at the end of the day was to not \"apparate\" home; he'd rather never feel squeezed like that ever again. He thought the Knight bus was even more fun to ride than the goblin carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis school shopping done at last, a much happier Harry was returned to his room and given all of his school things with a stern warning from McGonagall to study ahead a bit in his subjects to make a good start at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, Harry cheerfully chucked his school books in a pile for later and had an ice cream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry sighed as he felt his stomach grumble; obviously he'd spoiled it somehow, and turned it into a demanding creature. Stretching a bit, he set down his quill and flexed his hand out, shaking the cramps out of his fingers. Why Hogwarts demanded an outdated writing tool that required so much fine control in the fingers was beyond him.  With a sigh, he rose from his chair and ambled over to his cold box for a morning snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think he'd turned full Dudley, but he was beginning to think his cousin didn't just get his appetite from Uncle Vernon. Ever since getting back from Diagon Alley, Harry had made a promise to eat when he was hungry, and to eat until he was full; a big change from how the Dursleys had treated him, and one his stomach had really seemed to appreciate. On the other hand, he found it a bit odd that his stomach, long used to going to bed without supper and breakfasts of single slices of toast and marmite, would turn around and demand a full english breakfast every morning. And a mid-morning meal. And a big lunch. And a meal at tea time. And an afternoon meal, and dinner, and a midnight snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, second breakfast was obviously in order, so Harry cracked the coldbox...and saw the back wall.  He blinked, looked again, and slowly closed the box.  Opening it again, he saw that he really was on the last of the food; the only thing left in there was a chocolate cake sent from Hogwarts for his birthday last week. The cake was large enough to have needed most of the second shelf for storage, which Harry supposed should have been a clue at the time that he was emptying the cold box alarmingly fast. Harry had been saving it for sentimental reasons; he was sure it would taste wonderful, but he really enjoyed looking at his first real birthday present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry lugged the heavy plate to his desk and pondered the problem as he idly dipped a fork into the gift. His eyes briefly lit up at the taste - it <i>was</i> delicious - before he focused on the problems at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem one: where was he putting all of this food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a brief, horrifying image of his head on Dudley's body, Harry dropped the fork (a large section of the cake was missing) and rushed to the first floor bathroom. Shutting the lock with a firm turn, he shrugged off his shirt and checked his reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was he was <i>not</i> fat.  Banishing his Dudley-shaped nightmare from his mind, Harry spent some time critically studying his reflection.  His ribs were no longer visible, as they used to be, and his stomach looked to be level with his chest, instead of slightly caved in.  He gave his side a poke, giggled at the sensation, and then relaxed as he didn't see any ominous jiggling.  Definitely not fat, then. But not skinny either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry beamed as he tossed his shirt back on and went back to his desk. Problem two, then: he'd need more food.  Harry may have been shocked at himself with how much he was eating, but if he wasn't turning into the family's third blob monster, he <i>really</i> wanted to keep up with the regular meals.  It would be best, he decided, to go back to Diagon Alley and get groceries there. He was familiar with the area, he knew where to go to get what he needed, he had wizard money to buy things with...and he wanted ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded as he resolutely set down the fork, deciding to save the rest of the cake for...the cake was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked from the cake plate, which had to be almost a foot around, to the crumbs (barely any) left of the cake, and down at his still-flat stomach, which felt almost like it was <i>purring</i>.  Well, that settled that. He definitely needed more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he'd like to look nice for his trip, Harry grabbed the fitted shirt and trousers the professor had magicced for him, and slipped it the top over his head.  And tugged.  Frowned.  Tugged again. The neck hole popped over his head, scraping his ears, and gripped his neck tightly. Wriggling, he managed to get one arm through an arm hole, but that pulled the whole thing to that side and he couldn't get his hand out through the other.  Glancing down, frustrated, he saw that there was a solid inch or two of bare skin showing under the hem.  Huffing, he yanked the shirt off (It did not want to go over his head this way, either) and turned to the trousers.  A minute of stumbling, hopping, and cursing later, Harry gave this up as a bad job. The button was <i>not</i> going to reach, and his ankles showed.  It was like the clothes had shrunk in the wash, or maybe the magic was still working on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head and grabbed some of his school robes. They were fitted, too, and he <i>was</i> going to a wizard area, so they'd be fine.  For a moment, he found himself struggling with those as well, but after a second the clothing seemed to relax on his frame, and hung down just as perfectly as when he'd bought them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. Obviously the thought he'd started having about why his other clothes were too small was silly. If the robes still fit, then the professor must have made a mistake and left the shrinking on. Good thing it was happening slowly then, it would have been really embarrassing to have burst out of his clothes in the middle of his shopping trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning a bit at the image, funny since it hadn't really happened, Harry made quick work of sneaking out of the house, finding a secluded location and hopping the bus to the Leaky Cauldron.  Tom gave him a nod, but didn't seem to be paying enough attention to recognize him in particular, and the crowds were heavy enough that he'd blend in fine.  He did spot a number of other kids around his own age, looking to buy first wands and loudly chattering about going to Hogwarts. It looked like he wouldn't be the only short person in his class; most of the kids he spotted were around his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry decided to take care of his necessary shopping first, as he pictured Professor Mcgonagal's stern expression and remembering her warnings about money.  Carefully jostling his way through the crowds, he did his best to ignore any tempting signs, passing Magorium's Magical Instruments (Musical and Technical! All that whizzes, zips, and tweets!) and Madam Malkin's (Finest robes for Hogwarts! Enchanted to let out their own seams!) and <i>very</i> carefully not looking at the ice cream parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him long at all to pick up enough food to refill the cold box, and as the previous trip got him halfway through the holiday, it should be enough to get him to Hogwarts this time.  The grocer even spelled it to stay cold all day, and to fit into one bag.  With a whole day ahead of him, Harry decided to do the proper thing and have fun out in the alley, instead of cooping himself up in his room all day. Grinning, he slid into a booth at Florian's and ordered a triple banana split.  His stomach grumbled.  He ordered two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After polishing off two triple sundaes....Harry felt a bit sick. Maybe Mr Fortescue had been right to give him a dubious look and cheerful warning when he'd taken Harry's order. Well, Harry thought to himself as he slowly swayed out of the ice cream parlor, too late now.  He hiccuped a bit as he thought over how to spend his day. Obviously he was staying the magic alley full of wonder; why in the world would he willingly go back to Privet Drive right away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGringotts was right out. What looked like a small army of goblins was camped outside the doors, and there was an absolutely ridiculous queue of irritated-looking witches and wizards snaking through the camp, being checked over and over before even getting to the doors.  The owner of Magorium's Instruments told him there'd been a robbery some time back, and the whole bank was on lock down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...no shopping spree, then.  Harry still had a bit of pocket money, but he'd already spent a good bit on more food, and he supposed this was just a sign that he should listen to Professor Mcgonagall, and that a giant shopping binge wouldn't end well. He looked a bit forlornly at the Magical Menagerie...he thought it might be cool to get a pet, maybe a magical fish or something. Then again, he was on thin ice with the Dursleys anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWindow shopping was the order of the day. Talking with several of the shop owners, Harry discovered that, for the most part, the wizarding world had an 'artisan economy', which meant that most of the goods were hand-made by a witch or wizard that had worked out special, unique spells or properties for their products, and a lot of the goods out there were custom made for the customer. Harry thought it sounded really cool; maybe he could open a shop when he got out of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw some really cool, unique items for sale; odds and ends that had been made to test new spell, or had been made on order but then never purchased. He saw a saxophone that animated brooms to sweep up while it was played, a compass that he was promised pointed to his greatest desire, three different talking mirrors, a pair of shoes that let you walk on walls, and a thousand other wonderful things.  Harry thought, just maybe, he'd come back next summer and ignore the professor's advice...just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was recognized, twice. Once was by the owner of a magical nick-knack shop. Hearing he lived with muggle relatives - who he didn't particularly like - the man had given him, at no charge, a doorknob with a minor muggle-repelling ward on it. He told Harry that if he replaced his bedroom knob with the new one, any time his relatives wanted to bother him, they wouldn't make it past the door.  The second time was by a fellow shopper; an older woman in Flourish and Blotts glimpsed his scar as he was skimming a book on jinxes; she'd just given him a pat on the head, called him \"dear\" and continued shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice dinner at The Leaky Cauldron, Harry caught the Knight Bus back home. He'd made it past the park when his day took a bit of a down-turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at that, it's Potter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stalled, looking into the park warily.  Dudley and several of his regular 'friends' were lounging on some of the older equipment. It looked like one of them had been drawing dirty pictures on the slide with a marker.  One of them had definitely spotted him, though, and he had their full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he wearing a <i>dress</i>?\" Pier's hooted with laughter, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned red, embarrassed. He couldn't believe he'd forgotten that he was wearing robes! The whole group was laughing, now.  What was he even supposed to say? Did this count as revealing magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...it's my school uniform.\" Harry answered, trying for a slightly haughty tone. Steeling his nerves, Harry started a casual march toward Privet Drive. The worst they'd done was laugh; he could put up with that, and he'd be out of here in less than a month anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dudley,\" Piers turned towards Harry's cousin, eyeing Harry out of the corner of his eye and frowning. \"Didn't you say Potter was getting shipped off to some private school in Scotland next month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDudley grunted a bit, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, some old bat came by last month and said he was going; his parents set it up when he was a baby or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to keep an eye on the group.  He wasn't too far from the house now; while Vernon and Petunia would definitely take Dudley's word over his about any fighting, they'd never let him do anything serious right under their noses. Vernon had <i>opinions</i> about hooligans, even if he didn't notice his kid was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet,\" Piers cooed mockingly. He paused, as if he'd had an idea. \"Of course, that means we don't have much time to pay him back for ruining that zoo trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Dudley drawled, as he started walking toward Harry. The others followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said again as he started walking faster. \"And he got us kicked out before we could see the lizards. And he scared off the fish...I heard the zoo got a <i>really big</i> one about then, too. It was on the telly; they've got, like, a six foot long koi fish in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your own fault we got kicked out!\" Harry shot back, hopping backwards and turning to take off faster. Unfortunately, he still wasn't used to moving in robes and he tripped mid-turn and landed hard with a loud \"OOF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Potter?\" Piers sneered as Harry found himself surrounded. \"Hard to run away in a dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry hastily scrambled to his feet, looking around nervously. He frowned. Something seemed...off.  Dudley's crew were still looming menacingly around him, but they seemed...less loomy.  He blinked a bit in surprise when he noticed that Piers, who'd always been the smallest and rattiest of the group, wasn't any bigger than him.  His thoughts from that morning came back to him; maybe he <i>had</i> grown a bit this summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, he was completely boxed in, and Harry accepted that even if he had gained an inch or two, that didn't mean much compared to most of this group's hulking forms, or to being outnumbered, or having to fight in an unfamiliar dress...robe! It was a robe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, and deciding that if he never had to see any of these punks again, he'd rather leave making a statement. He'd treasure the shocked look in Piers' eyes as he decked him in his pointy nose forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Harry was in his room, an ice pack on his face, grounded for the rest of the summer, and missing a baby tooth.  Weirdly, he felt content. Sure, he was in a lot of pain, and covered in bruises, but he'd made those punks bleed too for once. He had a cold box full of food to last until Hogwarts, a magic Dursley-repelling doorknob, and he was less than a month away from leaving Privet Drive and going to learn magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only regret was that he kind of wanted to go visit the zoo again, now. He wanted to see that new fish.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Locked up in his room, the days leading up to his Hogwarts trip blurred together, and so between sleeping, eating and studying, Harry marked the weeks by personal firsts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour weeks out from the big day, he managed to light his wand for the first time. <i>Lumos</i> wasn't too difficult, once you figured out the trick, but Harry hoped he could learn magic faster with a proper teacher.  Harry also took a pair of Dudley's old trousers and cut the leg hems to fit just right.  After, he placed them in front of his closet door next to the magically sized pair for comparison. The roughly cut pair was definitely a bit longer. He planned to check the magic pants for any shrinking later. Deciding to test the other half of his theory, he also stood against the closet door and made a careful line over his head in pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks out, Harry took a break and unscrewed the magic doorknob from his door and walked around the house holding it in front of him.  He spent a wonderful afternoon watching his Aunt Petunia purse her lips and stalk toward him, only to go glassy-eyed and sort of wander off in a daze every time she got close.  She probably wanted to know why he'd do something as ridiculous as wander around holding a doorknob.  Toward evening, he parked himself on Dudley's bed and nibbled his way through his cousin's entire stash of candy bars, offering a chocolaty smile whenever one of the Dursleys charged in to remove him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks out Harry paused while working on his quill writing as he felt his toes tap the floor under his desk chair.  Leaning over out of curiosity, he bent his knee and slowly dragged his big toe along the grain of the floor boards; something he'd never been able to do while sitting in that chair before. Humming thoughtfully, he slowly stood up out of his chair - very deliberately <i>not</i> hopping, as he suddenly didn't have to - and made his way over to the closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic trousers didn't look any smaller compared to the larger pair, but when Harry slipped the bigger ones on he could <i>clearly</i> see some ankle. (The waist was still too big, of course. Dudley was a wide, wide boy.) The smaller fitted (used to be fitted) pair wouldn't close at the waist, and Harry could wrap his hand around the skin they showed above his feet.  He was shocked at the difference, but he'd been somewhat prepared for it when he saw the pencil mark on the closet door floating slightly below his eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his last week, Harry did three things. First, he tried on his Hogwarts clothes again. Now that he was paying attention, he was able to see the clothes lengthening on him. However, unlike last time they stopped an inch or so too soon...in pretty much every direction.  The bottom of the robe was too far off the ground, the sleeves were too short, and the whole outfit <i>pinched</i> a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing Harry did naturally followed; he went out and bought new clothes. He threw on the nicest of Dudley's old things, which were now barely long on him even if they were too wide, and jammed his feet into the pair of his cousin's shoes that he'd saved. Harry was glad he'd decided to do that, even if when he'd planned to grow into them he'd pictured more of a 'few years' kind of thing instead of a few weeks. The nice shoes he'd bought for Hogwarts wouldn't slip on at all; he even had to go barefoot as he'd apparently outgrown child-size socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately he was now a regular pro with the Knight Bus. Madam Malkin was very apologetic, and convinced she must have sold him badly hemmed robes. He got a new set at a discount, and she even threw in an extra few inches of growing room \"just in case\" (she'd pinched his cheeks at that point...Harry had mixed feelings). He stopped at Gringotts (they were open again, though security was still higher than he remembered) and he stocked some more food. Apparently the amount of food that lasted him four weeks the first time only made it for three the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Harry did was - of course - go to King's Cross and get on the Hogwarts Express. Harry had been too excited to wait at Privet Drive and had taken off just after dawn. The Knight Bus staff were happy to explain the barrier to him when he admitted he didn't know where he'd find a \"Platform 9 3/4\" anywhere, so he'd spent exactly twenty seconds on the muggle side of the station. He'd just finished claiming a compartment as his personal territory when someone knocked on his door. Before he could even think about getting up the door swung open and a large ball of frizzy hair attached to a girl swept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello, is there room in this compartment?\" The hair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Harry looked around at nobody and wondered if that was a real question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" she continued without yet stopping for air, \"I only wanted to know if I was allowed; are the first years all supposed to sit somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a first year.\" Harry offered, bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, the girl stopped to breathe (this oddly made Harry feel a bit less like <i>he</i> was suffocating) and looked him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I'd thought...well you're rather tall then aren't you? Simple mistake. I suppose I'll just sit in here then, and if we're both in the wrong place we'll find out together. I'm Hermione Granger by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl...Hermione...kept talking, she dragged a large rolling suitcase in behind her and slid it into the space under the seat opposite from Harry. Sitting at the end of her seat, she thrust out her hand with an expectant look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Harry a few seconds to realize she wanted to shake hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour, the two gradually made a bit of conversation, with Hermione doing most of the talking. Harry found he didn't mind too much; spending nearly two months more or less by himself had made him a bit quieter, and having someone to listen to was a nice change. Fortunately before he got tired of listening (he wasn't sure if he could make her stop talking) a round-faced boy named Neville joined the group and drew her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther students came and went, a small army of redheads swarmed the train at the last minute, and Hermione and Neville swept out the the compartment in a flurry of frizzy hair to find his pet toad. Some blond ponce knocked on his door and asked about Harry Potter; Harry just shrugged and pointed him toward the back of the train.  An hour in, Hermione and Neville came back with Trevor in hand to see Harry calmly eating his second breakfast, which he had packed just for the trip.  Both of them were a bit bemused when Harry immediately bought a small candy mountain when the trolly came by and passed some out to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shrugged a bit as he bit into a chocolate frog. He could make room for dessert if he could share it with (he hoped) friends. Besides, apparently he was a growing boy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry's first reaction to seeing \"Mr Hagrid,\" the <i>extremely</i> large man in charge of the introductory boat ride, was a bit of alarm. Surely not <i>all</i> wizards got so big; he'd seen a lot of wizards over the last month and most seemed pretty normally-sized.  Maybe it was just Mr Hagrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was him, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry craned his neck about as the boats floated themselves toward a hidden castle gate. As Hermione and Neville were both smaller than him; it wasn't hard - between staring wide-eyed at the <i>amazing magical castle</i> - to pick up a new frame of reference. He saw a couple other kids his size; a red-headed boy with freckles was probably taller, though he looked a bit stringy, and two boys following that blond ponce from the train were absolutely <i>massive</i>. Most of the other children, however, seemed to reach somewhere between his chin and his nose. Surrounded by people his own age, Harry came to the conclusion that he was, indeed, tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he disembarked with his future classmates, Harry mused a bit about what this might mean for his future. He wasn't sure if he wanted to end up Hagrid-size; that seemed like it might be inconvenient, though on the other hand Harry doubted anyone went up to the man looking for trouble.  As McGonagall steered the group into a waiting area (she gave him a bit of a double-take) he decided he'd just have to ask somebody if he kept growing. Maybe if he caught himself looking eye-to-eye with the red-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very impressed with the magic singing hat. (The song, not so much, but the <i>hat</i> was bril.)  He was double-impressed when it had the good sense to send both of his new friends into the same House, making his own sorting much more convenient for everyone.  He'd barely had a chance to see if Neville was able to save him an extra seat near him and Hermione when McGonagall called his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly decided that most wizards did not know how to whisper properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The</i> Harry Potter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's a tall one, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peas and carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and slightly hungry over the last one, which came from his future table (he was very confident about this), Harry barely registered when the professor asked him to see her after the feast.  Then there was a hat on his head.  Unlike several of the others before him, it seemed to fit his head a bit better than average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" muttered a voice in his ear. \"Yes, it is important to have a properly-sized head. Most of you lot are all ears; barely anything to hold onto. You want to be with your new friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\" Harry offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather loyal of you, that's a strong Hufflepuff trait, and you seem to take promises seriously too, I've hardly ever seen such dedicated magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what?\" Harry asked, confused. He didn't really understand any of that.  \"Look, if I want to be with my friends, don't use that to separate us! That's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat snorted a bit.  \"Well, that was definitely brash. And quite a bit of righteous anger, too; don't like people stepping on others' toes, bossing them around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't right.\" Harry offered, firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, please continue fighting for justice, honor, and so on. Just make sure to mind where <i>you</i> step in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRIFFINDOR\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the sorting passed in a bit of a blur for Harry, as he made space between his two cheering friends. The feast passed in a blur of a different kind. One with apparently endless food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked up from his plate, offering a shy smile when he locked gazes with twin red-heads on the opposite side of the table. The two seemed to be glancing between him and the red-head kid his own age who was a few seats down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one you think will stop first?\"  Left twin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Potter's up five plates to four, and even giant eleven-year-olds only have so much room in there.\" Right twin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true.\" Left twin rubbed his chin. \"On the other hand, Ron usually only has four plates at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ron - Harry assumed this was young red-head's name - glanced up at the twins suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey offered him giant identical grins, that only got wider as his face paled and he went back to his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sickle on Potter.\" Left twin offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione scoffed as she pushed her dessert around on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really,\" she muttered, \"hardly setting a good example, gambling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Harry a curious look, though.  One that, now Harry was paying attention, he saw Neville shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you <i>always</i> eat this much?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shrugged, quickly washing down the last food that was on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately, yes.\" He offered, eyes locking on a nearby platter with treacle tart.  Target acquired.  Hesitating, he checked his friends' expressions before he reached out for a scoop. He kept an eye on them as he slowly added two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of his friends seemed offended, just a bit surprised. The twins just changed some money around; so that probably meant Ron had stopped eating.  Harry hummed contentedly as he polished off the treat; he hadn't had a chance to eat many good deserts besides ice-cream, which he may have over-purchased in the last month.  Harry was just glad that he'd long-since mastered the art of fast, but polite eating. There hadn't really been any other way to avoid both a scolding from Aunt Petunia and Dudley stealing his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Dumbledore offered a list of school announcements as Harry finished dessert; the comment about painful death waiting in the school caused him to choke briefly, and he'd had to sip water for a few minutes afterward. It was only after he and the other students rose to head off to their new common room that Harry felt and hand on his shoulder and looked to the side to find Professor McGonagall looking back at him with an expectant expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Potter, if you would come with me please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a request, so Harry shortly found himself back in the pre-sorting waiting room, sitting on the sorting stool, with his new head of house looking him up and down.  He couldn't help fidgeting a bit under her gaze, and he blushed a bit as his stomach audibly purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First Mr Potter,\" the stern woman offered him a tight smile, \"you are not in trouble.  However, as you are - I'm sure you've noticed - <i>considerably</i> larger than you were several weeks ago, I will need to perform a quick check-up to rule out a few causes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er,\" Harry shifted a bit on the stool. \"I did notice; and I don't really know <i>why</i> it's happened...are you the school nurse as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" McGonagall offered simply as she pulled out her wand.  \"I'm not confident that we need to involve her just yet, and the sorts of things for which I am checking you are under my particular field of expertise.  You're hardly the first student I've seen who's body decided to impersonate a dragon hatchling before school opened. Usually, it just means that student has a strong aptitude for Transfiguration.  You'll find most of the more talented in the field have very distinct or idealized features; sometimes being introduced to magic can trigger an episode like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry mulled that over a bit; he knew in theory what Transfiguration was, he'd spent most of his time skimming his school books after all.  A thought occurred to him as he remembered the last time he'd seen this witch do magic, and he hunched back on the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to shrink me?\" He asked, voice slightly higher pitched, as he eyed her wand warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGonagall smiled, and laughed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most definitely probably not.  That's the first test.\" Without any further warning, the professor muttered a long string of odd words and tapped Harry rather hard on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" McGonagall offered, \"you're not a Metamorphmagus, or you likely <i>would</i> have shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just nodded frantically, even though he had no idea at all what a Metamagus was.  He winced as a second tap followed; he wondered if that would start to leave a mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, Harry looked down to see his whole body glowing slightly. The professor didn't seem particularly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she offered briskly as she helped Harry to his feet. \"You've transfigured yourself; it's an unconscious, permanent effect. I'm not concerned at the moment, as it's rather similar to most cases I've run into. If I had to guess, you probably wanted to outgrow your cousin. From what I saw in your home, that does not surprise me. It <i>does</i> show a strong aptitude for my subject, so I will be expecting excellent work from you. As unstructured self-transforming magic is extremely fiddly it would be best, for the moment, to let it run its course. Likely you'll either slow back down in a month at the most, or you'll just transition into a more ordinary growth spurt; you <i>are</i> at that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make an appointment for you with our nurse for Halloween; that should be simple enough for you to remember. In the meantime, it's definitely time for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't help grinning a bit as he trailed along behind the professor, taking in the wonders around him. He was in a magic castle, he had his very own friends, and he'd just been told that he was going to be bigger than Dudley!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't stop smiling even as he fell asleep, tucked into the most comfortable bed in the whole world.  Safe, happy, and warm, Harry felt ten feet tall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry blinked, disoriented, as he sat up on his bed.  His feet felt weirdly cold, and his legs shifted oddly as he scooted back to sit on his pillow. He felt something rough on his shoulders, and something was digging into his back. Reaching blindly behind himself, he frowned as his fingers curled over a carved wooden surface; the headboard on his new bed. But why was it so low? And why were his feet still cold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching through his curtains, Harry felt around for the top of his new desk; his confusion increasing as he reached lower and lower until finally his hand lightly smacked onto the surface. He slowly drew his arm back in, feeling the wood grain sliding under his fingers as he looked for his wand. It was close, much closer than he'd thought, and it felt odd in his hand. The wand's grip seemed smaller, he covered the whole area with only three fingers, and it was so narrow that he had to pinch it instead of simply holding on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lumos,\" he muttered in a raspy voice. He stared down at the end of his four-poster, where the curtains at the foot of the bed were draped over his knees; his calves and feet must be on the other side, sticking out into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was almost touching his bed canopy, and his back climbed past the headboard and up the stone wall of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Harry drew his legs in; sitting hunched over his knees, feet in front of him, he took up the entire bed.  His surroundings seemed a bit blurry and unclear; likely because he had no glasses on.  Harry drew the side curtains open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLit by his wand, the entire room was <i>tiny</i>. The other beds were spread through the space, their occupants softly snoring inside. Next to each bed was a tiny desk, and a small wardrobe. Rising to his feet, Harry stumbled slightly as he looked down on the furniture, his shoulders even with the bed canopies and the desks barely reaching his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on his desk were his glasses. Picking them up with two fingers, Harry quickly realized they were far too small to be of any use. Without them, the room seemed hazy, and it was hard to pin down what things looked like or where they were.  Harry set his glasses down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore curious than afraid, Harry couldn't resist squeezing his way around the room; there was barely space for him to move around, even though the room had felt fairly open and spacious that evening.  He bent down and picked up a pair of shoes, tilting his head as he crammed a finger inside and touched the toe. Had these really been on his feet a few hours ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA splashing sound drew his gaze to the tower window; big enough to hold a window seat for the students, Harry hunched down and slowly pressed his frame into the space, the seat under his palms creaking alarmingly.  Gazing out on the moonlit grounds, Harry saw ripples spreading out on the lake.  Suddenly, an enormous fish shot out, arced through the air, and crashed back onto the water with an earthshaking splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Koi fish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Potter! It's morning already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blinked, rubbing grit out of his eyes, as he took in the giant four-poster bed surrounding him. Daylight lit the room outside, and cast a dark boy-shaped shadow on the curtains.  He frowned. He'd been dreaming...he thought. Something about fish?  He shook his head to focus; at Hogwarts it would be back to three meals a day; he wouldn't learn anything if he spent all his time thinking about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry opened his mouth wide, letting out a loud yawn, before swinging his legs over the side and wincing as his feet connected with the cold stone floor.  Opening the curtains, he looked up into a wide-smiling freckled face and an outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you!\" Offered the boy, shaking Harry's hand while Harry tried to work out if he was awake or not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Weasley, Ron Weasley.\" He offered, letting go of Harry's hand and gesturing behind him at three other boys who were all going about different morning tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there are Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas, and Neville said you'd already met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Harry.\" Harry offered, stretching and toeing around the floor for a pair of slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I can call you Harry, call me Ron.\" The boy seemed pleased.  \"I can't believe I'm finally <i>here</i>, you know? And in Griffindor with <i>the</i> Harry Potter; well, of <i>course</i> you got into Griffindor, m'not surprised about <i>that</i>, and my family's all been lions for <i>ages</i>, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was rocking a bit on his heels at this point, looking slightly self-conscious.  The black boy - Finnegan or Thomas - laughed a bit and walked over, offering Harry his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him, Potter. Ron's just pleased to meet you. We met on the train, and he's alright, even if he has mad ideas about what makes a proper sport. He was really excited to meet you after the feast, since you're famous or something. Dunno about that, but you seem alright too. You can call me Dean, Dean Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry,\" Harry offered, feeling a bit more confident and awake. Keeping Dean's grip a moment, Harry quickly hoisted himself off the bed and started looking around for his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, there's <i>two</i> of 'em.\" Exclaimed the last boy, who must be Finnegan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean quickly retreated back to his area, letting the last, and shortest of the boys in the dorm have a chance to introduce himself.  Finnegan didn't offer his hand right away, instead glancing back and forth between Harry and Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to feel like a ruddy midget bunking with you two! I mean, it was bad enough yesterday with just this one!\" Finnegan grumbled, smiling, as he smacked Ron lightly on the shoulder. Indeed, the top of the boy's head was about level with Harry's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're titchy.\" Ron snorted, poking the boy in the forehead.  He turned back toward Harry. \"This is Seamus Finnegan, wizard, booze-smuggler, and dorm midget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" Finnegan objected, offering Harry his hand.  \"Call me Seamus. I am a wizard, I <i>do</i> have a few bottles of Butterbeer in my trunk, and I am <i>not</i> a midget.  Stringbean over here just got an early start, what with me being born in June. I'm only barely eleven, so there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born in July.\" Harry offered, apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeamus gave him a betrayed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Late</i> July,\" Neville chimed in from his wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry frowned thoughtfully as Seamus pouted; how did Neville know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Ron offered, hopping up to sit on Harry's desk, \"we thought we'd wake you up; <i>whatever</i> you were doing with McGonagall yesterday - Neville told us you'd gone off with her - must have taken a while; we didn't get to really meet you, and you slept through all of us waking up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Harry offered, grabbing his bathroom things and heading to the ensuite. \"It shouldn't happen again; too much excitement I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble,\" Seamus offered with a smile as he slipped on his shoes.  \"We'll wait a bit and all go down together. And if you aren't a morning person, at least it should be safe to have Stringbean over there wake you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Stop calling me Stringbean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me Midget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry grinned at Dean through the mirror as the two brushed their teeth.  Sure, the dorms were a bit more cramped than he'd like, since he had to share the space, but it looked like he'd get on with all of them.  He hoped Hermione was having as much luck in the girls' dorm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hermione was not having Harry's luck in her dorms, and things didn't improve even as September turned into October. To hear her tell it, her dorm mates were a bunch of flighty scatterbrains who ignored everything she had to say unless they wanted to grill her about \"tall dark and handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't really sure how to deal with that; he wasn't really thinking about...<i>dating</i> and stuff yet, but to hear Hermione talk about it, it was all that her dorm mates thought about all the time, and worse they were thinking about <i>him</i>.  Apparently he'd made a real impression during the first flying lesson. Neville had almost shot up out of control at the beginning, but Harry had managed to jump up and grab hold of his ankle. To hear the rumors afterward, he'd cleared ten feet easy; Harry didn't think it had been that much, and magic had probably helped, but his classmates had been impressed. Afterward, he'd done so well on his broom that he'd been declared a natural by Madame Hooch, even if he couldn't turn as tightly as some of the small first years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWood had already approached him about trying out for reserve keeper next year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, all of Harry's classes were going well, except maybe potions. Between Hermione's talent at research, and Neville's wizarding background, Harry's group of friends managed to finish their schoolwork quickly and without too much trouble (though for whatever reason Hermione often spent extra time going over the required writing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped that Harry found himself able to focus much better as about three weeks into term his weird, constant hunger went away.  It had happened the same day he'd borrowed one of Ron's robes by mistake and realized the bottom hem didn't quite reach the ground.  Ron had taken Seamus's ribbing with good humor, and just said that at least since his robes were hand-me-downs, they wouldn't resize if Harry made that mistake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, Halloween had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know,\" Neville spoke as he and Harry made their way out of Charms, \"that for a while when we were little, a couple nutters wanted to re-name Halloween 'Harry Potter Day'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stumbled a bit mid-stride and turned toward his friend with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeamus snorted from behind them; the shorter boy must have hustled up to join them after he'd turned in his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, Harry. Neville made that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slowed his stride (some more), allowing Seamus to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neville doesn't usually joke that way,\" Harry gave his friend a puzzled look, and Neville quickly shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have done,\" Seamus said, hooking his hands behind his head. \"Said it happened when you were <i>little</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sputtered a bit as Neville snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you...I was little, like, <i>last year</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me a photo, with you holding the paper, both for date and scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just shook his head and took off for the hospital wing with a few muttered excuses. Things with Seamus had gotten a bit rough a few weeks in; apparently he'd been taking the 'midget' comments a lot more seriously than they'd thought. A prefect had stepped in one evening with him and the short boy had, blushing, confessed that he didn't like the name-calling.  There'd been some awkward apologies and shoe scuffing. Harry had decided to share some of his own stories from being picked on back in tinier times.  In the end, Seamus had come around, and the dorm had gone back to the fun, teasing atmosphere it had had before, and Seamus had decided to poke a bit of fun at Harry by pretending to believe his 'small' stories were an elaborate lie.  (It was a bit hypocritical, but since Harry wasn't actually bothered, he didn't care.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Seamus' jokes were just more references to Harry being the biggest boy in his dorm, and Harry had realized he <i>liked</i> being big.  Even if some of the attention was embarassing, and he had <i>no idea</i> how to deal with Hermione's dorm mates, nobody picked on him. Nobody called him names, or ignored him. Sometimes if the first years were all working as a group, they looked to him as a leader or protector.  It felt...good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Pomphrey was quick and professional. She did a lot more tests on him, asked some awkward questions about certain body parts, and within ten minutes declared him \"perfectly healthy, still (barely) within normal measurements and development standards for his age, and probably done with any magical self-enlargement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as he left for the feast that things got...fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it later, Harry's memory would be unclear at best. One moment, he was walking down the halls outside of the Hospital Wing, and suddenly the whole world seemed to take on a dream-like quality. The world was hazy, and his thoughts random, with no reason or logic. He almost watched as a passenger while his body turned and started down the nearest staircase toward the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body froze in the first sub-level as he heard many footsteps approaching. After a moment, his arm reached out and tilted a nearby torch sconse. A terribly narrow passage opened in the wall to his left, and his mind balked in horror as his body squeezed itself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he <i>slithered</i> through the tight corridor, shuffling sideways with stones rubbing against his shoulders, Harry's mind balked at the tightness around him, memories of his tiny cupboard, his towering cousin, and his giant furious shouting uncle flashing behind his eyes.  For a moment his mind seemed to clear, but a second wave of horrible dizziness later and he was once more along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscaping the tiny crack of a passage, he found himself in a plain, unfurnished hallway. Ahead of him was a large iron-bound wood door with the Hogwarts crest carved into every panel. Odd symbols were cut into the metal frame.  Harry was so fascinated by the doorway that he didn't notice he'd moved until his hands closed over a heavy draw-bar and slid the mechanism open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's head cleared like he'd been dunked in ice water. Standing behind the now open door was a giant...monster. Towering so high it would have to duck into the hall, massive arms holding what looked like a small tree as a club, and staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry slammed the door shut.  The horrible thing bellowed on the other side, and the door slammed at Harry, his feet skidding back on the stonework. He pushed, and <i>shoved</i> at the door, gritting his teeth, but whatever that thing was, it was just too much for him.  With a second slam, this time harder, the door blew open and Harry felt himself lift off the ground as he was launched across the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, and desperate, Harry ran at the far wall and wriggled himself back into the tight, horribly tight, passageway. As he scurried through like a frightened little mouse, he shuddered as the club slammed into the stone behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis worried friends found him holed up in his bed, and they were telling stories about a troll somehow getting into the castle. He was too ashamed to say anything.  They told him the feast had been moved to the common room, but he wasn't hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, he woke to a growling stomach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What on earth?\" Harry mumbled as he moved in front of the washroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Christmas holiday, and Harry and Ron had the dorm to themselves. This was fine; the two of them got along rather well, and Ron had a great sense of humor (most of the time).  At the moment, the Weasly boy was snoring away in his bed, which suited Harry just fine. He didn't fancy trying to explain why he was standing around in the washroom in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry bent his arm, and watched as his bare-chested reflection copied him.  A modest, but very <i>very</i> real, ball of muscle bunched up at his reflections bicep. The boy in the mirror struck a pose, the enchantment taking over for a moment, and flexed his chest and stomach, six small bumps briefly showing up before fading. The mirror-Harry let out a whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep at it, lad! A few years of effort and you'll break hearts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scowled, and pulled a face at the mirror before stepping off to the showers. He hadn't put in any effort at all! He'd only done the same things he'd done <i>before</i> the...incident.  And hadn't the adults said he wasn't transfiguring himself anymore? He didn't think he'd gotten any taller since Halloween; Ron was still around eye level. (Though maybe the red-head had grown a bit, too...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry paused, and in a fit of whimsy, spun toward the mirror, flexed his arms and growled.  He laughed a bit at the image, stuck out his tongue, and continued with his morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron were making an effort to explore the castle while the older students were away. So far, Ron had found a secret passage from near Griffindor Tower to the great hall...by slide.  Harry was trying to top that, but so far hadn't found anything nearly that cool to share; the best he'd found was a dusty old mirror where the enchanted reflection was always playing with toys. Though where mirror-Harry got a dollhouse that looked like the Dursleys' house on Privet Drive he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo today, Harry was determined to find a super-cool secret to show up his friend/rival. He'd find out what was hidden on the third floor corridor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was already one hall away from the big secret; he'd been psyching himself up to this for some time. Ever since the...incident....with the troll, he'd been having bad dreams, always waking up feeling scared and claustrophobic.  He <i>needed</i> to do something brave, and a little stupid, just to prove that he still could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartling briefly at an odd sound, Harry froze and looked around. Nothing was in sight. Gulping, he crept up to the forbidden door.  A soft tug did nothing. The door was stuck. Gritting his teeth, Harry braced his feet on the wall and <i>tugged</i>, the sleeves of his robes pulling tighter on his arms as he put everything he had into opening the stupid door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door didn't budge.  Harry huffed, and glared at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - click -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blinked, staring at the door. Did it just...unlock?  Cautiously, Harry pulled on the door, and it swung open with ease.  Now suspicious, Harry lit his wand and peered into the room from outside.  Suddenly the hair on his neck prickled! Acting without thought, Harry dropped to the ground, and felt some invisible force whoosh through his hair and into the room.  His wide eyes took in the site of a suddenly very awake, angry, <b>giant</b> dog before the door slammed shut inches from his nose and clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scrambled back from the door on his hands, eyes darting around the corridor. What had brushed his hair? What if he hadn't ducked?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran back to the dorms, Harry had two thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon would be super impressed to hear about the giant dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whatever had tried to knock him into the dog's room was much more dangerous.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry awoke with a startle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt Had been  the first day of classes since the winter break and his experience on the third floor, though much of his wariness had subsided. <br>\r\nPlus, when his housemate heard about his alarming discovery, he officially granted Harry the title of winner in the battle to see who could find the most outrageous thing in the school. <br>\r\nLikewise, since his experiences with the troll AND the massive three headed dog, things  had been relatively normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was exhausted when he had returned from classes only half an hour before and had decided he was going to take a nap for an hour or two before getting started on work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, said startling, and rude awakening was his stomach audibly growling. <br>\r\nSeamus, the runt, was peering over from his bed across the room. Meanwhile Harry was filled with a slight sense of anxiety. Though Seamus was none the wiser as he had been gone over winter break, Harry\u2019s appetite had been steadily increasing. And despite no increases in height \u2014 Ron still stood at eye level \u2014 his shirts had begun to feel tight across his chest, arms, and back. Likewise his pants had taken to hugging his thighs and butt quite tightly,with his shoes seeming altogether too narrow. Fortunately, no one seemed to notice because of his extra large cloaks. <br>\r\nGroaning, and lifting from his bed with a stretch, and quite the loud yawn, Harry peered over at his roommate, and questioned if he\u2019d like to go to a pre-dinner snack in the Great Hall. Though Seamus gave him a slightly confused look, he agreed to proceed, as he too thought he could use a quick snack as a break in his work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they proceeded down from Gryffindor common room, Harry began to realize just how much bigger he was than his classmate. His strides his longer, his steps were louder, his hands were thicker, his \u2014His stomach rumbles furiously, and LOUDLY again. Their pace became brisker, with Seamus needing to run to nearly keep up with Harry. When they finally managed to get to the Great Hall Seamus quickly went to grab a few treats for their walk back, but by time he had turned around Harry already had a plate stacked high with all sorts of food, and was clearly planning to take it with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis should tide me over till supper I suppose\u201d Harry said, looking down skeptically at his meal. He HOPED it would. <br>\r\nHis partners response was quick and swift, said with almost no input of thought, \u201cBloody hell Potter! Are you planning on getting as big as Hagrid? Supper is within the hour, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever managed to eat that much in my life in one sitting\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was slightly taken aback by the response, but quickly recovered. The teachers had TOLD him he hadn\u2019t stppped transfiguring himself, then any further growth would likely be due to plain puberty. PLUS, why shouldn\u2019t he eat if he was hungry, and who was Seamus to stop him. His response was duly applied with little thought as he angrily retorted \u201cWell, at least some of us ARE growing!\u201d He made a swift exit, plate in hand, stuffing his food in his mouth, leaving a stunned Seamus with treat in hand looking after his quickly receding figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while he regretted the way he may have said it, it wasn\u2019t like Harry was about to apologize for getting bigger. Bigger than anyone he knew, everyone he saw, he\u2019d been small his entire life until recently, and he wasn\u2019t about to feel bad about it because some git was jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the portrait of the fat lady, saying the password while reaching down for more food, he realized his plate was empty. Which he was mildly upset about, until he looked up at the grandfather clock in the common room and realized most people would be departing soon. He found Dean, Ron and Neville as Seamus rolled into the common room. An irrational sense of pride roiled up in Harry as he saw him make his way uncertainly forward, causing him to puff out his chest just a little bit, which resulted, to his surprise in the top button undoing, and causing him to stand just a little taller. With alarm Harry realized Ron now only was up to his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Seamus finally reached them through the throng of classmates he stayed relatively quiet, and to Harry  it seemed as though his friends were waiting for him to make the first move. He liked this. Being looked up to, like a leader. As he pushed through crowd, making eye contact with some seventh years, and looking over the heads of some fourth years, he finally made it to the exit, and they were off to the Hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived Harry was quick to start piling his plate with food. Unlike the first night in which he only barely eeked out more plates than Ron, tonight Harry easily doubled, maybe tripled his intake, with nearly all the other boys in gryffindor staring at him in wonder by the end of the night. What most of them didn\u2019t know, was that he undoubtedly could\u2019ve eaten more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time he made it back to the rooms that night, after some light snacking in the common room, all of his roommates were asleep. He attempted to get his pajamas on, but they were tight and uncomfortabke, So he made his way to the bathroom in just his boxers, which at this pony seemed to leave little to the imagination. When he got there he was slightly taken aback by what he saw in the mirror. He looked bigger. Not taller. But thicker, and older ?  His arms were big now, as big as grapefruits, and his chest and stomach seemed developed with muscle. His neck was thicker and his shoulders broader. Hell, he even had some hair growing on his chin and upper lip, among other places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely satisfied with himself, Harry made his way back to bed forgetting to brush his teeth. The only thoughts invading his mind as he laid down in bed pertaining to how much fairer a fight he\u2019d have with Dudley when he got back to little winging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke the next morning to the brisk winter blowing through an open window, and the room empty. As he swung his now cold legs over the edge of the bed and stuck his feet \u2014 attempted to stick his feet into his slippers, he realized them were much to short and much to narrow. Hmm that was strange. He quickly made to shower, not glancing at the mirror in his rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was brushing the water out of his hair with his towel he heard Ron calling his name, alerting him they were headed to breakfast, and asking him where he was. As he exited the bathroom a much shorter body ran into his, flying to the floor, having almost no effect on him.. It was Ron!! Harry extended his hand to help him up and that\u2019s when they both noticed the changes. Harry\u2019s hand eclipsed Rons. On top of this, the top of Ron\u2019s head only met his chin. And as the young wizard looked closer he started to take in the other differences. His legs were thicker. The towels that usually came mid calf on him, now stopped above his knees. His legs and armpits were hairier,  with a little patch starting to grow on his chest, which had also ballooned in size. Harry was massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was on his way to being as big as Hagrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon\u2019s response said it all though. <br>\r\n\u201cBlimey, what\u2019re you gonna wear\u201d</span></div></div>",

Plus I bet most of your clothes wont even fit you\" Ron stumbled through his words. He was at a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind <i>that</i>, I'm sure theres something in here that'll fit me\" He said while fumbling through his clothes, \"I'm hungry, I gotta eat some breakfast\" and with that his stomach released yet another audible growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his best efforts, it was clear none of his clothes would fit him, as not only were they short, but they also looked like they'd be much too tight.

They were barely functioning as pants too, as they hugged tightly around his upper calves, and were starting to split at the seem near his butt. As they made their way through the upper year rooms,  Harry carefully looked for suitable clothing. By the end of their scrounging harry was looking moderately better for ware. They'd managed to find a larger shirt and pants from one of the larger fifth years. Though they fit him fine across the waste, and were a relatively loose fit, the pants still stopped above his ankles and shirt was simply to short on his arms. It would have to do though. they had managed to find a larger pair of shoes as well, though Harry's feet still felt relatively constricted within them. And with that, his stomach growled for maybe the tenth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ron we gotta go, i could eat a cow right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the look of hunger shining in Harry's eyes, Ron didn't doubt it. And as they practically ran to the Great Hall, with everyone passing them on <i>their</i> way back to the dormitory Harry went full steam ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking himself into a seat, Harry hurriedly started to pile multiple plates with food. Whether it was treacle tart, bread pudding or even some chicken wings, the boy was continuously eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven and a half plates later, and Harry finally managed to push himself away from the table. </span></div></div>",

He made eye contact with Neville, smiled, and proceeded to get ready before heading down to the great hall. <br>\r\nAfter tying the lace on his right shoe he stood up and made his way to the door.

I mean you did miss dinner last night, Halloween too, I\u2019m sure my stomach would be rumbling if i missed a meal too\u201d Seamus added, and then under his breath \u201cthough probably wouldn\u2019t shake that loud if i had to guess\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing\u201d the smaller boy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the Great Hall, Harry\u2019s stomach made audible noises again. Seating himself across from the twins and in between Ron and Neville, Harry started to fill his first plate. <br>\r\nWhat started off as a plate filled with the contents of a well balanced English breakfast, quickly grew to a second, which then jumped to a third, and before Harry knew it, he was polishing off his usual maximum, his seventh plate. The other boys were giving him sideways glances. Sure they\u2019d seen the kid eat a similar amount of food before, and they undoubtedly expected it considering he had missed a meal the day prior, but it didn\u2019t take away from the awe of seeing someone shovel away that much food. <br>\r\nIt seemed like he was done too, patting his stomach, and letting out a series of quiet belches, before taking a deep breath. What alarmed them, was that he then seemed to pull in closer to the table, dragging their whole bench, and digging into another plate, as his stomach rumbled once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn\u2019t really assess the damage he\u2019d done till the never ending dishes started to empty. He pulled away from his plate. Most of the table had vacated, with only a few renaming. Namely Neville, And Hermione, who seemed to be  were assessing him quizzically. He let out a belch, this time deeper and damper, than the few he\u2019d released earlier. He didn\u2019t feel any worse for wear that was for sure. He could definitely see some stains on his shirt, and feel some food on his face, but his clothes still felt fine, and his stomach seemed satiated, finally! What sat in front of him alarmed him though. It was hard to gauge from the empty plates in front of him, but he had to have guess that he polished no less than fifteen heaping servings of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione glanced up at him, nervously; \u201cHarry, are you feeling alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever better, Hermione. Never better\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe month and a half since the run in the troll, and Harry\u2019s unbelievable intake, had been less than eventful. Beyond that insane breakfast, Harry hadn\u2019t put away a meal that large since, though he was consistently passing ten to twelve dishes a meal. Despite that intake, he hadn\u2019t gotten demonstrably larger. Sure his pants were a little tighter, and shorter, only reaching above his ankles. And yeah, his arms a little to long for his sleeves now, but as far as Harry was concerned, that was barely noticeable. <br>\r\nWhat was noticeable, at least to onlookers, was that Harry had gotten thicker. Though he may not have noticed it, he was now a great deal bigger than his roommates. Sure him and Ron were still hovering around the same height, but Harry\u2019s body stretched a bit broader. Seamus, by comparison, really did look like a misfit next to him. <br>\r\nHe rolled over in bed again. He was hungry, it was Christmas morning, but the only left in the dormitories, Ron, was still asleep abed over from him. His stomach wasn\u2019t happy. It growled again, this time louder, and Harry decided it was time to get up. He rolled out of his four poster placing his feet in his slipper and take the two steps necessary to get to rons bed, and shook him. Rather violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy Christmas Ron! Let\u2019s get breakfast yeah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon sat up with a start. \u201cBloody hell, Harry. No need to cause an earthquake, wellhead down just as soon as i open my presents, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry followed dejectedly. Not only because of  the delay for food, but also because he was acutely aware that his aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t sent him any gifts. Despite this, when they entered the common room Harry found a handful of packages with his name on them. Food could wait...for now <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Ron, they all seem pretty big\u201d Harry stared down at the packages in front of him. They mostly had been gifts of new clothes. Some only a tad bigger, others monsterously so. <br>\r\n\u201cHarry, you barely fit in the clothes you have on now, what could be the harm in trying in this new stuff before breakfast?\u201d <br>\r\nAt that, Harry glanced down at himself. Had he been growing?  Now that Ron mentioned it, these clothes really were getting small. A sliver of his stomach was showing, his pajama pants didn\u2019t even clear his ankles, and everything was decidedly tight <br>\r\nRon was right. It void my hurt to try on some bigger clothes. <br>\r\nHe grabbed what he gauged to be the nearest outfit and size to what he was wearing now, and began to shuck his clothing. <br>\r\n\u201cBlimey Harry, have you been working out, you\u2019re bigger than some third years.\u201d Harry glanced between himself and his friend. Ron had a point. He was bigger than his friend. He didn\u2019t know when, but it seemed like All of the sudden he has sprouted muscles. His pecs pushed out above a relatively flat stomach, and his arms laid bulky at his sides. He really must look intimidating to the others. And was this how shoes were supposed to feel? They were roomy! <br>\r\n\u201cAlright I\u2019m ready whenever are\u201d he glanced at himself up and down in the mirror. He could get used to this. <br>\r\nHis stomach rumbled once more. <br>\r\nAnd they departed.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time there friends returned a week later things were slightly different. <br>\r\nFor one, Harry was bigger, though one would be hard pressed to notice, as Harry\u2019s new clothes were as tight as his old clothes had been before break. The only tell was that he now was roughly a head taller than his friend. <br>\r\nUpon seeing him, his growth, Professor mcgonnegals immediate reaction was to schedule a checkup appointment, to see wether his self transfiguration had run its course (it hadn\u2019t). </span></div></div>",

I'm 18 years old, and Tyler is 12, but Tyler, or Ty, ended up bigger than me... A lot bigger! He's practically a giant boy now, even though he's still 12 years old. I'm 6ft tall and Ty was 5ft tall, and we had a good relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when mom took Tyler to the doctor just at the start of the annual flu season. Ty had just gotten over another bad cold, and mom just didn't want Ty to end up missing a ton of school because he was sick again. Last year, he almost missed a whole month's worth of school, and it was a nightmare for him to get all caught up on all the missed classes, let alone all the homework assignments. Mom ended up spending every afternoon and evening, working with Ty and helping him get all caught up with his classes and his homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took Ty to the doctor's office, where the doctor sent them to teh lab so he could get his flu shot. Fortunately for him, they were doing all kinds of research at that same lab, where Ty was due for his shot. Due to some freaky mistake, the lab technician mixed up the vials of teh flu shot and the growth serum, and the nurse injected Ty with this weird serum instead. nobody knew this of course, until a day later, when the mistake was discovered. But the people at the lab decided to stay quiet, and wait it out until they would hear back from our mom first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Mom came home from the doctor's office and Ty showed off the band-air on his arm, right where his elbow was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Joe! I got my shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah....\" I said to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was proud of the little tyke. He was only 5 feet tall, and he was short and skinny, and I knew how much he hated going to the doctor. Still, he was brave, and he didn't cry this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something weird started to happen to him, since he came home from the doctor that day. It seemed as if he would just grow bigger and more muscular...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ty came running right at me, and stopped, as he bent over and picked up the ball. Right away, I noticed that he seemed a little... bigger. I could have sworn that he seemed a little taller than before, and his arms and legs seemed a little more muscular. Maybe I was seeing things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ty picked up the ball, I could see small biceps sticking out of his arms. Ty used to have very thin arms before. Then, when he turned around, I realized that his calves had become slightly rounder, and were sticking out the back of his legs. small lumps of muscle had formed, on both legs, just below the knees. What the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ty!\" I shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy stopped kicking the ball and ran towards me. He stopped right in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that he had definitely grown taller, maybe 2 inches or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro... could you do me a favor... and check the mail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and sprinted to the mailbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped as I watched how quickly he ran the distance to the mailbox.

That was rather unusual, since he had never done that before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't put the dishes away!\" I laughed. \"You can't even reach the cupboards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can NOW!\" Ty replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my little bro stood next to me, I noticed some more changes in him again. I had not seen him in four days, and it seemed as if he had enjoyed another growth spurt while I was working during those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy was only wearing shorts and sandals, and nothing else. His chest was bare, so he could show off his chest. I used to look down at him, but now, I would be looking at the top of his head.

Not only that, but his chest was fuller, his arms were thicker, his quads seemed wider, and his calves seemed bigger. What the heck is going on here? Nobody grows that fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand me the plates, bro!\" he ordered, enjoying his new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Ty was able to reach the cupboards now, as I handed him the plates and watched as he put them away. Every time I handed him a plate, I saw how he flexed his muscles in his arms, and it seemed as if those muscles were growing bigger every single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much longer would he keep on gowing and how big would he get?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I peeked my head into his room, seeing his sleeping body curled up under the covers. In the darkness, something looked a little off, but I didn't give it much thought. \"See ya in the morning, Ty,\" I whispered, smiling, then closed the door, heading to my own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, I got up, heading to the shower first thing, as my typical routine had always been. The feeling of hot water on my face always did wonders to wake me up. Afterwards, I was brushing my teeth, a towel wrapped around my waist, when I heard a knock at the door. \"Joe,\" Ty's sleepy voice called out, \"can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" I said after spitting out the toothpaste and rinsing my mouth. I heard the door creak open and I turned around, wiping my face off with a hand towel. \"I'm almost don-- What the--?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy reaction was due to the figure that had come through the door. \"Ty?\" I asked, not sure of what - or who - I was looking at. \"Is that you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like my kid brother, sure, but now he was almost as tall as I was! His pajama top from the night before had stretched tight over his skin, revealing his stomach, which seemed slightly more fit than I remembered. His pants now cut off halfway up his calves instead of at his ankles like they should have. His proportions were the same as before; he still looked like a normal, if athletic, pre-teen, but on a larger scale. The only thing that made me believe I really was looking at Ty was his young, boyish face, his blue eyes still droopy from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, Joe,\" Ty answered, apparently not yet aware of what had happened to him overnight. \"Who else would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-- Whoa!!\" Tyler exclaimed as he finally caught a look at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. He looked down at his toned torso and at his legs, awed by what he was seeing. \"This is great!\" Tyler's face had instantly changed from tired to excited, as his hands ran over his body, feeling the new muscles that had shown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" I wasn't quite sure of how to respond. In the back of my head, I thought that there might be something troubling about a 12-year-old boy growing almost a foot in one night, but if Tyler was happy with it, then I'd also be happy for him. \"Yeah!\" I said, trying to bring a supportive smile to my face. \"You look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler continued to admire his transformation, twisting his waist and flexing his muscles, always watching the mirror. \"I can't wait to see what happens next!\" he said, his face beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext? you think to yourself, and shift nervously from foot to foot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I loaned Tyler some of my clothes, which fit him fairly well, perhaps a little loose, but definitely passible. When we got downstairs to the breakfast table, we were both afraid for one or both of our parents to freak out. Sure enough, when Mom saw Joe's larger-than-normal body, she nearly dropped the plate of bacon and eggs she had been carrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" she said, bringing a hand to her mouth. \"Tyler! What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother beamed up to her. \"I grew! A whole bunch last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I confirmed, nodding. \"He just woke up this morning like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Mom said. Surprisingly, she didn't seem incredibly confused or phased by her younger son growing a foot taller and more muscly overnight, and took it in stride, continuing to serve breakfast. Dad, sitting at the table across from Tyler, barely looked up from his newspaper, slurping his coffee and continuing to read the sports section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gobbled down his plate of bacon and eggs, finishing before I had even started. When I saw him look over at my plate, a look of hunger still in his eyes, I smiled and dumped half of my eggs and two slices of bacon onto his plate. \"Thanks, Joe!\" he said happily, as he continued to eat. I didn't have much of an appetite after the events of this morning, and it was truly an amazing site to see my brother, who just the day before had been a rather picky eater, being so ravenous. I just hoped, for the sake of my parents' grocery budget, that this didn't become a trend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, we grabbed our backpacks and headed out the door, Mom giving us a kiss on the foreheads as we left, now having to tiptoe to reach both of us. Tyler's and my schools were near each other and both within walking distance, so we walked down the sidewalk together. A few kids and adults who passed us gave Tyler strange looks, unaccustomed to seeing a high school senior and a seventh grader the same height, but no one said anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the intersection where we had to go our separate ways, I reached over and gave Tyler a big hug. \"Have a great day at school today, buddy,\" I said. As I squeezed him tight, I felt his arm and chest muscles, which seemed to be bigger and firmer than than they looked, surprising me and, I have to admit, turning me on a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, bro!\" He smiled at me as he brushed the hair out of his eyes, and waved goodbye. As I watched him walk away, I noticed he had a bit of a confidence in his stride now. I smiled, feeling happy for my brother's big break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful for me. School, band practice, and four hours at the restaurant afterwards. I didn't get home again until 10:30, and Tyler was already in bed when I did. As I poked my head in on him while he slept, I looked for any signs of more transformations, but he appeared to be the same size as before. I noticed he slept only in his -- well, my -- boxers, obviously not even bothering to try and fit in any of his pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Tyler,\" I said softly. \"I hope tomorrow's another big day.\" I had no idea how right I would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning, Tyler had already gotten up. I started heading into the bathroom, and could hear the sound of the shower running inside, so I guessed he was in there getting himself clean. At first, I thought I should go downstairs and wait, but as I started to leave, I heard Tyler's voice (still boyish but now louder and more powerful) call out, \"Joe? Are ya there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ty,\" I said. \"Sorry for interrupting. I'll head downstairs until you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't go!\" he cried out. \"C-can you come in here a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little confused, I shrugged and opened up the door into the sub-room where the shower was. I pulled back the shower curtain, only to be shocked when I saw Tyler inside. He had definitely grown more over the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler's head was now almost hitting the ceiling of the shower, his large body having grown even more last night than it had two nights ago. The water from the shower head struck against his chest, dripping down the hills and valleys of his expanding pectoral muscles and rippling abs. His boyish face looked down at me with a half-embarrassed, half-excited smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Joe,\" he said with a hint of amusement. He moved his right hand down his chest, gliding past his large, perky nipples and feeling the new, wonderful muscles that had appeared overnight. Everything about this situation nearly floored me, but what had to take the cake was my brother's amazing rod between his legs. Completely and totally erect, it was bigger than any porn star's, and when Tyler's hand made it down far enough and brushed against it, the thick, meaty head began to throb. Tyler shivered, with pleasure, I assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I really need to go downstairs,\" I said as I turned and started to step out of the bathroom, but I felt a large hand grasp my shoulders as I did so, spinning me back around. Looking straight into Tyler's eyes, I saw a mixture of confusion and lust, fear and desire running throughout his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe,\" he said, his voice low but powerful, \"...help me. Please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew immediately what he wanted help with, but I definitely felt uncomfortable doing it. Finally, though, I started to stutter, \"O-Okay, Tyler, I'll tell you what to do... First, you want to grasp your... yourself tightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" he asked, wrapping his fingers around his thick meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes, that's exactly right.\" I took a deep breath before continuing. \"Okay, now you should take that same hand and rub it back and forth along the length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to stroke his cock as I suggested, and his eyes lit up. He picked up on it quickly (as most boys his age would), already seeming to be a natural. Within seconds, his eyes begin to roll back into his head; he seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-oh, Joe!\" he cried out. \"This is AMAZING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as he continued to go faster and faster. His massive muscles were tensing and flexing, even sometimes causing his entire body to twitch or shudder. He hadn't turned off the shower yet, and as the hot, steamy water continued to run down his smooth skin, I noticed a stream of precum slowly starting to ooze out of his slit. \"At least he's close,\" I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, he lasted another five minutes. Every thirty seconds or so he'd quickly yank his cock upwards, and I thought he would be about to cum, thankful that it was almost over-- but he kept going! Just as I was about to try to sneak away again, hoping he wouldn't notice, he finally slammed his butt and back against the wall of the shower (causing two tiles to crack in the process), thrusted out his crotch, and began spewing forth hot white ropes of cum that splattered against the shower curtain and the bathtub basin. There were six shots in total before he was all done. As much as I hadn't wanted to be forced to watch this the way I had been, I admitted it was one if the more impressive displays I had ever seen, and Tyler seemed to have one of the more impressive bodies of any human on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slouched down, his face still in an overly-contended afterglow, he finally looked back up at me, a satisfied grin on his face, saying...</span></div></div>",

That meant, that I would often come home and just wander into my bedroom and just crash right away, because I was so doggone tired after work. Luckily I made a ton of money from all the tips that I earned, since the place where I worked was a top-notch steakhouse. The food was great and the service was first class, and the people who ate there had a lot of money to spend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five full days of working there, they called me up and asked if I could come in and work for a sixth straight day as well. They were one waiter short, because one of the other waiters had called in sick, so they needed me to fill in for him. Normally, I never say no, so I hopped in the shower and I went straight to work. Normally, I ended up sleeping the whole afternoon after work, and when I would wake up, Tyler was out with friends, or at the mall, or visiting Nate, the kid next door, so I wouldn't even see him. So, six days went by, without seeing my little bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the seventh day, I woke up, and my bedroom door opened up. In walked a tall, muscular boy, who quietly pulled the sheets back and climbed into my bed. Ty would do that often, just to wake me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww Ty! Your feet are cold! Get out!\" I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Joe!\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I noticed something. His feet were rubbing up against mine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body felt huge! He seemed tall and muscular... I opened my eyes and stared at him in disbelief... Who was this big kid, who had so playfully crawled into bed with me? Was this still my little, twelve-year-old brother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty... Stand up for a sec, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of bed and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out of bed and stood right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI used to look down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was exactly my height now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... My... God...\" he uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy 12-year-old little brother was now 6 foot tall, and he was muscular. He just stood there with a wide grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're not the 'big bro' anymore, huh?\" he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw his bigger pecs and biceps, and gulped. He was still growing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days brought their own drama at work, but nothing was more surprising than coming home each night and seeing how much Tyler had grown.  Sitting at the kitchen table doing his homework, lying on the couch watching TV, playing video games while sitting on the floor, these were all normal actions for Tyler.  It was just amazing to see someone with the body of an adult doing them.  In fact, the only way you could tell that Tyler wasn't an adult was to look at his face, which still had its boyish nature to it, cemented with a wide grin; Tyler was truly happy having become this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, eventually our mom decided something had to be done about it, so we went to the same doctor's office where he had gotten the flu shot.  By this time Tyler stood out among a crowd, at nearly seven feet tall and large, thick biceps and pecs.  He had gotten used to stealing my clothes, as his old ones didn't fit him any more, but now most of my shirts were too small for him as well.  He usually walked around the house shirtless, only wearing a tight-fitting pair of nylon shorts, but since we were going out in public, Mom made him put on a t-shirt as well, which still was form-fitting around his muscles and not quite covering his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we walked into the waiting room, the nurse at the front desk covered her mouth, and ran back to get the doctor.  We were quickly ushered into a private room, where we only had to wait a few minutes until the doctor came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see you're back, Tyler,\" he said with a nervous look on his face.  \"And healthy as ever, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call this healthy?\" Mom said, in hysterics.  \"What's happening to my baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be frank, ma'am.  The last time you were here, there was a slight mix-up, and it seems Tyler got an experimental development enhancer, instead of the flu shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mix-up?\" Mom shrieked.  \"What's going to happen with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the good news is, that there doesn't seem to be any negative side effects, but we're not sure when the growth will stop.  On the mice we had tested them on, most stopped growing at around twice their original sizes.  But some... well, let's just say we had to abort the experiment early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom just stood there in shock, but Tyler couldn't have been more happy with the news he was hearing.  \"Awesome!! So I'm going to become, like, a giant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting the idea of power to go to far to his head, I asked another question before the doctor could answer.  \"You said there were no side effects, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no negative side effects.\" The doctor flipped through some charts.  \"In addition to the growth, some of the subjects have experienced an increase in thirst, a larger appetite, and an increased sex drive.  But those were in less than five percent of the cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can do?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, while we're still at work on the process, the changes have so far proved to be irreversible.  Of course, our corporate backers understand the struggles that you are going to be up against, and have agreed to financially support the development of the boy until he reaches adulthood.  I just need you to sign these papers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went uneventfully.  On the drive home, Tyler kept going on and on about being the biggest person on earth, which was a thought that, while scary, also seemed a little interesting.  I figured I could get used to the idea of being the big brother to a modern day Hercules.  I just needed to make sure that I stayed on Tyler's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, however, proved that their were going to be new challenges that awaited me if I was going to keep Tyler happy.</span></div></div>",

I was about to walk into the kitchen, when I saw Ty in there, grabbing a bunch of food he set on the table, and eating it, while standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing a wife beater...a tight one.  It was small.  It exposed more than half of his stomach and lower back.  His boxers were tight around his waist too.  As I spied on him, walking back and forth getting more food, I saw a massive bulge.  I assumed it was the entirety of his genitals, but apparently, it was only his massive testicles.  His giant penis hung out the right pant of his boxers.  My brother was bigger than ay porn star I've seen, and he was still soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to eat like a maniac, and I was shocked.  Our family already got the first check for Ty's upkeep, and food was already dwindling.  Then, something was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Ty, bent over the food, bulge slightly.  The muscles in his back widened, his body pulsed, and he was slightly taller.  His boxers tightened slightly.  He grunted, still eating.  His body swelled slightly again.  \"Yes...\"  He said.  \"Bigger...\"  I actually heard his bones cracking.  The wife beater stretched out farther and farther, becoming slightly transparent.  His boxers tightened around his growing butt, thigh, and genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was jealous.  I hated Ty for it.  I blamed him.  This young kid.  Why was I blaming him.  No one his age would be against what was happening to him.  He was basically turning into a super hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a tear, and saw his boxers fall to the floor, and his penis swing back and forth.  He swelled slightly more, and the growth stopped.  \"No...\"  He said, eating more, eating faster.  \"Bigger...I can't wait to be the biggest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pissed.  This wasn't fair.  He didn't even know what the size meant.  That right now, he could probably get any girl he wanted.  His mind was still innocent...innocent-ish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the house, and made my way to the doctors office.  I snooped around the office, in legal files, til I found Ty's record.  I found the experimental drug they had, and stole a batch.  I hated that my brother was bigger than me, and I needed to catch up.</span></div></div>",

I opened my eyes and looked over to the doorway, where I saw the immense figure of my formerly \"little\" brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler,\" I hissed, not wanting to wake up our parents down the hall.  \"What are you doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bro,\" he said, casually, \"I'm feeling kinda lonely.  Would you mind if I slept in here with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving me any time to answer, he moved towards my bed, pulled aside the sheets, and climbed in.  I didn't really know what to say; I wasn't crazy about the idea, but I didn't quite know how to say no to someone who could easily beat me up at his new size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed in my bed, and I could instantly feel the mattress settle as it adjusted to his weight, leaning over towards his side.  I turned my back towards him, closing my eyes.  \"Good night, Tyler,\" I said, trying to get back to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, I felt him scoot over closer to me, and he reached over and wrapped his arm around me.  It was a large arm, like being hugged by my dad when I was a kid.  He pulled me closer towards him, and pressed his body against mine.  It was at this point that I realized he was totally naked.  His smooth, muscled chest rubbed up against my back, and pressing against the side of my thigh I felt what I could only guess was his cock, as impressively large as anything else about him was now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly spun around and looked at him in the eyes.  He had an innocent look to them, reminding me that he was still a boy, no matter how big his body had gotten.  \"Tyler, no,\" I said.  \"If we're gonna sleep like this, we need to keep our distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not tired yet,\" Tyler said, as he moved his hands down my back and towards my ass.  He gave them a light squeeze, tugging at my boxers, finally ripping them off in one quick motion.  There I was, lying next to my bigger brother, the two of us naked.  It was at this point I realized that I, too, had begun to grow hard at this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to take a second look at Tyler, his body lit by the moonlight leaking through my window.  He was now undeniably hot, muscles all over his body having been developing quickly, but with the smooth hairlessness that should accompany someone his age.  His feet were hanging off the end of my bed; he was truly a giant now, and, though I knew he would never intentionally hurt me or anyone else, he had a strength now that was almost frightening.  And, of course, there was the matter of his manhood, which now, as he was lying on his back, stood straight up, at least fourteen inches long and nearly as thick as my forearm.  Its slit was starting to secrete precum, and with each beat of Tyler's heart, it throbbed, as if to indicate it was ready to explode with just the right touch.  At this point, I had to face the facts: no matter how much my brain said otherwise, no matter how weird it felt, physically I was beginning to desire my brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned his head, the moonlight reflecting off his eyes in just the right way so that his pleas seemed extra sincere.  \"Please, Joe.  I need you to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I realized I had to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

And you can't <i>ever</i>-\"<br>\r\nTyler interrupted you, reaching over and pulling you closer. \"I know I know I know, I can't ever tell anyone. I'll keep it a secret!\" <br>\r\nYou were close enough now that you could feel the heat from his muscle-bound body, and could feel the smoothness of his skin where your feet were touching his legs. <br>\r\nYou took a deep breath to steady yourself, and then grabbed hold of his cock before you could talk yourself out of it. <br>\r\nHe gasped at the contact, and spurted a jet of pre that was more voluminous than any load you had ever shot. <br>\r\nYou opened your mouth and slowly moved to the tip of his cock, and began licking the tip. <br>\r\nThis earned you another gasp, and a small whimper as he let out a spurt that make you cough. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Joe?\" He asked quickly, looking concerned and rubbed your back. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah I'm fine...\" You assured him, and then wrapped both arms around his two-foot cock and began licking his cock-tip in earnest. <br>\r\nHe bit his bottom lip and whimpered again, trying to keep himself from choking you with another spurt, and rested his big hand on the top of your head. <br>\r\nRelaxing a little now that he was being careful, you began to rub your hands up and down his shaft.  <br>\r\nTyler groaned, closing his eyes and bowing his head as he endured pleasure like he'd never known before. <br>\r\n\"Joe...!\" Your little brother had touched himself once or twice, but it hadn't been anything like this.

Of course, you\u2019d be forgiven if you missed me, seeing as I was sitting in the lap of my kid brother Sean.  Ya see, he kinda overshadows anyone he\u2019s with, seeing as he\u2019s twenty feet tall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven\u2019t heard about us?  Well, let me tell you about how all this started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began three years ago, when I was twelve and Sean was ten.  We were riding in the back seat of our parents\u2019 Honda Accord, which our Mom was driving, coming back from a wedding of a friend of hers at work.  It was an icy night; snow had been falling for a few hours, and the plows and salt trucks hadn\u2019t gotten to the roads yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean and I were bugging each other in the back seat, as brothers usually do.  \u201cMom, Michael\u2019s crossing the line onto my side of the seat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, Sean's kicking me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned around, \u201cBoys, you better stop fighting, or I--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the car started to skid.  Mom turned around and tried to keep control, but couldn\u2019t.  The car spun off the road and into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that night was kinda hazy.  I remember waking up in the hospital with a splitting headache.  A doctor stood over me with a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Michael, my name is Dr. Parsons.  How are you feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up slowly, rubbing my eyes.  \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry not to move too much, Michael.  You have a slight concussion, and a few scratches and bruises, but other than that you\u2019re going to be fine with enough rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, you were in a car wreck.  Evidently your car lost control and skidded headlong into a tree.  Thank goodness you were wearing your seat belt; otherwise you might have been thrown from the car, and who knows what would have happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of my family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons checked her chart.  \u201cYour brother, Sean, is in the OR right now.  He\u2019s been banged up pretty bad, but we expect him to pull through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, and I noticed her gentle smile begin to drop.  \u201cWhat about my parents?\u201d I said.  \u201cAre they okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons placed her hands on mine.  \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Michael.

How are you feeling?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, no longer feeling dizzy.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel fine, I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood, good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and turned to Sean.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you look like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing alright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoc, I feel great!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nate said, as he finished the bowl and sat it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, well, I need to tell you boys something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She sat down on a chair in between our two beds.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth of you are going to be fine, physically.  Michael, your injuries were minor, and you should be fine to go in a few days.  Sean, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recovering nicely, but Dr. Nguyen noticed something during your surgery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your pituitary gland.  It seems to have been enlarged, probably from the trauma of the accident.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be threatening anything, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we should keep an eye on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy \u00e2\u0080\u0098pit-too-a-tary\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gland?  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sean said, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, simply put, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a part of your brain that controls a whole lot of stuff, like growth, development, blood pressure--things like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sean said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo does that mean, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bigger, that I will grow more?  Like become a giant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons chuckled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSean, we really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  To be frank, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anything like this has ever been seen before.  It could have no effect at all, or it could be life-changing.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to wait and see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean smiled, and I saw that he was looking to the ceiling, daydreaming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something else we have to talk about, boys.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried contacting any family members, but it seems like that might be impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, our parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were both only children, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have any family left alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons looked concerned.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there anyone you can think of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looked over to me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about great-uncle Eli?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Parsons\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes lit up.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat-uncle Eli? Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our dad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I explained.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kinda a hermit or something, lives all by himself somewhere in South Dakota.  Made a bunch of money in the sixties or seventies, but then up and disappeared.  Neither of us have met him.  Mom and Dad never talked about him, we only heard of him from our grandfather the year before he died.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sean said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be like this mad scientist.  Used to work with the Army, until they kicked him out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHmm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Parsons thought.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like the best place for a couple of adolescent boys to live.  Well, we should be able to find something.  Your parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wills are being examined, they probably specified what they wanted to happen.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let both of you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room, and I turned to look at Sean.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo whatcha thinkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, little bro?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean leaned back, still looking up at the ceiling.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dunno.  I mean, it sucks that mom and dad are gone.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scary that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re orphans now, but, for some reason, I just feel really optimistic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably just the drugs they have you on talking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad one of us feels that way.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna do, Sean.  Our lives are gonna be changed forever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean turned on his side and stared straight at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be a bad thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiled warmly, and, I had to admit, it did make me feel better.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMichael, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise each other that, no matter what happens, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always be there for each other.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always watch each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his hand out, reaching as far as he could out of the bed.  I looked at it, then up at his face, and I nodded.  I grabbed his hand.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPromise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe held each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands for a few seconds, then let them go.  Sean licked his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan, I could really go for another bowl of Jell-o.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He hit the nurse call button.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"BEGINNING FINAL LANDING PROCEDURES - STAGE ONE: REAWAKENING\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar opened his eyes, something that was surprisingly difficult. A disoriented feeling washed over him, not unlike what had happened a few months ago when he had stolen a bottle of beer from the market and chugged it all down at once. As he blinked several times and tried to focus his eyes, he noticed that he was in a very small, dimly lit, confined area, and he couldn't move his arms or legs. He started to shiver involuntarily, and he could see his breath. An uneasy feeling came over him, but he couldn't quite place the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAGE ONE COMPLETE - BEGINNING STAGE TWO: STABILIZING CABIN\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet to his right, his younger brother Caleb was already wide-eyed and anxious for the pods to open so he could finally get out and stretch his legs. He had experienced much less confusion and disorientation from the hibernation process than Skylar had, and quickly remembered why they were in this situation: they had been found guilty of a double homicide, something which they both knew was a load of bullshit but which they couldn't afford to hire a good enough defense against. As they were orphans and had already had a troubled record, they were given a new experimental sentence: expulsion from the planet. That's why they were on this small starship programed to take them to a planet several dozen light-years away: they were no longer welcome at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAGE TWO COMPLETE - BEGINNING STAGE THREE: RELEASING PRISONER RESTRAINTS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud hissing sound filled the air, causing Skylar to jump a little. He breathed a sigh of relief as he realized it was just the air pressure leveling out as his pod opened. As the hissing stopped, the glass quickly slid away, and he could feel a rush of fresh air slam into his face. The restraints around his arm and leg unclamped, and he gingerly climbed out of the pod onto the cabin floor, his muscles ginger from disuse. As he looked around, he realized where he was -- and began to remember why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skylar!\" Caleb called out, running up to his brother and throwing his arms around him, embracing him tightly. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Skylar grunted, knocked back a little by his more exuberant twelve-year-old brother. He didn't blame the kid, though. Even before the expulsion, the two were the only family they each had. It didn't matter that there was a four year gap separating them - they were the best of friends. And nothing could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm all right, Caleb,\" Skylar replied, patting his brother on the back and trying to reassure him. \"I'm just still having a hard time getting used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger boy nodded. \"I don't blame you. That's probably part of the punishment, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAGE THREE COMPLETE - BEGINNING STAGE FOUR: APPROACHING DESTINATION\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the mechanical voice said those words, the small ship they were on began to shake violently, knocking them both back against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Caleb cried out, fear evident in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I don't know!\" Skylar rushed to the lone computer display in the cabin, studying it furiously. \"I think we're entering the atmosphere of a planet. Hopefully this shaking won't last--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the shaking stopped, and they could hear a loud whistling coming from outside the ship. At the same time, their bodies began to feel slightly heavier, the planet's gravity compounding with the effects of the artificial gravity field of their ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight, Caleb!\" Skylar instructed, and both boys grabbed onto a couple of handles that were sticking out of the wall. After a few seconds that seemed like years, the ship came to a sudden and complete stop. The air was completely silent now, save for the heavy breathing of the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LANDING PROCEDURE COMPLETE. ALL PRISONERS MUST EVACUATE SHIP. SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE WILL COMMENCE IN TWO MINUTES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self destruct!\" Both boys looked at each other in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Skylar,\" Caleb grabbed his older brother by the arm, heading for the ship's airlock. \"We've got to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute and a half, Skylar and Caleb had both jumped from the ship's door to the ground two feet below, and they quickly ran as far as they could from it. Luckily, there were a safe distance away by the time the self-destruct sequence activated and the ship disappeared in a small explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Skylar said, shaking his head. \"I guess they really don't want us to go back. I hope this planet is as hospitable as they promised us.\" The two boys stopped to catch their breath again before turning to examine their surroundings. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skylar shielded his eyes from the somewhat harsh light of the sun and looked around. Things didn't look too different from their home planet. The sparse plant life situated among the rocks seemed strikingly similar. The landscape was rough and rocky, dirt and dust swirling around them in the light breeze. Caleb winced and covered his mouth, coughing heavily into his hands. Skylar immediately patted him on the back and pulled out a small flask of water. Caleb eagerly drank from it. When he was done, he wiped his mouth and said, \"Where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar ruffled Caleb's hair and said, \"Don't worry about it Cal. I figured we might need to have some supplies on us just in case those bastards back home were lying about how \"hospitable\" this place was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb frowned as he looked at the flask. \"Did you steal it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, don't worry about it.\" His voice was firmer, the tone indicating that there would be no more discussion. Caleb sighed and screwed the top back on the flask, shaking it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I drank too much...It's almost empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar took the flask back and held it up to his ear, shaking it slightly. The sound of water sloshing around inside indicated there was about a quarter of it left. \"Come on, let's look around. I'm sure we'll be able to find something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nodded and grabbed his brother's hand. The two brothers began to walk together along the rocky path, slowly making their way down what appeared to be a mountain. They were dressed in tight, form fitting space suits, dark blue in color, making them stand out amongst the grey rocks. Skylar looked around slightly nervously. There was no telling what kind of animals would be on this planet. The judge back home (could they even call it that anymore?) had been quite firm that, while the planet would be hospitable, with food,water, and shelter, they were still condemned criminals. This \"Prison Planet\" experiment (as it was called in all the media) had many supporters as well as detractors. Those who were for it argued that the planet would be a better place if all the most ruthless and evil criminals were forced to leave while those who were against it hated that their tax quixes were going to support an entire planet full of the worst the planet could offer. Skylar couldn't care less about any of that. All it meant to him was that his little brother and he were forced from the only home they had ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" Skylar thought to himself as he gripped Caleb's hand tightly. \"We never needed anyone but each other and we never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar was so deep in thought that it took several shakes of his arm by Caleb before he snapped back to attention. \"Huh? What's wrong Caleb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" He said, somewhat impatiently, pointing a something in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar looked and saw what appeared to be a small village, situated at the bottom of the mountain. Skylar was a bit surprised to see an entire town there, but just because they were the first people sent here, didn't mean they would be the last. The path they were currently on seemed to lead directly to the village. \"Well, I guess that's our new home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we actually get to sleep in a house?\" Caleb asked, sounding surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so.\" Skylar said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb couldn't help but smile. He had spent his whole life on the streets, sleeping in any shelter that they could find. To have an actual home to live in had been a luxury he didn't think he would be allowed! He picked up the pace, letting go of Skylar's hand and running a little ahead. \"Don't go running off!\" Skylar shouted, chasing after him. Caleb just giggled and ran on, jumping over rocks and sliding down some loose gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long to reach the village. Caleb got to the bottom of the mountain first, turning and crossing his arms triumphantly. \"I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't even racing shorty.\" Skylar said, ruffling Caleb's hair again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't call me shorty! I'm not short!\" Caleb said in a huff. Being undersized for his age (thanks to a lack of nutrition), his height was a bit of a sore point to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, sorry Cal.\" Skylar said, smiling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb tried to fix his hair as they walked along the main street of the village. There wasn't a lot to it; a few houses, what appeared to be a convenience store, a clothing store, and not much else. The houses were all one story affairs. Peeking inside the window of one of them, it appeared they were only three rooms: a big living space, a bathroom, and a bedroom. The furniture inside was sparse and there didn't appear to be any extra amenities like television. Still, it was more than the brothers had had before. \"Maybe this won't be so bad...\" He thought to himself, cautiously optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb wiggled the doorknob, but it wouldn't budge. \"I think it's locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets just keep walking and see what we find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers continued down the road, testing the doors on the various houses only to find all of them locked. The convenience and clothing stores were both open but supplies were limited. Caleb immediately pulled a bunch of different outfits from down off their hangers, wanting to try a bunch of them on. Skylar stopped him and said, \"Just take one or two for now. We still don't know where we're living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nodded and chose two outfits he liked, Skylar doing the same. The convenience store had a few staples (bread, dairy, meat, etc.) all stored in freezers. They left the food and drinks alone for now, moving to the last house in the village. There was a key taped to the door here. Skylar took it down and unlocked the door, stepping inside the house. Caleb ran ahead of him, looking in all the rooms. \"Cool, bunk beds! I want the top one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar dropped their clothes off on the bottom bunk and said, \"Come on, lets change and get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed uneventfully. They ate a small dinner, looked around the village and the forest area surrounding the village, and when it got dark they went back inside and locked the door. Skylar couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. There were no animals around at all. Everything was strangely silent. All the food and clothes and shelter...it was too convenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when Caleb let out a big yawn, rubbing his eyes. He tried to hide it, but Skylar saw and immediately said, \"Bed time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb groaned and got to his feet. \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed up into the top bunk and crawled under the covers, falling asleep almost immediately. Skylar turned off the lights and got into his own bed, staring up at the bottom of his brother's bed, listening to his steady breathing. He was surprisingly tired himself. He had intended to stay awake and plan out their next day, but he fell asleep within minutes.</span></div></div>",

He giggled, and more splintering and cracking could be heard from that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat the fuck could that be?\u201d Skylar whispered to himself. The scientists who had given them the minimum preparations for this trip had promised them the planet would be deserted until they got there, so hearing other voices that spoke the same language as them was the last thing he was expecting -- much less to have them be so roaring. He quickly slid out of the bed, standing up and turning back towards the top bunk. \u201dCal?\u201d He wasn't surprised to see his younger brother still asleep; a life of growing up on the run and having to sleep in the streets and other noisy places had given the young boy an uncanny ability to sleep through practically anything, something that Skylar's body never adjusted to. He considered giving him a good shake, but he decided to try and find out what was going on first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly stepping towards the bedroom window, he peered outside, not noticing anything out of the ordinary at first. The neighborhood, or whatever it was, didn't have any street lamps or any other artificial sources of light, so the only illumination came from the stars and the twin moons up above. Luckily, one of the moons was full tonight, so that allowed him to see decently well. Still, because of where the bedroom was situated on the backside of the house, the angle he was looking out did not give him a clear view of the street at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he made his way towards the front of the house. The shades on the front windows had been drawn before they had arrived at the house, which thankfully concealed him, for now at least. As he approached them, though, he could see shadows and outlines moving outside -- large figures, from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that's not the house they chose to sleep in,\" the older boy's voice from outside said. \"Otherwise we just hiked all the way out here for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" the younger boy replied, \"this one doesn't have any furniture or anything in it. I'm pretty sure this is one of the ones just here for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar placed a hand on the opening of a window shade, pulling back one side slightly so he could have a look outside. His jaw fell open in shock as he saw two boys standing in front of a half-destroyed house on the other side of the street - but not just any boys. These two stood at least twenty feet tall, rising above the roofs of the houses around them. Skylar stared at them, trying to comprehend what he was seeing. Their faces appeared more or less like boys from his own planet. One boy looked to be around fourteen, with olive-colored skin and deep brown eyes, though his hair was a striking iridescent violet and reached down to his shoulders. He had an extraordinarily muscled physique, like that of a bodybuilder; his white short-sleeve t-shirt and red shorts seemed to fit his form exactly, even going as far as to reveal a noticeable bulge between his legs. The boy next to him, who was brushing himself off from the debris of the wall he had crushed, looked to be several years younger, around Caleb's age, and had very pale skin and fiery red hair, which was short and spiky, and bright green eyes that seemed to glow in the moonlight. Skylar did notice a series of ridges down the back of his neck, noticeable but nothing too scary or exotic. This boy was surprisingly taller than his companion by a foot or so, but had a much skinnier build -- still impressive for his apparent age, something that was more like a late teenage swimmer's build, made all the more noticeable by the fact that his clothes seemed not to fit as well as his friend's, leaving most of his stomach exposed and only covering less than half of his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just make sure you're careful, all right, Zalus?\" the older-looking boy said. \"I hope you're not that clumsy when you're playing with your brother. You might kill him, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Zalus's eyebrows furrowed. \"Don't even joke about that kind of thing, Markis. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, whatever,\" Markis rolled his eyes. \"We've still got the matter of finding the two new arrivals before sunrise. We've searched all the other empty settlements, so they have to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar didn't like what he was hearing at all. Too many questions were running through his head on what all of this meant and how any of this could be possible, but the number one priority he now had was to make sure Caleb was safe and for them to both get to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran back to the bedroom, trying to remain in as calm a mindset as he could, considering the circumstances. \"Caleb! Wake up!\" He continued to speak in a whisper, but tried to be loud enough for his brother to hear him. \"We've got to get out of--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached towards the top bunk, he realized that it was empty! Whirling around, he cried out, \"Caleb?! Where are you?!\" When only silence answered him, he started to search the rest of the house, praying that his brother was still okay.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skylar began to tear around the house, trying to find his brother. He wasn't anywhere to be seen! There weren't a lot of places to hide in the small house. Under the bed, in the bathroom,behind the shower curtain, in a closet, but that was it. Skylar ran back to the window to make sure the giants weren't getting any closer to where he was and he did a double take as he saw Caleb running up to the one apparently called \"Zalus\". \"CALEB!\" Skylar shouted, opening the door and charging out into the night. Both Zalus and Markis looked down in surprise as Caleb and Skylar ran over to them. After so many hours of searching it was a bit of a shock when the objects of their search found them instead! Skylar grabbed Caleb around the arm when they were just a few feet in front of Zalus'...well, feet and and dragged him backward, drawing a little yelp from the younger boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Skylar, what did you do that for?\" He said, frowning up at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, you can't just go running outside when you see something like THAT!\" He shouted, pointing at Zalus. \"They could be dangerous! Now come on let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Zalus said, crossing his arms and tilting his head with a frown. \"I'm not a \"that\" I'm a person just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Zalus, you're not. These two aren't from your planet.\" Markis said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Are you sure?\" Zalus said, bending down and leaning in closer, those bright, almost glowing eyes studying Caleb and Skylar curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Markis said, grabbing Skylar without a second thought. \"Look, see?\" He turned the teen over and pointed to the back of his neck. \"No gravity regulators.\" He turned Skylar over and pointed at his eyes. \"No night vision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus rubbed the back of his neck and said, \"Well, I GUESS...I was hoping I could see someone from my own planet again, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkis smiled and patted the younger giant on the back. \"I know, I was too. But I'm starting to think this is a one pair per planet kind of deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should take them to Uther anyway.\" Zalus said, straightening back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkis straightened up as well, still holding Skylar in his hand, his fingers (which were the size of tree trunks) wrapped securely around Skylar, holding him tight enough to show who was in charge here. Skylar was too dazed from his sudden capture to really do much except sit still. The two giants were about to start moving when Zalus felt something beat on his toes. He frowned and looked down, his expression softening when he saw Caleb using his fists to attack the giant's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let my brother go you big jerk! He didn't do anything to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus gently picked Caleb up, the small boy trembling as he was suddenly grabbed, and said, \"Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you OR your brother. We're just going to take you to a place where you'll be safe. You won't have to be alone either! Doesn't that sound great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop babying the kid Zalus!\" Markis said, already several feet away. \"Come on, I want to get at least SOME sleep tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus sighed and said, \"Well, we'd better go. My name is Zalus by the way.\" He extended his finger to Caleb. \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb...\" he said, grabbing the finger with his whole hand and shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\" Zalus said energetically, holding Caleb like you would a mouse. \"I'm going to hold you like this in case I trip, okay? When I landed here with my brother one of my gravity regulators got damaged.\" He pressed lightly down on one of the ridges on the back of his neck, this one smaller and slightly misshapen when compared to the others. He winced and said, \"It hasn't really healed yet and my e-equi..um...equilibum...equi...well I fall down a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb giggled and said, \"Okay, just don't crush me or anything, okay?\" He was adapting to this situation much quicker than Skylar was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus and Caleb chatted as they walked. Markis, on the other hand, was much quieter. Skylar wiggled around a bit, his heart pounding as he tried not to imagine what might become of him and his brother in the hands of these strange giants, and said, \"Where are you taking us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? We're taking you to our city. Uther will fill you in on all the details and get you...situated.\" He grinned as he said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar shuddered. Just what the heck did he mean by that? He put the question from his mind for now and said, \"What is this place anyway? I thought we were the only ones here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkis chuckled and said, \"We all think that! That's what they want us to think for some reason. But there's quite a few of us. All of us in pairs, one older brother, one younger brother. Zalus and I are younger brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your older brother must be...\" Skylar said, gulping a bit, unable to finish that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkis laughed and said, \"He's actually not much taller than you, though he's got WAY bigger muscles! Our planet has some ridiculous gravity! If we didn't have bulky bodies we'd be stuck in place, unable to move. I tell you, I feel as light as a feather on this planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar fell silent as he contemplated this information. He hadn't expected there to be such a severe height disparity between the brothers. Was Markis just a freak of nature, so to speak, on his planet? Or maybe it was some weird backwards biology where you were born a giant and slowly grew smaller as you got older? Or...maybe he was part of some experiment? It was impossible to say. This whole situation was beyond his comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was passed in silence. Within an hour or so, they had arrived at their destination.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they finally reached the top of the last hill, Zalus and Markis stopped for a moment to catch their breath. Looking past the edge of the hand he was being carried in, Skylar saw that down in the valley below there looked to be a large village, almost the size of a city, with dozens if not hundreds of houses spread out along several streets. Each of these streets were dotted with perfectly-functioning street lamps, and they seemed to all diverge at the same point far in the distance, arranged in such a way that they formed the spokes of a wheel-like formation around a central hub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is this place?\" Skylar asked, his eyes fixated on the lights of the town below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus took a deep breath and smiled. \"This is your new home. We simply call it 'The Hub,' since it's where everyone who lands here ends up, eventually. Well, almost everyone. Except--\" He was cut off by Markis noticeably clearing his throat and shooting him a stern look. After a few awkward moments passed, he simply said, \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of worry gnawed at Skylar, but he didn't have time for any follow up questions, as they started moving down the hill into the village. Markis brought a finger to his lips, indicating that they should stay as quiet as possible, and so the other three boys complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they passed through the village, Skylar noticed that the size of the houses seemed to vary wildly. They all seemed to be noticeably bigger than the houses back on their home planet, or even where they had stayed the night before, and they seemed to be getting bigger as they got closer to the center of the town. The first ones they came across seemed to be around thirty feet tall, looking like they might fit a boy around Markis' size, while the biggest stretched much taller overhead, at least a hundred feet tall, if not more. And it wasn't like they were multi-story houses; no, they all were single-level, they just had windows and doors that were noticeably bigger. \"If there are boys here that are as big as those houses seem to indicate\u2026\" Skylar worried to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, though, the streets were deserted. Being the middle of the night, Skylar assumed that most of the residents were sleeping, except for those out on patrol like Zalus and Markis (if there were any others like that). Of course, he had no idea how many people actually lived here, or if all or even any of these houses actually had people in them. Markis had mentioned that everyone here were pairs of brothers -- did that mean that there were no adults? An interesting idea, Skylar thought, but one that could mean trouble, and a lot of it, if things went out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they arrived at the center of the village, where a huge tower, almost like a fortress, loomed above them. \"This is Uther's house,\" Zalus whispered. \"You'll stay here tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Caleb exclaimed, in awe at the imposing structure in front of them. \"Is he your king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZalus chuckled, and shook his head as Markis pushed open the huge wooden door part of the way and stepped through, Zalus following behind. \"No, not quite. He's just the biggest among us, right now anyway, and so he gets the biggest house. It just so happens that house is also part of the central complex with all the laboratories and holding cells and all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabs? Holding cells? Skylar didn't like the sound of that one bit, and the fact that the entry hall they were in looked like a dimly lit dungeon didn't help. \"Now just one minute,\" he said, his voice growing louder with excitement and a little bit of anger. \"What are you doing with us? Are we your prisoners or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please keep your voice, down!\" Markis hissed at him, then continued in a hushed voice. \"No, nothing like that. Once you've met Uther and the two of you are ready, you and Caleb will be given a house just like the rest of us and join our society. But we can't do that just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell not?\" Skylar demanded, trying to sound forceful without being too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because--\" Markis shook his head, trying to suppress a smile that was forming. \"Well, isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't what obvious?\" Caleb asked, trying to match his brother's indignation but still sounding eager and excited, his eyes sparkling in the reflection of the light coming from the torch on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkis rolled his eyes, while Zalus stifled a chuckle. \"You're not big enough yet, tiny!\" He gave Caleb a poke with a single finger, nearly knocking the small boy over in his palm. \"Don't worry, though, that'll change soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Skylar or Caleb could ask any more questions, the sound of footsteps approaching caused both Markis and Zalus to stand up straighter and face the archway at the opposite end of the entry hall. They both held out their hands in front of them, making sure that Skylar and Caleb were both clearly visible. As the footsteps got closer, they grew louder and louder; whoever was coming was much bigger than either Markis or Zalus. Skylar gulped, hoping that whoever it was would at least be as friendly as the two had been.</span></div></div>",
