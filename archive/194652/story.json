Finally she decided that telling him her name couldn't hurt anything...so, she smiled up at him and said, \"Well, my name is Jenny...and....I hope I'll run into you again sometime.\"  \"Well, you will if you decide to take advantage of the special they're running at that massage parlour you saw advertised back there, I'm the certified massage therapist.\"  Oooooooh, Jenny smiled to herself...now she KNEW she would have to look into THIS....\r<br>\nAs her gaze unwittingly shifted to his hands, she thought of the warm little shiver that she'd gotten when he'd helped her off the train and ever so slightly squeezed her hand while he'd been holding it.

Perhaps it was my sense of adventure, freed by that little squeeze of my hand that had sent me reeling.

I went from swoon to deep swoon to shudder and my lust got the best of me (and him) the moment he touched the back of my legs, just above the knee.  \"You don't really think I need this towel, do you...\"  \"It's there only for the client's modesty.  For the massage, it's rather a burden...\"  \"Then let's concentrate on the massage,\" I said, and in one motion removed the towel and swiveled my legs around to face him.  He slowly parted my legs, his magic hands descending my thighs, now moist with my \"effusions\".  I had already experienced orgasm, and we hadn't even made love yet.

My back arched back in the extreme pleasure Robert gave my body. Yes, my whole entire body. Robert was great. He grabbed my butt and squeezed it while he was still eating my sweet spot. I moaned loudly and had an intense orgasm that lasted a few seconds. I could really tell that his tounge was full of much more magically pleasure than his hands. We quickly moved to my bedroom, and Robert stripped completely naked. I lie on my bed, and he covers my whole body with his. We started kissing again, and he slipped his bone inside me. I told him to stop for a few seconds while I grabbed a condom out of my drawer. Robert threw off the wrapper containing the condom and quickly put it on. Robert was just as eager to have sex as I was. He slipped inside me again and we had the most intense sex I had ever experienced. We moved into a different position causing me to sit on his lap. I closed my legs and rode him hard and fast. For the next half hour we had sex in that position. After another intense and extensive orgasm(or should i say orgasms)I stood up off the bed, and Robert sat on the edge. I got on my knees and grabbed his upper legs. I looked at him seductively and that put my face in his lap sucking on his hard, long cock. After 5 minutes of sucking his dick, he cummed in my mouth, and on my face. We just couldn't leave eachother, I washed my face real quick, and met him in the living room with the tv and vcr. I slipped a video in called \"The Extreme Pleasure\". The horniest porn video I owned. We lied on the couch while the movie started. I sat on has cock and closed my legs again, and him hard and long once again. The movie had started and two very beautiful blondes were \"getting to know eacother better\" while the were licking and touching eachother. We were having so much fun together, so much fun that the movie had finished and an extra hour had passed. We had also gotten to move into 5 new positions, one that I had learned from Kama Sutra, and another was ever so famous goddy-style. I knew that it was time for him leave, but before I did I got his number, and invited him over for another \"massage\". He left and two hours later...</span></div></div>",

The best ones always seem to be taking their work home with them.\"  Jenny smiled at this  wonderfully handsome (how had she missed it before?) man across the aisle from her.  \"Ah, there, that's better.\" Robert smiled back.  Jenny took a deep breath and made a quick decision to throw caution to the wind.  \"So, tell me more about this job\" she said.  Then she frowned as she thought about all the loose ends she would have to tie up at the office.  Gosh, was she really considering quitting her job?  All of a sudden, she thought of the complications that would arise working for such a handsome boss.  And here she didn't even know anything about this guy, besides what he'd told her.  Could she take him at face value, or not?  \"Oh...well\" Robert said, clearing his throat, \"I realize this whole idea would require a little research and consideration on your part.\"  He had been watching the emotions on her face.  Wow, did they show, he thought, smiling to himself.  At the same time, he realized he'd perhaps better take a step back, so to speak, if he was going to get a chance to get to know this lovely girl.  And boy, did he want to, he realized all of a sudden, in a moment of surprise at himself.  And now the train was coming to a stop...his stop, and he found himself wishing it were a longer way.  He rose from his seat, and handing her one of his business cards, said, \"Well, do look into it, if you'd like.\"  Thinking that was all the more he dared to say at the moment.  Jenny smiled and accepted the card, tucking it into her purse.</span></div></div>",

They go to his highrise apartment building in the heart of New York City, and go in for coffee.

Placing one hand softly on her cheek, letting his fingers penetrate into the lovely softness of her hair, he reached for one of the bites of cake and brought it to rest on her lips, his fingers slightly probing into her mouth.  Even as her breathing became more labored and ragged, she giggled and playfully bit his fingers before accepting the morsel.  Then she picked up a piece of the cake and started to feed it to him, but smiled as she held it back a little, saying \"Now don't feel like you have to bite back...at least not too hard!\"  Robert grabbed her wrist gently and took the cake from her himself, and keeping her hand there after he'd finished eating the cake, he placed each of her fingers alternately into his mouth, making sure absolutely no frosting could be left on them as he sucked them clean.  \"O.K., I won't bite too hard,\" he said as he turned her palm to his lips and kissed it softly.  Jenny couldn't keep herself from trembling as he then let his tongue escape from his mouth to stroke and press into her palm with it, making tiny little circles.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she felt his moustache tickling its way up her arm as he placed kiss after kiss on it, marking, so it seemed,  every half inch of the way up, Jenny let herself lean backwards and allowed herself to be swallowed up by the deliciousness of it all.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRobert paused to smile at her, realizing she was assenting for him to go as far as he would like.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSo it was that the next morning, Jenny awoke to find herself in a strange appartment, in the arms of a man she'd only met yesterday.  To her consternation, common sense was annoying her now, fighting with the feelings of total satisfaction she had experienced the night before.  What would happen next, she wondered.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJust then, the phone rang, waking Robert.  First smiling at her and giving her a good morning kiss, he reached over her to pick up the cordless phone that was resting on a nightstand.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hello,\" he spoke into the phone as he stroked her hair.  She propped herself up on her elbow and looked at him questioningly, but his smile turned into a worried look as he got out of the bed and walked out of the room with the phone.</span></div></div>",

Dressing himself, slowly and with care, he seems to have forgotten her for a moment.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sinks back into bed, pulling up the covers.  Jenny begins to wonder if perhaps, she'd made the wrong choice.  What on earth could it be?  What could they want with him?  A thousand dreadful possibilities filled her consciousness in that short time it took him to dress.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut he returns to her, leaning carefully across the bed and takes her hand.  Kissing it gently, he strokes her arm and looks up at her with large beautiful eyes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll only be a moment, I promise.  I hope this doesn't upset you, for surely I can explain everything upon my return,\" he sooths her.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Spend as much time as you like here.  There is a robe behind the door and feel free to take something from my wardrobe for now.  Make yourself at home,\" he leans in and kisses her confusion creased forehead.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do not worry. I'll be back soon.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd with that he leaves, taking with him his watch, briefcase from near the door, and his cell phone and keys on the way out. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJenny leans up on her arm and blinks at the situation.  How quickly he had spoken, so softly it smoothed all worry from her.  But now, in his absence, the reality of this begins to sneak back in.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe rises slowly, stretching and looking around.  Taking the robe and tying it carefully she treads softly on the light carpeting to the living room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd now she has a moment to think.</span></div></div>",

The four gorgeous men were gently massaging the bodies of the four women.
