Konoha was the same old Konoha, the great stone faces were still the same as ever (despite the addition of Kakashi), people milled out about the same way they always did, at least Ichiraku was still Ichiraku. Deciding that if he had nothing better to do he'd at least enjoy some ramen he ducked in to the familiar shop. \"Hey pops,\" Naruto said to Teuchi \"get me the usual!\" After Naruto ate his fill and was on his way the relief that his pleasant distraction offered was already fading fast. Determined yet again to find some way to alleviate. his boredom Naruto pressed on down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the villagers were happy to see him and the village <i>was</i> safe and he knew he should be grateful, and he was, but as he walked along Naruto couldn't help but wish for something to do or someone to fight. Eventually his mindless wandering led him to the training fields where he figured he may as well get in a work out. Creating an obscene amount of clones all of the Naruto's proceeded to undergo all sorts exercises. An hour or so of time had been killed training and when he released the jutsu he saw he'd amassed a small flock of fresh academy graduates watching him with starry eyes, Naruto blushed at this and waved to the group (of which several promptly fainted). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt a bit dejected as all he'd really managed to do was make himself sore and sweaty, but vowing not to lose to something as lame as boredom Naruto pressed onward back into town. Passing through the gates Naruto had a rush of epiphany as he looked at the street before him. It was so <i>obvious</i> if he was bored he could just...</span></div></div>",

Landing at the residence's main entrance Naruto began furiously knocking and was met with, what felt like an eternity later, a loud shout from what sounded like Kiba \"JESUS CHRIST I'M COMING!\" Naruto wisely took that as the cue to stop knocking, and after what felt like another eternity Kiba finally opened the door, clad only in a tank top and boxer shorts with an obvious drool mark running down his face. \"Well? What's the big emergency?!\" Kiba asked exasperatedly \"It better be good if it interrupted my nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well...uh...I just thought I'd to see if you wanted to hang out\" Naruto admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suck.\" Kiba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sorry I'll go an-\" Naruto started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. Come in.\" Kiba grumbled. Naruto's heart momentarily fluttered as he briefly thought he'd screwed up his one opportunity, before he followed Kiba in. However the instant Naruto passed Kiba he said \"Jeez man, you reek!\" clutching his nose in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No I don't!\" Naruto retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not to your nose, but to me you smell like a pool of sweat and dirt.\" Kiba gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohhh,\" Naruto said dumbly \"I worked out before I came over here, that must be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care. Get clean\" Kiba muffled behind his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? What?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the hall, to the left. Shower. Use it.\" the Inuzuka managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"USE. IT.\" Kiba interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Naruto caved \"You big baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than a little weird that after visiting a friend Naruto found himself bathing, but here he was at least Kiba was gonna hang out with him still. Turning the water off Naruto stepped out off the shower to find his clothes were gone \"What the fuck?\" Naruto said to himself as he wrapped himself in a towel. \"Hey Kiba,\" Naruto loudly griped \"where the hell did my stuff go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stank almost as bad as you did so it's in the wash.\" Kiba answered from the sofa, now wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, \"You can wear these until they're done, they're a little old but they should fit.\" Kiba said tossing Naruto a pair of sweatpants. Before either had realized what had happened Naruto let go of his towel to catch the pants. \"....\" \"....\" \"...and you think you're gonna be Hokage?\" Kiba jabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, taking this as a challenge, placed both hands on his now bare hips and declared \"Do you think this anything less than the body of a Hokage?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's markings were mercifully hiding his faint blush when he said \"Actually I just meant it shouldn't take you two hands to catch a pair of pants.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Naruto said before his whole buddy turned red and he ducked back into the bathroom. After regaining his composure Naruto slid the sweatpants on which, as Kiba warned, were a bit snug, all except for one area, the crotch. Less then thrilled with finding out how he \"measured up\" to Kiba, Naruto grumbled to himself \"That ass-hat could have at least lent me a shirt.\" wanting desperately to think about <i>anything</i> else. Sucking it up Naruto left the bathroom and headed towards the living room where he saw Kiba nervously fidgeting \"weird\" he thought before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence for a moment before Naruto finally asked \"Soooooo what do you wanna do today?\"</span></div></div>",

Making his way back down the hallway he saw the bathroom door, check, followed by the next door which led to a nice looking bedroom, maybe Hana's? maybe Kiba's mother's? either way it was far to well kept to be Kiba's. The next door appeared to be quite scuffed and scratched, well that's not to strange considering they <i>do</i> raise ninja hounds, turning the knob Naruto was assaulted by the smell of <i>trash</i> and <i>dude</i>, found Kiba's room. Daring to venture further into the room Naruto had to stop carefully around the mess, not unlike his own room, he found the room was littered with clothes, meals of a time passed, and...bodybuilder magazines? \"Definitely making a note of that for later\" Naruto said with a devilish smirk. Continuing down the hallway Naruto found one final door before the hall ended in a large open room, opening the last door Naruto found a bedroom utterly filled with weight machines. Momentarily confused Naruto then remembered his occasional brief encounters with the head of the Inuzuka clan, \"Maybe it's best not to go in the room of such a...fierce woman\" Naruto thought before walking the rest of the hall. Looking around Naruto found the hallway had terminated leading into a large kitchen/dining space, clearly evidenced by the fridge, stove, and litany of cabinets he, wildly, assumed were full of dog treats and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way across the room Naruto found another hallway on the other side, clearly linking the home into it's circular shape, but this hall had only one door. Entering the room Naruto what found what must be the largest area in the complex, with several kennels in the back, and filled with an array of training equipment for the dogs. His curiosity satisfied, Naruto was about to head out the door when the smallest and faintest of glints in the corner caught his eye. When he checked the corner he found an, almost entirely hidden, cabinet filled with several identical bottles of...food pills? Pocketing a bottle to ask Kiba about later, Naruto proceeded down the hall winding up in the entryway/ living room again. With the pills positively burning a hole in his pocket Naruto sat on the floor in front of Kiba's sleeping form and waited. About a minute passed before Kiba began to look annoyed, sensing Naruto's presence, and opened his eyes angrily snapping \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" Naruto asked, unfazed and holding up the bottle of pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a flip had been switched, Kiba snatched the bottle from Naruto and jumped to the other side of the room \"Where did you get these?!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In, in, in, in the dog's training room.\" Naruto stuttered, taken aback. \"What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath Kiba explained \"These are special food pills that only we Inuzuka's are supposed to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, go on.\" Naruto pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're given to the puppies to help them grow.\" Kiba continued \"Now please drop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, clearly having no such intention, asked \"If that's it than why'd you freak out so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I swear that's all the more there is to it,\" Kiba insisted \"the rules are just very strict. Humans are <b><i>never</i></b> allowed to take one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why not?\" Naruto asked unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know they're just not!\" Kiba said, becoming annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's find out!\" Naruto said, eager to try something stupid, \"They can't be <i>that</i> dangerous if they're for puppies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no!\" Kiba said, turning away to return the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Naruto huffed \"I just though you were supposed to be a dog ninja not a chicken ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that...</span></div></div>",

Told you it was no big deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Kiba said, feeling slightly queezy, but resolved not to let on. \"Let's just play some cards or something,\" he suggested setting the bottle down and fishing through a drawer for a deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Naruto agreed excitedly, ready to actually <i>do</i> something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they walked to the table in the Inuzuka's living room Kiba suddenly collapsed, groaning with pain. Naruto raced to his side, gripped by alarm when he discovered Kiba's body was radiating an absurd amount of heat. Lost for words or solutions Naruto was about to try and locate Sakura or Grandma Tsunade when the heat abruptly abated and Kiba assured him he'd be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill somewhat apprehensive, Naruto accepted Kiba's word at face value and the two went to the table as previously intended. Kiba began shuffling, deciding they'd be playing poker, saying \"Alright this will just be basic Hold 'Em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what are we betting?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Kiba said laying down the hole cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How about clothes?\" Naruto suggested after a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really wanna play strip poker?\" Kiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big deal? We're both guys so it's not like it'll be weird or anything,\" Naruto babbled, praying he hadn't blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That works for me,\" Kiba said confidently \"I just meant you've only got one piece of clothing before you bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...maybe I'll go see if my stuff is done,\" Naruto said beginning to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit your ass back down Uzumaki,\" Kiba barked \"you don't get to propose a strip game than go put clothes on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but, but,\" Naruto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing! I-\" just then Kiba's body let out a load groan and his eyes appeared to glaze over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled after his previous episode Naruto asked Kiba \"Are you sure your ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, definitely,\" Kiba said with a pleasured moan before the room became filled with all kinds of cracking and stretching noises. It took only a moment for the pair to see what was happening as Kiba's body began gradually rising higher. Naruto stared dumbfounded at his friend as the dog ninja couldn't help but pant with the pleasurable exertion he now felt. Kiba's bones were continuously cracking and warping, creating new space for his new frame, as his skin audibly stretched out to meet it's new demands, and his muscles appeared to be in a constant state of \"pump\" as more and more bulk loaded itself on his already sculpted physique. Before long a new sound joined the cacophony of growth as his clothes began to groan with tears of defeat as Kiba's shirt began to split up the back. His shorts fared only slightly better because of the material, but when the inevitable tear came Naruto learned his former classmate preferred to go commando as the split grew and grew until the pants simply fluttered to the ground. Now exposed in all it's glory Naruto got a look at the beast that had made quite an...<i>impression</i> in the sweatpants he now wore as it continually lengthened and thickened, benefiting both from the pill's effects and Kiba's arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust settled and the growth ceased Kiba stood and appraised his new body, feeling the freshly blossomed muscle and brushing aside the tatters of his shirt. \"Oh yeah...\" Kiba purred running his hands all along his new body, coated head to toe in a generous amount of hair, and taking stock of the fact his head was <i>just</i> shy of the ten foot ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he'd been forgotten Naruto sat for a moment similarly admiring Kiba's daunting new stature as well as deep down finding he had something that felt like...appreciation maybe...but <i>far</i> stronger for his friend's new visage. Another minute had passed before Naruto cleared his throat and joked \"So I guess that let's you out of the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Kiba looked down to his companion and in a rush remembered his surroundings. \"Guess so,\" he admitted \"but I'd say we both won on this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shitting...\" Naruto said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Kiba had, understandably energized, insisted on cooking for Naruto and wasn't taking no for an answer which suited Naruto just fine, he'd already been to Ichiraku's once today and money was a little tight, and whether he'd admit it or not he was more than fine with Kiba's new look and state of undress. When dinner was ready though Naruto began questioning just how grateful he really was when Kiba offered him a plate of...something...gray. After working his way through the meal, all while Kiba devoured three servings for himself, Naruto said, not sure what to do with himself, \"Well, I guess I'll get my stuff and head out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Kiba rebutted \"You were probably gonna stay over anyway so why should you go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just thought that after all the...that you would...\" Naruto floundered \"Besides you probably are sick of having to be...you know...of being...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Naked? If you haven't picked up on it yet I don't care,\" Kiba said, gesturing to himself \"Frankly I kind of like being naked so I'm good as long as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...than...I guess...there's no problem,\" Naruto concluded, his heart fluttering involuntarily, \"But I probably should get my stuff out of the washer by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you know where it's at right?\" Kiba asked, not needing an answer, as he gathered the plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto reached the Inuzuka's washing machine he was surprised to hear it was still on, and it was grinding rather angrily. Worried for the fate of one of his signature orange outfits Naruto opened the toploader and was instantly made aware of the problems the machine had been facing. \"YO DOGBREATH!\" Naruto shouted angrily as he stormed back to the dining room, soaked belongings in hand \"Care to explain this?!\" he fumed producing the tattered remains of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.....\" Kiba said taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh nothing! You put my shuriken holster in the wash!\" Naruto ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops?\" Kiba offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah \"oops,\" Naruto fumed, \"that was one of my favorite jackets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have...like...a ton of them?\" Kiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point...\" Naruto huffed, finally cooling down after blowing off some steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you really want I'll be you a new one short stuff,\" Kiba teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it!\" Naruto snapped, coals stoked anew \"You may have gotten taller, but I can still knock you on your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, you're a little badass and all that,\" Kiba jabbed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just tell you?!\" Naruto said shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're so cute when you're mad,\" Kiba poked the bear again, \"besides it's late and I want to get to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I'll...I'll uh...I'll just crash on the couch...\" Naruto said having lost his wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Kiba boomed. \"My bed's big enough for both of us,\" he said, knowing it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I. I, I, I...\" Naruto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that, come on,\" Kiba said dragging Naruto behind him. When they got to the room Kiba began kicking litter around to clear a path to the bed before turning to Naruto and, having made up some schtick to fuck with his friend, said \"The only rule in Kiba's room is that no one's allowed to wear more than Kiba.\" Naruto promptly turned bright red but before he could argue Kiba stopped him saying \"Now no arguing. Here I'll even help,\" and he actually did dare to start pulling down Naruto's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">.....you know I could knock you out for this.....</font>\" Naruto mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why haven't you,\" Kiba teased, before leaving his friend just as bare as himself. \"See you think this is just as fun as I do,\" he chided when he found Naruto completely erect behind the sweatpants before showing of his own boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then clambered atop the bed that was barely large enough to hold Kiba let alone Naruto and were pressed together as tightly as could be...</span></div></div>",

Nearly an hour of this though was beginning to dampen Naruto's spirits as time after time the village's shadowy corners proved to be filled not with secrets, but a simple lack of sunlight. \"Damn it,\" Naruto huffed kicking a stone aimlessly into a patch of grass, to his surprise though the stone struck something that sounded distinctly wooden. \"What do we have here?\" Naruto asked no one in particular, interest piqued by this out of place sound as he began inspecting the area where the stone landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock Naruto found a hidden hatch that bore the Uzumaki crest \"What in the...\" Naruto trailed off as he ventured down into this mysterious bunker.

As the ninja looked around the room he found himself completely bewildered by what all this apparently important junk was or why it was even important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kurama decided to make his opinion known as he spoke with an uncharacteristic fascination \"Naruto, do you know what you just found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just looks like a bunch of junk...\" Naruto said to Kurama sounding unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot,\" the fox chastised, \"This is the Uzumaki's long lost vault, who knows what kind of secrets are down here kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound really impressed by all this crap,\" Naruto chuckled, not used to the fox being so interested in...well...anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it twerp!\" Kurama snapped, then, as if karma in motion, Naruto tripped over some clutter and had the life scared out of him when a strange puppet fell on him, causing him to scream like a little girl. \"Suits you right for laughing,\" Kurama huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it, what's so special about all this Kurama?\" Naruto asked, dusting himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you actually read one of the scrolls instead of just staring at them you'd see,\" Kurama pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, don't get your tails in a knot,\" Naruto said as he approached an ornate case that housed three elaborate looking scrolls. </span></div></div>",

Although with there was a few lines of text that red, \"Use this and puppet to give one who is bound to another their own body. However, the one who has the bound inside of them must not remove their hands from the scroll while the process is being done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after reading the scroll Naruto found himself just blinking at it a few times before he commented, \"Okay, so what does all of this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't you do what it says and find out?\" Kurama suggested, from inside the young man's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure, why the heck not.\" The young ninja replied, to which he then did what the scroll had instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once he had put both the scroll and his hands onto the puppet that was laying on the floor Naruto found his eyes widening along with an odd feeling in the pit of stomach as he felt the nine tailed fox leave the inner most part of his mind. He then watched as the orange colored chakra leave his body and going into the body of the puppet. This caused him to grit his teeth a bit and become a bit anger as he felt he was being tricked by the tailed beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these feelings were quickly pushed to the side when he the orange furred nine tailed fox's voice before he left his body completely when he told him, \"Hey, no need to get upset, kid. I may have suggested that you take a look at the scrolls. But even I wasn't expecting this. But you don't need to worry about me attacking anyone or any village. Because now that I've got my own body all I want to live in peace. So I guess I'll see you soon, kid. But just so there's no hard feelings I'll leave you a small amount of my chakra for you to use in any battles that you may have to take part in later on in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Naruto's eyes widen again as he saw the red scroll start to glow brighter and brighter. Then out of nowhere a huge blast of smoke came out of the scroll which caused the ninja to let go of the scroll and cover his mouth and cough a few times as he remarked, \"Darn it, the scroll never said anything about that happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the young man soon after found himself gasping again upon hearing Kurama's voice as clear as day when he said, \"I'm not sure what that smoke was all about either. But I must say I think it was a success, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once the smoke had completely gone away Naruto found himself looking upward at a now free nine tailed fox. However, he looked like a mix of his normal form and that of human's, most likely like that of an anthropomorphized form. He then also noticed how huge the nine tailed fox's muscles were, and upon a closer look he soon saw that the now anthro Kurama stood at a height that was....</span></div></div>",

I used to be a giant so I'm the one who feel's weird being so...<i>tiny</i>,\" Kurama ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, God, don't have a stroke,\" Naruto conceded. \"That doesn't really help us as far as getting back home though. Most of the villagers would still panic if they saw the kyuubi is back...even if he look so...<i>different</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we don't have a problem,\" Kurama said before preforming the transformation jutsu \"viola.\" Naruto just stared at Kurama as what stood before him now was someone who bore a striking resemblance to himself. Kurama's creation was like an orange haired version of Naruto, appearing perhaps a decade older, with even more animalistic attributes like more exaggerated canines, slitted eyes, far more prominent whisker marks, and an overall sharpness to his features. He wore nothing more than a fishnet mesh only as heavy as necessary to be considered a shirt and a pair of black shorts, and he stood at 6 foot 4 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll probably work...but why did you decide to look like me?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I-I just have a good frame of reference for it that's all!\" the kyuubi said in a fluster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one of Naruto's favorite things about their recent friendship, despite Kurama's age and experience when provoked just the right way he was even more excitable than himself. \"Oh? I thought maybe you thought I was...ya know...kinda hot,\" Naruto teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT IT YOU RUNT!\" Kurama boomed, all bark and no bite, \"I just figured that this would be easiest! Yeah! That's it! Now stop pestering me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" Naruto said in a coy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the two were on their way back to Naruto's apartment, the journey was mostly free of any significant interruption just lots of villagers looking at the pair. Naruto couldn't blame them he knew he'd been gaining lots of <i>admirers</i> lately, and whether it was himself or Kurama he was all to happy to take the compliment. However just as they approached the final stretch Naruto heard a familiar voice ring out \"Hey Naruto! Wait up!\" followed by Kiba running through the crowded street, Akamaru in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Kiba,\" Naruto greeted the dog ninja, trying desperately not to betray his apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your friend?\" Kiba asked gesturing to Kurama, \"He your cousin or something? You two look crazy similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, I'm his cousin, my name's Kurama,\" the kyuubi answered as Akamaru feverishly sniffed at him, curious who this new person was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kurama, as you heard I'm Kiba, and that's Akamaru,\" he said gesturing to his sniffing partner, and taking an involuntary sniff himself. \"Naruto I just wanted to let you know that the training fields are free if you feel like sparring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Naruto smiled, \"Maybe later though, me and my cousin were just headed back to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok cool, I hope to see you later,\" Kiba waved before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama what the hell?! Why'd you just tell him your name?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's my name,\" he said matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if he connects the dots?! A bunch of people heard me saying your name when we fought Madara!\" the Uzumaki protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" Kurama said disinterestedly, \"You're already lucky I'm doing this silly transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the duo finally reached the apartment Kurama wasted no time and undid the jutsu the second the door was closed. His 7 foot height was restored along with his blazing orange fur, muscled frame, obscenely free hanging cock and balls, as well as his nine tails that dragged along behind him. \"You know squirt, this might actually be kinda fun,\" he said, flopping on to Naruto's couch and spreading his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm still not really used to the whole \"shamelessly naked\" thing,\" Naruto complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll just have to learn to live with it,\" Kurama said, making it clear he'd only put his dick away in public, \"After all I've seen your <i>morning routine</i> every day since you were 11, I'm surprised you never ripped your dick off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama shut the hell up!\" Naruto yelled as the kyuubi seized his opportunity to avenge his earlier embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's only fair, tit for tat Naruto,\" Kurama chuckled at the teen's frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Naruto sighed, trying to glue his eyes to the ceiling, \"We've still got something to discuss.\"</span></div></div>",

There's no way you and I can share my bed together! I bet you won't even be able to fit on it without your feet or a bit of legs sticking out of the blanket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you're point?\" Kurama commented, none the worried about the matter whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this not bother you?! Naruto almost shouted, as he let out a groan of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you acting like such a child?! Do you really think I'd do anything else with you other then sleep?!\" The orange furred nine tailed fox snapped right back.

And while he did this he went on with, \"Plus I bet you're worrying for nothing kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found himself becoming nervous as he wasn't sure how to respond to the nine tailed fox's comment and not to his surprise once both he and the tailed beast had entered his room and were both laying on his bed together the ninja found that his bed was completely fine. However he was right about the bed just barely fitting the nine tailed beast's size. In fact the young man noticed right away that he didn't have that much at all on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he glared up at the grinned beast's face when he pointed out, \"Okay smart guy, what do we do about this problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's an easy one kid.\" Kurama replied, before Naruto felt the anthro fox wrap his arms around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the ninja's eyes to widen as he was placed on top of the heavily muscled anthro nine tailed fox's body.

However one thing quickly became apparent as the longer the two stayed in contact, the more they were both becoming <i>interested</i> in the situation. In what had truthfully been only about a minute both Naruto and Kurama had begun sporting both an orange tent and pole respectively. Each of them was now somehow simultaneously trying to look at anything but the other while also finding themselves being drawn deeper into the other's eyes, as each time their eye contact was broken they found themselves looking in complimentary directions, making eye contact, and starting the process anew. This continued for a while until they both nearly had a heart attack when they felt each other's fully grown arousal make contact with one another. Naruto promptly jumped from the bed and started babbling, \"I-I-I, Uh...Laundry! That's it, yep, gotta go do that,\" he left the room then his apartment altogether, noticeably taking no clothes with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Kurama sighed, not sure what to think of that whole encounter. Had the brat really just turned him on so easily, by all accounts Naruto was clearly into it himself, that only made sense though of <i>course</i>, anyone would be into the great kyuubi, but the most powerful bijuu was left to ponder his thoughts as his massive pride still stood and throbbed freely, desperate for attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later Naruto returned, back to his usual self, Kurama though had been waiting with bells on for the ninja's return. \"<i>Finally</i> you're back,\" Kurama grumbled, \"Why the hell don't you have any food? I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you look, ya know, in the fridge,\" Naruto asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes smartass, all you've got in there is some old milk that may as well be cheese,\" Kurama retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right, well what about the cupboards?\" Naruto wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All three of them are just full of stinkin' instant ramen,\" Kurama complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasphemy,\" was all Naruto cared to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up dummy, can we just go somewhere? It's nice having a body again but it's such a pain at the same time,\" the fox bitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go to Ichiraku then,\" Naruto proposed, grabbing his trusty frog wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no ramen,\" Kurama replied as he preformed the jutsu to regain his earlier human appearance, \"I want something hardy for my first meal in such a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heresy,\" Naruto said reflexively, \"What about Yakiniku? Or is barbecue not <i>hardy</i> enough,\" he taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, we're going now,\" Kurama said dragging Naruto out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were seated in a corner booth and, having just received, their order had begun placing food on the grill. Naruto was finding it genuinely amusing to see Kurama bouncing in his seat as the meat cooked, impatient with eagerness, almost...cute... \"No not cute, just funny,\" he rationalized to himself. The second the food was cooked Kurama pulled the biggest piece of steak off the fire and put it directly into his mouth, appropriately wolfing it down like someone who hadn't had an actual meal in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, fuck that was hot,\" Kurama panted before taking a large gulp of water, \"Ah, definitely worth it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...yeah I bet,\" Naruto laughed awkwardly as his mind was otherwise occupied. This damn fox, something about <i>this damn fox</i>, Naruto couldn't quite put his finger on why, but for some reason seeing this demon, turned hero, turned friend just acting like himself for a change was making his heart flutter. Was he really developing feelings for Kurama?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ruto. Naruto. TWERP!\" Kurama yelled a little louder than he'd meant to, both gaining the ninja's attention and drawing the eye of the majority of the other patrons, \"Hey Naruto, what's wrong with you tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I guess I'm just not that hungry...\" he said unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not buying it, what's really eating you?\" the kyuubi pushed, his experience with Naruto being a deft tool when it came to reading him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just...I...it's nothing...\" he faltered with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on kid, when have you <i>ever</i> backed down, now tell me,\" Kurama said determined not to let Naruto brush it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't laugh,\" Naruto said with a deep breath, \"...how would you feel about...maybe later...doing what we did...earlier...again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" but then it was Kurama's turn to blush \"<b>Oh</b> <i>that</i>...w-well I, I dunno I-I mean,\" he fumbled with embarrassment at the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was dumb of me, I sho-\" Naruto started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you get to far there,\" the fox interrupted, \"I, uh, I didn't exactly...say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery fiber of Naruto's being suddenly did a backflip of joy, not only had Kurama not tried to kill him, he said yes! \"I-I mean, I don't <i>just</i> mean what happened, I mean, oh crap did I just ruin it,\" Naruto babbled, giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I know Naruto,\" Kurama said as he stood from his side of the booth and moved to join Naruto on his, \"Now just, let's finish dinner first,\" and gave him a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of there dinner was filled with a mix of lovey dovey displays and cringe worthy comments, but the both of them were far to excited to feel anything other than unbridled joy. After the meal they left for Naruto's apartment once again this time hand in hand as they glided passed a blur of faces, desperately fight the urge to simply sprint. Reaching the apartment building, hearts pounding...</span></div></div>",

Boruto had, shockingly, requested a burger and Naruto, in the twist to end all twists, prepared himself some ramen. Boruto had thought the burger was prepared well enough, but was less than surprised to find his father had devotedly slaved over his <i>precious</i> ramen creating something that what bring a tear to Teuchi's eye. The night was a little bizarre though as once their meals were finished Boruto noticed his father was, despite his earlier posturing, apparently keeping his distance, always sitting on the opposite side of the room from him. Reflecting further the young ninja began recalling more and more odd behaviors the Hokage had been showing over the last month. Despite it being his go to messenger system he seemingly hadn't used the Shadow Clone jutsu in ages and, like tonight, whenever he was home he seemed really hesitant to touch anything, but more than anything he would frequently get the look of concentration he'd gotten whenever he closed his eyes and spoke with Kurama much much more often, strange if the fox was supposed to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself now brimming with curiosity Boruto asked his father, \"Hey dad, has anything be, I dunno, different or weird lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto promptly burned scarlet and said, far to rapidly, \"What? No! Of course not! Everything's fine! Why would I try and hide something?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your poker face is better than that when you speak with the other Kages,\" Boruto jabbed, \"Now what's the big secret old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-nothing!\" the Hokage said, again flustered. \"Now if that's it I think I'm ready for bed,\" Naruto said standing, eager to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could reach the stairs though Boruto grabbed his wrist, to which he deftly freed his hand and jumped back by about a meter. \"Ok seriously dad, what the hell? Is something wrong, like really wrong?!\" Boruto pushed, concern mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing! Just try not to think about it,\" Naruto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when you say stuff like that it makes it sound like you're gonna die or something!\" Boruto pushed, nearing his boiling point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a deep breath Naruto finally asked his son \"Are you sure you won't regret this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\" he replied, ready for his dad to spill the beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But are you really sure?\" Naruto asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Boruto replied, growing exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that you're sure,\" Naruto said in an attempt to put of the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Boruto shouted, the end of his rope reached and surpassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go somewhere safe first though,\" Naruto said to his son's confusion before the pair ventured deeply into the Hidden Leaf Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a clearing Naruto stopped and said \"Alright this should be far enough.

Boruto kept track of every one as his father spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyuubi-Henshin-no-jutsu!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOOM!* A loud explosion erupted  as Naruto was engulfed in the smoke spawned from certain jutsus. The smoke was massive, engulfing the area as the nearby trees leaves were pushed away by the smoke. So thick it was even blocking Boruto's sight. The Hokage's son moved an arm in front of his eyes as it blew into him to try to see, the other waving back and forth pitifully as more just kept coming. The force of the smoke pushing spiky hair back as his coat wanted to fly off him, the bottom swinging wildly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Cough* Damn dad! *Cough* Warn me before that happens! *Cough*\" The smoke got into his lungs, but thankfully it was harmless and he could still, mostly breathe fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't respond. Beyond the boys sight the outline of his fathers body thanks to his blue chakra would be visible to the eyes of an Uchiha, but soon it began to change. Stretching higher, expanding wider, his outline bulking as it became the orange of the Nine-Tailed Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it Naruto's hands seemed to become sharper with claw like protrusions, his mouth began to stretch out to the form of a snout, orange outlines of long tails emerged from above his posterior. Nine giant orange outlines in all as two long ears appeared on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound was resounding through the area as a *Buuuuuzzzzz...* that hummed within the ears of Boruto to a numbing like feel, but began to stop as the smoke began to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if In response to the question something grabbed Boruto from behind, something sharp yet smooth pressed against his back as it entered his shirt from below and started lifting him in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait! Whoever you are my dad and me will kick your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoruto's threats fell on deaf ears as he was rapidly raised in the air, his mouth pointed down as his eyes squinted to see yet there was still smoke all around, though thinning faster as he rose into the sky. Still, whatever sharp weapon was pressed again the boy and lifting him was sharp enough he didn't want to take chance until he saw the owners face. So he left his kunais and shurikens alone for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Before I had only gotten a little big, but I never got this big.\" A deep, powerful rumbled through Borutos ears. \"Guess that's the benefit of a days rest. Should have known a full work day of endless paperwork was holding me back when I was barely making three clones max! You think so to Boruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Boruto needed to know to figure out it was his father, the smoke finally began dissipating faster and in a minute the sharp object brought him face to face with the outline of a snout. Followed in thirty seconds by it belonging to a dark orange furred fox.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Dad!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! In the Kyuubi flesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father had become the spitting image of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Orange fur, black fur surrounding red eyes that moved into his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Kurama was always a little humanoid in the front with his arms, his legs had instead transformed into those a human would walk with, but with big mighty paws in place of human toes and feet. Likewise his torso had fully become human. And Man was he beefy! They even had a impressive human like cock above orange furred balls. The thing was half-hard throbbing against his cut six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lean frame of Kurama or even Naruto's had been replaced with a bodybuilder physique. He was impressive in ways neither was by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his clawed hand over his snout, Naruto dropped Boruto onto it. The spot big enough for his son to sit on it. The man had easily grown at least 90 feet tall Boruto assumed. Maybe more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found myself turning into Kurama one day during a full moon. Weirded both of us out at the time. Then every full moon at the Hokage office me and Kurama would gain more and more control. Soon it was possible whenever we wanted. Though I never got bigger than nine feet at most! Nor well-\" he bounced his pecs \"thick. I was just as scrawny as normal. So what do you think of my secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a puppy his tails began to wag, crashing down with a *BOOM* onto the trees crushed beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe-it's okay I guess.\" Boruto eyes turned huge before he turned away from his fathers eyes and hid his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!?\" Naruto was surprised while Kurama snickered within, correctly guessing the truth. Tails instantly stopping and slouching down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I mean you said this was just you trying without being exhausted for once.\" Then a bulb flashed in Boruto's head as he grinned away from his fathers sight. \"Clearly you need to do more with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Naruto wanted to make his kid proud. Now was the time to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean I've never done this to anyone but myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure!\" Boruto said, excitedly looking into his giant father's eyes. \"Besides think how cool it'd be if we were both so...so...*ahem*...cool...\" he clumsily fumbled to keep himself from saying hot, as he shifted his legs for a second time to try and hide just how <i>cool</i> he thought this whole situation was, hoping his father didn't simply feel his son's <i>excitement</i> on his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay then if you're sure let's try it,\" Naruto said as he quickly preformed the seals again, this time though he carefully lowered the tip of his giant clawed finger on top of his son's head and poured the built up chakra into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments Boruto fell back upon his father's snout in defeat feeling nothing, \"Ah dammit,\" he griped in disappointment, but a moment later he felt an intense heat begin to rise within him. It was happening! It was really gonna happen! \"Hey dad quick put me down!\" Boruto shouted with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cue Naruto placed his son down on the ground just in time for Boruto's own billowing cloud of smoke to appear. Boruto felt his chakra mingling with that of his father's as his body began to expand rapidly, all the while becoming denser with new muscle in addition to height. Euphoria was beginning to overtake the boy until he was overcome by a fierce itching as golden fur began to grow across his body and a painful burning erupted at the base of his spine as nine tails of his own began to sprout. With thud after thud his nine tails grew in size and fell to the forest floor, now each akin to his father's, rivaling his own height when he tried lifting them. His lush golden fur, topped by his normal hairstyle, continually fought a losing battle to hide the young ninja's ever increasing musculature as his body began to take the form of an avid athlete, not quite as dense as his dad's but still remarkably cut. Finally, as his height continued to soar, he felt a pressure in his groin before his balls suddenly became heavier and hung lower and his penis began erecting up his six pack until it was half way up his abdominal muscles, smaller than Naruto's but Boruto felt far too good to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...*huff*...Oh my God...*huff*...Dad that was incredible,\" Boruto beamed, standing fully to find he was now only marginally shorter than his old man while matching whisker marks began forming to join his actual whiskers, again akin to Naruto's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it,\" Naruto said, proud of his handiwork as his tails began to sway once more. \"But I guess that means it's better than \"just okay,\" he teased observing his son's newly grown physique, a strong swimmer's build paired with a generous dick, all enveloped in an alluring gold fur, and adorned with nine fresh new flowing tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" Boruto said before he, to his father's surprise, planted a deep kiss on his father's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph...Boruto...hold on,\" Naruto said, confusedly breaking the kiss, \"Why are you...what does this...I mean do you really think that we should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want to, It means I'm horny and frankly so are you, and yes I really <i>really</i> want to,\" Boruto declared confidently, then pounced on his father, pinning the larger fox to the ground with a giant tremor and kissing him anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding this kiss harder to break Naruto began to lean back as his son ravaged his mouth and with a final gasp asked \"Are you sure about this?\" giving in more and more to his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Boruto asserted, letting his body sprawl out atop his father's, the two giants gradually becoming a tangle of limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"In that case I'm going to give you the full experience,\" Naruto said before he renewed the kiss, deeper then ever. Boruto was nearly overwhelmed as his father's kiss occupied the entirety of his senses, the clear advantages of experience on full display, which kept him from realizing that his father had again preformed the jutsu until he felt his dad's body sliding beneath him and the kiss becoming harder to maintain. When Boruto opened his eyes he was shocked to realize that in only moments the mouth he'd been grappling with was now equal in size to the whole of his head, and that instead of the roughly same sized body he'd previously lay upon he now was only covering down to his father's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...I...you're...so\" Boruto fumbled, too flustered to even gush properly as Naruto continually grew with increasing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, so <i>cool</i> right?\" Naruto teased his son who could now fit comfortably on his chest as he continued to grow and grow in the night moaning loudly, any semblance of trying to remain covert long since demolished, evidenced by the increasingly noticeable kyuubi like man that sounded like he was barely containing the world's largest orgasm. Naruto then noticed his son eyeing his enormous growing body \"You can go ahead and look around you know,\" the Hokage told his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Boruto's golden tails began wagging involuntarily with eagerness as he began to explore his still expanding father. Getting up from his dad's pecs, but not before leaving them with some affectionate nuzzling, Boruto traveled down a set off literal cobblestone abs that if this continued threatened to become canyon-esque, bending to feel each one, hands excited to feel everything they could. Then Boruto reached the crowning pinnacle of his father's manhood, stunned silent as he realized it was as tall as himself, if not a little taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Phew*...Go ahead...*phew*...and touch it...\" Naruto said breathily before his son did just that and more, latching on to a penis as large as himself. Naruto, for all his worth, threw his head back and only just managed not to climax thanks to his iron will, wanting to save his release for something special. Continually though he was tested as his son seemed to have found his favorite spot as the organ became double his son's size, then triple, coated with a constant flow of pre and the numerous releases of his boy until after Boruto's fourth consecutive orgasm he became overspent and passed out nestled in his father's furry groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Boruto awoke he noted his father seemed to have stopped growing as the orange floor beneath him was no longer stretching. What took him longer to grasp though was that when he looked up, and up, and up, the penis he'd been fondling appeared to be ten times his size. \"Wait...\" Boruto said to himself, \"...if I was around ninety feet...and now dad's dick is <i>this big</i>...that means that dad is...,\" taking a moment to think, nowhere near as bad at math as Naruto, just...math...he yelled \"HOLY FUCK! He'd be over a mile tall!\" Turning on the spot Boruto then got the full effect of his father's daunting size as incomparable muscles covered his orange body, with his tails stretching out seemingly endlessly, and his face not even fully discernible it was so high up. Looking around the dick Boruto then saw that Naruto had apparently brought them back to the village, his sense of duty to the village apparently overridden by his desire for pleasure and his eagerness to impress his son. Naruto was seated before Konoha's gate, his legs wrapping around the massive stretching village, and a sense of appreciation for just how massive the village was overcame Boruto when he saw even his father couldn't outstretch it, though true enough no structure could compare it was just...expansive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a sensation at his groin Naruto looked down and saw his tiny golden son darting about. \"HEY BOY,\" Naruto boomed, \"PRETTY HOT AIN'T IT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Boruto yelled the loudest he could manage, and involuntarily beginning to drool a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLAD YOU APPROVE,\" Naruto said before flexing in a godly display, \"BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE UP...</span></div></div>",

The boy's mind was then overwhelmed with pleasure as he began to grow and expand in all directions. Before long the youth could hear the sounds of tearing fabric and himself moaning, but his mind focused only on this carnal bliss. Only twenty seconds had passed and already he'd outgrown his father by a wide margin, and he continued to ascend, vaguely aware of the feeling of his erected cock slapping into his father's slack jaw, as arrived and easily surpassed double the Hokage's height with the energy showing no signs of abating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was more than a little surprised at how well his son's body responded to the small amount of chakra he'd provided, rubbing his jaw he simply watched as his, now fully nude, progeny began to idly stroke himself with one hand and rub his tight muscles with the other. After thirty seconds of stroking, moaning, and growing Boruto had easily quadrupled in size when he sat on the forest floor and lay back to stroke his member with both hands. Now standing between his son's massive growing legs Naruto decided it'd be safer to jump atop his offspring as the limbs beside him and testicles before him were an ever encroaching threat to his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoruto barely felt the impact of his father landing on his torso as his mind demanded one thing and one thing only release, immediate and imminent release. Continuing to pump himself with a nigh frightening ferocity his continued his expanse easily doubling in size once more as his body, even laying down, far surpassed the tree line. Unfettered by the fact his father now stood amongst his six tight abdominal muscles he gained once more in speed as a final growth spurt pushed him over the edge, and with a deafening roar of climax the boy shot load after load high into the night air all to come down and paint him with his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow basking in the afterglow a two-hundred foot tall Boruto panted heavily as a cum stained Hokage appeared before him, standing on his pec \"Understand why it's such a big secret now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" Boruto replied, still somewhat short of breath. \"But people are gonna freak out when they see me,\" he pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the effects are only temporary,\" Naruto explained, to his son's not-so-secret chagrin, \"However that was only supposed to be enough to make you two feet taller not two-hundred feet so who knows just exactly how long this will last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if it's such a big secret, how come you had an idea how big I'd get? Even if you were wrong,\" the giant asked his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have tested it some,\" Naruto explained, \"I would go out into The Forest of Death and experiment on the bugs and some of my clones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Boruto admitted, considering the whole of the situation. Soon though, despite his orgasm from moments earlier, he began to feel his cock stirring anew as he looked at his father, this tiny being coated in his seed was capable of this and, presumably, so much more. The possibilities alone were enough to send his hormones back into a tizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that behind him his son's monolith was rising Naruto said \"Really? I know boys your age are horny, but gimme a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it,\" Boruto said indignantly, \"It's just so damn hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't swear,\" Naruto chastened, involuntarily entering \"dad mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I'm huge, naked, and I jizzed on you, but I can't fucking swear?\" Boruto pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's two, but I guess I can see your point...\" Naruto conceded, shedding his now soaked layers of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding now only in his boxers, with the dorky little ramen cups on them, Boruto couldn't help but feel something within him stir as he looked upon his nearly nude father, \"...You know dad...it'd be pretty cool if...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A heavy *SLAM* was heard as a brown haired Jonin entered \"Big bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Naruto body jumped only a little \"Gah! Konohamaru!? What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't believe this. That sake store we tried a year ago is opening a branch here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words Naruto's eyes widened. \"The Great Cosmic Daidarabotchi Spirits!?\" A smile crossed his face, drool dripped a little from his mouth. \"I can't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it!\" Konohamaru rushed to Naruto's side by the desk in a flash! Several papers neatly stacked flying off their completed piles slowly to the floor, but ignored as the the two became giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until Naruto remembered he lacked the ''considerable'' funds to get one. \"Ah but I don't have the money at the moment.\" Crestfallen, he nearly slumped back into his chair before Konohamaru opened his wallet, reveals loads of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha covered. I was saving so we can go again one day and try that exquisite flavor once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Konohamaru. I was afraid we wouldn't get to enjoy it like we got to previously.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment both paused, faces red as they let out a tiny whistle. Almost as if keeping something from any prying ears. Silence lasted only a few moments before stopped, Naruto getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for? Let's go!\" Moving out of the way of his Kage, Naruto lead them both to the exit of his office. His quick pace making clear how excited he was to try this drink of the past as Konohamaru followed at the same speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its next to Ichiraku Ramen! kay' boss?\" It's been a long time since he called Naruto that, well actually a year, which resulted in the tightening of Naruto's shorts as Naruto remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...wouldn't mind a bite to eat after we get our fill of some good booze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two had arrived at Ichiraku Ramen. The updated restaurant had a small stall with no visitors next to it. Wood with carved paintings on the side of great mountains. No one was there tending the small stand, but the two knew exactly what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing out every bit of cash and putting it on the table, Konohamaru smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take four bottles of the Ol'Gods please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a *Hum* red markings of a Jutsu appeared up below on the wood, making the money disappear with a *PUFF*. Disappearing red marks followed by the emergence of four blue when a *PUFF* of four black bottles appeared. Depicting a great giant of earth on the side.of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing one each, both happily *POP* the cork off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers Naruto!\"<br>\r\n\"Cheers Konohamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took a swig of their bottles, a deep rich aroma the likes of which no alcohol has ever been able to compete with made its journey down their throats. The taste was so great both knew they had to stop lest they waste it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his lips with his sleeve, Konohamaru smiled. \"You don't usually go out drinking with me boss. So when we get the chance I do love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...it's usually Kiba. You really should come some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I want us to hang out with just us. Or I visit you and Boruto. Seeing both of you is always great.\" The brown eyed Ninja stared intently at Naruto. The drink already setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So want me to summon these away for later?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes please! I want entire years  of the upcoming fun we'll have with my village~\"<br>\r\n\"As expected of my boss!\" Pulling out a scroll and performing a summoning jutsu, the four bottles disappeared in a *BOOM* of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how should we start our fun this time~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====Previous Year=====<br>\r\nKonohamaru had been Naruto's guard during a visit to the Land of Iron to meet General Mifune for a treaty between the five great countries and their allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two came across a special little stand that sold alcohol, lost in the cold, each swig of the drink causing <i>big</i> side effects that led to two very grown ninja embracing their mischievous side for months on end. Returning to \"normal\" after enough was enough. Everything ruined returned to the way it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell not quite. Naruto and Konohamaru <i>did</i> get a few inches taller and easily a dozen pounds in muscle. But who'd notice such a change in a world returned to its Status Quo?</span></div></div>",
