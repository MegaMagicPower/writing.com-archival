Flinging the door open, Kayleigh grinned openly, 'Hi Tanya.'<br>\r\nTanya didn't look happy, 'Hi Kayleigh. Um, I've never asked you this before but I've got no one else to ask, so could you please look after Liz for a while?' At this the girl holding Tanya's hand looked up and moved out from her mothers shadow. <br>\r\nLiz was a pretty enough girl, with long brown hair and green eyes, but there was also something about her that unnerved Kayleigh by just looking at her. Persevering though, Kayleigh smiled, 'Sure Tanya, I'll look after Liz for you.'<br>\r\nTanya then handed Liz over to Kayleigh and bent down to whisper something in her ear. Tanya then stood up, thanked Kayleigh and left for her car.<br>\r\nKayleigh then looked down at Liz, wondering what to do with her.<br>\r\n'So what do you want to do?' Kayleigh asked.<br>\r\n'I've got a game we can play.' Liz replied.</span></div></div>",

Once they got into the living room Liz stopped and turned towards Kayleigh. 'For the game to work we have to hold both our hands.'<br>\r\nKayleigh rolled her eyes and smiled, this should be good.<br>\r\nThey then held hands and Liz started to chant slowly, making Kayleigh feel a tingle run through her body, then she felt a deep sense of vertigo as she closed her eyes to steady herself. As soon as she opened them she wished she hadn't because when she looked up she saw the enormous thing that was now Liz, and now she was very happy.<br>\r\n'Fantastic, mummy said this would work.' Saying this she let go of Kayleigh as soon as she reached doll size.<br>\r\nKayleigh took this opportunity to make a run for it, unfortunately with such small legs she didn't stand a chance against the enormous Liz, who scooped her up in one hand easily. Lifting Kayleigh to her face, Liz's grin grew wider as she looked Kayleigh over. 'Mummy said this would be the best way for me to learn what ladies grow into.'<br>\r\nAt this Kayleigh got desperate and started to struggle in Liz's hand, but it was useless, at her size she was pathetically weak. 'Dammit', Exclaimed Kayleigh, 'at this size I'm pretty much useless.'<br>\r\n'I wouldn't say that Kayleigh', said Liz running her soft finger over Kayleigh's shrunken shirt, 'You have some uses.'
