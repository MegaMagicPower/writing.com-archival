Her arms were equally round and flabby, and they scritched and rubbed subconciously at her middle. She had a hypnotic amount of drool coming from her mouth, covering gigantic breasts that wobbled with each small movement she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her tail was like a tree trunk, and it slowly swayed back and forth, a large flame dancing at its end. The flame appeared to Pikachu to have a gluttonous look to it, which matched the look in her eyes, which were a part of a thick muzzle, plump cheeks and the rolls that used to be a neck. While he was busy looking this beauty over, she burped louldy enough to make herself jiggle. She beckoned him over to her, and he followed, mesmerized by her soft, tubby form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rubbed his chubby chest and belly with one of her fat hands before smiling and winking at him. \"So you're the new guy I heard was coming.

Okay ?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmander started to walk and said : \"Follow me. I know a room with a lot of food inside.\" Pikachu nodded and followed her. He couldn't resist watching her fat body, she was so hot. He blushed and felt embarrassed.<br>\r\nThen, they reached the \"Meal room\". Pikachu went inside and looked around. There were mountains of cakes, hamburgers, french fries, candy and others things like that. He licked his lips and he really needed to eat something now.<br>\r\nThe fat Charmander came to him and said \"Well. I guess you're ready. It's time to eat now.\" And she started to stuff Pikachu with some cakes. He couldn't do anything and loved to see her feeding him. He ate with pleasure and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Pikachu was huge and a little fatter than Charmander now. His cheeks, arms, legs, tails, butt and belly were pretty big too. He let out a big belch. The Charmander told him \"Wow ! Nice one. Now you're as big as me, it's time for you to feed me.\"<br>\r\nPikachu nodded and grabbed some food. Then, he started to feed her now. Charmander smiled and decided to feed him as well. They could feel their fat bodies and there were pretty soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the two Pok\u00e9mon finished eatting everything inside the room. They were 10 times bigger than before and they could hardly move. They got fat and huge face and they got several chins too.<br>\r\nPikachu said : \"UUURP ! Mmmmm... That was a great meal. I don't know if I could eat more.\"<br>\r\nCharmander replied : \"Yeah... UUUURP ! We can barely move now. But we can still walk, just a little. Hmm...

I'll have to go get more while the fat settles on his belly.\" Pikachu watched and drooled as he stared at her huge wobbling ass.

Within seconds he had grown a foot in each direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat completely engulfed all of his paws, making him immobile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Suddenly a siren was sounded throughout the complex and perked both Pikachu and Charmander away from their task at hand.<br>\r\n   \"Is that a fire alarm?\" asked Pikachu worried that eating to immobility may have been going too far.<br>\r\n   \"Not at all, and if it was there are plenty of obese water type pokemon and they would be able to put it out with ease.  No.  That my chubby friend is the fat alarm.  It goes off every day randomly.  Sometimes its early in the morning or late at night.  No matter what time of day everyone is waiting for it with great anticipation.\"<br>\r\n   \"Well, what happens?\" Pikachu asked drool dripping from his mouth and mixing with the crumbs and smudges on his pelt.<br>\r\n   \"It is just something the leaders of the Slob Club thought up one day.  You see its to make sure membership stays up to snuff by giving them a daily feeding to make sure nobody isn't acting any less slobby.  Just a quick fattening 20 course meal for everyone.  If you can't finish it then you may get kicked out of the club.\"<br>\r\n   \"But what if I can't finish it?\"<br>\r\n   Charmander chuckled, jiggling her fat all over herself.  \"Don't be afraid my friend.  It's just so the club doesn't get boring.  I mean what is life, even a slobby life like without taking risks.  This way it helps motivate everyone, especially new recruits like you to feel just as slobby as everyone else.  So just relax and let your inner glutton take control.\"<br>\r\n   Suddenly, hoses fell from the ceiling and somehow found and forced their way into both their mouths.<br>\r\n   \"Tubes?\" asked Pikachu who could barely talk with the tubes in his way.\"<br>\r\n   \"Yes, this way is more efficient for stuffing so this is how we're fed.  One is for food.  It comes out like a paste, but is both extra fattening and hunger inducing.  The second is for liquids.  It pumps highly carbonated soda into your mouth to help the food get down your throat.  And that last tiny tube pumps air into your mouth so you don't suffocate.  It isn't that important really.\"  She ended with a chuckle.  Pikachu could tell she must have gone through this test plenty of times before today since she didn't have any trouble talking to him with all the tubes.<br>\r\n   The sirens sounded again and Pikachu knew it was feeding time.  The pumps acitvated and he felt the air and soda begin the pour into his mouth.  He drank as fast as he could to get every last drop, but some still overflowed out onto his chin.  The food came in moments later, sliding in at a slower speed.  It tasted like chicken.  He started to eat it and it was unbelievable.  He continued on for several courses finding the flavor change constantly.  He kept his eyes closed wanting to see how fat he'd get after the feeding was over, though his hands began to knead his doughy body with excitement.  He could tell he must have doubled in size since his tiny paws could barely get halfway around him anymore.  His tail was so fat it fell to the ground.  After a while he remembered what Charmander told him about connecting to his inner slob and realized he had only gotten a little food on his face.  He stopped swallowing the food and let it fill him mouth.  His cheeks expanded to their max (which had increased with the rest of his girth) before his lips finally let out a stream of food paste, soda, and drool.  After it reached the end of his stomach he began to fill his empty belly.  He was quite shocked that he didn't feel the least big hungry after all that.  He figured that the food made him hungrier just like Charmander said, but he didn't think it'd be this effective.  He thought to himself he'd better get some more to eat after this was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the food stopped pumping and vanished back into the ceiling.  He looked at himself and Charmander and couldn't believe his eyes.  He saw...</span></div></div>",

His cheeks were massive and Pikachu felt great.  As a force of habbit sparks shot from his cheeks when he was happy and even his lightening seemed fat.  His neck was subtracted, but his chin multiplied into 5.<br>\r\n   When Pikachu saw Charmander she was the same and knew where the extra tubes came from.  \"Uh, why did you give me your tubes?\"<br>\r\n   \"Because I had a little plan.\" she replied amazingly pushing Pikachu toward the door, despite his size.\"<br>\r\n   \"How-\" he started.<br>\r\n   \"No.  I'm not that strong.\" she replied before he could speak.  \"While you were having a little snack I put a wheeled platform underneath you.  They have them here for a lot of the immobile ones who still want to be able to move.

Charmander jumped on Pikachu and snuggled deep into his fat.  \"It's a little game pokemon play with each other and its loads of fun.  This will be our first time, but I'm sure we'll play it all the time, now here is how it goes.  That will throw pies over here and we have to try and eat them as they get to us.  The biggest at the end of the game wins.  Don't think that being bigger than me gives you an advantage since you don't have hands to catch the pies you'll have to catch them in your mouth.  There is also a winner for the one with the most pie goo on their body so you can still score points if you get covered in pie.  Shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n   Pikachu opened his enormous mouth to let out a big belch and sliding his tongue across his mouth, adding a fresh coat of saliva to his face before saying. \"I was born ready.\"<br>\r\n   \"Alright.\" she said pressing another button and the pies came flying.</span></div></div>",

Charizard grinned trying her best to hold back a giggle as Pikachu whimpered<br>\r\ntrying to manuver his immobile body to catch the pies. \" let me help you with that darling\" she said, realizing that she could not win this fight, and then began catching <br>\r\nand stuffing the pies into Pikachu's mouth, now covered in a mixture of drool, crumbs, and pie fillling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pie catapult ran out of pies after a few hours of the game, but by that time it had become more of a pie binge for Pikachu.<br>\r\n\"Looks like those pies put a couple more pounds on that skinny little body of yours\" she giggled before farting loudly. Pikachu hadn't paid much attention to his growth<br>\r\nduring the game, but he got a good look of how fat he had gotten when Charizard place a rather large mirror in front of him.<br>\r\nHis now absolutely gigantic belly had at least doubled in size, his huge arse now looked like it could fit a fat nidoqueen in each cheek, and his chubby face was <br>\r\nnow obscured by his multiple chins. \"BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP\"!!!!. Pikachu belched as it went on for about twenty minutes, wiggling his <br>\r\nfat body and following it up with a rather large smelly fart. \"Well, now that game's over, how about I give a little treat\" she said as she pulled out two large hoses.<br>\r\n\"These two hoses are special\". \"This one will allow your sweat and methane glands to produce twenty times your normal amount, and this one will allow you to <br>\r\nBurp and Drool so much that you,ll almost sweat saliva\" she said excitedly.\" But im only going to let you choose one\" she said giggling. \" But first\" she said <br>\r\nseductively.\"This\" as she plopped her fat sweaty arse straight on his plump face.\" I have wanted to do this since you first became immobile\" she said. \"FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP\"!!!!!.

It was to enter into an special chamber to anplify slobby skills.  He did so curious to see just what it was.  It was pretty cramped for his size as he was locked in.  He found it hot in their too with the lack of ventilation.  He didn't know when it would begin, but then a monitor appeared and told him to stare at it.  He looked for some time, but nothing happened.  Suddenly a pill was shot at his face that he ate on impulse before he could think about it.<br>\r\n   Suddenly he began farting uncontrollably.  He tried to hold it in, but the shear pressure in his rear wouldn't hold it.  It wasn't that he didn't want to let it out, it was just that it was hard to breath as it was and the farting was only making it worse.  To add to this his sweat glands were functioning cauing his B.O. to stink up the place worse.  He was afraid the smell would make him pass out.<br>\r\n   \"Don't resist it.\" said Charmander through a speaker.  \"Just enjoy the stench.  Take in big breaths.\"  Pikachu started slowly, but then began taking in deep breaths of his own gas.  \"Good, now keep thinking this smell comes from you.  The stronger it is the sexier you are.  The more there is the greater you are.  Don't hold it in, but allow your essence to expand.\"<br>\r\n   Pikachu thought this stuff sounded a little strange, but he tried it anyway.  Suddenly he wasn't smelling foul farts, but something that was sweet.  It was still his foul gas, but in accepting and embracing it he was able to breath it in like it was clean air (though the though of breathing clean air without his esscense seemed less disirable now).<br>\r\n   After a few more minutes to make sure it sunk in Charmander released him.  Ready to greet him she was hit in the face with a wind of Pikachu gas.  It was stronger than she expected and made her tear.  When Pikachu emerged she could hardly recongnize his scent.  He seemed to have a visiable stench aura around him.  She got in close to get a better whiff.  \"Wow, you smell good.  Better than me even.\"<br>\r\n   \"Thanks.\" replied Pikachu.  He let out a giant burst of gas one after the other.  They even seemed to get smellier than the one before.  Looking are his armpits they seemed to be sweating more due to the gas cutting off all cold air around him, the same thing went for his feet.</span></div></div>",

You must give me followers who will give me their worship so I can depose Arceus, and take his place as a head god. You needn't worry about your dream being unfulfilled either, I couldn't care less how my followers acted as long as I get control. All you have to do is spread your dream to the entire Slob club, then expand outwards saying Jaldabaoth shall make your desires a reality.\" he said. \"Of course if it means the humans shall let pokemon rule a slobby world I would do anything,\" Char said. \"Good now you will wake soon when you do go find two young male twin Ralts who I have made to aid you, while they are children the dreams and ambition of a child can carry great sway.

You can stay here for a while to get your strength back, as long as you don't mind being out of the wild.  Raichu was more than thrilled to get such an opportunity to have such a cosy life.  They forest was always riddled with dangerous pokemon like Beedrill, not to mention several pokemon trainers searching and capturing strong pokemon, many of which were his friends.  Now he had it made as long as he stayed here, but he figured that if he didn't have a good excuse for staying the human would see him as a freeloader and throw him out.  He thought quickly and figured if he could pretend to be sick he'd be able to stay with no questions asked.  He started yawning and fell asleep.  Or at least the human thought he did.  He figured if he didn't act energetic he'd figure he was still recovering and let him stay.  Suddenly he felt the human pick him up and lead him into another room.  Then he was placed onto a comfortable bed.  The human left the room.  He looked around and saw that he fell for it.  He liked his accomodations here better than the pile of leaves he used to keep warm in the coldest nights.  He looked around, but kept his ears fixed on the human's footsteps in case he came back in.  When he finally did Raichu went back into the bed to act like he never awoke.<br>\r\n   He didn't stay long this time and after he was gone Raichu saw he left a bowl of pokechow next to the bed and another with fresh milk in it.  He was still a little full from his last meal, but he figured he must have been at least a little underweight from that long period without food.  He ate it all, even when he felt like he couldn't fit another bite it he forced himself to swallow.  He felt his stomach was filled to the max and chubbier than before.  He figured that the ill feeling he had now would help with his act.  He felt sleepy for real this time and thought to himself how long he'd keep up this charade.</span></div></div>",

The Raichu sat and looked confused, his cheeks bulging further and further as viscous drool finally spluttered from his mouth and all over his thick belly.  He'd nearly forgotten about his new, action feature.  His tongue slid out and oozed drool onto the floor and his feet, his stomach rumbled and he belched loudly, flecks of spittle flying across the room.  So far, he was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the door opened suddenly, and carts upon carts upon carts entered the room.  It was not unlike a train in the appearance.  And such heavenly smells coming from it.  The drool began to flow like it too could sense the food, spilling from his mouth and coating his front with a shimmering mess.  The raichu's ears twitched as he hopped up on the carts and began gorging on the foods that sat upon them.  The human attendant laughed and watched the Raichu for only a moment, then apologized to the busy Raichu and left abruptly, leaving the pokemon to his task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu was hardly bothered by the empty room, wonderful foods filled the air with their aromas, and Raichu heaved up buckets of drool on the carts, sliming them and belching as he ate and ate and ate.  \"What an amazing place\", he thought.  He belched, agreeing with himself, and swallowed a delicate looking three tier chocolate cake.  His belly growing and swelling, his body soon picking up the pace.  Soon he was becoming a hefty, disgusting blob of the pokemon he once was.  His small, and now zafarms were looking more and more pathetic by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he lay on the ground, his body pulsating as he spit up more drool and licked his fat fingers, plenty of food still available to him, but a rest was in order.  Raichu rubbed his flabby belly greedily, and with a sick little smile on his fat face, he leaned forward and farted loudly.  He mrrbled to himself and felt the heat against his blubbery cheeks.  \"Slob...\" he thought.  \"I could learn to enjoy this...\" and as he licked his face with his plump tongue, drool spilled from his maw.  He shifted himself to get up once again and attack the food, a beautifully loud burst of gas blurted from his rear.  He was going to be doing that alot in his stay here, he knew...</span></div></div>",

This may take a few hours.\" The hypnosis room had a single recliner in the middle of it, that faced a very large and pronounced, wide screen HD tv. The walls were far apart, and were metal plated. Raichu was placed in the chair, and strapped in with a large metal belt that went around his belly. The human left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubliminal messages start to play from speakers, hidden throughout the walls. At first it was a series of tones and frequencies that made him incredibly subjective. He'd probably beleive anything he was told after a few minutes. Raichu was oblivious to them though, and just sat there, belching and drooling until the TV turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speakers started to play \"belching is good. Belching is fun.\" The TV showed what he thought of as an incredibly sexy female Raichu on screen. She started to dance seductively, waving her but, blowing kisses, but after a few minutes, she started to belch. She would stop he dance to burp and then continue, eventualy, she stopped dancing all together and did nothing but belch. Raichu was still staring though. \"Man that girl is Hot! She really knows how to burp!\" His enthusiasm for belching caused his stomach to produce more gas, increasing the frequency of his belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was drooling. The same Raichu was put back on the screen. Raichu was excited, hoping to see her belch some more, but instead she just stood there, shooting him looks. He thought it was quite entertaining to be flirted with by the mouse. The subliminal message switched to \"slobber is good. Drooling is good. Its natural. Its beautiful.\" And after a few minutes the Raichu on screen started to drool just a bit, enough to coat her lips, then it picked up, and she started to slobber all over herself. Her drool covered the entire white part of her belly. She stared at him seductively, drool streaming down her front. \"Damn! Hypnosis nothing,  they seem to just be showing me videos of hot Raichu's\" His own drool started to pick up steam as he started to have a streak like the Raichu in the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"manners are bad at the table. eat as fast as you want. don't wipe your chin. just eat\" The Raichu was on the screen again, belching and slobbering. This time she had an assortment of food with her. She started with a bowl of pokechow. She started to eat it normaly, but she picked up the pace. She started to shove the food in her mouth. The sexy mouse, was eating everything with her mouth open, a dribbled chins everywhere. After a bit she finished the bowl and moved onto a cake. She shoved her face into the cake and started to devour it. Her face was smeared with cake. \"Man. What an eater. I'd love to meet that Raichu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it cut to Raichu standing, and once again she started dancing. But as she danced she started to get fatter. \"fat is good. fat is beautiful. flab is sexy.\" Her once trim body grew fat, and she turned into a dancing blob of a mouse. \"Man what an obese chick! This place no what a hot pokemon looks like.\" He then looked down and saw how skinny he was. \"I'm gonna half to bulk up fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a human was on the screen. He looked well dressed, and mannered. \"neatness is bad, manners are bad. Neaties are backwards. Neaties are servants.\" The humans closed changed to a white shirt and pants, with a collar on their necks to mark them as servants of the slobs. The picture changed to the Raichu ordering a human to feed her. \"Cool! Those neat freak humans are slaves here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Subliminal messages stopped, leaving him wondering why it was called the hypnosis room. All he did was watch an incredibly sexy Raichu give him a show. The human came back in, this time in the club uniform. \"Neat Freak!\" He said in a dominating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not nearly fat enough. Take me to *urrpp* someplace in this club where I can build up some flab.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a belly that was as large as he was. Her fat had even made her taller! She would tower over him! He imagined her squishing him under her massive gut.

Her front side was soaked in drool, and the viscous liquid dripped from all parts of her. \"Ready to get stuffed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Any time!\" and stared at her like he was hypnotized<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, \"Nice to have a loyal fan.

We're going to get rid of all your manners before we do anything else.\" Raichu was confused since he listed it as being third. The human seemed to understand his question. \"The order really doesn't matter, as long as they all get done.\" The human picked up our hero and took him into a room, with a chair in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was simple and devoid of any decorations on the cold and baron metal wall, Raichu was placed on the chair, and the human walked out, shutting the door behind him. The chair was stuffed really well, and Raichu relaxed and got comfortable. Then a speaker came on. It produced a very high pitched tone that instantly put Raichu into a hypnotic trance. He closed his eyes, and listened very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are under the influence of the slob master. Do you understand me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to do everything that I say aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of belching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you will love it. You will love burping, and hearing other people burp. You will think its fun, and not think twice about it understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belching is good. Its fun to burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now slobbering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its dirty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Slobbering is great. Its natural. Its completely normal to have a trail of saliva dripping down your chin. You will think that slobber is normal, and will find it unusual to not be drooling all the time. What do you think of slobbering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its completely natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its unatractive and bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't. From now on your will think of fat as being attractive. You will think nothing is sexier than an obese chu waddling, jiggling as she moves along. You will want to be as fat as possible, to be sexy yourself, so all the obese pokemon will like you. What do you think of fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best thing ever! I hope I get nice and fat soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can get, I want to be fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fast as possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the best way to eat is with your mouth open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, It's the best way to eat. You get crumbs all over yourself, not to mention its attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. From now on, you will eat with your mouth open. You will not think twice about it, as it will feel natural, and you will feel no urge to wipe your, chin. How will you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my mouth open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, act like I've said, and you'll surely have all the hot, slobby 'chus here trying to get at you. Now neat people. What do you think of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're okay I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're strange. They think slobber is bad, fat is unattractive, and belching is rude. Those things are good and polite. Neat people are backwards people. We let them serve us. Slobs are more important than neat people. Remember, neat people serve your needs, they are the workers. You are their master. They give you food, and tend to you. What do you think of neat people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, When you hear the tone, these teachings will sink in, and you will think like a fat, dirty slob. You will have your body modified to be a better slob.\" The tone sounded again and Raichu came out of his trans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was confused for a second, and didn't feel right. He looked over himself. Skinny. No slobber down his chin. No crumbs either! He hadn't burped in a while. He felt like the ugliest Raichu ever! He needed to put on at least 50 pounds, and he wasn't drooling enough. Then a human came in. Raichu noted that the human was skinny, very skinny, wasn't drooling, looked properly groomed, probably ate with utensils... a NEAT human. One of his slave. \"Backwards neat freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human smiled, seemingly able to understand the Raichu now, \"Yes sir?\"</span></div></div>",

The raichu's body was showing clear signs of taking on the belch, though still very plush looking, he was clearly much rounder now, and it wasn't long until he was larger still, and larger STILL.  He opened his eyes and could barely see over his bloated cheeks.  He could taste Pikachu's breathe and her drool down his throat, his arms and legs wiggled helplessly as he grew uncontrollably...he was panicking, a squeak of gas escaped from his rear as he rolled around in place.  Clearly Pikachu had lost track of just what she was doing, the kiss was heavenly, but he was going to explode!  His body was enormous and he couldn't reach to push the fat pika off his orb-like body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has to let it out somehow, but how? </span></div></div>",

Her eyes had swollen and bulged from their sockets, signaling things might have gone too far.  A river of drool had ran down the Raichu's front, sealing the kiss on the two originally, and as if in slow motion they seperated...several gooey strings of saliva pulling from their mouths.  Raichu watched, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, drool coating his fat face, as the Pikachu slowly rolled back, body creaking ominously...he was sure she was going to explode at last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAA-<br>\r\n-AAAAAAAAAAATFOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHH!\" Pikachu's rear opening had ballooned outward and finally expelled one giant gasious eruption the likes Raichu could only imagine.  The sheer force sent Pikachu into the ceiling, rebounding her into the floor and again lauching her into the walls with a fart-fueled spin, and more than a few times she slammed into the obese raichu's fat belly, smooshing him like a gel-filled stress ball, this in turn sent her one last time into the far wall, cracking her head and landing her on her back.  Her body had deflated until she held the smaller and still fat puffed Pika appearance.  There she lay, squirming as her stretched anal opening blew the remaining gas out like a foghorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu hefted his fat ass and sloshed to her side, looking over her and rubbing her thick flesh.  \"Wow kid, I'm impressed!\" He snorted through his fat snout and inhaled the viscous flatulence that filled the room.  \"I don't think I could have done any better...\"  Pikachu moaned and groaned, rubbing her fat head, dizzyness rocking her vision, the blurry fatass Raichu finally coming into clear view...he was standing over her, and without much care, drool dribbled from his mouth and hit her in the face several times.  \"What's next?\" she joked, rubbing the drool from her face, giving her little fingers a lick.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned to look at Pikachu. what he saw was an enormous yellow ball with arms, legs, and a head sticking out. The Yellow mass let out a long fart. \"Ahhhhhhh, that *Oof* hit the *Brauup* spot.\" Said the bloated Pikachu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu just moaned in response.

He started to drool right there, and from the surprise he broke off the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a lot of her saliva on his chin and belly, but now he felt drool flowing over his mouth, down his chin and over his belly. It was only a few seconds before his entire front side was coated in a layer of drool. He marveled at himself. Even after he closed his mouth, it seeped out through his lips. \"Awesome\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slobber queen smiled, \"Now, Go get some fat on *urrrrpppp* those bones! Maybe come back to see me some time saliva boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called for his human outside the door. \"Neatie! I need to go to a fattening course. And I don't care how much you neat freaks don't like drool, you're carrying me there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" The human responded. Raichu enjoyed commanding these humans around.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't eating and so he waddled over to some more food that he hadn't eaten, only to feel his footing and flew forward.  Outside the Snorlax the people had just arrived at the Snorlax sanctuary.

That wasn't surprising, but what was, was how big these particular Snorlax were.  Pichu figured that food must have been in abundance here for them to eat like this.  It wasn't before Pichu began chowing down on fruit, berries, and even trays of sweets spread out around there.  He ate so much that if he was still a normal Pichu he'd have burst, but he kept stuffing his face.  Other side effects of the change included that his saliva glands were over producing saliva in his mouth he began drooling all over himself.  Also, his food consumption was getting out of hand.  He was putting more food in his mouth than he could swallow and his face was getting covered in food.  Some even rolled onto his stomach.  He ate one last cherry before he felt unbelieveably tired.

They at first thought him to be a small yellow munchlax but when they got a closer look they saw he was a pichu, a very fat pichu at that.  Upon making this discovery they quietly and calmy took him to the meeting room and showed him to the other members of the SCU.  They were all talking loudly about the unusual find and some even took pictures.  Just as one hypothesized, he was in such a deep sleep that he didn't even flinch.<br>\r\n   They brought him to a lab and started to try some experiments.  T'hey took out a pokeflute and played it to wake him prematurely.  When he began to stir he looked around the room for food for a few minutes.  When he realized there wasn't any he was shocked to find he wasn't where he was when he slept and there were dozens of people around him.  A female scientists forced them to leave as she saw the terrified look on his chubby face.  She then took out an instrument for taking some DNA, a doughnut.  She held it up in front of the shock proof cage he was in and he instantly began to drool a lot.  It dripped down a tiny hole in the container and into a petri dish.  She began to analyze it and saw how his genetic structure looked on a computer and compared it to pichu and snorlax genetics she had on file.  To her astonishment, the pichu's genetics hadn't just changed, but were still changing.  He was actually becoming more and more like a snorlax, but some of his genes remained dominant to that of the snorlax genes.  She looked back at pichu to perform her next test when she encountered two more surprises.  The first was sections of his yellow fur were being replaced with dark blue fur, just like that of a snorlax.  The second was that the doughnut on the table she showed him never left his sight and all this time he was drooling.  There was so much he was up to his neck in it.<br>\r\n   She quickly opened the drain in the cage and then gave him the doughnut to put his saliva glands at rest.  He put the whole thing in his mouth, chewed it fast and swallowed it in one gulp.  His body puffed out almost instantly from it and then let out a belch.  It was so loud that the ground actually shook from it.  She jotted this down on her notes.  She then took him out of the cage and toweled the saliva off of him before taking him to his second test.  He was placed into another room.  This one full of food.  Food of all kinds.  Snorchu's saliva went into work again.  And he jumped out of her arms and began eating again.  She locked the door, not that she expected him to leave, but in case any of the snorlax were in the building for a check-up and were hungry (like snorlax were ever awake and not hungry).  She watched from the one way window with a few other scientists and watched him as he ate.  He had just started and already looked fatter.  He was about 70 lbs. now and each bit of food he swallowed seemed to make him even fatter.  His drool was out of control as it poured from his mouth as he ate.  It ran down his chin and onto his stomach.  Some even dripped on the floor.  And every once in a while Snorchu would let out a loud belch or fart that seemed to shake the area like an earthquake.<br>\r\n   The scientist looked at her notes and made her hypothesis.  She believed that the genes that this pichu, she classified as snorchu (coincidence, huh?) got from a snorlax by unknown means was afecting him in some ways, but not enough to make him a full fledge snorlax.  He'd gain the eating habits and the metabolism, but pichu's didn't have a weight limit gene that all snorlax have and this one didn't get one either.  This meant he'd continue to gain weight and in theory could even get fatter than a snorlax.  Some of his body structure was already changing to help him alter his body to allow him to handle the weight, like keeping him mobile.  She noted that his feed seemed to be enlarging in a way to allow him to move, though he'd only be able to waddle.  She wasn't sure if he'd get so fat he'd be able to move anyway, but she would take care of that when they came to that bridge.  She also noted more parts of his body had dark blue fur, though some still had yellow, like his bulging belly.  She also believed that a snorlax's natural ability to eat food and not get gas and their smaller saliva glands weren't in the equation.  Snorchu's pichu saliva glands were in overdrive because of this and his inability to maintain gas forced the rest of his slobby habbits.  She still needed more research so she'd have to continue observation for quite some time.  Snorchu didn't seem to have any complaints.</span></div></div>",

As time passed it became evident that Snorchu wasn't eating as much as he normally did and it was apparent his hair was reverting to the normal yellow.  She could only conclude that it was a result of the host's body rejecting the dna like it would a virus.  She put her career on the line for this experiment and if she didn't bring positve results for possible pokemon geneitc breeding she'd be ruined.<br>\r\n   Fortunately, she kept Snorchu under her observation alone.  Nobody else had even seen him since the first day he was discovered.  She quickly brought him into her private lab and placed him in a special tank.  She placed an oxygen mask over his mouth and then flooded the container with water.  Snorchu didn't understand what was happening, but over the time he was with her he had grown quite attached to her and listened to her as if she were his trainer.  Whatever she was doing now he trusted her.<br>\r\n   She began pressing buttons on the computer and began introducing snorlax dna into the tank.  She used the data she received from the first test and gave him a more potent amount.<br>\r\n   \"All right, Snorchu, I know you are probably still injured from your own electricity when you use electric attacks, but I need you to fill the container with electricity for a few minutes.  If everything goes correctly you'll regain the snorlax dna.\"<br>\r\n   Snorchu did as he was told and release a stream of electricity.  Suddenly he felt the lightening zap him and felt the tingling he felt every time he ever used his electricity.  He glanced at her and saw she wanted him to turn up the voltage and he did so.  The numbing sensation began hurting a little, but he didn't stop until she told him to do so.<br>\r\n   After a few minutes he heard her tell him to stop and he did so gasping in the mask.  He felt a little strange after everything that happened.  He usually felt drained after using so much electricity at once, but he also felt like he wasn't himself.  She showed him his image in a mirror and could hardly recognize himself.  His ears were wider and resembled a snorlax.  So did his hands and feed.  His yellow fur was changing color before his eyes and an even more powerful hunger came to him than ever before.  She held out a donut and drool poured from his mouth instantaniously.  She handed him the doughnut and carried him into the same room he had his last feast and showed him it was fully stocked.  She let him loose and he began to eat with gusto.</span></div></div>",

Lucario got up ( It took about fifteen minutes to get to his knees) and waddled the best he could to the cupboards. Using the counter he set his fat upon it and reached up as far as he could. Lucario was about a foot away from reaching the cupboards then he saw a chair. He set his fat belly off the counter and went to pick up the chair. When Lucario got to it he tried to pick it up but when he bent over his stomach was too big to reach over, so he got behind it and pushed with his stomach. When the chair was all set up Lucario again set his fat on the counter then got on the chair. Lucario reached the cupboards and opened it. Looking inside he realized that this was the wrong cupboards. He then got off looked where the right cupboards were and got his big belly of the counter and scooted the chair into the right spot. Lucario then set his fat on the counter again and got on the chair again. Lucario now sweating after all that work was extremely mad and hungry reached up into the cupboards and started eating at a fast pace. When Lucario was doing this he wasn't thinking about how much the chair could handle, soon he realized this when he heard a snap thinking it was the chair (and was right) Lucario jumped onto his belly that was already on the counter ( the jump was more like a five inched hop and pulling with his arms) looking down he saw the chair collapse. Lucario turned back to the cupboards and started eating at an even faster pace. Soon he was done, before Lucario was about five feet in diameter with moobs the size of dodge balls each now he was about eight feet in diameter with his moobs the size of a basketball each. With the house empty of food Lucario was still hungry now deciding on what to do Lucario smelt the bakery from the city come in, and he looked at Mew and Mewtwo where they looked completely big and delicious.</span></div></div>",

Most Humans aren't as grateful to them as you are.\" The trainer started to back away from Mewtwo as he kept walking to him, much to his delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you keep them rail thin like all other humans because you think being fat is 'bad for you'\" The trainer backed up into a tree, trapping himself.

The tree behind him groaned as Mewtwos weight was pushing it out of the ground. Mewtwo, the mind reader he is, read the trainers thoughts. 'He's so...soft\" the trainer thought. 'I know I should be disgusted at this or at least no tlike it, but he's just so cuddly' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo, surprised at this, leaned back to his orginsl stance, not enough to release the trainer from his grip, but enough to stop grinding him against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, little human?\" Mewtwo grinned and slapped his belly, making it wobble and dance for a couple seconds. In response, the trainer blushed profusely, his face going tomatoe red, trying not to show any emotion, but failing horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you see things my way\" Mewtwo stepped back from the trainer and turned around to face his Pokemon, while giving the trainer a good view of his big fat rear end and tail.

Soon, their minds were set to a similar tune to Mewtwos, one that involved eating, gaining weight, belching, and drooling. Almost immediately after the process was done, they all made a b-line to their food. What once was a proper meal was now a mere snack, as the Pokemon demolished their bowls of poke chow in seconds and still craved more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo anticipated this and took the liberty of lifting the rest of the Poke chow in the bag out directly into their mouths. They were surprised at first, but soon relaxed as a steady stream of food filled their growling stomachs. Mewtwo was only too happy to help, eager to spread his message of fatness around the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they going to be okay?\" the trainer asked, concerned for much his Pokemon was eating in one filling. Mewtwo rolled his eyes. His concerns were appreciative, but not needed. With a smirk, he let himself fall back towards the tree, resting comfortably against the creaking tree bark and a once again trapped human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human,\" Mewtwo said firmly but kindly, as if he was talking to a child. :I understand your concerns for your friends, but i think it might do you good if you let me take care of the situation without you interrupting.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" the trainer asked hesitantly, not wanting to annoy a psychic god who has him pinned against a tree, \"what should i do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo smirked and wiggled his rear end, wedging the human further around his body and wrapped his fat tail around him and the tree. \"Get comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer now was blushing an ever deeper shade of red then before, finding himself at lost for words. meanwhile, his Pokemon were doing more then fine. He could hear his Charizard roar loud with pleasure, and could make out beyond Mewtwo's neck fat that his pale yellow gut has swelled rather largely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See human?\" Mewtwo remarked, \"Pokemon are MUCH more happy being big fat slobs then skinny sticks used for battle. You should be proud, you're witnessing the first of millions of Pokemon to be liberated from their evil trains of thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, all things must come to an end, just like the endless stream of food, which had ran out of Poke chow from the bag to deliver. Although still hungry, the Pokemon took time to appreciate their new bodies. They had all gone from their sleek, muscle bound form to moderately chubby, a good sized layer of fat coating their bodies. it wasn't long after that when a steady but small gush of drool started to escape their mouths. The Arcanine actually gave a descent sized belch and got a round of cheers from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...not that im not..kinda enjoying this but...could I see my Pokemon now?\" the trainer asked as quietly as he could. Mewtwo calculated that their bodies were officially slobs now, so he released his tail around the human and gave him just enough room to wriggle out from behind him. He still wanted to play with his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he was released from his captor, the trainer was trapped again by his overly affectionate Delphox tackling him to the ground. It rubbed it's pudgy form against it's master, eager to show him it's newfound girth. \"Haha! Hey Delphox! I see you put on a few pounds there.\" The trainer quipped coolly. His face started to get covered with drool but he didn't mind, what made his Pokemon happy made him happy, so he was more tolerant then most people about getting drooled on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo surveyed the campsight and put his paws on his blubbery hips. \"My work here is done. Goodbye Human. I hope you enjoy this gift i gave you.\" Mewtwo said and then floated himself into the sky, ready leaving the fire type Pokemon fat and happy.</span></div></div>",

Their trainer was worried about their, not to mention his own safety. \"Now human. I think you'll find they're in better shape. Belching, slobbering, and probably a lot hungrier than they were before. I just need to make a few alterations to your mind.\" He started to reach into the human's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan this strange pokemon had really helped him out. Keeping them thin.

He chomps, barely crushing the food before he swallows, a painfully large bulge in his neck appearing before it sank to his fat belly.  Mew giggles from afar, knowing full well this is her chance...a quick psychic attack on Mewtwo's brain and...perfect!  \"The gluttonous pig...without any inhibitions, he'll never stop!\" Mew giggled once again and watched the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo blinked for a moment, as if something had struck him in the neck...everything fell to the floor just like that.

As large as his cheeks could be, they held fast, and soon he vomitted all over himself.  Or so he felt.  He looked down his fat front and saw thick clear liquid...drool.  Gallons of it had just been hurled on himself.  He lifted his arms and saw it dripping down in viscious dropplettes.  \"Disgusting!  Undignfi...\" and without warning he heaved more drool forth, his tongue sliding out and dripping with more slime than he had ever imagined possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his fat face, what was going on?  He snorted, his tail slapped the seat he was in and the hunger began again, bags of snacks and candybars and bottles of liquids of every sort began to float into the air once again.  He belched wetly, spewing drool forward and opened his mouth as wide as he could, there was no time to think...time to eat!  Food flew into his opened maw and his body swelled out, like tumors he'd bulge in spots and grow, his rear fattened up and drooped to the ground, his tail thickened up and lifted him, arms took on large bulges, his sides had thick stretch-mark ridden rolls that oozed into a great fat belly.  He was pulling food in from miles and miles around, grease, lard, salty snacks, full meals were going down his gullet and fattening him up.  His enormous belly gurgled and rumbled, Mewtwo leaned onto one hefty cheek and his tail twitched as he farted loudly.  \"Disgusting pig!\" he thought to himself...but he drooled onto his obese form and rubbed it into his fat folds, a grin on his face, lifting his cheeks again and expelled more gas, farting harder and louder than the last.  He sat and wheezed, inhaling his own stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to train for something new...respect is given to those bigger than others, he thought.  A wet belch bubbled up from his mouth, food floating around his head.  He slapped his obese body and watched his ocean of fat sway this way and that.  \"So...\" he said out loud, to noone.  \"I have to be bigger than the world!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drool sputtered from his mouth and he looked well beyond content with the obesity that had taken over his once trim and powerful body.  He opened his eyes lazily and mrrred audibly, he sent out a mental command to the pokemon, his true subjects, and before long they too had swarmed his monsterous body and began rubbing at his bulk, and, Mewtwo noticed, bathing him in their drool!  As each pokemon hefted itself onto his body they began to spew the viscous liquid onto their blobby master and massaging it in.  One group of Pokemon, consisting of a Kangaskhan, a Cubone, Charmeleon, and a Pidgeot began to spread the massive butt cheeks of their master.

The smell of the flatulence and the heat coated them...it was impossible not to inhale the stink.  Mewtwo mrred once more, a healthy release, he thought, but there was more?  He felt his rear beginning to spread again, the Pokemon were reacting to his flatulence in a most peculiar way...their bodies were surging with fat, the Charmeleon's tail exploded from the gas before being smothered by his fat rear, the Pidgeot had become a ball of lard, barely able to breathe, Cubone's bone helmet cracked and busted into pieces as his head became too fat for it, Kangaskhan appeared as an overripened melon now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Mewtwo thought.</span></div></div>",

Mewtwo frowned at the lack of improvment. But thinking back to it, he had burped twice sending his droll over everything and nothign happened then, this should have been obvious. Suddenly a rumble shot up his throat and he let out a sudden blasting belch without warning. The pokemon and the humans holding them were pushed back and went tumbling down Mewtwo's belly. The pokemon being smaller got down faster than the Humans who's larger bodies caused them to get caught up more. The Totodile came rollign to a halt in a mud puddle in front of Mewtwo and looked around lazily. He didn't seem to care he was cover in mud. After a few moments a blast of bubble erupted beside him as he let one loose and insteed of gasping in horror at his lack of control like he had before he insteed sighed out of relief and relaxed in his messy puddle. The Swellow rolled into the side of a Pokemon gording from the many piles of food Mewtwo had placed around his subjects to either eat or be fed from. The Pokemon looked surprised and dropped a meatball hoggie on top of Swellow getting sause all over her. Swellow just looked at the mess coverign her and looked up at the pokemon and opened her mouth hopping more would fall. The pokemon oblidged and dropped another treat into her mouth, a cake. The cake fell in and around her mouth sending crumbs down the sides of her cheeks. The Swellow happliy ate as drool poured from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo marveled at how much an effect his burp had had on their minds. Suddenly Mewtwo became aware of the humans decent down his belly. They felt far heavier than before. looking down he was shocked to see the Humans were quite fat now. The Girl was close to 350 pounds, her dress was in shreads as her belly swelled up and spread her legs to either side. Her arms were thick and hug on either side of her inflating belly. she landed with a thud on her fattening rear and began to sob at her new body. Slowly as she realized she couldn't even stand up under her new wieght still having the muscles of a 120 pound girl she creid harder the tears running down her chubby cheeks. The boy was just as fat his shirt riding up over his belly. he panted hard trying to stand and huffed as he only managed in tilling forward far enough to rest on his belly more than his but. His reaction was frustration as no matter how hard he tried his fat had him pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo marvaled at this and suddenly a thought struck him. Turning to the man he has used earlier in his experiment Mewtwo saw he wasn;t as sickly looking as he had been at first. The Man was now seated on a nearby bench ignoring hi Pokemon's demands for food. He was taking in deep breaths of the foul air that permiated the area near the ground now that there were so many slobs. He hadn't even tried to remove the gastly smelling shirt that had absorbed so much of Mewtwo's fart, he just didn't seem to care. Mewtwo quickly yanked the two humans who were now fat from his burp and flung them behind himself forcing a large fart out and blasting them. bringing them back to his veiw the two coughed a few times and their eyes teared up. But then they stopped, the girl's expression turned from saddness to a dull uncaring look. drool began to trickle from her mouth and soon incressed as she hung midair uncaring only wonderign when Mewtwo would let her down so she could eat. The boy coughed once more then opened his mouth as if to puke but inseed a burp came out of his mouth. the effect of being midair caused the belch to propel him backwards and slowly he spun. Head over heals he twisted midair untill his rear was pointed up and without warning her farted changing his momentem so he flew downwards gettign his head stuck in Mewtwo's many rolls of fat. Between Mewtwo's fat rolls was a sweaty horrible smelling mess of food crumbs and body oder that made his farts smell like flowers. However the boy didn't seem to care his head was in such a foul place and just took normal breaths, after a few moments he even felt the boy's tounge probing around licking up sweat covered food crumbs. Mewtwo let the two humans down by the nearest food pile and immediatly they begand rocking themselfs face first into the piles and ate like pigs. Mewteo admired thier eagerness even finding the Human's new slobiness made them quite enjoyable to watch. As well Mewtwo could sense the thoughts of the pokemone around him as they took notice of the two test humans tranformation. Their new love of slobbiness made them love the humans as much as they loved pokemon, and the humans tending to the pokemone seemed to envy them. Mewtwo smiled his mental conditioning had taken hold so well and decided to reward them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away a soda bottling plant shook as one of the tanks tore from the ground and flew away. Back at Mewtwo the tank reached his mouth and her tore it off with his powers. slowly Mewtwo poured the carbonated drink past his towering fat cheeks into his mouth until it was all gone. Mewtwo wrapped his psyhic powers around his belly and made it churn. Everyone watched in awe as Mewtwo's massive gut swayed back and forth as the several thousand gallons worth os soda begand to fizz up and expand. Mewtwo's belly began to swell up like bread dough and pushed everyone near it onto their butts as it surged forth and knocked them over. Suddenly the ground began to shake. slowly at first then turnign to a rummble the gas in Mewtwo began to burst through his system shaking the country side untill..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-<br>\r\nPHHPHHHPHHPHHHHPHHPHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEER-<br>\r\nBRAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP-<br>\r\nFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAP-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo let out a monumental Belch and Fart in equal messures at the same time. A thick cloud of smog filled the town and blacked out the sun. Coughing could be heard all over as Pokemond and Human alike fought for air. but the coughing suddenly stopped and the smog dissapeared at an alarming rate as everything in the area started breathing in the smog as much as they could tryign to suck the foul cloud of smelly gas into their lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cloud subsided everyone was fat drooling messes. Human and pokemon were now equaly fat slobs. The humans now all begged for food as their pokemon had and wore the same lazy expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo was almost happy with his work when sudden;y he realized something. Both the pokemon and Humans had slipped from his control. They still all reveared him as being the greatest for being fatter and slobbier than they were, but their lazier mental processes and lack of careing had left their minds unable to process the forces of Mewtwo's psyhic powers trying to make them his slaves. They still embraced the slobby lifestyle and effect of his gasses on him but mentaly they were back to the way they had been before his arrival. Mewtwo thought about this. They still honored his suppiority as the slobbiest but did not serve him, They were all slobs as the world should be, but humans were now equal to pokemon rather than the humans serve the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo tried to decide between his desires for a slob world or his lust for power. </span></div></div>",

Mew didn't want to admit this was her fault right off but the prank was getting way out of hand, Mew's mental plants in Mewtwo's mind to like being a slob had warpped him. Mew decided her only hope was to open up a direct link to Mewtwo's mind and keep him busy with argument while she tried to undo her mental tricks. This was dangerous since it ment Mewtwo would have access to her mind as well but she was confident she could resist his will and sneak past his defences at the same time, she was stronger after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop please!\" her Mind called out into Mewtwo's brain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you!\" Mewtwo replied \"No! Besides a pokemon so thin and clean as you has no buisness even talking to me! Come back when you're a pink ball of fat and covered in drool...\" He scoffed and started forward again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew cut him off \"No you don't understand! This is my fault! It was a joke that got out of hand!\" Mew pleaded trying to reach into Mewtwo's mind and unblock his formor thoughts \"Look at you! Your huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have looked at myself\" Mewtwo responded \"and it's wonderful, I and all my Slob subjects are glorious and perfect. My body has changed as well. I am the Slob savior of this world. My body has transformed to emit powerful chemicals that transform every being into wonderful Slobs, We was the choosen, all who join us become as holy and sacred as we are. But of course you should see for yourself...\" Mewtwo concluded and began to press on Mew's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew had reached the part of Mewtwo's mind where she had mucked around but she couldn't find the mental twists she had left, his mind seemed untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for the changes you thought you made to my mind?\" Mewtwo asked, his control had taken Mew by surprise, she was so focused on undoing her chnaged she hadn't noticed Mewtwo's pcyhic powers wrapping around her own, he was entering her mind and was aware of what she was trying to do. \"There are none, You thought you were playign a joke on me but in reality your so called tricks only liberated my true self. This is my destiny, and now I will liberate your mind so it can be yours too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good, Mewtwo's mind had absorbed the mental changes and he was turning into some kind of slob god because of it. Mew could feel his presence entering his mind. She could feel his will pushing on her own trying to turn her into a Slob God as well, she heard his thoughts saying something about \"Slob Queen\". Mew Pushed back but he was already partway in the door of her mind. Mew's will fired back and for a short time it seemed like she may push him back out without any changes. But then new voices appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around Mewtwo the Slob Humans and Pokemone hooved around watching the mental battle. They began to get mad a non slob would challange the greatest slob of all. Their mind hurled insults at her. They called her a skinny speck of nothing. A clean waste of space. Her mouth didn't drool OR burp so what good was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these insults were very meaningful to Mew but they were negative and filled with discust for her lack of Slobbiness. The massive about of negative mental enegy growing around Mewtwo directed at her started to take it's toll. Mew's mind was assulted with the hate for her clean thin body. Mewtwo's will started to creak past Mew's reistance. In a last effort to stop him Mew blasted the assult of Mewtwo and Hate with her powers. But the mental energy against her was to strong. It was alike a grenade went off only inches in from of her. Mew's mind was blasted and shut down, Mew began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo brought a group of humans and Pokemon around below Mew. Mew fell onto their soft but filty rolls of fat. They all expressed discust being touched by something so unslobbenly but Mewtwo silenced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is unconsious, her mind is beyond my reach, currently an unbreakable mental sheild if protecting her in this vunerable state, But the seed is planted. In the last few moments i gifted her mind with the same changed she gave me but they are small and will take several days to grow and do to her what was don to me. In time she will become a Slob like us, if we allow her to change natually she should become our new Slob Godess with her own Slob power different than mine. I best not use my Slob gasses on her to speed the process, it could turn her mind to mush as it has some of yours and then her pcyhic powers will be lost as well as the potential for s Slob Godess. Besides, won't it be fun to watch such a clean thin creature slowly submit to the power of the slob? I for one know I will enjoy seeing her slowly progress from a non slob to my Queen of the Slobs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow come my beautiful Slobs I want to make sure we are near plenty of food when she comes to, Our soon to be godess will feel her forst hunger pangs when she comes to. I want her to be well surrounded by temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo started to move his flock again as Saffron City came into view.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun started to climb into the sky as the morning began for Saffron City. Everywhere the city was coming alive with people and pokemon moving this way and that on their way to work or doing their errans and their pokemon accompanying them. Few noticed when a purple mass started to rise on the horizon. It wasn't until the giant purple blob began to hover closer and closer to the city and blocked out the sun before everyone took notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo Hovered only 50 feet above the grount but his massive size and the low possition of the sun in the sky caused him to vast a vast shadow across all of the city. People began to panic, Pokemon ran about loss fro mthair masters in fear of the huge pokemon sensing his power and wicked intent. This chaos was exactly what Mewtwo wanted. As the city paniced Mewtwo began tearing the roads up that exited the city. Cars coming and going from the city were lifted and hurled within city limits before being returned to the ground. Every path out of the city was shreeded and buried. Next Mewtwo moved his slob followers in a ring around the city forming a barrirer of obese human and pokemon slobs. Despite their bodies ranging from 300 to 450 pounds and the large number of them still there were gaps in the wall, so now Mewtwo began to pull vast amounts of food from the surrounding farms and food processing plants to feed his slobs and bringing the workers of these places along with the food to be placed in the city. Mewtwo did not take food from the city, infact he placed some of the food he brought in piles around the city, He wanted to ensure once his attack begun there would be plenty to eat. The food not sent to the city begand to swirl around the ring of slobs walling in the city. They lazily opened their mouths and let the flying food place itself in their mouths. All around the city Mewtwos slobs gordged. With a thunderous blast Mewtwo let out a lout fart and burp sending the gasses to surround his Slobs. as the haze cleared all the food was gone and the Slobs were tipping scales at nearly 900 pounds each, many were nothing more than balls of fat with a plump head resting on top. Mew had left a gap for himself, with a crashing thud he landed in the ring closing it up. The shock wave shook the city knocking everyone on to the ground. The City was now trapped and at Mewtwo's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo thought about all the experiments he could try. He wanted to see just what he could do with his powers and Slob powers combined. He was really starting to have fun with this, He was going to really to enjoy toying with this city and turning them all into glorious slobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo started a mental checklist on what he could try:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Gas a Human and their pokemon with only a fart so the Human becomes a slob and the pokemon get fat and see which one rubs off on the other more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Vice versa gas a Human and their pokemon with a burp so the Human is fat and the pokemon's slob and see who has a greater effect on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tell some of his victims they aren't leaving until they became slobs and see how long they snap and agree to be slobified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mentaly invade some of his victims minds and make them Slob lovers and see if they make themselfs slobs or try to force it on others<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Make the parents of a family slobs and see how they teach their children to be slobs as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Make some victims Slobs but keep their minds as they are and see if they try to fight it or give in and accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo smiled as even more ideas poured into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby Mew still lay on the belly of a rather fat, rather sticky, very smelly, Gardevoir. Gardevoir was the only pokemon that didn't express discust about being touched by a clean non slob. She actually enjoyed the thought of being the first to spend time with their future slob queen and be the first to get Mew dirty using her own filth. Mew sleepily began to coem to and looked around eventaully coming face to face with Gardevoir. Mew sat on Gardevoir's belly for a few akward moments before getting light headed from the smell of Gardevoir's food and sweat stained belly. Gardevoir opened her mouth to say hi but insteed a flood of droll poured out spraying Mew in the face. Gardevoir laughed and smiled at Mew over her fat covered cheeks but Mew was becoming horified over the situation. Trying to lift itself in the air with it's mental powers Mew found her psychic powers were still weak from the battle with Mewtwo and she was going to need a day or two of rest before she could do much with it, but none the less she should have enough to fly but she found she couldn't get off Gardevoir's belly. Looking down Mew quickly saw why, Gardevoir gut was covered in a sticky mess. Mew was stuck to Gardevoir's food covered belly, Gardevoir started to laugh again finding it adorable how confused Mew looked at how Gardevoir could let herself get so filthy. Gardevoir laughed so hard that the drool coming from her mouth covered Mew and washed down to her paws. Mew found the drool while sticky itself was cleaning off some of the sweet sticky mess that had her glued to Gardevoir. Mew managed to free herself from the drool and flith covered slob and tried to fly away to get as far away from Mewtwo as she could and think of a plan. But Mew was still weak. and couldn't get far, she saw Saffron City below her and figured it was better than nothing to hid in for now till she could get further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo smiled as Mew limply flew into the heart of his trap. She was so weak she couldn't even sense the thoughts of Mewtwo and his slobs to know what was going to happen to her. Mewtwo turned his attention to the City once more he could sense the thoughts of his future slobs in the city, they ere in a panic calling for help from anyone they could get a hold of, some were in TV broadcasting stations making pleas for anyone watching to help the trapped city, some were even trying to get past his wall of slobs but every time they would get near a man woman or pokemon slob, the slob would just burp in their face or let out a loud fart and the escapee would turn in terror holding thier nose as their eyes teared up. Mewtwo started tearing cell phone towers from the ground cutting off communications. Mewtwo knocked over broadcasting towers for radio and TV signals killing their ability to transmit and threw sadalite dishes around like frisbees. Only one Tv tower remained. In the studio of KKSC news anchor woman Sandy Stokes was making one of the pleas for help to anyone in broadcast range outside of the city to call for help from the army, little did she know Mewtwo had cleared every human pokemon and wild pokemon for a 2 mile radius and put them in the city to join in the slobification and there was hardly anyone left to see the broadcast who wasn;t trapped with her in the city. As Sandy spoke the window near her desk flew open and blew the papers and cue cards all over. As Sandy tried to keep her hair from being messed up a burp and a fart could be heard in the distance. Suddenly a thick smog came in the window and engulfed Sandy. The Camra men looked on in awe as the strange smoke came from no where and seemed to pool on Sandy. All that could be heard was coughing and hacking followed by a lout ripping noise. Then the coughing stopped and they could heard Sandy let out a loud moan of pleasure. Exchanging confused looks the Camara men didn't know what was going on, until the smog cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the haze lifted there sat Sandy, bursting from her clothing all over. At 500 pounds her red anchor suit was in sheads but she didn't seem to mind. Her round face sat on top her curvy body and smiled happily at the Camara as drool dribbled from between her lips. Sandy's fleshy arm moved to scratch her butt but it didn't reach so she just scratched as close as she could. Suddenly her eyes lit up and she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention Saffron City, This is TV anchor woman Sandy St-... Slob, Yes Sandy Slob here with breaking news for all of you clean unpure non slobs. The greatest Slob of them all Mewtwo has come to bring the gift of Slob to our undeserving city and liberate us from the hastle of hygine and exercice. Soon we will all be perfect Slobs free to eat all day and make total pig of ourselfs. rejoice fellow Saffronians, the age of the Slob is at hand. The City wide blockade will not end until we are all fat drooling smelly Slobs! So put down that salad and pick up a donut! Let your drool flow and gas rip! Lopsen your belts people, you won't be needing them anymore. Long live the Slob!\" She cried happily then began to pig out on a pile of food that was lifted through the window to her by some unseen force. All over Saffron City many of the citizins watched the decloration and then their favorite perky anchor girl gorde on a pile of food twice weight of her formor body getting the food all over herself and just making a pig out of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo closed the mental link with Sandy's mind, checking off \"Tell some of his victims they aren't leaving until they became slobs and see how long they snap and agree to be slobified.\" from his mental check list Mewtwo wondered what to try next as somewhere deep in the City Mew ducked around Alley's forced to run on foot for the first time in her life. Mew wasn't used to physical exerstion and was getting tired fast... also very hungry...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the living room of the Wilson family Cindy Wilson the mother had just seen the bizarre broadcast and turned to her husband Matthew Wilson for support but found he was equally amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... It's....? Did she.... Hun do you...?\" Cindy stammered unable to finish a sentence in her shock but Matt just looked down trying to form a coherent thought of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... not... sure?\" He meekly managed at last trying to put the confusion into a sentence hoping it would help understand it. It didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cindy put her hand to her head and grunted in pain. Before Matthew could react and ask what was wrong a similar pain hit him, a tightness of pressure pushed on their skulls and they leaned down gripping their heads trying to control it. In their heads Mewtwo spoke to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, you are now under my control, there is no argument. Obey.\" Neither Cindy nor Mat said anything in protest, their arms feel limply to their sides and they slumped forward in their chairs obeying as their master commanded. \"Now as you know there is only one true path for you: Slob, being a slob and loving the slob life.\" Cindy and Matthew nodded in agreement hung on every word that was blasted into their minds by sheer force. \"You are granted the honor of a free Slob life I will provide you through my powers but you must prove you deserve it. Cindy and Mat knew this all sounded wrong, they wanted to get him out of their minds, but he had to firm a grip on them, every moment they were linked to him was another moment their minds were being bent to his will, their subconscious resisted less and less, slowly accepting him as their god and loving the idea of his new plans for them. \"Now to earn this honor you need only give your children to me, You have a daughter named Sammantha, and a son named Mark and their pokemon, You will convert them to slobs by teaching them to love the Slob lifestyle, I will turn you all into slobs more and more as you perform this task, understood?\" Cindy and Matthew eagerly shook their heads happily so far under his control they didn't even remember how they ever lived as non slobs all this time, they wasted no time calling their children into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mommy?\" Sammantha said bouncing into the room happily. She was 7 years old and the picture of innocence with her blond hair done in pony tails and overalls that only went to mid thigh over top a sun yellow t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie no, don't use so much energy!\" Her mother quickly scolded \"You need to relax more, go sit on the sofa, and let your pokemon out so they can join you.\" Sammantha didn't understand but did as she was told and took a seat on the couch letting her Bellsprout and Marill out onto the cushions beside her. Cindy quickly brought out a large plate covered in sweets for Sammantha and her pokemon to snack on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I want you to clean this plate off understood honey?\" Sammantha's mom told her with a smile. Sammantha just opened her eyes wide gasping at the towering pile of confections and eagerly dug into the snacks along with her pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark!\" Mat yelled up the stairs \"I told you to get down here! This is very important young man, and bring your pokemon!\" He yelled as he moved between the fridge and living room sofa stacking all the food up around his daughter while Cindy patted their daughter's head and offered sweet after sweet to Sammantha and her pokemon as fast as they could eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what is it dad?\" Mark sighed entering the kitchen with is Snubbull in tow. Mark was 12 with short black hair and that dower expression on his face most teens wear 90% of the time. \"Where's the fire, where are you taking all the food?\" He asked as his father grabbed an entire shelf of cookies and crackers all at once from the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not important right now son just go sit on the living room with your sister and have something to eat\" his dad told him and rushed to the living room with the junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shrugged \"Whatever\" and motioned for his Snubbull to follow. Snubbull pranced into the living room and lept up onto the chair grabbing the first box of cheez-its and tipping it back to pour into his mouth. Mark came in behind him and pushed the spare boxes off the chair and plopped down next to his Snubbull and grabbed a box of cookies eating a few. \"So why are we doing this? Is all the food, like, about to go bad or something?\" He asked looking at his sister who was mid way through the plate of treats looking stuffed as their mom just kept picking up sweet after sweet and forcing them into her mouth, her pokemon in a similar fate were trying to turn their heads but Cindy was bigger and it didn't take much effort to push the soft pastries into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark it's important you just focus on eating right now\" Mat told him setting another stack of cookies next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Mark tried to protest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts son.\" His dad cut off \"Look it's very important for all of us if we get you kids into shape fast and prepare you, our family has a great opportunity before us and it all depends on if you and Sam can just sit back and trust us, Ok buddy? All you have to do is sit there and eat, easy right?\" Mat smiled and patted Mark on the head, handing Snubbull a new box of cheez-its as the previous one ran out and poured a pile of cookies into Mark's lap to eat. Mark was still dumb founded but he had no reason to suspect his parents of anything, for now he just started slowly eating the cookies in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mommy I'm full...\" Sammantha moaned, crumbs and frosting smeared around her mouth. Bellsprout lay on it's side with a noticeable bulge in it's stick like body and Marill sat on it's butt tipped back with it's arms on it's slightly rounder body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no sweetie there is so much more for you to eat... here eat these next\" Cindy said gently to her daughter and offered a package of Oreos each to Sammantha and her pokemon. Sammantha was too shy to object to anything forced on her and couldn't speak her mind very well, plus she loved her mother with all her heart so anything her mother asked of her she would do, including stuff her self silly if her mother asked her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" She said defeated and popped open the package of cookies twisting one open and gently licking the cream. Her pokemon seeing their trainer give in did as she did and kept eating since Sammantha was the only one among them capable of putting a stop to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no Baby, you don't eat like that...\" Cindy corrected her daughter \"Like this...\" She said and dug her hand into the package pulling out a stack of Oreos and sliding them all into her own mouth until her cheeks bulged and chewed bits of chocolate wafer crumbs spilling out the front dribbling down her chin as they mixed with drool. She dug her hand into the package again but this time turned them so they were like a tube as she pushed them past Sammantha's lips. She pushed her daughter's jaw shut and smiled as Sammantha did as she was told and chewed unable to stop crumbs and drool from leaking out of her mouth as well as her cheeks swelled with cookie and cream. Bellsprout and Marill exchanged distressed looks but soon realized Cindy was looking over at them as well. Not wanting to get stuffed like Sammantha they quickly grabbed for their packages of Oreos and stuffed a few in their mouth making grand chewing motions to show they were doing it to so Cindy would turn back to her daughter. They were still eating way more than they wanted but it was better than having twice the cookies crammed into them like Sammantha was receiving. Cindy smiled again and scooped out another stack of Oreos in each hand, one for her and one for her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was dumbstruck by what was going on but every time he slowed his eating pace his father would stop bringing in food and grab a donut to shove into his son's mouth. Mark didn't like the way that felt and was learning to keep his own mouth full rather than slow and have another pastry shoved in. Still he couldn't figure out what had gotten into his parents. Turning to his Snubull he was shocked to see him laying on his back with a fourth box of crackers held up in the air above him pouring them into his mouth. Snubbull threw the box aside and patted his gut which now stuck up and rocked sideways trying to grab a fifth box. Mark's dad brought in the last stack of junk food and aided Snubbull in his reach for a box of vanilla wafers and handed to the beached pokemon who happily bit the top open and dumped them into his mouth. Looking to his son Mat grabbed another donut and forced it into Mark's mouth which was once again empty as Mark stared at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Mark choked between bits of the forcibly inserted pasty \"Why are you doing this? Why is mom stuffing Sam? Why are we all trying to eat everything in the house?\" Mark tried to ask but got another donut shoved in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, don't waste time with silly questions.\" Mat told him and grabbed a plate of fudge to eat himself. \"We aren't eating *everything* in the house, Just the good stuff, none of that nasty fruit or discussing vegetables. As for why... why not?\" He chuckled and grabbed another donut. Mark saw the donut and quickly stuffed a handful of cookies in his mouth to keep it full, Mark's dad eyed him to make sure he kept up the pace then ate the donut himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wilson family chowed down in silence both parents constantly offering up more food to their children and pokemon keeping them stuffed.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town two girls sat in the park with their pokemon. One girl, Gillian, was about 20 she had short brown hair and a slender build at 120 pounds. Next to her were seated her pokemon, Swablu, Teddiursa, and Miltank. The other girl Marie had a lighter brown colored hair that almost looked like a dark blond in the bright light of the sun, hers was long enough to touch the middle of her back but pulled into thin bangs in front that framed her face she had a slightly curvier build as she was more heavy set than Gillian at close to 170 pounds. Beside her sat her pokemon, Smoochum, Wobbuffet, and Leafeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what's going on...\" Gillian said looking through the bushes at a parade of police cars , fire trucks , and ambulance racing back and forth around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First an eclipse, then an earthquake, now it sounds like the town is going crazy. I don't know Gill, must be something big.\" Marie said patting Smoochum's head and cuddling her in her lap. \"Any ideas smoochy?\" she asked playfully poking Smoochum. Smoochum looked up and her and smiled not wanting to admit she could sense Mewtwo's presence. Smoochum looked back at Marie's other pokemon and  Gillian's pokemon,  they all exchanged worried looks over what it meant. Marie noticed the exchange and lifted Smoochum up to eye level \"Come on girl you can tell us, I think we can handle whatever's going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain you can...\" A voice suddenly echoed in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wha, what...?\" Gillian stammered \"M-Marie please tell me that was you making that loud scary voice...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie just shook her head at Gillian. \"No...that wasn't me...\" She said scared. Smoochum hugged onto Marie in fear, Leafeon stood in a defensive stance by Marie and Wobbuffet got got beside them and looked sharp for any threats. Gillian glanced around nervously while her Swablu and Teddiursa ran to her and hugged each arm, Miltank tried to look brave and stood between Gillian and whatever may be threatening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na low boom sounded in the distance followed by a sort of rumble or roar, it was hard to tell. Suddenly a thick green cloud over took Marie and her pokemon. \"Marie!\" Gillian cried but before she could help a blue cloud rushed in from the other direction and engulfed Gillian and her pokemon. Marie and her pokemon hacked and coughed as tears streamed down their cheeks, the stench in the cloud was unimaginable Marie thought she might pass out, she even felt her arms getting heavier as if she was getting to weak to hold Smoochum anymore. Gillian and her pokemon took deep gasping breaths, the cloud was thick, very thick, it was so moist they felt like they were drowning, Gillian could feel it coating her body soaking her in the slimly stuff, then her clothes started to get very tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds started to thin. Marie felt dizzy, her head was fuzzy and she got tired, She let out a loud belch and shoved her hand down the back of her pants to readjust her panties. She didn't even seem to notice how heavy her lap felt till her pokemon started to cry for help. \"Smooch smooch!\" smoochum cried waving her arms at her sides helplessly. Marie blinked and lazily looked down \"Oh... Smoochum.... wait what happened you look different...\" Marie asked her head still fuzzy from the clouds effects, it didn't feel like it would ever get clearer. Smoochum was fat, she had blown up three times her size and taken on the shape of a ball. Leafeon helplessly kicked it's legs trying to move over a belly that touched the ground and lifted Leafeon's legs off the ground enough to seriously impede movement. Wobbuffet's tear drop shape was reversed as he got so fat his head was the smallest part of his body and the rest of him looked like a over-full water ballon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haze around Gillian lifted and she took a deep breath of the cleared air but as her chest lifted she could feel it was significantly heavier. Gillian was shocked to see she had developed a very large pair of beasts, she was now a D cup up from her original A cup. Gillian tried to lift her arms to feel the weight of them but they too were heavier. Gillian thought it was her pokemon still clinging to her arms but when she looked down at them Swablu and Teddiursa were not there but rather her arms were thicker and covered in flab. Gillian was having a hard time putting two and two together, the idea of being thin one minuet then exploding with fat the next was to unreal for her mind to process. Gillian looked at the rest of her body seeing the new fatter definitions, her gut stuck out below her chest pushing her shirt aside and resting on her lap down to mid thigh. Still Gillian couldn't understand why she was seeing this body engorged with fat where her body should be. Gillian didn't want to believe it, it couldn't be, her body she spent so long keeping tone and in shape just couldn't be a flabby out of shape ball of lard just like that! Gillian looked to her pokemon for comfort but they were all laying on their backs as if nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swablu, I'm still thin right?\" She tried to ask despite none of her pokemon paying attention to her crisis \"Tell me this is a bad dream, or that the gas is making me hallucinate!\" Swablu just slowly lifted her head and smiled at Gillian before letting out a loud obnoxious belch and used her cotton like wing to rub her belly. Gillian was shocked her little Swablu could be so vulgar, but then Teddiursa laying behind her picked his head up and winked at Swablu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teddi Teddi\" he said happily and Swablu blushed. Gillian couldn't understand her own pokemon anymore, the bond they had from years of being together always told Gillian exactly what her pokemon were thinking but now it was like her pokemon was on totally different wave lengths. Swablu closed her eyes and concentrated, Gillian could only watch wondering what would happen next. Swablu leaned forward and suddenly... let out a lout fart. Gillian gasped at the lack of manners her pokemon now had and Teddiursa just laughed and let one of his own rip. Miltank was at Gillian's feet smiling happily at her, Gillian looked up from having her head slumped down in frustration over the situation with hope maybe Miltank still acted normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miltank Mil!\" She cheerfully greeted as drool ran down her chin. Gillian's head slumped once more frustrated again, she didn't understand any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gill what happened girl?\" Marie asked suddenly, Gillian looked up to glare in anger at such a obvious question about such a horrible tragedy but was surprised by how fat Marie's pokemon were now, but Marie was spared this terrible burden she received, it looked like nothing happened to her, until Gillian noticed how much Marie noticed a trickle of drool hanging from Marie's mouth. Gillian looked back at her pokemon, just like Marie they were all drooling, and just like Gillian all Marie's pokemon were fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie...\" Gillian chanced a guess \"How do you feel about burping...?\" Gillian asked cocking her head to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this:\" Marie smiled and let a loud burp out, it received a chorus of cheers from Gillian's pokemon who all tried to match it with their own. \"That means I think it's wicked awesome\" Marie giggled. Marie didn't usually talk like that, Marie usually tried to sound professional and well read for fear of sounding like some air headed bimbo, but now she sounded like she didn't care about her vocabulary. Marie drove in the point by leaning to one side and letting out a fart, all her pokemon groaned in displeasure as they were all to big to move and stuck right next to the source of the foul odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all are performing so well, it's time I gave you a treat...\" The mysterious voice from before boomed \" Soon you'll be prefect enough to join us...\". A pile of various types of food floated past them from nowhere and was placed at their feet. It was stacked 3 feet high and 6 feet in diameter made up of fast food, candy, pastries, desserts, and other fattening foods like fried chicken and Ham covered in honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillian's stomach growled in delight as soon as she saw the food. She didn't want to eat it... she needed to lose weight... but it was so... heavenly. Gillian's will crumbled and she heaved herself sideways to get onto her hands and knees and crawled to the pile of food with vigor. Marie's pokemon followed close behind all tranced by the pile of food themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where are you guys going?\" Marie asked as her pokemon ran away from her and followed Gillian. Smoochum had to roll to get there, Wobbuffet was hopping as best he could sending shockwaves of flab  rippling through his body, and Leafeon was trying to push herself over the bloated belly she had as it drug across the ground. None the Less they all got to the pile of food at roughly the same time and just shoved their heads into the pile. They all came back out with food crammed into their mouths, crumbs and other messes spilling out and dribbling down their chins. Gillian couldn't cram the food into her mouth fast enough to satisfy her growing hunger, Smoochum, Wobuffet, and Leafeon all just shoved their heads back into the pile and gorged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaier watched awestruck by the site as did Gillian's pokemon. Gillian and Marie's pokemon may all have been fat blobs but they way all that food just clung to their chins and the mess it made, Marie just found it so damn sexy. Marie and Gillian's pokemon all crawled to the pile themselves to be closer to the display. \"Gill, that's so...\" Marie started then belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked awesome?\" Gillian asked through a mouth stuffed with food assuming that's what the burp meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was going to say beautiful\" Marie said hypnotized by all the honey dripping off the ham Gillian was stuffing into her mouth and dripping down her chin into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food?\" Gillian asked confused \"Then have some, it's SOOOOOO good\" Gillian moaned and grabbed for a hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no that mess you're making, it's sexy and-\" Marie started to lust but Gillian grabbed a set of barbecue ribs and crammed them into Marie's mouth. The warm sauce dribbled down her chin and clung to the underside of her jaw as it trickled down onto her chest. A wave of pleasure rocked Marie and she let the loudest fart yet rip, Marie let several more farts rip as each shudder of pleasure rippled through her body, she could even feel herself slightly moist down there from the orgasmic experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was effin' awesome!\" Marie screamed \"Food makes the best messes!\" She declared and started wolfing down the food. Gillian herself was enjoying the sight of Marie eating, it just felt... right, to see someone throwing their cares away and gorging themselves. She wanted to see more, she wanted to see Marie eat until Marie was as big as she was. She wanted to see Marie to fat to move, hell she wanted to see everyone turned into a big blob of fat. Gillian panted heavily from the thought of everyone getting fat. She looked for her pokemon, They had all taken to stuffing Marie's pokemon with food, not to feed them but rather to purposely see the food smear around their mouth and dribble down their chins. Marie's pokemon didn't seem to mind to much, it meant they were being fed even if it was getting everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie keep eating\" Gillian said suddenly her eyes wide with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Marie said with a mouth crammed so full of food it was spilling out. Marie stopped her hands from furiously rubbing the BBQ sauce all over her chest and turned to Gillian<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep eating!\" Gillian said again grabbing a box of donuts and eating a few \"It's just... right, we need to gain weight, you need to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gill I dunno.... But if it means making a mess like you I could be for it... plus I wouldn't have to do anything all day if I'm a fat ass like you.... oh and think of how much of a mess I'll have on me if I'm to lazy to move...\" Marie said fantasizing about being covered in crumbs and food as she ground a jelly donut into her shirt making the grease and jelly grind into the fabric staining it forever. \"Fine but you gotta enjoy yourself more girl.\" Marie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Gillian said with 3 hot dogs hanging out of her mouth \"I'm on the verge of a orgasm this food is so good and so fattening, how could I enjoy it more?\" Gillian asked shoving the hot dogs all the way into her mouth by cramming 3 more behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean like I am\" Marie explained gesturing to her food smeared face and torso. \"It's so much better if you just eat like you were at first with no care for how much of a mess you made and and...\" Marie tried to explain but let out a burp insteed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean like....\" Gillian said surprising Marie that she suddenly got it. Gillian closed her eyes and looked like she was thinking when suddenly she let out a fart and blushed. Maire cheered and showed her support by grabbing a plate of brownies and shoving them in her mouth. \"I still think it's unlady-like, but if it makes you eat more then I'll-\" Gillian finished by letting out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie smiled and looked at her pokemon \"That goes double for you Smoochy, Wobbles, and Leafy. I'm your trainer and I'm not going to have my pokemon acting all polite or clean, I wanna see you all cramming as much food into those fat guts as you can, I want the fattest slobbiest pokemon on the block!\" Marie cheered them on and turned back to her eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys too!\" Gillian joined in \"Swablu, Teddy, Milk, gorge your hearts out, show Marie's pokemon the meaning of 'fat slobs'!\" Gillian giggled and kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in the city Mew moved slowly through an ally. She was exhausted and without her power to lift herself psychically she was walking, an activity she had decided she thoughly hated about 6 times in the last hour. Mew crept around the corner of a dirty building trying to use her psychic powers to sense Mewtwo and what he was up to but it was no use, all she got was a dull buzzing sound in her head. Mew's head ached slightly from the exertion. Mew decided to take a break again feeling very tired despite how little she had really done. Mew hopped onto a tipped over trash can and soon nodded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mew dozed she started having dreams, she was surrounded by food and it kept begging it to eat her. All around her shapeless forms carried food to her side and offered it up for her to consume. Mew refused at first but the smell of it, it was driving her mad. Again and again the forms came at her with food and requests to feed her as she lay back and enjoyed it but she resisted, denying them each time, yet each time her protests grew weaker and weaker. At last she broke, the smell, the texture, the sheer sight of all that delicious food, she couldn't stand it any longer, She opened her mouth and al her \"subjects\" as she was beginning to view them, loomed over her and pushed all their food at her in one big push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew stirred rolling over on her seat and falling off the dirty metal can. Mew blinked regaining her bearing. The last thing she had seen was thousands of faithful subjects giving her... giving, what? Mew swung her head back and forth a bit shaking the mental cobwebs loose, a new feeling for her to have her mind anything less than omnipotent. Mew's mind was playing tricks on her, deep in her she felt an urge... a desire... a hunger... a hunger for what? Power? That wasn't like her. But it was undeniable in her subconscious something yearned for more and it was having free reign in her mind as long as her psychic powers were unavailable. Mew's stomach tied itself in a knot with worry over what Mewtwo had done to her while she was unconscious, Mew was also coming to terms with this new emotion know as fear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mew caught whiff of something, something delicious. The fear of what lurked in her mind dissolved when the opportunity of food presented itself, Had Mew realized this her fear would had doubled, but instead she was to busy trying to sniffout which way it was coming from. Peering around the corner the backally door of a restaurant hung open. Inside a clash of kitchenware rang in the ally as chefs worked like madmen to satisfy their new food obsessed customers. Mew race across the ally and ducked behind a dumpster. As she neared she could hear the calls from inside of many different chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some more pasta out there they can't  get enough of it!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't find the measuring cup for the cheese!\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter just dump it all on they seem to want as much of it as they can get\"<br>\r\n\"I can't find the meat I was frying up for sloppy joes!\"<br>\r\n\"It's out there already!\"<br>\r\n\"without the buns?!\"<br>\r\n\"They don't care they're eating it with their hands, hell they're eating everything!\"<br>\r\n\"I know I got mobbed last time I took a platter out! Now one is waiting at tables  anymore they just grab it as soon as we finish!\"<br>\r\n\"geez-us you think that weird broadcast earlier about all of us turning into freaks was for real?!\"<br>\r\n\"Quit the chatter guys if I don't get another tray of food out there soon they'll bust in here and take it!\"<br>\r\n\"How are we even keeping track of their tabs, Who the hell is paying for all this food!?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno where's the boss??\"<br>\r\n\"He's out there in the mob eating like everyone else, don't bother all he keeps saying is 'more food more food!'\"'<br>\r\n\"Guys! They're coming in!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey you greedy Bas- ARGHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clatter of pots and pans rang out as a rack of cookware toppled over, a horde of customers pushed their way past the doors two bus boys were trying to barricade with their arms and ran over top of them assaulting the chefs. A fight broke out as the slob masses tried to push the cooks aside and eat the food in storage while the chefs tried to hold onto the fading notion that they commanded this kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew took her opportunity and slipped into the fray. Dodging feet and running through the argument she crept into the pantry and her eyes lit up. Though half empty there was still many things left, to her delight the racks of pastries made that morning hadn't been reduced to badly by the crowd of slobs and a few trays of cupcakes remained as well as half a rack of donuts and 1/3 a rack of  marble fudge. Mew climbed onto the shelf beside her and flipped the latch on the door to keep the horde of barbarians out while she dinned. Mew leapt onto the tray of fudge and sat herself down to begin shoving it in. Mew was delighted to finally have something to eat, she was beginning to feel so hungry she felt like she hadn't eaten in weeks. Now she was making up for what felt like lost time. Mew sat with her legs spread leaning forward over the fudge clawing at it and raking it into her mouth, her butt seated on the only spot of the tray the fudge didn't cover. Soon the tray was licked clean, Mew had chocolate all over her hands and some smeared on her behind. Mew kicked off the nearby wall and pushed the tray off the rack onto the floor and fell down onto the next tray repeating the process only this time she had to sit in some off the fudge until she could clear herself an open spot to sit, at first she wasn't going to eat the fudge she had been seated in but by time the tray was nearing empty she just shrugged and plowed through it. Again the chocolate stained her paws and crumbs were left around her mouth. Mew stood revealing a chocolate mess all over her bum and licked the crumbs from around her face. Another tray was pushed aside and the pink pokemon dropped down another tray. By now her little belly was getting filled but still room remained. When Mew seated herself in the next tray her gut rounded out as she sat and a bulge pushed forward showing how her furry stomach was rounding out but still it was only food not fat yet and Mew was to hungry to take notice. Soon 4 more trays were pushed to the floor licked clean and Mew was on her last one swiping up the last bits. As Mew leaned forward to lick the chocolate away she was taking not of how hard it was getting, the last 3 trays she licked clean she had felt a lump under her as she leaned forward, and every time it seemed bigger. Oblivious to it Mew simply kicked her legs out and balanced on the roll like a ball and spun herself on it licking the pan clean. Mew was satisfied now she had had her fill... but she was still hungry. Mew knew she had eaten plenty, but still the cupcakes remained, and the donuts too. Mew didn't need anymore... but she wanted more. The cupcakes made her mouth water and the donuts made her sweet tooth beg. Mew hopped off the try onto the floor with a heavier landing than she would expect but just assumed her legs were getting tired from this workout. Mew hopped across the floor her movement was more of a side to side hop than it was before as her belly weighed down and she tried to run in a way that didn't bounce it roughly up and down, she was nearing full after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew scaled the few trays of cupcakes their were, her head coming over the edge of the top one and scooping a cupcake into her mouth as she climbed onto it  trying  to clear room. Mew sat back against the rack and started picking cupcakes up with her tail and bringing it to her hands where she was unwrapping them and placing the used paper liners in a pile beside her before gobbling them down. Soon she didn't get that far and just let the fall where they were removed some laying ontop of her now stuffed and rounded belly. When the tray emptied she just grabbed more from the tray under her with her tail to comfortable to get up. But her pace slowed and by time she was through half of the next tray she let out a little burp and her head tilted back. Mew burped twice more as her stomach churned and settled and the little pink glutton passed out. She had chocolate smeared on her butt, fudge crumbs ground into the fur on her belly as well as a small stack of cupcake paper draped around it, and sprinkles glued to the area around her mouth with frosting. Mew again dreamed of her strange subjects that wanted to give her something deep in her mind she now lusted for, but she didn't even know what it was yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/5881/mew1mz6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/5881/...</a>  ))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the brawl of slobs and chef's had aroused Mewtwo's anger. He sensed the hostility in the restaurant and became quite upset. In a flash the brawl ended as every one in the kitchen suddenly stopped arms falling limply to their sides as their master invaded their minds and scolded them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you behave this way! Most of you are on your way to being glorious slobs! Some of you are fine chefs we need to prepare our lavish meals and will soon join us as righteous slobs. How can you even begin to fight one another? You are all working towards the same goal and as slobs we are above such petty squabbles! You will all behave yourselves and work together on your journey to the path of Slobbitude UNDERSTAND?!\" Mewtwo commanded as his subjects all limply nodded drool leaking from their mouths. Mewtwo rewarded his subjects by bringing them plenty of food to eat so they would not have to fight anymore. Mewtwo unlatched the pantry and brought all the food out as well for his slobs to eat. Of course Mew's presence was not overlooked, Mewtwo smiled at Mew's progress and placed a cupcake in her mouth while she slept, Mew began to suck on it unconsciously. Mewtwo decided to remove every crumb from the pantry, He wanted to ensure Mew would go looking for more to eat rather than take advantage of a well stocked pantry and as well his subjects needed their food too. So while Mew slept the pantry was cleaned out, aside for one cupcake of course.</span></div></div>",

Still dreams haunted her of desires and urges she couldn't make out but called so strongly to her. Mew's body softened slightly as the sweets she had eaten slowly turned to fat. After a long nap Mew stirred at first rubbing her eyes trying to bring them into focus. Mew looked around at the empty store room, the shelfs were bare and the doors to the coolers were open showing their insides to be empty as well. Mew tilted her head to the side in bewilderment, she had not eaten all the food, and if anyone had entered they would have surely woken her, not that they could, the door was still latched. Mew glanced down at her feet and spied the cupcake Mewtwo had left for her while she was asleep. Without a second thought she scooped the cupcake up and scarfed it down. Mew almost felt odd about her treatment of the cupcake she was eating, as if the mere presence of food before her was enough of an invitation to eat it, hungry or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew shook off these feelings, it was just appetite is all, if it hadn't been something sweet she probably wouldn't have just felt like eating it like that, she did have a sweet tooth after all. Mew pushed these idle thoughts to the back of her mind, she was getting caught up in pointless pondering while that fat slob menaced an entire city. She had to stop Mewtwo and get him back to his old self. She felt bad knowing this was all her fault, if only she could just turn back time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew tried to test her powers trying to lift the tray she was on. The tray shook slightly tipping side to side unable to get it fully in the air. Mew's face tightens as she tried harder to focus. The tray managed to lift a few inches above the ground and hold there with Mew pushing herself to the max. She didn't have god control over it as the tray kept dipping to one side or the other threatening to fall again and she wasn't able to hold it in one place as the tray slowly turned and moved back and forth in a small area in the center of the room like a hockey puck on an air hockey table. Mew's face started to turn red and she became exhausted. Mew let out a grunt of pain as she lost her mental hold and the tray smack the floor sending slight ripples through Mew's softer body. Mew was going to need more time before her powers came back fully....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut First Mew was going to lick the crumbs off her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Wilson family household the family was making great progress into their decent of Slob-dom, or rather accent to glorious slob-dom as Cindy Wilson and Matthew Wilson saw it. Sammantha Wilson their daughter lay on the couch stuffed to bursting rubbing her belly in slow circles moaning. Her pokemon lay next to her, Her Bellsprout had passed out 15 minuets ago, it's eyes rolled back and stem like body puffed out in a way few had ever seen a bellsprout swell, the pokemon's body resembles a snake that had swallowed  a creature many times it's size whole and now had the massive lump stuck in it's digestive track. Marill on the end was actually taking to this treatment still going strong stuffing food into her mouth. Marill was no longer the small perfectly round pokemon she once was, She was now shaped more like a pear as her round head sat atop an even rounder belly that had grown larger than the rest of her body and now hung down pushing her legs further apart and making her center of gravity awkward. This was not a problem however as she had no plans of moving while she lay on her back and begged for more food from Sammantha's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marill Marill!\" Marill cried happily and opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my you want more sweetie?\" Cindy smiled at her daughter's pokemon. Cindy herself sported a much more rounded gut and had spread her legs slightly to accommodate the fleshy orb she cradled lovingly in her lap. Unlike Sammantha and her Pokemon who all had food smudges around their mouths from where Cindy had been forcing the food into them, Cindy herself had large hunks of foodstuffs and generous globs of various sweet juices and creamy frosting dotted around her mouth that she wore proudly in addition to the steady trickle of drool that flowed from one corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Marill dear\" Cindy gladly leaned over her stuffed gut to pass more brownies to Marill, She simply sat the plate on Marill's belly and let the blue pokemon dive face first into the pile eating them right off her belly which was rising like dough to meet her mouth with each mouthful of food she swallowed. \"Sammantha dear you and your bellsprout need to be more like that Marill of yours, She is a fine example of what a young lady should be\" Cindy smiled warmly at her daughter then looked back to Marill, admiring her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Yes mommy...\" Sammantha groaned and grabbed another cupcake cramming it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad I can't eat anymore...\" Mark whined across the room his father offering another slice of pie to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark now now, that's no way to think. We want to get into shape don't we? Come on our family has a bright future ahead of it and being full has no place in it\" His father reminded him pushing the pie into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guah, wuff, ruahhh, wugug!\" Mark mumbled through the food chewing it quickly and swallowing to be able to speak again. \"Dad what on earth are you going on about?! Don't you know you exercise to get in shape?! And what is this bight new future you keep talking about? Gee all this food is making Snubbull sick!\" Mark protested. Indeed next to Mark his Snubull was puffed out almost as bad as Marill was and unlike Marill he looked as if he was going to lose his meal at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exercise?!\" Both Matthew and Cindy echoed in unison \"Son I never want to hear you use that foul word ever again!\" Matthew spat sticking his tongue out in disgust, Cindy covered Shammantha's ears to keep her from hearing the word anymore. \"As for Snubbull, he and Bellsprout are just going to need to try harder, the master won't allow such small appetites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... Master?\" Mark asked puzzled \"Dad you've lost it, who or what is this stupid master you're talking about. Dad this is insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the doors and windows to the Wilson family flew open. Mark and Sammatha looked around wildly scared, Sammantha even started screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done well so far...\" A voice echoed through the living room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you master!\" Cindy and Matthew eagerly barked grinning  lowering their heads to the disembodied voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Wha?!\" Mark stuttered while Sammantha panted in fear her voice trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I shall move things along but it is still up to you to show them the way..\" The voice spoke again as a breeze started to softly roll into the living room. With the breeze a strange odor followed as a thicker mist seemed to fill the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" Mark reeled in disgust \"What smells like rotten eggs?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wonderful!\" Matthew breathed heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glorious!\" Cindy chimed in and took a deep breath herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mommy I feel funny...\" Sammantha groaned looking a little pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie tell mommy\" Cindy smiled in anticipation \"What do you feel..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" Sammantha tried to speak but something was holding her back. Sammantha looked like she was about to throw up as her mouth hung open uncertainly and her chest kept heaving irregularly as something worked it's way toward her mouth. \"I feel like I'm bout to...\" Sammantha started when suddenly it came:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP\" sammantha belched loudly. Everyone grew silent and looked at Sammantha, her parents wide eyed as if they were waiting for something big to happen, and it did. As sammantha's burp subsided her belly seemed to rise slightly as her back arched. Sammantha let out another burp albeit smaller but as she did her body seemed to puff out as her stomach shrunk slightly. Sammantha burped twice more each time her body swelled and softened as her stuffed belly digested the food and fat began to thicken her body. Sammantha's clothes were tight across her belly the buttons straining to stay on and her pants looked like she was just poured into little girl pajamas meant for a girl several sizes smaller than she was. Sammantha's eyes got wide and she burped once more. \"Braaaap\" She let loose and the seams of her pants split wide open and more than half the buttons on her shirt burst off flying across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mommy I'm hungry!\" Sammantha suddenly lit up smiling as if she hadn't just gone from a girl stuffed full at a size 11 to a plus sized girl at size 18. Sammantha rubbed her hand on her gut as it growled loudly crying out for food her belly now big enough to sit in her lap. Sammantha began to drool slightly at the sight of food still uneaten laying in the middle of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course honey theres plenty of food for my big growing girl!\" Cindy beamed with pride and grabbed a package of chocolate chip cookies and started to open them in front of her daughter. Sammantha was so eager for the cookies however that she bolted forward and snatched them from her mother's hands tipping the package back and dumping a few into her mouth and chewing happily. 'That's my girl\" Cindy smiled and wiped a tear of joy from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam!\" Mark stared flabbergasted \"What on earth is wrong with you?! You just turned into a blimp after eating enough food to fill a truck... HOW CAN YOU BE HUNGRY?!\" Mark yelled scared of what was happening<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Mark I'm hungry!\" Sammantha whined shoving a can of whip cream into her mouth and trying to spray as much as she could into her bulging cheeks until it filled them completely and got whip cream all over the sides of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam you have to... whoa what was that...?\" Mark suddenly bent over clutching his stomach. He knew what was coming, he could feel it. Mark suddenly let out a loud burp and his stomach shrunk sending fat into the rest of his body puffing his boyish frame slightly. \"Nooo...\" Mark moaned as another set of burps forced their way out \"Urp\" \"arrrup\" \"ruuuuurp\" each letting his belly reduce in size as his body started to fill out making his clothes tighter. Mark could still feel it, the big one, the one that would push his body over the edge into a chubby out of shape mess and make him a food disposal unit like his sister who was now letting their mother pour a series of 2 litter of soda bottles into her like she was a giant glass. Mark fought back the burp. He clamped his mouth shut and tried to force the bubbling gases back down his throat. Mark manage to hold off the last burp for as long as he could when suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFT\" a muffled eruption of gases could be heard through the cushions Mark was sitting on. Mark's face turned red as he felt his stomach bottom out growing vastly hungrier as if he had not eaten in days. Mark gritted his teeth fighting back his sudden desires for food as the last of the gases he had fought back as a burp managed to pop out a few small bursts in the form of farts leaving him feeling weak from hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad..\" Mark meekly mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes son..?\" His father said smiling waiting for what he knew was coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt killed Mark to admit it, but he couldn't fight it \"Dad I'm hungry\" He said at last a drop of saliva cresting over the corner of his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarks father happily handed his son a large cheeseburger that he immediately devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing suit of their owners Sammantha's and Mark's pokemon joined their trainers. Bellspout awoke with a loud burp as it's stem like body got thicker and softening irregularly, even the leaves seemed to plump as Bellsprout quickly got to work shoving food into it's mouth. Snubbull's eyes grew wide as a series of farts shook him back to consciousness making the pokemon's pink body round out considerably making him roll back further and reached up begging for food which Mark's father quickly gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarill seemed to have the most fun with it letting out a burp and fart in alternating bursts and feeling the shockwaves it sent through her softening frame. When it was finished Marill was back to nearly a ball shape again but her front seemed to hang down more as her belly fat couldn't keep that perfect ball shape and her cheeks puffed out giving her two rounded bumps on either side of her mouth which seemed to channel the new stream of drool in a straight line down the front of her belly onto the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy and Matthew also relished the feeling of their bodies growing as the food the had stuffed themselves with turned to fat although unlike their children the gains were not represented by farts or burps, they were happily farting and burping already so their bodies puffed up normally until their clothes could barely hold them in. Cindy and Matthew stood and proudly reveled in their growing slob glory and left their children and their pokemon to get more food for the growing family. As Cindy and Matthew ran to the basement to raid the storage fridge their Kids and pokemon crammed more food into their eager mouths unable to quench this new hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew slowly pulled the latch off the door and pulled back on the handle opening the door out of the food storage room in the restaurant. Mew leapt down onto the floor causing her feet to ache as the impact of her new weight sent a wave of pain into her tiny paws which weren't even accustomed to holding her normal weight much less the poundage she had gained from her binge, not that she noticed the gain, she just assumed it was her body getting sore from all this walking when she should be flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew tiptoed through the mass of sleeping slobs thankful they had passed out so she didn't have to reveal herself in order to leave. Mew wasn't even sure why she was leaving, the empty pantry was a nice hiding spot, she could crawl into one of the dark cupboards and wait for her powers to come back but the pantry was lacking something... Mew couldn't place it but something about a pantry with no food in it was a depressing place to stay and she needed positive emotions if her powers were going to return to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping back into the cold dark alleyway Mew realized it was late at night, she had been passed out for hours. Mew hurried down the ally the tops of her paws bursting the bottom of her belly as she tried to awkwardly run with her arms outstretched for balance. Mew didn't get far however, after only a block and a half Mew was panting heavily her pace slowed to a near crawl. Mew was actually starting to sweat from the physical exertion. She leaned against a dumpster and tried to catch her breath. Mew looked about the ally curious if anyone might catch her back here. Between buildings Mew could see much of the city looked deserted as now nearly half the population was either succumbing to Mewtwo's lure of slob life either by force or choice, or had been taken hostage by a friend or family member who was a slob now and wished to spread the joy to those around them. Many of these new Slob no matter their means of conversion had flocked to one of the many piles of food throughout the city and were joining in to massive slobby feasts taking place there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew lumbered around the dumpster looking for a new place to hide. Mew found relief when the ally began to slope slightly down hill making walking much simpler. Mew picked up her pace moving through the dank city ally. Mew suddenly realized her speed was increasing, as she had been looking for a place to hide away the slope of the hill grew steeper and with it Mew was walking much faster unable to slow her paws as they  landed with heavy smacks against the pavement. Mew's limited experience with walking meant she had never run down a slope so fast she couldn't stop and Mew's new weight wasn't going to make this an easy learning experience. Mew barreled down the ally trying to slow herself down by extending her arms and trying to catch more wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of Mew a small inner-city food market had a large commotion in front of it. A horde of human slobs and soon to be slobs were all pounding on the front doors demanding to be let in. Inside a small group of pokemon trying to save the people, some of whom were their trainers, from a slob fate by barricading the doors. The windows where a rather strong Glaceon had used blizzard to cake the store front's glass windows with a thick sheet of ice preventing entry. Sadly the pokemon had not taken into account how ineffective they would be to their trainers once they were locked in the market behind the sheet of ice. Outside the trainers began to give up seeking new sources of food leaving their pokemon inside the food filled fridge. Mewtwo had decided not to intervene and let his slob follows into the store, because now he had a small group of anti slob pokemon right where he wanted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was now running uncontrollably down the hill, the wall of the super market coming into view Mew realized she couldn't stop. Mew was going to smash into the brick wall of the back of the super market fast enough to seriously injure her. Mew had to think fast but the only was out was a small window just above the wall but it was to high for her weak out of shape legs to make the jump for. Mew had to risk everything and try to lift her self with her powers just long enough to fly into the window. Mew narrowed her eyes focusing on the window and concentrated on the image of herself flying gracefully through the window unharmed. Mew's paws still hit the pavement heavily indicating she had not lifted any of her weight yet. Mew kept focusing her mind on flight, and the safety of that window. Still Mew could feel the weight of her body with every bounding footstep. Mew shut her eyes and hoped for the best as she came within 10 feet of the wall. At the last second Mew kicked off the ground with all her strength and aimed for the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew felt time slow to a crawl as her wellbeing hung in the balance. Mew held her breath as she lifted a foot off the ground, then two feet. Mew's heart sank and she felt her vertical ascension slow and she began to reach the peak of her jump after barely getting 2 feet off the ground. Mew threw her entire body forward and pushed herself to fly. Mew thought she hung in the air there for an eternity fighting gravity until she got a most unexpected boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prrrrrrrfp\" Mew suddenly farted. Mew's face turned red as she realized what she had done but no sooner had she done so than a sudden kick of speed lift her body and gently whisked her through the window letting her slowly land inside. Mew's eyes were horrified as her lack of control over her own body. Mew had never even so much as burped before much less fart. Mew did not care for this new development at all. But Mew could put it aside, her powers seemed to be returning and she could face Mewtwo soon and put an end to this. More importantly though she could cast off this horrid walking business and fly again. Mew tried to lift herself off the ground but nothing happened. Mew shook her head and tried again, nothing. Mew placed her face in her palms. This was terrible, her powers were still on the frits, they only worked briefly after she did that ghastly bodily function and then they cut out again what was going on with her body??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew had to put this mystery aside for now though. A sudden clatter from the next room tuned Mew into her surroundings. Mew was in a dimly lit storage room for the cleaning supplies and maintenance room for the food market. Mew crept to the door and peered through. Mew could see right into the main area of the store where all the aisles were. Around the super market Mew could see the pokemon that had locked themselves inside and they were...</span></div></div>",

Mewtwo then let out a hearty laugh. \"Oh, happy day! Everyone in this city and soon th entire world will be under my blob control! Oh, somebody stop me!\" \"With pleasure!\" A loud voice said. Mewtwo turned his head and saw a Darkrai decend from the sky. A pair of legs decended from Darkrai's body as he touched down on a flagpole on top of Town Hall. \"Who dares oppose my rule? Why are you not a slob?\" \"Sorry lord flabulous, but I don't intend to be your puppet anytime soon!\" The Darkrai then form a black energy ball and luanched it a mewtwo. It hit the slobs fatty skin and sank into it, sending a shock through Mewtwo's system. \"W-what was...that?\" Mewtwo asked shakingly. \"That tubbo was just a taste of my power!\" Darkrai said as he stood in a proud, heroic stance. Mewtwo however shook off the effects of the energy ball and stared at the mysteriuos Darkrai with feirce eyes. \"Alright foul demon, face my wrath!\" Mewtwo shot a large, very powerful energy ball, at the flagpole, destroying the entire roof of the building instantly. \"Ha-ha! That will teach you a lesson to mess with me!\" Mewtwo said valiantly. \"Oh yeah!?\" A firmiliar voice said. Mewtwo turned his head to his other side and stared in shock as the Darkrai stood there unharmed. Mewtwo's heart dropped into his enormous stomach as he saw his oppent stand there like nothing happened. \"What's the matter tubbo, you miss?\" Mewtwo's anger boiled to the point were steam seemed to come out of his ears. \"Err, die evil Darkrai!\" Mewtwo siad as he luanched an even bigger blast at his opponent. When the smoke cleared the building had a huge bite cut out of it. \"Hahaha, he could have escaped that!\" \"Guess again!\" Mewtwo tuned his head and saw the Darkrai again unscaved, his eye closed cutely and his hands with his fingers forming a V shape for peace. Mewtwo's whole body shoke violently as his anger went beserk! The fat psychic then lauched a hell fire of energy balls at the Darkrai, but everytime the ball it Darkrai was somewhere else. Soon the dark poemon started doing strange cartoon gimicks that only made Mewtwo madder. Mewtwon't understand it! He couldn't understand it! Everytime this Darkrai seemed to be hit he was somewhere else and mewtwo couldn't track him! soon mewtwo got tired and stopped, sweat pouring out of his gland as his anger translated to killer heartburn! As mewtwo panted heavily Darkrai suddenly appeared right on Mewtwo's belly. \"What's the matter tubbo, feelin tired?\" The Darkrai mocked. \"I'm not out of options yet! Wait til you see my slob army!\" Soon every slob under Mewtwo's control came out of resturants and they're own home and began to advance up Mewtwo's enormouss gut towards Darkrai. \"Well look at this, it's the blubber brigade.\" Darkrai said in a mockful tone. </span></div></div>",

He then eyed the enormous gathering of slob below him. \"That's not all I can do!\" With a wave or his arm many dark energy balls came out of nowhere and hit individual memebers of the mind controlled slob attack force, putting them to sleep! \"What is this!\" Mewtwo screamed as over half the mebmers of the slob rebellion were fast asleep. \"A little nap to help them wake up!\" Darkrai said as he formed another ball of energy and threw it at more slobs as it became many balls.

They sit atop a throne of feces for their gigantic bodies. They were at least 2 tonnes in weight, and were unable to do anything without their fellow slobs helping them. All the Legendaries tried to stop them, but Cindy and Matthew were able to overpower them and convert them to their new slob army. They also became a couple and had a child who quickly bloomed to 1000 lbs before she turned 18. Every day, they would let out enough waste from their plump rears to cover Antartica and also gave the army the ability to eat anything they so please, which helped in increasing their girth to over 500lbs and almost made them immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also reproduced with their fellow army, whether it be Pokemon or Human, they pleasured them and had their children who would one day get bigger than their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, their influence grew all over the world, infecting everyone within time. Cindy's first order was to allow reproduction with Pokemon regardless if your human or not. This created a whole new species: a Poke-Human, who had two stomachs, increased hunger and abilities from the Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, even though Mew helped Darkrai in stopping Mewtwo.

In the last few days she has been unconscious, allowing the seed Mewtwo planted earlier to sprout inside her mind and removing her resistance to the idea of being a slob as each day passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begun to accept the idea, coveting the idea of being a big, sweaty slob for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to fantasize about ruling a planet full of slobs eating like wolves as the area around them gets covered in filth, garbage, and their own urine/ sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't care as long as Mewtwo was by her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Mewtwo, she tilted her head up and noticed Mewtwo gettting the snot beaten out of him by Darkrai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to end this.\" Darkrai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkrai charged a Shadow Ball and fired at Mewtwo, who was unable to escape.

Long live the age of slobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo turned his enlarged body to Mew and smiled. \"I couldn't have done it without you Mew, thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew ripped a powerful wet fart, giving the slobs more food to eat and smiled. \"No, thank you Mewtwo. I could never have experienced this pleasure without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo grabbed Mew's palms and asked a question. \"Mew, you have an amazing power that everyone needs to experience. Will you be my queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew then smiled. \"Of course I will master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd then cheered as they all let out farts and burps, shredding their clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, Mew and Mewtwo were sitting atop thrones made out of a combination of feces, urine and sweat as they observed their servants feasting on their own waste. All the humans were around 400 lbs and were given the ability to eat feces without suffering the side effects, Cindy and Matthew were the biggest humans of all weighing over 600 lbs and were even bigger slobs than anyone else. Cindy(20)'s boobs spilled out her own fattening milk that could increase the frequency of a persons gas 10 fold, which got a lot of men's attention(probably the most attention they could give now). While Mark's(21) urine was able to increase a person's sweat, which made them even hungrier. Mark attracted a lot of women as a result and was given a constant supply of it thanks to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo and Mew looked over the new kingdom and smiled. Their new world order was in effect, now people are fat, dumb, and happy....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was first the size of a bowling ball is now the size of a large beachball and started to form moobs.  Totodile's miniscule arms began to swell and Totodile's legs grew out to the size of large hams.  Totodile's neck bloated out and formed two more chins as it's cheeks swelled to the size of large baseballs.  Even Totodile's stubby tail bloated with enough fat to be too heavy to be lifted without help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwellow was starting to represent it's namesake and began to swell with blubber.  It's belly quickly hit the ground and it's breast was quickly stretching forward.  The sides began to expand out and pushed the wings out.  Even it's legs were swelling out, spreading to the side.  Swellow's neck even began to bloat out and it's back began to rise with fat.<br>\r\n\"Exclent\" Mewtwo thought to himself as he saw his test subjects swell with lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of five minuets both test subjects were turned into large blobs of fat.<br>\r\nTotodile was well beyond immobile and was now four feet high because it was laying on it's fat belly.  Totodile's sides stretched out four feet each way, making him eight feet wide while it's arms were two feet in diameter and unable to bend.  Although not yet completly swallowed up by the arm fat, Totodile's tiny hands and claws looked like blue water inflated gloves, not even the fingers could baraly even wiggle.  The legs were covered in rolls and had butt cheeks that were larger than Totodile's body before the transformation.  With his back up you could clearly see Totodile's four very nicey formed bloated back rolls, and a tail so bloated that it was almost wider than the thickest tree trunk at the base and formed rolles.  A lovely set of moobs were displayed, each one too big to wrap your arms around.  Totodile's five fully formed chins prevented even his powerfull jaws from opening more than an inch, while his cheaks looked like two pillows were stuffed in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwellow now resembled a giant six foot tall and nine foot wide waterballon with feathers.  Even the scailed part of the leg were bloated beyond any possible movement along with tallons that resembled stuffed sausages.  The bird's back formed large back rolls and swelled outward.  The chest and neck were formed into one slab of continuous fat, as the head was sunken into the bloated body to the point where top of the head merged with the fat back.  The beak was sunken into the fat chest and was shortened by bloated cheaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the test is a succsess\" Mewtwo said to himself as he saw both pokemon sunk slightly into his own fight by there weight.</span></div></div>",

When the movie was over he went to pick up his mess (what he thought was only the crumbs of a piece of chocolate cake and 1 two liter). He looked down and noticed his stomach was covered in chocolate and about a dozen 2 liters of coke. He wondered how he even crammed that much in his now slightly bulging gut.

He let a loud belched that echoed through the house and patted his slightly expanded stomach. He then leaned forward and let a loud fart that he almost sufficated because of the stinch.

Batting away the butterflies in his stomach, he commited the action, and waited breathlessly for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he discovered his passion for sumo wrestling, Charmander had been reading up on its background and techniques. As he had absorbed all of the information, he eventually concluded that he wanted to become one himself, so with only a recently bought mawashi and some currency hidden on his person, he began to explore the area for sumo schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe search was more difficult than expected, since there were no said institution where Charmander lived. He expanded his exploration outside the town limits and after much asking and eavesdropping, he learned of a sumo academy in a secluded part of the continent that's rarely heard about. It's seclusion worried Charmander, for schools like those rarely enrolled everyone that just walked up to their doors and asked to be emitted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited nervously, bouncing on one foot to the other, until a slide slot was opened to reveal a pair of narrowed red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" a growling voice demanded. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander jumped and began shaking, watching those scary eyes warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sir.\" he meeped. \"I was wondering...I am sure you wouldn't accept...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just spit it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can I join your school and...b-become a sumo wrestler?\" he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander felt the eyes taking in every detail of his person in the long silence that followed. Finally, the doors slowly squealed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" the voice simply stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander complied, adjusting his mawashi quickly as he entered. When the doors shut, darkness descended and he shuddered as a very large presence made itself known beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir trek onward was silent as Charmander's eyes tried to adjust to the darkness. He failed, but that didn't stop him from attempting to swinging his glance around everywhere they went. Eventually, a metal door came into view and the presence waved a hand towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go in there and wait until someone call you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed behind him, the fire Pokemon examined the room. It was arena sized, with square padding covering its surface and a lone seat standing in the middle of the area. Glancing around, he took his seat and was startled as the chair shrunk to accommodate his size. Charmander then eyed the large television screen facing him and waited nervously for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the screen flickered on and revealed a large figure obscured by shadows observing the newcomer with oddly green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" the figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Hello.\" Charmander greeted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes stared at him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your purpose here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To-to become a sumo wrestler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would you want to?\" the figure asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, uh, it looked like fun when I looked it up and I wanted to try it out.\" Charmander answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To try it out.\" the figure repeated. \"Tell me, do you understand the implications of entering to this school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you vow to enroll here, it's a permanent process. Whatever action we'll apply to you will leave an eternal effect upon you and your body. It's not something to back out of. To do so and to cheat on your stay here will yield a punishment that you must fore take for years before you see the light of day again. Are you sure you want to enroll here? Think over this for ten minutes and be prepared for an answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen shut off and stayed off until the ten minutes passed, where Charmander arrived carefully made his final decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about the risks and still want to come. I will do anything to get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Are there any people who will miss you on the outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really.\" Charmander admitted. \"I only have distant connections and they probably forget about me in a short while anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Is there anything that you should tell me about yourself?\" the figure asked. \"Anything about you yourself that could interfere with your sumo training here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander though it over and then shifted embarrassedly in his seat. \"Well...this might annoy the others...but I always been a bit gassy. I can hold it in for a while, but if I'm not paying attention to it at times I...let it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure seemed amused. \"Oh really? Well don't worry about that? That won't be a problem here? In fact, it might become a asset to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander looked confused. \"What? What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished asking this, a slot opened and two pairs of pills sprung up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take those pills.\" the figure told him. \"They are there to control your gas and drool troubles. And...to increase it.\" The last sentence had a mischievous edge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why would I want to increase it? Shouldn't I try to avoid such embarrassing things like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed. \u201cListen here. While such actions might not be politically correct in the outside world, the same doesn't hold here. It's even encouraged. So, will you take the pills or not. Oh and don't worry. If you start um...having side effects, then ignore them. No matter how major or large they may happen, they won't threaten your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharmander gazed at the pills dubiously, then shrugged. Popping them into his mouth, he waited for them to take effect. As he waited, he felt his saliva glands begin begin producing more drool than usual and a tightness began to occur in his stomach. It was uncertain whether the gas and liquid would escape his body or be trapped inside him as they began to multiply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened!</span></div></div>",

A moment later he saw that white thing was his paunch, which had pushed out a couple inches since he began eating the ice cream.  He was confused at what to do.  He could try and get free then run as far away from here as possible.  However, he knew that he wasn't in any immediate danger and the cold substance actually felt good forcibly going down his throat and bloating him up.

He relaxed and began taking a nap while the machine kept working, feeding him ice cream.<br>\r\n   Hours later he awake.  Charmeleon didn't intend to sleep that long and he found his gut was three feet out in front of him.  Also, his arms and legs were fattening up as well.  His tail must have been plumper, but he couldn't see it while he was bound up.  It was then that he noticed the tube was done and the scientist was laughing maniacally at him.  enraged he decided to take his anger out on the doctor with a good old flamethrower, before he made his leave.<br>\r\n   But when he opened his mouth to attack no fire came out.  He tried a few more times, but he managed to only release a burp.<br>\r\n   \"Can't use your flame thrower I see.  Well, maybe you should take a better look at yourself.\"<br>\r\n   He helt out a mirror and to Charmeleon was shocked to see his red scales were now purple and his tail fire was out.<br>\r\n   \"You see you've only passed the first half of the experiment and are crossed between a fire and ice type pokemon so both powers cancle each other out.  Now  I'll continue the experiment and once your scales turn a more bluish hue and a icy fire on your tail you'll be done and the first ice-type charmeleon will be created.  I wonder what I should call you.  Chillmeleon... no.  How about Coolmeleon.  I'll think of something.\"<br>\r\n   Charmeleon didn't know what to do.  He could try and use his normal type attacks to escape, but to lose his fire moves would weaken him and without them he could no longer be a fire-type.  If he stayed to complete the experiment he'd gain ice-type moves and then he would at least be stronger than he was currently.  The only drawback was he might get even fatter than he was already.</span></div></div>",

The scientist had to struggle a bit but finally got the muzzle on him and the tube to fit in his mouth which would of been much easier than at the begining do to the charmanders now large cheeks. He then connected the two tubes and flipped the switches. He tasted ice cream but noticed that it was mixed with ice. The charmander felt his cheeks fill as he refused to swallow and then it just poured down his throat. pretty soon he felt his stomach touching his legs from it sagging and felt his cheeks droop down more touching the first of his two chins. He felt the restraints get tighter and he noticed they were about to brake. He noticed that the scientist was not paying attention and did not notice the flaw. The Charmeleon found it as his only chance to get free so he started sucking on the tubes to speed the flow. He soon could see his white stomch as it reach his view from growth. The scientist left the mirror up charmeleon just noticed and looked in it and was now starting to turn bluer and begin to get a blue flame on his tail. He noticed that his tail was shorter and tubber as the same for his arms and legs. He noticed that his stomach was huge and coverd his upper legs all the way down to his knees.

If the charmeleon could of read he would have read:slob formula-for all your drooling, belching, and farting needs. He then started the machines again and the charmeleon instantly tasted all the sugar sweets and could not resist their taste. He couldn't taste the formula but it was there. He soon belched loudly enough for the scientist to hear and soon after farted to. He soon began to drool and it started to leak out of the muzzle and on to his moobs.

The orange lizard's belly was a good four to five feet in front of him while his arms were propped up in it's own barrel sized arm fat while the fingers had plumped up to the point where he could only bend them half way.  His tail had formed several rolls while the flame on the end burnt brightly with gluttony.  His legs were propped out to the side by there own size and his belly lifting them off the ground, while the leg fat covered up most of his feet.  Charizard's neck was three times as thick as it used to, filled with fat and formed numorus chins while his head sunk in slightly into his neck and basketball sized cheeks.  The lizards wings looked like they were made from sausages and there movement hindered by the fat, forcing them in a permanent open position.  A loud and long fart erupted from the greedy dragon's rear as drool slid down the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Quarkson couldn't help but chuckle, this was the point where he could finaly see if pokemon, even the self centered Charizard, enjoyed being slobby and fat.<br>\r\nDr. Quarkson always wanted to make pokemon happy, but when he accadentaly discovered that overfeeding pokemon was the easyest way to make them happy he took the experament further into wild pokemon territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Quarky, can I see my friend now?\" Aggron asked, still munching on some snacks.<br>\r\n\"Hold on, the experament is still in proggress, I now need to deactivate the chocolate to see how Charizard reacts to his new body.\" Dr. Quarkson said \"becides, you can stand to wait a couple of more minuets, I helped you become slobby not impatient.\"<br>\r\nDr. Quarkson then added \"becides, if you keep bothering me like this I might just decide to take away your lovely flab, but if you allow me to work then after this experament you can do whatever you want.\"<br>\r\nAggron shook his head, causing his flab to wiggle.<br>\r\n\"Good, now if the charizard likes it, then I might even introduce one of my other slobby subjects.\" Dr. Quarkson said before pressing a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard shook his face, he felt large for some reason, and unclean.

As if on cue he looked around the cave, and with a sheepish grin leaned forward, lifting his flabby rear end up enough to allow a noisy fart to escape.  His fattened tail twitched with pleasure as he ended the flatulence on a deep and cave-vibrating blurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better...\" he sniffed the air, getting a disgusting rise out of his own smells.  \"I'm still hungry here!\" He pounded on his enlarged and tubby belly flab.  His fat quivered and wobbled, as he looked around again shaking his jowels with the rapid movements. This time, he was expecting some form of reaction from the walls themselves.  He grunted and began rocking himself back and forth, finally sloshing his weight enough to roll him forward towards the fridge.  \"Gotta be...something...I missed...\" and soon he'd grasped the door of the fridge and tore it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHILI!\"  He smacked his lips and smirked at a large pot.  \"Hope the ventilation is good in here!\"  Removing his grip on the door he pulled the gigantic pot to his lips, letting gallons of chili spill down his throat and into his stomach.  He slurped at the rim of the pot, ate, gorged, and his body took it all.  His orange body began swelling like an over-ripe fruit, bulging and rounding out.  His scales felt dirtier and dirtier as he fattened up, his butt became enormous, his legs dug into his dough-like belly flab as he began rising up off the ground.  \"Time for a show...\" he thought, an evil smirk appearing as he gulped one last time.  He grunted loudly, working his tail across his rump as best he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a massive jet of flatulence he sent a flame into the air, and snorted triumphantly.  Let's see another Poke'mon do THAT!  What would disgust any normal 'mon at this point, the Charizard was starting to take quite a bit of pride in.  His farts continued to build up power as they built up pressure inside of his rear end.  The chili was causing his system to go into overdrive, and at this point he had no shame in emptying his intestines of the foul gas.  </span></div></div>",

She love chocolate so much, but she rarely got any as it was made for humans and pokemon tended to make pigs out of themselves with such things.

She didn't stop until she drained the pool to puddles.  She licked a tile clean of choclate and looked at her refelction.  Besides a few spots of blue she was all brown with chocolate.  Her actions didn't seem like her at all and she decided now was the time to use water gun.  She opened her mouth, but a stream of water wasn't unleashed, but a long sticky glob of drool that ran down her chin and neck.  Disgusted by this she tried to figure out what was wrong.  She tried again, but instead got a burp and when she tried a third time she let out a smelly fart.  She wasn't sure what was happening, but she was getting scared.

She approached the fridge and used her psychic force to open it using telepathy. She glanced inside it and squealed in delight at its beautiful bounty. Inside were sandwiches, hamburgers, steak, pizza, cakes, pies, and ice cream; all kinds of human foods. Espeon grinned and began taking food out of the fridge. Her first of the immense meal was a tall, appetizing sandwich. She shoved it violently into her mouth and chewed the sandwich with her mouth wide open, letting crumbs and saliva spill out and onto the once-spotless floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she burped loudly and licked her fingers noisily. She then began to shove more and more food into her mouth; meat, vegetables, desserts, she devoured it rapidly.

It didn't eclipse Evee's blast though. \"Alright look's like I'm paying for dinner. Where do you want to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvee looked thoughtful. Where does she choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie looked back at the porky police officer as she waddled to her bike. Katie couldn't believe the young woman had let herself go so much, most of the Jenny family were tall slender and well kept but this one was so fat she burst through every seem in her uniform as it threatened to tear to pieces, even her skirt was so small more than half her large rear hung out showing her pink panties quite clearly as the blubbery cheeks swayed side to side with her waddle. As for the well kept clean cut professional look officer Jenny's were know for, this one didn't seem to even clean her uniform, not that she would be able to get it back on, if she even managed to get it off in one piece at all. The fat female cop just huffed as she swung her thick thighs over the side of her reinforced motor bike, despite heavy plates along the side to strengthen the bike's weight capacity the bike still squealed loudly as her weight bore down on it and the tires sank until they looked almost flat. Slowly the fat officer rolled away on her bike muttering something in a rather upset tone about having to report to city hall before she could get herself anymore snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie shrugged and went inside, Katie wasn't stupid, quite the obvious she was a very intelligent girl, but somehow her common sense was.... lacking so to speak. In fact regardless of her note worthy understanding of the world around her she was often seen as a ditz for missing even the most obvious of details. This is perhaps why She had missed the fact Donut town was not only removed from the official pokemon trainer route's but also several warnings had been issued for all trainers and travelers alike to avoid the region entirely due to a very high number of trainers who had visited the area on their quest and never returned home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double wide doors to the Pokemon center slid open as Katie and her Evee approached them. Evee began to slow down and let out a low growl cautioning Katie to slow just as she put one foot inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at her Evee puzzled \"What is it Evee?\" Katie said bending slightly to looked her only pokemon more closely in the eye, Since Katie was a bit of a ditz she often failed to throw the pokeball at the right time or downright left them behind at the pokeshop she bought them at. None the less this only gave her more time to bond with Evee, they were almost like sisters one could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve! Eve! Evee!\" The small brown pokemon cried out in protest getting a bad feeling about this place. The Evee took several steps backwards and called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie giggled at Evee's reluctance to come in. \"Oh come on Eve! Remember what that fat toll booth operator back on the road said! This place is the best, they have all kinds of special training programs to improve pokemon and trainer cooperation! It's the whole reason we changed out route to come to this place. I bet since it's not on the official course we'll have a leg up on the copatition when we get to the grand tournament if we're the only ones with this training. Now lets go!\" Katie said pinching Evee's left ear and tugging softly. Evee cooed over the pressure knowing it was one of her weak spots and trotted along behind her trainer as Katie pulled her in by the ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Katie looked around at the weird design. The flow of the center seemed to force new arrivals straight to Nurse Joy's reception desk were a pink blob sat. Katie couldn't help but find the humming of the lights inside annoying, this was louder than normal florescent light humming too, it was almost like a speaker somewhere was letting out a low pitched whine.  As Katie neared it the blob became more recognizable as a very very fat Chansey, The faithful assistant of all Nurse Joy this one seemed to just sit behind her desk eating from a near by basket of Pokemon food. The massively fat Nurse pokemon took little notice of their approach more interested in bringing more food to her mouth leaving behind a trail of crumbs across her flab. She didn't even care Katie was asking for assistance until Katie reached forward and lightly touched the Chansey's flab. The Chansey flailed her stubby arms wildly and wailed at Katie quite upset at the inturuption. Before a familiar voice calmed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Chansey dear the poor girl only needs help\" Spoke Nurse Joy in a soft tone. Katie turned to see Nurse Joy sitting in a scooter parked in the hallway. Just like Officer Jenny this Nurse Joy was a great deal fatter than her sisters, her seditary job had allowed her to grow much fatter than the Officer but she just as messy. Nurse Joy's pink nurse uniform was in pieces and the only thing keeping her modesty was a tightly stretched apron covering her large chest. As for her lower half the nurse's slab of a belly poured down from under her apron and covered her legs down to her knees meaning even if no clothing was left down that far nothing could be seen anyway. All over her body various smears and spots of dribbled food sat on her. Nurse Joy tried to smile warmly at Katie like all Nurse Joy did but ruined the trademark smirk with a large belch and several after burps that sent shockwaves through her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young lady how can we assist you today?\" Nurse Joy asked after the ripples subsided and eyed Katie up and down like a slab of meat ready to be cut. \"You look positively famished dear! come come lets get you to the Pokemon Center Cafeteria!\" Nurse Joy suggested and quickly spun her scooter around giving Katie an eye full of her fat behind spilling out over the tiny seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually I came for some training... um Nurse Joy?\" Katie called out trying to catch her \"Miss! Miss I really need that training!\" Katie took off after the scooter, Evee moved closer to her trained and tried to remain alert still uneasy about the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie started to catch up she came to a hallway passing through the tables for the cafeteria and Katie was shocked by what she saw. More than the fact that the center had far less trainers than any other center usually had, was the few trainers she did see. Seated at tables that looked more like couches with adjustable tables the trainers all seemed to range from the 200 pound mark to the 400 pound mark. Boys and Girls dotted the large eating area seated at tables covered in food just stuffing their faces without concern for how much of the food wound up on them and not in their mouths. The eating area was a symphony of slurps, gobbles, chops, chews, burps, belches and worse every now and then a faint rubble could be heard as one of the dinners passed gas. TVs everywhere kept the attention of the young trainers with cartoons and goofy shows, but they weren't any Katie recognized, they all had prominently obese characters and the screens seemed to flicker every other frame like the TV's couldn't maintain the picture. It wasn't even just the trainers getting into it either, at their feet their pokemon all lay slouched over feeding bowls being refilled constantly by dispensers by the bowl, even though it differed from pokemon to pokemon most of them just looked like fat little balls of fur with pudgy legs and paws uselessly hanging out the side of their fat frames. And still the humming of those lights wore on Katie's patience and her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you're lucky you got here when you did\" The Nurse Joy broke in pulling Katie away from the sight of a girl not much older than her but three times her size who had a bowl of ice cream tipped in the air and was chugging it like she was dying of thirst. \"You look like you'd blow away if the wind blew hard enough, You know it's not healthy to be so malnourished dear\" Joy cautioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malnourished!?\" Katie repeated under her breath, \"my mom is always telling me I'm in danger of getting fat with the way I eat, what's with this place...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat nurse apparently heard more than Katie intended because suddenly she brought up the subject of Donut town itself. \"Well dear do you want to hear our little town's history?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see...\" Katie began</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donut Town was really no different than any other town actually it had been founded many years before and lead an average existence until it had the great fortune of being selected for a part in one of the many towns included in the Pokemon Trainer's League Official Route. This brought with it a Pokemon Center, the Officer Jenny protection force many new shops and restaurants and of course booming tourism industry. The town flourished and grew, but despite being a different kind of average, the town was still an average town on the long road to the Pokemon Leagues. That was, until Seven years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***************************<br>\r\n***************************************~Seven Years Earlier~**************************************<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a cold stormy night on the edge of town a mud covered Drowzee stumbled out of the bushes badly hurt. The victim of a cruel beating by several foul tempered children from Donut town the Drowzee now sought help from the town that spawned the children that attacked him. Knowing little of humans and preferring to avoid them the Drowzee knew only rumors of the Pokemon Center and hoped desperately that he could find it and be saved. However he had no way of knowing where it was and soon found himself on the back step of one of the quiet houses of Donut Town. Trying to get someone's attention all he could manage to do was scratch meekly. To his fortune the Mother of the household heard him and came to investigate, yet to his dismay the aid he had hoped for was not found there as the woman screamed at him calling him a wild animal and kicked him away from the door swiftly, slamming it as fast as she could and locking it. As Drowzee picked himself up he managed to look inside at the humans who had turned their back on him in his hour of need. There a family of 5 sat, the mother who had hit him, the father, the son, the daughter, and a young baby. All of them eating there dinner. Slopping food on their plates and stuffing their faces. There was plenty of food to go around in this warm safe abode and yet they refused to share any of it with him, as if on cue his own belly growled for food. Angrily the Drowzee turned his back on the scene and moved to the next house. Yet his reception here had been no better. Once again he found himself thrust out into the cold wet night his wounds aching and his stomach growing more and more famished. As Drowzee left in a huff he stumbled over their garbage cans. Drowzee came crashing to the ground hurting his chin. Looking up at the garbage spilled his eyes lit up at the prospect of finding something to eat in the spilled contents of the garbage can. But nothing edible remained, a slop of meshed up food oozed out sprinkles with rotten apple cores and moldy bread Drowzee was enraged that not only did the Humans so selfishly horde their good fortune, but wasted it so freely even ruining what they didn't use. Again and again it was the same scene that met his pleas to assistance. Humans throwing him out, Humans wasting perfectly good supplies and items turning them into garbage to pollute the world, and worse of all humans stuffing their faces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowzee began to grow listless over these sights, he paced down the street his wounds seeming less and less important. Drowzee was angry, these pitiful humans had to be taught a lesson. They all needed to be put him their place! A faint glow began to rise up off his body, Drowzee's wounds healed and his mind focused. Filling with power Drowzee could feel his anger welling up inside him giving him a clear picture of his revenge coming to realization. Drowzee rose off the ground as the power surrounded him, in a flash his anger and determination evolved him to a Hypno. Hypno landed again and set right to work teaching his lesson. Sending out hypnotic waves for miles Hypno captured the minds of every human of the Donut Town region. His rage empowered him to pull all their minds to him and bend their wills to his own design. If these humans were going to be such greedy messy pigs then that's what he would make them! That night the entire population threw their modesty and concern for anything but food out the window. Hypno took control of the government setting up his own home in Town hall to rule over his slobbery minions. Over the next few weeks the population's obesity exploded. Every home, school yard, and place of public business was full of over weight humans stuffing their faces growing out of their clothes making a mess of themselves. The town was addicted to food and gave up any concern for anything else.But it wasn't long before the warmer months approached and the official training season began. With it came trainers along the official routes and for an unlucky bunch, right to Donut town. Hypno did not take kindly to these intruders in his town poking their nose into the population's new eating habits, personal hygiene, or manners. Hypno tried to bring their minds into his control but the trainers minds were focused and fresh as were their pokemon, And Hypno wasn't as strong as he had been in his fit of rage. As well Hypno himself was succumbing to the lifestyle he crated for the town as his fat servants brought him the same food and manners he had forced on them. Hypno had gown fat himself and was losing his concern for his own wellbeing. As such Hypno was forced to bring the trainers under his thumb in more conventional terms. Sending out Officer Jenny to meet and make reports on all new arrivals then make sure they stayed long enough to become like everyone else Hypno ensured no more meddlesome government agencies poke their noses in with surveys on obesity rates or investigations about eating habits. Hypno had Nurse Joy beginning the conditioning with super addictive food to give trainers and their pokemon along with a mind numbing hum in the poke center to weaken their resistance and subliminal messages in the music and TV's It wasn't long before a build up of trainers began to form in the town, not allowed to leave and slowly getting out of shape their attempts to escape grew less and less as they fell under the spell of the food and overall attitude of the populace slowly becoming slobs themselves bursting out of their clothing. Over time the flow of trainers slowed as more and more people became concerned with the disappearances of both trainers and the investigators sent to find them. Within 3 years the Town's population doubled with their now permanent residence and they all shared the same pastimes, Eating, and turning every visitor they got into slobs like them. Now 4 years later Hypno's power has grown as much as his weight. As each new resident settled in and submitted to his will they joined their minds with his to give him power and now from atop his fat laden food stained throne Hypno was ready to expand his kingdom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** *************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present Nurse Joy finished telling Katie and Evee her long winded lie about the town being a happy place were everyone loved it so much they stayed for the great people who won them over. Katie didn't understand the story fully, Nurse Joy spoke as if the town had no weight problems, as if it was just like any other town you could go to and nothing was out of the ordinary. Evee was getting restless her feeling they were being watched grew. Suddenly Nurse joy came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" She happily beamed and rolled to a buffet of food steaming hot beckoning to Katie and Evee. The smell of the food filled their nostrils and made their heads spin with hunger. The low hum in the Pokemon center was making it so hard to think and the food looked so good...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie looked back and forth over the array of tasty foods before her. Everything was cooked to perfection and seemed to glow under the heat lamps. The shine of the lights on the food, the smell over powering the air, and the fact Katie was on a diet and had not eaten all day weakened her resistance. The food called to Katie and her Evee, the hum in the center de-focusing their thoughts and bore the image of the food straight to their minds and into their stomachs as both trainer and pokemon let out a loud deep growl from their slim bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie braced herself, she was on a diet after all, she would just get a salad to start with to fill her up then maybe some dessert. Katie looked around at the display of food and found it odd the salad bar was not immediately seen. Salad bars were cheap to stock so most places put them out front so patrons would fill up on cheap greens before eating the more expensive food. At last Katie spied it in the far back against the poorly lit wall. The lights in back flickered as if they were going bad and no one cared enough to replace them and the greens didn't look all that green from where Katie stood suggesting no one ever changed them but Katie was sure this we just her eyes playing tricks on her and grabbed a plate for her and Evee and started to walk around the buffet towards the poorly kept salad bar. As Katie and Evee trotted along the display of food however Katie couldn't help but glance over at the food whose heady smell was driving her hunger so wild, soon Katie had stopped looking where she was going and just stared at the food she was passing. Fried chicken, glazed ham, four cheese potato scalap, lasagna dripping with a greasy tomato sauce. Katie's pace slowed with each temptation and each new dish made the salad bar seem further and further away until her legs came to a rest in front of a huge slab of cheese filled casserole. Katie bit her lip and looked around unsure what to do. Katie tried to find the salad bar again but her hunger surged and everything beyond the buffet before her seemed shrouded in darkness unimportant to her growing hunger. Katie looked to Evee for support but Evee had hopped onto the counter to investigate what Katie was stopped for and now was staring at the food that had also tempted Katie. Evee whimpered and her legs started to buckle as Evee couldn't bring herself to hop back off the counter away from the temptation. Katie looked back to the food her stomach demanding she fill it her will power ebbed away. Slowly Katie's hand lifted itself to the counter grasping the spoon and dug deep in to the creamy rich casserole. The slurping sound of the moist cheese spreading to let the spoon into the casserole drove Katie wild with anticipation about the taste, Evee just let her tongue out as she eagerly watched Katie spoon a generous helping for them both onto their plates and turned back headed the other way on the bar with Evee hurrying behind her as eager as Katie to sit down and each. Katie headed for the cash register planning to just pay for this food then be done, but then she passed the butter cover rolls which found a handful tossed into both their plates along side the casserole already taking up much of the room, then she passed the flakey buttery chicken calzones which she just had to add a few on top her and Evee's pile and slather it in marinara sauce. Evee watched her trainer load their plates with a mountain of food but didn't dare protest the fact she could never eat the human sized proportions, she was just to hungry to watch Katie put any of it back. Finally after needing to add some fried chicken, not being able to pass the marshmallow cover sweet potatoes without pushing a scoop next to the piles, and the smoked salmon just found it's way onto the pile Katie struggled to balance the plates as she stepped up to the cashier. However Katie found nothing there but a display screen above the register that said \"free of charge\". Katie looked back to Nurse Joy to confirm but the over stuffed Nurse was no where to be found. A quick scan of the area showed no one of authority just a multitude of obese trainers stuffing their faces, Katie got the idea and looked for a seat. Katie and Evee picked a table at the far end of the Cafeteria close to the entrance where she first came in because most of the young trainers had taken seats near the buffet itself and Katie and Evee were somewhat creeped out by the way neither the pokemon could ever aknowlage anything aside from their food or the TV's they were glued to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie came to her chosen seat and took a moment to study it. The seat was wide like a couch and obviously had deep thick cushions. The table was crescent shaped on a flexible arm that pivoted from one side of the chair so you could sit in the chair and adjust the table to fit your required distance. Katie took a seat and sank into the pillowy cushions, it felt like Katie was floating on air and her muscles instantly relaxed. Katie felt a shudder of pleasure wash over her as her slim butt sank in feeling a warmth within the seat heating it. Katie could almost fall asleep right there if her hunger wasn't so overpowering. Katie just let the pleasure washing over her as a soft coo and looked to the table. Katie pulled the table closer to reach her food and Evee leapt up onto the cushion beside her then to the table to reach her plate. Katie scanned the edge of the table closest to her and found a small array of buttons to be played with. Katie didn't want to break anything by pushing random buttons but she did find the recognizable shape of a TV remote nestled in the cluster of buttons and gave it a try. Katie watched the TV before her flicker to life with the same uneven blinking all the TVs seemed to have but after studying it for a few moments it was actually less noticeable than Katie thought as the more she watched the less she could even tell the TV was blinking at all. She soon found a show featuring two very fat women discussing the latest in trendy fashion and must have gadgets. Katie thought the girls looked familiar but still knew they looked nothing like anyone she knew, but in fact they were. Stacey Marquies a young Brazilian fashion star and Gwen Douglas a 20 something home trends guru were once a pair of TV consonants about what's what in today's hippest crowd till they disappeared in the middle of a cross country tour to update everyone's wardrobe and living room one town at a time 3 years ago. Now the two young women and their camera crew were permanent residents of Donut Town and all at least 350 pounds heavier, It was no wonder Katie couldn't recognize them under the layers of flab and food stains that ran down their trendy dresses. Now their shows focused more on which of today's fashions could stand up to a avalanche of belly without splitting at the seems and which patterns looked the cutest with all your food satins, ironically fashion wasn't that big in Donut Town since everyone was slobs and could sit around naked for all they cared, but the shows were comforting to the young girls in town who once obsessed over what they wore everyday before they became drooling messy slobs, the shows helped them feel like they were still on the cutting edge of fashion even if all they wore were tattered stained shirts and the most elastic pants they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's stomach roared puling her back to why she was here in the first place: to eat. Katie tore into the pile of food scooping down into the casserole and placing the spoon in her mouth, the flavor melted into her tongue and Katie moaned at the shock of taste that hit her. She moved the spoon fasted grabbing a larger spoonful faster this time and bite down hard on the spoon trying to drive her tongue into the cheesy casserole as much as she could. After Several bites Katie only found herself getting hungrier and hungrier, Katie stopped trying to aim for the casserole and started just digging her spoon down the entire length of the pile scooping multiple dishes into her fork and spoon and stuffing them in her mouth feeling the explosion of flavor and shuddering with delight. Katie's pace quickened as the powerful appetite stimulants in the food began to run their course driving Katie's hunger through the roof. Soon Katie was leaned down with her face inches from the food shoveling the food in as fast as she could chew. Evee on the other hand was on the table face first in her platter wolfing down the food as fast as Katie. Evee started with small bites but they grew larger and larger until Evee simply buried her muzzle in the mush of food and started slurping it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth trainer and pokemon inhaled their food for fifteen minuets until Evee backed off from her plate and let her knees buckle till the poor little pokemon was trying to rest on the table but was really resting on top a stuffed belly that swelled forward from her body and forced the Pokemon to rock back and forth on the round belly  that was nearly a quarter of her own body size. Evee groaned in discomfort and rolled onto her back kicking her legs limply to the sides and panted stuffed full. Katie tipped her plate back and licked it clean dribbling a few specks of food across the top of her shirt. Katie still had the presence of mind to dab at them with a napkin but there were none to be found, napkins were of no use to a slob after all. Katie just lifted her shirt to her mouth and licked the spots up leaving slight stains in their place. Katie glanced up at her Pokemon, Evee was in pain from how stuffed she was. Evee had eaten close to half the pile of food on her plate and had specks of food all across the front of her furry face. Katie eyed what was left of Evee's plate and felt her own stomach gurgle. Katie had eaten her entire serving, she wasn't far from eating more than she had ever eaten in a single serving and yet Katie still felt like she was starving. In a display of no manners Katie reached forwards and pulled Evee's plate to her and dug in, unable to find her spoon at first Katie simply grabbed shoved her face to the food and slurped up bites making a mess around her mouth. Soon Katie's wandering hand found the spoon nearby and brought it to the plate shoveling the pile forward to her eager mouth. Katie soon scooped the contents of the plate into her mouth and once again licked the plate clean getting more food onto her shirt. Katie leaned back in the fluffy seat feeling satisfied. Katie looked down at her shirt and saw more stained but she was just to full to try to licked them off again. Katie rubbed her stuffed belly that poked up pushing her shirt out of the way. Katie felt a rumble of gas push up her throat, Katie started to let it out freely but at the last moment choked it back to a silent burp and managed a meek \"Excuse me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked around the table her head felt fuzzy. The combination of the hum in the air and the TV's subliminal messages assaulting her subconscious that was now weakened by the itis that was setting in from her food binge Katie's head wasn't quite responding like she wanted. Katie did notice she had eaten Evee's food without asking <br>\r\nand quickly apologized <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Eve I didn't mean to eat your food like that, I was hungry and you didn't seem to be eating anymore so I...\" Katie tried to explain but Evee just whimpered in pain and Katie decided the message was received. Katie relaxed more into the plush of the chair and felt herself falling asleep. Katie took one last look at the mess she had made on the table and the few specks of food on her shirt and decided to clean it up later just as her eyes shut and she drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A secret tunnel deposited her atop the emperor bed. She farted and giggled. Suddenly, she released an open floodgate of drool with a single burp. Fating and burping, the noises and smells called a bellboy. Glaceon was hungry! She called for all the food she could have. Strangely, it was pumped like before, but she loved every second of the growth. The fatterning liquid swelled and swelled her. Suddenly, the food stopped and Evan opened the door. He was being pumped as well. He began swelling and finished at a giant 300, but was miniature compared to his Pokemon. He ended up compressed in Glaceon's fat rolls.

She shook off the blindfold and saw she was wearing a full bodysuit, in a nice outside setting. She walked over to a pool and sat near it, touching the water. It seemed warm, so she sat inside. Glaceon missed the fact that her bodysuit was filling up with water, and the ice in her body froze it over. What the Glaceon didn't know was that she was gaining lots of new layers of ice on top of her body, and whenever she wanted, it could become a new paunch! Her bodysuit had a special property, however... she couldn't notice the ice forming in the relaxing water. Then, when the ice filled the tiny hot tub, an injection poked into her arm through the suit. Due to the calming water, she didn't notice her body swelling to accommodate the ice. The suit shrunk to its normal, size, and the feeling of tightness was so uncomfortable she walked out. The skinny Glaceon now had a bubble paunch that was about 2 and a half feet circumference. However, due to her flabby legs, she could manage a waddle. The suit kept her looking and seeming normal, however, and results were displayed on a tiny screen to her trainer, Evan. Glaceon was escorted out of the room and to the cafeteria for dinner.</span></div></div>",

They had dated for almost two months but as time went on, she became clingier with her boyfriend to the point where he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and dumped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last few days, she was sitting on her couch watching TV with the blinds closed and the lights turned off so that she could wallow in her depression.

Tired of getting bags of Chocolate that cost 10 dollars but only give you 500 mgs?\u201d The commercial then transitioned to a Machamp in a chocolate factory holding up his product. \u201cHi Billy Champ here for Choco Paradise.

Her thighs had increased in width to the point where the term Thunder Thighs would be an understatement, her legs were also slowly getting bigger and her butt was also beginning to sage due to how huge it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while she was devouring the chocolate and her body was expanding, the chocolate that was on her paws and lips were beginning to melt and drip onto her toes, giving off a disgusting but sweet smelling scent to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished the pile, Sylveon proceeded to sit down and felt the boards creak as a result of her huge butt and belly, but she didn\u2019t care as she proceeded to rub her belly with the rest of the chocolate on her paws. As the melted chocolate went down her belly, Sylveon felt very warm from it and also became very aroused by the hot and sweet-smelling liquid going down her body like a waterfall. The pleasure was so great to her that she felt something warm beneath her legs and she had a dirty look on her face as well as a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only thing her body was expelling as the digested chocolate was creating a lot of gas in her body that was slowly building up as time went on.

As the pressure slowly began to build up, Sylveon\u2019s smirk grew wider and wider as the pressure building up felt very arousing. Eventually, she couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and released her butt cheeks and let out a huge fart so powerful that it shook up the room.

She started with quick licks around the texture, but then she slowed down her licks so that she could savour the taste of the melted chocolate mixed in with her own sweet saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the block began to shrink further and further, her body expanded to insane proportions as her butt expanded several feet, her thighs became insanely huge with layers upon layers of fat that made her legs almost unusable, her toes were so thick and laden with fat she could hardly move it, and her belly was so enormous that it began to cover her entire floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sylveon was in such a euphoric state that destroying her house didn\u2019t really matter to her as she continued to expand further and further in weight, as well as height. Once she finished the final block of chocolate, she was immense. Her thighs were huge, she couldn\u2019t move her legs, her butt was so huge that she could feel her ceiling and her belly was so big and fat that she couldn\u2019t see anything in her home anymore except for a huge ball of her own fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylveon inspected the damage her over-eating had done, she felt proud of herself. \u201cThat was fun, I feel so much better now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after a long day of eating, Sylveon decided to take a snooze while using her soft and furry belly as a pillow.

Hey, being a slob isn't so bad after all,\" Mew said, beginning to drool over himself.<br>\r\n     Jirachi smiled. \"Glad you like it.\" All of a sudden, Jirachi had become just as fat as Mew, uttering a long, loud belch and drooling. \"Well, let's get to the - URRRRRRRRRRRRP - club. I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n     Mew nodded, and Jirachi wished them to the club, where a rather thin human was waiting for them.<br>\r\n     \"Hello, Mr. Jirachi and Mr. Mew.

It was definitely something that was fitting for such a high class place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look down into the tub, to take more of it in, but didn't find any sort of hole that would allow the hot air jets to enter the tub.

The temperature of the water being just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream furred pokemon purred to herself a moment before hopping right into the water, her bulk displacing a larger amount of water than she would've though, but it wasn't too bad.

Her eyes opening again as she glanced down into the clear rippling waters and found herself bloated looking. She had gotten it before from the way her owner kept her fed, but nothing like this. </span></div></div>",

It was almost too painful to bear, even as she slipped over to the rim, she couldn't hold it in any more. She blushed deeply as a deep, gurgling sound erupted through the waters and produced bubbles all over the hot tub, quite well enough to make up for any missing jets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced back, her fur soaked and still dripping as she sniffed the air, wrinkling it a bit at her own unusually potent stink. Ninetails looked around the room once again, trying to think of something, but after letting the slightly befouled air sit around her a little longer. It didn't seem so bad that she would have to smell it, at least it was a one time occurrence. She walked around a little and found the water on her body drying faster than she also would've thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetails smiled again before looking down at her thick fluffy fur and the walked over to one of the plush beds that had been set out for her before walking over to it and laying on the big pillow. She glanced at the TV and thought on turning it on for a moment before she sniffed the air again. She leaned up and glanced around, her ears perked as she caught something of a musky scent to the air. She wondered if there was another pokemon nearby her, but this room was only for her. Ninetails glanced down at herself and sniffed down around her legs before pulling back. It was her, she was the one emitting that stink, but she had just been sitting in the pool.

She couldn't control these and it also caused her to drool on top of everything else. When her drool hit her skin, the smooth and cold texture of it caused her body heat to increase which also resulted in a lot of sweat appearing on Ninetails' body, resulting in the bedding getting wet as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ninetails continued to try and breathe in clean air, she now had another thing to worry about. As she tried to inhale and exhale, she was assaulted by her now dirty and rotten breath, which only increased her coughing/gagging fits and also caused more drool to exit from her mouth in a now thicker stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the drool hit her skin once again, her body heat continued to rise and the sweat on her body only increased as the seconds passed by. Her bedding felt even wetter to the touch and she was beginning to look like she was in a sauna as the sweat also began to thicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her butt also began emitting gas which only added to the terrible scent that Ninetails was already inhaling into her body.

A broad beam of radiance burst through the dusty windows of a nearby abandoned apartment, its only denizen sprawled out lazily by the window where the warmth pooled together; a most comfortable Meowth indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But for all the comfort the lazy feline felt, an audible gurgling rose from his belly, causing him to stir about with a disgruntled, incoherent mumble. Hunger compelled him to rise from his spot, sitting on his haunches with a yawn most wide. Although he was rather fond of his home, the Meowth didn't have a very abundant food source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering these events, Meowth felt the subtle, but rising aroma of a meat most coveted by his tastes; the awesome scent of wholesome fried chicken. His palate kicked in involuntarily, turning to the source of the scent while drooling incoherently. Just outside of the dirty hovel was a street merchant, peddling his poultry wares in a big metal cart, keeping the cooked confectionaries nice and toasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent drove his appetite mad, determined to capture that bounty of meat. Hopping down from his window seat, the feline Pok\u00e9mon dashed toward a hole in the far wall, popping out into the alleyway shortly after. Cautiously, he peeked his head around the corner to observe the merchant finishing a sale with a hungry youth, a spike of jealousy manifesting in the Meowth's subconscious. How he envied those with money! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, however, that Meowth witnessed a very strange event. In broad daylight, amidst a crowd of bustling people, the merchant abruptly left, leaving his cart unmanned and unprotected. Where had he gone so casually? To the bathroom? This boggled the feline's mind. Suspicion arose in his thoughts, but this was abandoned in favor of the delicious aroma wafting from the metal cart. Slowly, sneakily, he began to approach his 'prey,' slinking along the brick surface of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even now the scent held strong, as though each inhale were a crowd cheering for his success. The cart's height was a mere three feet tall, nothing the agile creature couldn't handle. With a quick, nimble pounce he leapt up to the heated surface of the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough consumed with hunger, he was not stupid in his efforts of thievery. He looked around at the various people passing him by, wondering why it was that they did not notice his presence. Perhaps they thought the Pok\u00e9mon was the merchant's pet, but they seemed to pay no heed to him lifting the circular grate that hid the meat so sought after. Upon lifting the top, the Meowth nearly collapsed with happiness at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the cart lay, strangely, an enormous bag with a spice-laden interior, enhancing the flavor of the chicken that lay piled up within. Their crispy exteriors glittered with a healthy auburn hue familiar to most fried chicken, steam rising from the moist, alluring meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth resisted the urge to eat it right then and there, preferring to eat in the comfort of his own home as it was. Rapidly tying up the bag, he soon discovered the one flaw of his plan - it seemed the bag was quite heavy, and the feline wasn't quite strong enough to lift it easily out of the cart. But he was determined to eat, summoning his strength to lift the heavy bag out of the cart with a strained grunt, nearly falling off the edge as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bag in paw, the Meowth tossed the chicken-filled sack down onto the warm concrete sidewalk, hopping down to grab the meat and bring it home. Even now, the people thought nothing of the strange event, a feline Pok\u00e9mon slowly dragging a bag of meat easily two or three times his size into a dirty alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed, and the Meowth had succeeded. Using a sharp claw he rendered the tie on the top of the bag to shreds, the small mountain of chicken tumbling out on top of him. Spicy grease oozed into his fur, something he simply ignored in favor of bathing in his prize. Looking around at each massive leg, breast, wing, and any other articles of food in between, he rubbed his paws together, and began to eat.</span></div></div>",

A vast multitude of chicken legs, tall and small, big and juicy, each one beckoning him to consume. As if he needed any more encouragement! He lashed out at the bountiful harvest with both paws, opening his jaws wide to clamp down on two legs and once. Tears nearly burst from his eyes at the flavor, truly being the best food he had tasted in his lifetime. This awesome taste only spurred him on to eat, gnashing the supple, tender chicken in his maw, grease running down his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon swallowing, he immediately consumed the rest of the present chicken and tossed the bones behind him, licking his lips of excess grease. At that moment, the feline Pok\u00e9mon began to gorge, pushing chicken into his mouth as though he were going to win a prize, cheeks overstuffed with every tender morsel that he ripped right off the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even halfway did his stomach visibly began to blimp out from his rapid consumption, barely chewing his food. The results were not dramatic by far, but one could easily see his furry belly sagging to the ground, a pile of chicken bones soon surrounding its swelling mass. His limbs and buttocks soon followed after, the enormity of his rump pushing the bones he had discarded initially further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach gulp caused his hindpaws to flex in raw bliss, overwhelmed by just how much he was receiving in such a short amount of time. His body was overwhelmed as well, a single roll of fat building up on his stomach, while a few more bulked up over his arms, legs, and neck. His cheeks grew chubby, and his chin grew large. By the end of his massive meal, he had grown just as big - if not a little bit bigger - than the bag he had stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBones littered around him like a weak throne, a monument to his victory over his meal. Meowth leaned back with a satisfied groan, paws roaming over his distended belly, fumbling about with his equally blimped navel. It was good to be full. Too good. Grease 'n gas bubbled up in his gut, prompting him to let out a thunderous belch that echoed throughout the room: \"<i>Bh-Bhuuu-huuuuuuuuurrrrrrrp!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not all celebration and joy. An enormous pressure welled up within his body, like a burp that just wouldn't surface. The Meowth grunted and squirmed, but to no avail, as the discomfort spread throughout his entire body... but it became subtle, like a tingle. And then, he knew. And he knew all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spices! They were no spice, they were merely flavor enhancing chemicals laced with side effects to make the victim easier to catch. Fortunately for him, he was already hidden. Unfortunately, his body began to suffer the effects, tilting his head back in a groan of pressure. It began.</span></div></div>",

In fact, the Meowth felt close to nothing, save for exotic tingles arcing through his body, as thought the weakest of lightning bolts were pelting his flabby frame. In fact, it almost felt... <i>good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, quite suddenly, it kicked in, starting from the very tips of his toes. He watched in awe as each little toe swelled, claws remaining sheathed throughout, though the opening seemed to shudder and heave, raw fat sinking into the pores of his toes. The sight was grotesque to behold, each bloated digit easily larger than the rest of his feet... at least, until they too would grow. Each paw pad grew plump and saggy, accenting the heaving mounds of flesh that became his paws. Even if he was presently obese, his very feet had evolved into a gargantuan mass in a very short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis front paws and limbs soon followed suit, arms 'n legs bulking up in a manner most foul, the sound of bubbling heard beneath his flesh as fat piled up upon itself, giving each arm and leg an exceedingly chunky appearance. His paws became useless, holding them up to his face to watch each finger become fat sacks of flab, much of it sinking into the clefts that hid his claws. He could barely flex or move any of his digits, awakening a nameless fear in his heart. He then discovered it was not fear he felt, but a sickening sensation welling up in the pit of his throat, or rather, in the back of his mouth. Sweat built up on his 'brow, beginning to pant... He didn't feel well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation grew and grew 'til he could contain it no more, his maw stretching wide, wide open to deposit a massive amount of... saliva!? Yes, his very palate and saliva glands had grown to the size of watermelons, generating enough drool to constantly wash over his body in a constant stream, sinking into the rolls of his growing gut before his eyes. The very waves of drool seemed to awaken the growth of his belly and butt, cellulite manifesting in pound after pound of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin short time his tummy easily became the largest aspect of his chunky frame, fat legs stretched around the sagging sphere of suffocating substance. Multiple rolls of fat laced across his gut like a meaty lengths of garland, his behemoth button sticking out like a hairy dome. Nearly matching the overwhelming size of his gut was his ample pair of buttocks, each flabby mountain accented by his only mildly affected tail, the curled up length now nothing more than a straightened out pole of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat Pok\u00e9mon was having trouble breathing behind the weight of his body and the constant outflow of raw saliva, puddles of drool pooling up around his obese body. Topping off his transformation was his head, starting with his neck - the formerly short and neat pole now littered with rolls upon rolls of flesh that, along with his many chins, spilled out over the top of his torso. Each cheek soon tried to sag toward the ground, not so much from fat but from the drool constantly developing in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow thoroughly fattened and immobile, Meowth felt the pressure leave his body, giving him a moment's respite to recover his senses. Every pore in his body screamed, the heat of his body squeezing out dollop after dollop of moist sweat, mingling with the multitudes of drool slopping out over his body at any given moment. Though he felt vulnerable in his behemoth form, he felt somehow... <i>good</i>. So good, in fact, that he felt the urge to stand up. One... two... heave! Somehow, someway, the massive Meowth managed to stand on his two wobbly legs, barely able to support his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad to know he wasn't fully immobile, but he now he needed to make some decisions, such as what to do next. Unfortunately for him, his body began to make decisions on its own, stomach rumbling and growling with sudden anger, the oh so familiar pressure returning. Was he going to grow again? No... that wasn't it. His stomach was telling him something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... What could it possibly be?</span></div></div>",

He began to wheeze, sputtering up more drool as his stomach inflated within, the pressure was almost unbearable, and he opened his mouth to yelp but instead a massive belch erupted forth.  Spittle flew from his mouth as his burp echoed into the sky, he panted and burped again, and again, he felt like a deflating balloon!  He covered his fat face and belched into his blubbery paws instead, then vomitted thick-goopy drool all over himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so happy to be full and fat for once, but this was becoming interesting, and the \"worst\" had yet to occur.  He shifted his obese body as another rumble shook his wobbling frame, he bent over lightly and a blurt of gas escaped his thick, cellulite covered rear.  His sausage-like tail twitched and his eyes went wide and he gripped his sides, another painful swelling and \"FRRRARRT!\"  Meowth moaned in his mind, he began panting loudly and leaned forward and spread his blubbery cheeks, forcing more gas to explode from his rear entrance.  His drool-soaked faced harbored a grin and he closed his eyes, letting a nice deep fart rumbled out, squeezing and releasing his tailhole as he played with the noise of the escaping farts.

If the subject could still move upon being altered, surely \"Plan B\" would be to make him heavier 'til he couldn't walk. Or at least, that's what the Pok\u00e9mon thought as he waddled toward the hole in the wall, drool spewing from his maw with every tremoring step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon discovered, however, that the hole was no longer big enough to support his behemoth bulk, prompting in several options for the feline. He could simply crash through the brittle surface and barge into the alleyway, or he could try an alternative approach. Desolate as the area was, he still felt he could attract noise by his actions if he chose the former choice, prompting him to stand and think for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer, or so he thought, came naturally to him. With a gargantuan belch, a steaming torrent of drool catapulted out of his maw and onto the hole, coating it in a thick layer of sloppy drool. Meowth thought this ought to be a good enough lubricant to slide his body through, watching the tendrils of slime drip along the edges of the beckoning hole. He lowered his body as best as he could, laying on his slick, blubbery stomach to push himself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he immediately found himself stuck upon entering the hole, stereotypically stuck at the halfway point of his body. It seems his titanic tummy couldn't get through, leaving Meowth to groan in dissatisfaction. His frustration caused his gut to rumble, belching out a thorough wave of drool onto the stone flooring of the alley. His innards continued to rumble... and immediately another idea formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering his will, the Pok\u00e9mon held his lips tight while breathing calmly through his nose, keeping all orifices as inhumanly tight as possible. As if immediately sensing this defiance, his gas production kicked into overdrive, stomach gurgling and growling in anger. Involuntarily he began to belch, but he didn't release it, simply letting it collect in his cheeks along with his drool. His bowels were on fire, swollen with an overabundance of gas that tried to free itself, but barely managed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the Meowth began to inflate then and there, stomach lifting off the ground. The bloated belly began to lose its chunky appeal, becoming much more of a sphere in the process. Limbs, arms, face - nothing was untouched by the blocked flow of gas, eyes near bulging from the sockets of his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after reaching a large enough size, the hole burst into splinters, creating a much larger hole in the process, more than enough for the fat feline to slide through. Satisfied, he let his body bulk up ever so slightly before releasing all he had stored up in one single eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began with his rump. Like a smelly typhoon it came, a roaring thunder that heralded a stench most foul, the entirity of the room behind him manifesting as nothing more than a festering hovel of stink. The very whiff of his scent caused his lips to part in a literal torrent of drool, belching harshly in the process, propelling each steaming gallon of raw saliva against the far wall of the alley. Again and again his front and backside howled out in rip after rip of air, the scent of his rump so foul it nearly had substance, while the overflow of drool threatened to pour out into the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, quite abruptly, it stopped. Like a flood barred by gates of fat his body quieted, and he was thankful, managing to slide up to his chunky footpaws once more. He was now free, but the recent expulsion left him oh so hungry - hungrier than he had ever been. His drool was now sincere rather than involuntary, sliding down his rotund gut and sinking between his fat flexing toes. It was time to eat! But what to eat, hmm...?</span></div></div>",

The gardevoir's stomach let out a hungry grumble, and despite her best judgement, she began to eat, devouring the food that was in front of her. She panted a bit, burping after she finished over half of the food laid out for her. She ate and ate, moaning as she felt her belly get fuller and fuller. Once the Gardevoir got a break, she relaxed back, moaning softly...until she looked at her belly. She gets up, screaming in horror at her new gut.

The Chansey was at least 600 pounds, her feet were hidden by a massive rool of flab that just spilled out before her and wrapped aroud the sides of her fat body. As she waddled into the room it looked like a over filled pink water ballon was wobbling back and forth swaying side to side. As The chansey passed through the door she turned and waddled towards the table against the wall to place the tray down. As she turned Gardevoir could see the heels of her feet for the first time barely showing between either side of the roll of flab that wrapped around her body just under her large rear that shifted up and down as Chansey waddled. A wet trail stared to appear ubnder her feet that trailed along with her as she moved, Gardevoir quickly realized the drool comign out of the Chansey's mouth was dripping down her huge belly and being painted on the floor by the Chansey's belly which drug on the ground slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir's examination of the impossibly fat Chansey was cut off by another person entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Nurse Joy's Daughter, Nurse Joyce!\" A young girl announced entering the room. She could not have been any older than 18 at most. Her hair was a darker shade of red than the typical Nurse Joy and she had it cut short with sharp bangs in front that framed her face and a thin pony tail that came out the back of her head and curved down to just below her shoulders. Her uniform wasn't pink like her mothers, She wore the stardemark white apron but her dress  was a dark red and didn't have the poofy shoulders and came down to only her mid thigh, or least it should have. Joyce was nearly 300 pounds and was literally pouring out of her uniform everywhere there was a gap and what wasn't exposed was clearly pressed tight against the unifrom making it skin tight, each breath she took looked as if it would burst every button on her dress. She wasn't mush better than the Chansey with her drool as small wet spots in the top of her uniform showed and her apron had a couple dozen food stains in it, most of which were chocolate. The girl smiled uncertainly amd fiddled with her clip board. \"I usually introduce myself as my mother's daughter first since her and her sisters are so well known but I guess that doesn't make much difference to you since you're a wild Gardevoir, huh? Anyway as I said I'm Nurse Joyce and I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the Slob Club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chansey...\" the pink blob in the corner muttered under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so a nurse!\" Joyce barked getting defencive \"Or I almost am anyway! It's not my fault the online Nurse training program takes so long to complete! You know full well I'd be enrolled at the Nurse's school with all the others Nurse Joy daughters if it wasn't for.. well...\"  Joyce trailed off looking down at her fat covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was getting a little creeped out by this point. First someone kidnapped her from her beautiful lakeside home and now she was stuck in a room with this two fat slobs!  And what is this... \" Slob club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joyce looked back to Gardevoir as if sensing what she was thinking. \"Sorry about that, that Chansey never gives me any respect, I think it's becuase I'm still not  a full Slob like most of our members... especially my mother...\" Joyce finished under her breath. \"But you'll meet her leater, Anyway I'm NURSE Joyce and I am here to welcome you to the Slob Club. You're here becuase we recently recruited a...\" Joyce paused looking at her chart. \"Roselia! From your area. And she told us about how you didn't fit in with the other Gardevoir and spent most of your day lazing about the lake, naturally we just had to recruit you, and if you do choose to join that Roselia will get an extra box of donuts for a month as a reward for finding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir knew the Roselia she was talking about. There used to be a Roselia in the forest she hung out with from time to time just sitting by the lake all day taking it easy. But she hadn't seen her in months, Gardevoir assumed she had been captured by a trainer, She never guessed she had been swept into some club of slobs... Gardevoir gasped, did that mean her friend was a slob now too?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain a few things before I let you eat, This is a Slob club but we are under a Pokemon Center. Most Slob Clubs start with Pokemon center when the Nurse joy in charge agrees to let the president of the Slob clubs open it, just between you and me I think most Nurse joy's say no to the request but one way or another the president makes them Slob lovers\" Joyce said on the sly then thumped her belly and made it jiggle \"Though I can't say I'm that far off from being a slob myself ever since my mom started me working down here so she could join in with the Slobs here, and I have to admit the Slob lifestyle is started to grow on me as much as it did my mom, I guess eventually I'll end up trading in my nurse apron for a belly apron and joining as well, guess I'll have to hire one of my frineds or course since I'm to young to have a daughter...\" Joyce said getting off track \"Er. ahem sorry\" Joyce apologized and held up her clip board pulling back some forms to show a picture of the Slob club logo and a picture of a couple fat pokemon dancing around it \"Anyway The slob club was started by it's president who started by recruiting lazy trainers who didn't do much adventuring and all had out of shape pokemon who were as lazy as they were after never being in many battles and spending most of their time in pokeballs.\" Joyce flipped to the next page and showed some fat trainers and fat pokemon eating \"The club grew and prospered taking in many members who all grew became fat slobs.\" Joyce fumbled for the next page which showed wild pokemon looking quizicly at the fat slob pokemon and trainers. \"But then came the issue of wild pokemon, it was no surprise many pokemon in the wild were perfect slob canidantes without being the pokemon of a lazy trainer to make them equally lazy and so we began to search for and take in wild pokemon as you were. Annualy we take in 19 wild pokemon at this Slob Club in addition to the 26 traniers and thier pokemon we recruit from the Pokemon Center above us. I'd like to give you more history on the subject but thats all the basics I have, from here on out you'll be writing the history of the club for yourself, that is if you decide to join the Slo- Chansey!\" Joyce yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChansey had taken the distracting history leason as a chance to help herself to the tray of food. Chnasey looked up with some crumbs around her mouth and tried to appear innocent. Joyce stormed over to her and grabbed her hand and started to drag her towards the door. \"You know better than to eat other slobs food! No good Chansey... So much of a slob you're even to lazy to evolve into a Blissey like the others! You're on drool mop detail for the rest of the day, you've been making as much of a mess on the floors as the other slobs!\" Joyce looked back to Gardevoir and tried to smile as she wrestled Chansey out the door. \"I'm sorry about this, I'll be back later to discuss if you want to become a member, until then please help yourself to the food this fat blob didn't gobble down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chansey Chansey!\" The fat pokemone protested as the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir cautiously walked over to the food and looked at it for a while. This was all to much, she didn't want to become a slob! This place was crazy. It didn't help she was a wild pokemon suddenly stuck in the human world, hell this was her first time even being in a room let alone meeting a human. Now they wanted to fatten her up into a drooling messy Slob?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir's stomach growled loudly starting to hurt she was so hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a few bites... just to take away this hunger\" she thought \"The I'm going home to my lake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir picked up a cupcake</span></div></div>",

You know that. You've even started to put on more pounds three chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir smiled, her re-entry into civilization was going nicely.

Grovyle and Gallade were eating happily, stuffing food in at a leisurely pace. Suddenly a huge mountain of food came out of a hole in the table right in front of her, and before she had time to react, the smell wafted over her. before she could stop herself, she grabbed a fist full of macaroni and cheese and stuffed it right in to her mouth. she barely had time to register the unbelievable taste. she grabbed a huge cheesy glob with her other hand that followed the first. she proceeded to eat frantically like this, one hand after another after another.<br>\r\nas she stuffed her face she looked to see the effects it had on the other Pokemon. the grass type couple was eating with a care free demeanor, eating at a steady pace with one hand, and using the other to rub their bulging figures. Grovyle threw a hand full of spaghetti at his swollen lover, and they both broke out in to fits of laughter, spitting food everywhere.<br>\r\nAcross from her the Gallade shoveled food in at a faster pace than she did, picking up entire bowls and scooping the contents in to his mouth, though getting almost as much on him as in him. he was constantly jiggling and leaning, trying to get past his imposing gut. they made eye contact for a second, and she saw in his swollen face an expression of happiness, and he quickly diverted his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"he loves being a slob too!\" she thought to herself. she finally felt a glimmer of hope that she wasn't alone. but as she brought her attention back on herself, she felt the hope start to fade. her body was expanding right before her eyes! each of her breasts were now about the size of her ass and had stretch marks forming on them. they also had a layer of food covering them from her rushed eating. she grabbed one in her hand and tried to lift it, but could only keep it off of her stomach for a few seconds before her arm gave and it slid off of her hand, smacking on to her stomach and causing her entire front to jiggle. her belly was now touching the table, and she could feel her gut start to envelope it. her butt cheeks were also starting to widen and as they did so, they slid off the sides of the chair. she felt the little chair slowly sliding inch by inch up her crack as she shoveled down the food.<br>\r\nsuddenly she felt something welling deep in her gut. she realized that she needed to fart, and bad. looking across the table at the Gallade, who quickly averted his eyes. She could feel it slowly building up as she ate more and more. finally she shoveled in the last piece of her massive meal, and as she felt the slice of delicious apple pie slide down her throat, she knew it was the end. with explosive force she let rip a huge fart. her entire body shook from the force, and she heard a crack in the chair. all she could do is shoot a quick look at the Gallade's smiling face before the wood cracked and the chair imploded sending her plummeting to the ground. she opened her eyes and saw three blobs hovering above her. the revolting Pokemon bent over a little so she could see their faces. instead of disgust, Gallade had a look of concern on his face while the other two had smiles on their rounded faces. they helped her up on to her feet.<br>\r\n\"are you hurt?\" the Gallade asked<br>\r\n\"of course she's fine, look at all that padding she has\" Roserade said, laughing hysterically, before Gardevoir could reply<br>\r\n\"yes I'm fine. thank you for asking\" she said. she cringed as she pulled a piece of the chair out from her crack.<br>\r\n\"well it was only a matter of time\" said Grovyle, picking up the shards of wood \"that was our last normal chair. all the others are specially designed for... fuller figured people.\" as he said that he motioned with a sausage like claw at the other chairs, which were more than twice as wide and much sturdier<br>\r\n\"well we should probably go trade those splinters in for a real chair\" said Roserade \" we'll be right back!\" she said as the two grass types lumbered out, leaving the other two alone. when they had left she stormed in to the living room and sat herself on the sofa, giving an angry burp.<br>\r\n\"whats wrong?\" asked Gallade as he followed her in to the room and spread his weight out on the adjacent sofa.<br>\r\n\"whath wrong? are you kidding? look at uth! we're dithguthting piles of flesh!\" she realized that her lisp was getting worse<br>\r\n\"wait, so you like being this way?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"of courthe! i don't know how thomebody ever could!\" she said as she grabbed a handful of mac and cheese and ate it.<br>\r\n\"most of the people here enjoy being slobs.

But what would normally disgust her is making her even more aroused as she felt her bottom getting wet and Gallade smirked at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this better?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" he said, as he went over to her and patted her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should sit down\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both found a bench and plopped down on it. as their bodies settled down from jiggling, Gardevoir felt her handles squish against Gallade's. the various liquids that moistened their bodies let their love handles slide and rub against each other as they breathed. As she sat their, she began to love the feeling even more. She loved the feeling of their two swollen sides folding in to each other. She let her tongue hang out and let her drool fall down and dirty herself even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to rub the folds on her side, feeling how the fat pushed itself up through her open fingers and she began to play with herself even more while Gallade went under her belly and began to tickle her legs, which caused her to get even wetter.</span></div></div>",

Being a wild pokemon, only rarely had she sampled human food, and she instantly saw what she had been missing. As she swallowed, the sweet cake felt light in her stomach, and she sighed from how heavenly the one sample of the cupcake had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit in again, for a repeat performance of the delicious cake. Within moments the cupcake was gone, and she stared at her crumb covered, empty hand. She already missed the astounding flavor of the little pastry. \"Maybe a few more wouldn't hurt.\" There was a cake that looked like it was made of the same stuff as the cupcake, and she picked up the entire dish, and was about to blindly bite into it. As her lips got near the edge of the sweet cake, she pulled pack. \"I'm not a slob!\" Images of her self in a similar state as the pair that entered her room. Herself covered in drool and obese.

She had been so small, only a foot tall, in the wild. \"I'd been told that you had finally arrived!\" It was difficult to recognize her in many respects, if for no other reason than her face had been radically transformed by pounds of weight rounding her cheeks and chins.

One of the garchomps waddled out of view, and came back with a rolling cart full of greasy foods of all kinds. he pulled it up next to her and picked up a small case. he opened it and took out a small pill. <br>\r\n\"this will make you a slob in no time\" the Garchomp said with an eerie smile</span></div></div>",

She knew she had to hold it in or he would never look at her again. she could feel it slowly building up as she ate more and more. finally she shoveled in the last piece of her massive meal, and as she felt the slice of delicious apple pie slide down her throat, she knew it was the end. with explosive force she let rip a huge fart. her entire body shook from the force, and she heard a crack in the chair. all she could do is shoot a quick look at the Gallade's surprised face before the wood cracked and the chair imploded sending her plummeting to the ground. she opened her eyes and saw three blobs hovering above her. the revolting Pokemon bent over a little so she could see their faces. instead of disgust, Gallade had a look of concern on his face while the other two had smiles on their rounded faces. they helped her up on to her feet.<br>\r\n\"are you hurt?\" the Gallade asked<br>\r\n\"of course she's fine, look at all that padding she has\" Roselia said, laughing hysterically, before Gardevoir could reply<br>\r\n\"yes I'm fine. thank you for asking\" she said. she cringed as she pulled a piece of the chair out from her crack.<br>\r\n\"well it was only a matter of time\" said Grovyle, picking up the shards of wood \"that was our last normal chair. all the others are specially designed for... fuller figured people.\" as he said that he motioned with a sausage like claw at the other chairs, which were more than twice as wide and much sturdier<br>\r\n\"well we should probably go trade those splinters in for a real chair\" said Roselia \" we'll be right back!\" she said as the two grass types lumbered out, leaving the other two alone. when they had left she stormed in to the living room and sat herself on the sofa, giving an angry burp.<br>\r\n\"whats wrong?\" asked Gallade as he followed her in to the room and spread his weight out on the adjacent sofa.<br>\r\n\"whath wrong? are you kidding? look at uth! we're dithguthting piles of flesh!\" she realized that her lisp was getting worse<br>\r\n\"wait, so you don't like being this way?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"of courthe not! i don't know how thomebody ever could!\" she said as she grabbed a handful of her corpulent gut<br>\r\n\"they made you take the pill didn't they\"<br>\r\n\"how did you-\"<br>\r\n\"made me take it too\" he replied. \"they force you to take one if you don't become a slob on your own\" he explained <br>\r\n\"do they make everybody?\"<br>\r\n\"most of the people here enjoy being slobs, so they usually only use it in special cases.

I know its gross, but if you drool more you empty your mouth, so you dont have a mouth full of spit to talk through\" she nodded and turned her head away. she tried to spit it out, but the spit stuck to her face and dripped down on to her chest. she gave a defeated sigh and turned back<br>\r\n\"is this better?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"yeah\" he said, but his voice sounded odd, and she realized that he was out of breath. she also felt the absence of strength<br>\r\n\"maybe we should sit down\" she said.<br>\r\n\"okay, but we cant sit for too long. when Roselia finds out we're missing she's going to ask around. then its only a matter of time before somebody in charge overhears her\" they both found a bench and plopped down on it. as their bodies settled down from jiggling, Gardevoir felt her handles squish against Gallade's. the various liquids that moistened their bodies let their love handles slide and rub against each other as they breathed. as she sat their, she realized she liked the feeling. she loved the feeling of their two swollen sides folding in to each other. suddenly she was snapped from the massaging feeling as Gallade jumped up<br>\r\n\"we cant let this get the best of us. I know it might feel good to be this way, but we have to remember that this is the pill. come on, we should get moving.\" he said. she got up, face red in embarrassment, and followed him. subconsciously she started to rub the folds on her side, feeling how the fat pushed itself up through her open fingers. <br>\r\n\"come on, its not that far to go\" he said and they turned a corner</span></div></div>",

I simply tell them what to do, and they follow. get up!\" she yelled in a commanding tone, and Gardevoir suddenly felt the bracelets pulling her on to her feet.<br>\r\n\"now lets go. we need to teach you little ones a lesson\" and she felt herself being dragged by the bracelets down the hall.<br>\r\n\"<i>can you hear me?</i>\" said a voice in her head, and she realized by the sound that it was Gallade<br>\r\n\"<i>yes. do you have a plan on getting us out of here?</i>\" she asked<br>\r\n\"<i>no I'm still thinking. but I noticed something. look at these Garchomps. they have more stretch marks than the two of us combined.

I practiced a lot after my first force feeding. believe it or not all this weight flying around can be used to your advantage\" he said<br>\r\n\"you're telling me\" she responded, looking back at the passed out female Garchomp, as her gut slowly started to hover again. \"what are you looking for?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"these Pokemon had levitators on them. that's why their guts float. Ah-ha!\" he exclaimed, pulling his hand out to reveal a goo covered control panel. he pressed a button and a  small glowing disk slid out from the Garchomps guts. \"these will take off some of the weight and make it easier for us to move. take one\" he said, and threw it to her. she caught it, and with some exertion, lifted her gut and placed the adhesive side on the bottom of her gut. she felt instant relief as her gut slowly levitated upwards, pushing her breasts slightly to the sides. she looked over and saw that he was doing the same, and he gave a visible relief as his slimy gut moved an inch or so up, pushing his man boobs off to the sides, making them connect with one of his many rolls of back fat. <br>\r\n\"we cant stay long\" he said, and he turned for the door. they started to walk, but on the way out she caught sight of the massive tray of food.</span></div></div>",

Gardevoir could feel tears start to form, when the Zoroark heaved Gardevoirs belly up with one hand. the movement caused her breasts to landslide down the sides of her belly. Gardevoir opened her mouth in amazement at the strength of the dark pokemon in front of her, to be able to lift the gut that she knew was so heavy<br>\r\n\"my word, what a foul stench! you really must clean out all these folds of yours!\" the Zoroark proclaimed, lifting her belly like the hood of a car. \"just look at all these stretch marks!\" she said as she disappeared from view behind Gardevoirs gut. with that she started to trace her finger along the taut skin of her inner thigh where the stretch marks had formed. Gardevoir exhaled suddenly as the Zoroark carressed her quivering thigh<br>\r\n\"s-stop it.\" she gasped weakly, but inside it was all she could do to moan and ask for more. it just felt so good-<br>\r\n\"HA!\" the zoroark let out a mirthless laugh \"so thats why! the swollen little piggy likes her hideous body!\" she dropped the gut, and laughed as it jiggled. Gardevoir turned to her psychic companion for help, only to see him staring blankly at the show. the Zoroark noticed too and turned to him as well<br>\r\n\"so that explains it! we have ourselves a voyeur! I was curious as to who would like to spend time witch such a hideously bloated bag of flesh.\" as she walked over to where he was slumped. Gallade snapped to and glared at the slender Zoroark<br>\r\n\"she could be twice her size and still be more beautiful than you, witch!\" he shouted an spat an incredible amount of spit at her. he smirked as it hit her in the face, wiping any trace of smile from her face. where the smile left was replaced by a look of sheer rage<br>\r\n\"well I guess we'll have to see, wont we\" she hissed back as gallade's smirk dissipated as well </span></div></div>",

Gardevoirs eyes started to tear up as she forced the foul food in, but with a grim resignation she realized what she must do. hand after hand, she grabbed food and shoveled it in to her gaping maw with the amazing proficiency that this horrible place had bestowed upon her.<br>\r\n\"<i>stop, please! just let them turn me!</i>\" Gallade begged psychically, eating as slowly as he could<br>\r\n\"<i>no! you tried so hard to get us out! you never gave up, and I won't let this place make you a fat disgusting monster like me!</i> she responded, shoving an entire pizza into the bottomless pit her mouth had become just for emphasis<br>\r\n\"<i>but you're not a monster! you're beautiful, and-</i><br>\r\n\"WHAT IN ARCEUS' NAME DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!\" screamed Zoroark. with unmatched speed, she grabbed a syringe, and like a hostage taker with a knife, held it up to Gardevoirs neck, which was slowly expanding up her chin. her face was contorted in rage once again as she yelled<br>\r\n\"don't you dare talk to each other in that way! you are livestock! I made that pill, and nobody should be strong enough to withstand its power!\" she rushed with blinding speed up to Gallade, and began stuffing the food in to his face. terror struck Gardevoir as she raced to shovel food in faster as she witnessed Zoroark snap.<br>\r\n\"This is my facility!\" she yelled as she stuffed a handful of rancid jellybeans in to his mouth. Gardevoir matched the amount<br>\r\n\"I am in control of everything here!!\" she shouted and forced a chocolate bar into his face, some of it missing and landing on his man boobs. Gardevoir grabbed two and threw them in with uncanny accuracy<br>\r\n\"I AM IN CONTROL OF ALL POKEMON\" she screamed, as she grabbed a handful of onion rings and basically punched him in the face with it. Gardevoirs mind was cloudy from all of the horrendous food, but she knew that she was good at getting fatter, and if that was what it took to make her stop, she would eat until she couldn't bring the food to her face. on the other end of the room, Zoroark dropped her food, screamed, and swung at Gallades swollen face with blinding speed.<br>\r\nGallade smiled, and opened his mouth.<br>\r\nZoroark went silent.<br>\r\nGardevoir stopped eating.<br>\r\nGallade stood up with her hand still in his mouth.<br>\r\nZoroark lashed out with her other hand<br>\r\nGallade caught her other hand<br>\r\nZoroarks face turned to fear<br>\r\nGallade stabbed her in the neck with the syringe in her hand<br>\r\nZoroark gasped<br>\r\nGallade sneered<br>\r\nGardevoir farted<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gallade opened his mouth and released Zoroark. she slid down his moobs and off his belly, then slumped to the ground, her face frozen in a state of shock. he picked her up, dragged her to the chair, and chained her down. then he turned and started to walk over to Gardevoir. she stared at him in disbelief as he lumbered over, not even noticing the foul taste of the food she was still absentmindedly eating. suddenly everything dawned on her, and her face lit up into a smile.<br>\r\n\"you did it!\" she shouted, over come with joy. she giggled and jumped to go meet him, only to have her wide ass slide off the chair and hit the floor with smack and a sickening splat as the various coatings on her massive butt hit the floor. her face reddened with embarrassment and she rolled forward on her gut to get her feet under her. Gallade rushed over as she tried once again to stand. with all her strength she forced herself to stand. slowly she rose as sweat flowed down her sticky glistening body as she rose slowly... only to be forced back down once her huge gut left the ground. Gallade offered her his hands and she grabbed them in hers, and they both heaved and groaned in exertion... to no avail. once again Gardevoir came crashing down on her ass, and she finally had to accept the truth<br>\r\n\"I cant get up!\" she cried in anguish \"she was right! I have turned into a hideous blob!\" she started crying and looked at Gallade's swollen face \"you resolve to escape, and all I do is eat! you make up plans while I just open my mouth and wait for somebody to fill it! you chain the leader of the whole facility to a chair and all can do is sit and wait for rescue before gut gets so big I cant pick it up!\" she cried and grabbed her huge gut in an attempted to move it, only to succeed in shaking it a bit and exemplifying that she cant even do that. \"now if you'll excuse me I should get back to eating\" she picked up a burger and brought it up to her mouth, but Gallades hand shot out and stopped her. <br>\r\n\"just let me ea-\" she stopped talking abruptly when he leaned and started to kiss her.<br>\r\nIt seemed to last for an eternity. they sat, him lying on her gut like a mattress, slid between her bovine tits. she closed her eyes, feeling the warm weight of him on her gut as the folds on their bodies squished together. for second she didnt care about anything. not her immobility, not the flatulence that was occuring frequently for both of them, not even the obscene ammount of drool that was dripping down their mouths. all she cared about as she sat with a roll of his back fat in her hand was him and the rancid, foul, wonderful taste of his mouth on hers. after much too soon, he pulled his head away (the roll of lard around her neck prevented her from doing so as well)<br>\r\nand smiled at her. \"I could have never done those things without a courageous, beautiful pokemon to show me something worth breaking out of here for\". he kissed her again and then slid down her gut back on to his feet.<br>\r\n\"now,\" he said cheerfully \"how about we get you up and moving again!\" he said cheerfully. he grabbed his gut and reached under it, fumbling around for a bit. finally, his eyes lit up \"aha!\" he exclaimed, and with a flick of his arm, his belly started hovering. \"I guess they didn't notice we had them on!\" he got down on the ground in front of her and reached under Gardevoirs belly. she shuddered in pleasure at the feeling of all her belly fat being pushed around, until finally a triumphant aha from Gallade proceeded by her belly slowly lifting itself off the ground. Gardevoir sighed in relief as the weight of her gut let up, and she jumped to her feet.<br>\r\n\"thank you!\" she cried, and almost went in for a hug until she remembered that she couldn't even touch her own belly button any more, let alone hug her newfound love.<br>\r\n\"Im glad I could help\" he said, patting her belly like a newly working machine. realizing that Gardevoir was glaring at him, he smiled apologetically and kissed her gut. she returned the smile, and they both turned to look at the captured Zoroark. the natural aura of litheness that she had was now totally gone. she sat, shaking and jumping every time she expelled a burp or a fart, as if the experience was totally new to her. even without food she was becoming a bit softer around the edges, and was sweating way more than a normal Pokemon would. the couple lumbered over, laughing at the irony. <br>\r\n\"well somebody sounds hungry\" said Gardevoir, snickering now that the person behind her transformation was about to suffer the same fate as her.<br>\r\n\"I'll *urp* KILL YOU!\" she screamed back. her stomach started to rumble.<br>\r\n\"that's not very nice.\" responded Gardevoir, going over to the addictive food cart and picking up a piece of cake. <br>\r\n\"I thought fat people were supposed to be jolly!\" added Gallade, picking up a huge scoop of ice cream with his bare hand.<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU CALL ME FAT! she cried, letting rip an angry fart \"YOU TWO BEHEMOTHS ARE THE ONLY FAT ONES! she screamed at them as they approached her.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear, you wont be alone for long\" Gardevoir responded with mock sympathy. with that Gallade walked up to Zoroark, turned off his levitator, and dropped his gut right on her lap. she screamed in incomprehensible rage, and he stuffed the food in his hand into her mouth. her angry expression instantly melted away like the ice cream in her mouth.<br>\r\n\"tastes good don't it? you said it yourself, this food can be quite... addictive.\" said Gallade. she smiled and put the entire slice of cake in to her own mouth.<br>\r\n\"come on dear, we have a hungry guest. I would hate to run out of food and have her still able to move\" he responded as he stuffed another handful into her mouth. Zoroark stared daggers and him, but swallowed it anyway. Gardevoir nodded in agreement and brought the rest of the large cart over. she pulled it in front of Zoroark and they started stuffing her in tandem. one after the other they took turns filling Zoroarks face with the fatty food, with Gardevoir occasionally sneaking in a slice of pizza or a cake in to her own mouth. Zoroarks eyes glazed over in ecstasy as the flavors filled her mouth, as her butt started to fill her chair. Gardevoir was once again impressed by the sheer speed in which their bodies could turn the food in to fat. already, Zoroark was sporting a belly that went half way down her thighs. her hips had grown impressively as well, and were already about double her width when she sat down. oddly, her breasts had barely grown at all and were still about A cups by human measurement. <br>\r\nGardevoir was noticing that she herself had grown at quite an alarming rate. her neck was no longer visible, as the ring of fat had expanded to press up against her chin, as well as her swollen face. her  breasts have swollen as well, with each breast being about the size of Zoroarks entire belly. they stuck out, giant somehow perky orbs of flesh stacked upon her truly incredible belly. it had more than matched Gallades and would have weighed more than the rest of her belly combined, if not for her giant ass. it stuck half as far as her belly did, and had created a shelf upon which the grime that dripped down her back slid over before running down. it was completely covered in stretch marks and cellulite, and every little movement caused it to wobble and shake. as her farts had become more prevalent and violent, her ass shook each time she let loose a massive fart. the sweat that was omnipresent between her crack made sure that every one of her massive farts sounded sickeningly wet and smelled of body odor. it her ass folded over on to her massive thighs, with each one being the width of Gardevoirs new fattening subject's waist. the fat had built up so much that when she stood they completely covered her kneecaps, and when sitting they pushed her gut up on both sides even when she sat in the semi-split position that her belly forced her to take. they rubbed together at all times, keeping her thighs warm from friction and making her inner thighs smell like an entirely different kind of foul. they were all held up on her swollen feet, which were caked in a layer of grime that originated from both her and the floor.<br>\r\nshe looked up from her inspection of her body to notice that both Gallade and Zoroark were staring at her immense body as well, with Gallade still shoving food in to Zoroarks open mouth. suddenly becoming self-aware, Gardevoir first reddened, then remembered her audience. she giggled and winked as Gallade looked on, and then attempted to smack her ass, but was impeded by the roll of fat that had started to concentrate around the joint of her shoulder. what ended up happening is that she slapped the point where her ass connected to the roll of backfat that was once her lower back, and it shook the entire top part. the sudden movement released a record breaking fart. it released itself and just kept going. and going. and going. she turned to Gallade with the confused face. Gallades jaw slowly descended in awe. Zoroark stopped chewing, and it still kept going. finally, it slowly tapered off, and with a last small toot she finished.<br>\r\n\"ho... holy sh-\" Zoroark beegan to say before being cut off by a pie to the mouth, delivered swiftly by Gallade, whos mouth was wide open. she begrudgingly swallowed as Gardevoir giggled.<br>\r\n\"pardon me\" she said in a petite feminine voice, then smiled adorably and patted her elephantine ass, which responded with a small brap<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gardevoir?\" Gallade started to poke her gut with the hand that wasn't feeding Zoroark. he sighed and grabbed the end of the hose, ripping it out of Gardevoir's mouth. as he did so the contents of the hose exploded out the end, covering Gardevoirs face with the brown paste. without hesitating he stuffed it in to Zoroarks mouth, who began sucking contentedly. Gardevoir turned on Gallade, fuming.<br>\r\n\"but I want more!\" she screamed, flailing her arms in a desperate attempt to continue eating. shock spread across Gallades face at the sudden outburst. the shock turned to a tinge of fear when suddenly Gardevoirs eyes and hands started to glow pink. the tube suddenly became illuminated the same color, and wrenched itself out of his hands and into hers. Realization hit Gallade he jumped into action.<br>\r\n\"<i>STOP!</i>\" his voice ripped into her consciousness and brought her back to lucidity. she stopped her hand an inch from her face, coming to as the chocolate sludge dripped down her swollen tits. she looked around at her surroundings, then fearfully turned to Gallade<br>\r\n\"I'm losing control\" she said, as she began to realize the true implications of her words. he nodded grimly and grabbed the hose again. <br>\r\n\"i understand, and Im going to make this place pay.\" he responded, then turned to a snickering Zoroark and rammed it into her mouth. she loosed a muffled yelp, which was muted as the pump began filling her mouth. Gardevoir, now seething with anger, pulled up a few more machines.<br>\r\n\"you like seeing me lose it?! she shouted, burping loudly in her captives face. Zoroark shook her head side to side frantically, but Gardevoir just stuffed a second hose into her mouth. <br>\r\n\"well you're gonna love this\" she spat (quite literally). she grabbed a third hose and stuffed it in. she turned to Gallade. \"I'm done with her\"<br>\r\nthen she turned the hoses on.<br>\r\nZoroarks eyes lit up as the tubes all shot, full force, in to her gaping mouth. first her cheeks bulged, then her throat swelled up, then her belly started swelling at an absurd speed. her body seemed to inflate before their eyes as she thrashed violently, trying desperately to loosen the tubes. chocolate sauce sprayed from the corners of her lips and stretch marks lined her swelling body. just then one of the doors opened. the two psychics looked over at the new arrival, seeing another massive nidoking.<br>\r\n\"Mistress, I know you said to wait outside but we are detecting an overloaahhh....\" the nidoking drifted off, seeing his master chained to the chair and flailing frantically. without hesitation Gardevoir overloaded his mind and knocked him out, which caused him to fall backwards into the door frame. Gallade spun around in a fluid motion that would have looked graceful, had it not been for his man breast jiggling with the action and released a psycho cut at the door mechanism. it hit dead on and the door slammed, squishing up against the unconscious nidoking and preventing enterance. they sprinted for the exit on the opposite side and left the room, while Zoroark slowly expanded across the chair<br>\r\n\"they'll raise the alarm soon! we need to find a way out!\" Gallade said as they darted down the hall with newfound speed brought about by their levitator devices.<br>\r\n\"No, we can't anymore. this place has poisoned our body's and minds! what if I lose myself again? and its only a matter of time before this lard prevents me from functioning.\" she said as she grabbed a side roll. she was almost the same size as that nidoking, and they both knew it. \"we need to stay here and find a cure. not just for us but for everybody.\" she said, motioning to the balls of fat that scattered themselves across the hall, no longer easily identifiable as the pokemon that they once were. Gallade nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n\"so, how do where do we start?\"</span></div></div>",

I envy the ones that take the pill. they make it to total immobility faster than I could ever hope to\". he said as he looked down to his smaller companion with the blue spike on his head<br>\r\n\"total immobility? like, they can't walk?\" at that the nidoking laughed.<br>\r\n\"oh wow, you new guys are hilarious! did you hear that? I bet this one can still walk on his own!\" he said as he looked to the busty nidoking behind him. the trailing nidoking had a hurt look on his face at the mention of immobility, and almost seemed to turn green... but he felt a twinge in his head and he was back to his purple self<br>\r\n\"well anyway, total immobility only starts with being unable to walk. next, you lose your ability to move your head very much due to the neck fat, then your arms get swollowed up by your own fat, and finallly your thighs swell up so much that you cant keep your legs close enough together to walk. then your fat starts to impede your vision and all you can do is eat and wallow in your own filth! you don't even have to work anymore because you can't!\" he said, just getting excited at the thought. he looked down at the oddly horrified Gall- nidoking.<br>\r\n\"how long does that take?\" the little one asked. <br>\r\n\"well, for you its about two months, but about half that for me and him\" he looked back at the even more panicked looking nidoqueen. did a double take at the sight, but he was back to normal. the poison type thought that was odd for a second, but the thought passed as another headache replaced it.<br>\r\n\"I wish they would let me take that pill. 'you're not smart enough!' they say. 'you would become incapable of rational thought' they say.\" the world seemed to flash different colors as the nidoking with the skirt behind him seemed to start hyperventilating, and he had a suspicion that it might not be just the lighting.<br>\r\n\"but I figure you don't need to think if you can go from my size to totally immobile in less than a week!\" he exclaimed, and suddenly everything around him exploded and seering pain shot through his head. he looked up to see the green nidoqueen with the huge breasts having a panic attack, and in the flashing lights he looked over to see the recruits face shatter, partially revealing the swollen face of a gallade. <br>\r\n\"oh god, I have less than a week!\" he heard a voice say tearfully, as though the speaker were a mile away. another wave of pain shot though him as he looked down at his body, only to see it as the body of a gardevoir. this new body started to swell, and he watched his gut expand over the floor, and felt his arms and legs get swollowed by his own body fat. he could only stare in confusion as his newly acquired breasts started to swallow his vision. then a final, incredibly strong pain shot through his head, and for a split second before he passed out, he saw the pair of psychics standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir heard a thud as the nidoking behind them passed out.<br>\r\n\"are you okay?\" Gallade asked her.<br>\r\n\"how can I be okay?! I only have a week left before I become a useless mountain of fat!\" she screamed back. Gallade sighed and turned off her levitator<br>\r\n\"I mean, look at me already! two days and Im as big as him!\" Gallade slid himself up to her teary eyed face. he put his hand on her cheek<br>\r\n\"if you include these udders of mine Im probably even bigger than-\" he leaned down and kissed her again passionately. they held each other tightly, savoring the moment. finally they slowly moved their mouths apart, or attempted to, as Gardevoir wasn't able to move her head back very far. he looked into her eyes.<br>\r\n\"we're going to get this fixed. I promise you. and we'll be together for every step of the way.\" he said softly to her. she smiled at him<br>\r\n\"thank you.\" they stared into each others eyes for a bit, each ignoring the others occasional flatulence. finally, Gardevoir spoke up<br>\r\n\"are you going to use every one of my freak outs as an excuse to get a kiss?\" Gallade smiled and slid down her gut and back to his feet.<br>\r\n\"sounds like a good plan to me\" he said as he reached under her gut to turn the levitator back on. she sighed in pleasure from the inadvertent tummy rub<br>\r\n\"stop giving me reasons to have panic attacks! on another note, I think you burped in my mouth\" she said as she got back up to on to her feet.<br>\r\n\"really? I thought that was you. anyway, you kinda overloaded our tour guide.\" he nudged the nidoking with his feet<br>\r\n\"yeah, my emotions effect my abilities. If I get distracted I can't keep it up, and if I lose it like that, I overload his head with my own thoughts. I can only imagine what that poor idiot saw before I knocked him out.\" she remarked, looking at the sleeping mound of flesh. \"well anyway, I found out where we need to go, so follow me!\" she took off with Gallade on her heels. they waddled down corridor after corridor and made their way to the lab. every once in a while they came upon a nidoking, but they quickly dispatched the lone scouts. finally they made it to the door of the lab. they both looked at it<br>\r\n\"crap, this is one of those hand identification doors. only authorized pokenel can enter.\"<br>\r\n\"oh, I got this!\" said Gardevoir, excited to be able to be useful again. he looked at her in confusion, and she simply closed her eyes. she inhaled slowly through her nose, and exhaled through her mouth. slowly, he started to notice a pink aura surrounding her. he shrugged and looked around. suddenly, a nidoking came lumbering down the hall.<br>\r\n\"uh, I don't know what you're doing, but we have a guest.\" he mentioned to his meditating companion. he unsheathed his blades and got in to a fighting stance as the nidoking came walking up... and walked right past them. Gallade stared at him in confusion as the nidoking walked over to the door and put his hand on the identification plate. the door opened, and nidoking farted and passed out. Gardevoir opened her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" she shouted excitedly, attempting to jump for joy. she only suceeded in shaking a burp loose, but didnt seem to mind. \"lets go babe!\" she said as he walked through the door. Gallade shrugged and followed her. they walked into the lab room, and looked around. the lab was filled with beakers, books, and various other devices. the entire room had a clean, fresh smell to it that they hadnt experienced for a long time. they walked slowly, prepared for anything. Gallade scanned the room, and saw a small pokemon sitting in a lab chair in the corner. he smiled and walked over.<br>\r\n\"you're in charge here, I presume\" he sneered, picking up the unsuspecting pokemon by the back of his neck, and turned him around. what he had found was a small, pudgy, and remarkably clean sableye. the little guy gulped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"you're in charge here, I presume? we have some questions\" Gallade inquired of the awkward looking pokemon<br>\r\n\"hands off me, you putrid fatties!\" he shouted in a nasally voice.<br>\r\n\"you're not too skinny yourself\" he said, nodding towards the small gut that he was acquiring.<br>\r\n\"well at least I can walk!\" he shouted back, obviously directing the comment towards Gardevoirs gargantuan frame. Gardevoir averted her eyes at the mention of being mobile. Gallade noticed how the remark offended her<br>\r\n\"I'm curious. do you think you can still walk after I give you this?\" he asked. he held up his hand and revealed a syringe with a green liquid inside it \"picked it up when I came in, but I've forgotten what it was. I guess the only way to find out is to use a test subject.\" he shrugged and raised his arm, preparing to stab their portly captive with the unknown contents of the needle. <br>\r\n\"wait! what do you want? please don't do this!\" he begged. Gallade's arm froze, almost about as he was going to plunge the syringe in.<br>\r\n\"listen lab rat,  I'm in a bit pressed for time and I don't feel like repeating myself so here's how it's going to go down. we're both the lucky recipients of the slob pill thing, and considering the fact that you seem to be the only person in this place that isn't farting once a minute, I'm guessing you're the brains. now me and this wonderful pokemon behind me are the unfortunate recipients of the pill-\" at that the Sableye appeared shocked \"-and we want you to teach us a little about what exactly was put into our bodies\" but rather than answer right away, Sableye seemed to be lost in thought. Gallade stared at him for a bit as he mumbled to himself, trying to comprehend what he heard<br>\r\n\"wait, you said that the both of you already took the pill? how long has it been since you took it?\"<br>\r\n\"around two days but I don't see how-\"<br>\r\n\"two days?! it's been two days and you can still walk?!\"<br>\r\n\"Um, well I can but I really need to know-\"<br>\r\n\"no, this is impossible! I never mess up. there are no outliers in my experiments! even your friend is behind schedule for those designated to feeding. this can't happen!\" he started mumbling frantically again, so Gallade simply smacked him upside the head. the blow brought the little guy back to sanity<br>\r\n\"what do you mean behind schedule? and what does designated for feeding mean? I'm getting sick of your crazy buddy, and I'm getting an itchy plunger finger\" but the little lab-rat didn't even seem to care about the impending needle anymore. he simply sighed and turned to the two of them.<br>\r\n\"Follow me. it will be for the benefit of both of us.\" and with that he picked up a clip-board and waddled down the hallway. the two psychics turned to each other and shrugged, then proceeded behind him.<br>\r\n\"I don't understand\" he began, restating his disbelief. \"how you two can function without food for so long?\"<br>\r\n\"we actually just ate an hour ago\" replied Gardevoir, patting her stomach as if to prove it<br>\r\n\"An hour?! you shouldn't be able to able to talk coherently, let alone all of the signs of higher thinking you're showing.\"<br>\r\n\"... and why would that be?\" inquired Gallade<br>\r\n\"the pill works like a poison. over time it slowly lowers your intelligence, makes you slobbier, and makes you need food more and more. the only thing that can slow it's effects is the food we make here, but as you two can see the food causes the effects on their own as well. so the only way to prevent yourself from becoming a mindless pig is to eat, and eating causes permanent side effects anyway! it's quite a vicious circle, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"how long can a pokemon go before they lose intelligence?\"<br>\r\n\"for a normal pokemon? about 15 minutes\" at that the couple looked at each other in shock. \"come, I must show you something\" the sableye said. he walked up to a large shuddered window. he pressed a button on the side and the shudders flew open. both Gallade and Gardevoir gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ninside was the largest pokemon they'd ever seen. it took Gardevoir a few seconds to realize that the fleshy mass inside was a Grumpig. the room was almost as large as a basketball field and the pokemon inside was slowly filling the entire room. his massive gut weighed easily twice as much as Gardevoir's entire body, and the black gem had disappeared inside his cavernous gut. this marked the beginning point for a line that ran down his entire belly, seeming to part it slightly. due to his legs being on the side of his body, they had expanded outwards and were twice as wide as he was rather than be simply swallowed under his body like other pokemon she had seen. his thighs were so swollen that his feet were no longer touching the ground, but were instead propped up and slowly being swallowed by his ballooning legs. the same thing was happening to his arms, and his upper and forearms were only sections of fat. he had acquired two sets of man-boobs and they both hung down his sides, resting on his multitude of love handles. even from the front, his ass was clearly visable and almost as tall as he was. his entire body was coated with slime and grease, and in some places it had pooled into his remarkable cellulite. in the center of the incredible mass was his head, completely unable to move and surrounded in folds. a long tube snaked from the ceiling to his mouth, and he was sucking frantically from it, trying to get as much as he could. as they watched him he belched, and the air coming out of him stopped the flow of the tube which in turn caused him to dribble the liquid onto himself, adding to the grime. even after everything she had seen, Gardevoir was absolutely disgusted. Gallade spoke up<br>\r\n\"what's the second tube for?\" he asked, pointing down towards the Grumpigs rear. it was only then that Gardevoir noticed the second tube snaking from the grumpig and into a huge machine<br>\r\n\"that right there is the reason for this entire facility. there is another effect of the foo that I haven't talked about. the food here changes your body, making your gas a source of power that can be harvested. the bigger you are, the more you produce. this pokemon here can power half the facility on his own, and we have others here that are his size or larger. this is what we do with those we designate as feeders: turn them into generators.\"<br>\r\n\"...and how long did it take for him to grow this much?\" Gardevoir asked, fear building in her expansive stomach<br>\r\n\"about a week...\" Gardevoir felt herself go pale\".. but you two are different. I believe the cause for your relative immunity is your type. we have never had Pokemon of your typing here before, and I believe it is what causes it.\" he turned to Gallade. \"being fighting and psychic, you have incredible control over both body and mind, allowing you to suppress many of the side-effects.\" Gallade waived the information off as if it didn't matter<br>\r\n\"yes, but what about her?\" he asked, concerned.<br>\r\n\"I believe this was an error on the part of who ever brought you here. not many people understand or can identify fairy types, and with fairy and psychic together there is no telling what will happen, although the fact that your body has changed much more than your mind shows that your psychic abilities have been retained. if it was up to me you would have been brought here immediately for testing, but clearly relying on the judgement of those who have been eating the food here was a bad idea\" he sighed and wrote down something on his clipboard.<br>\r\n\"well that's nice and all, but we came here for a cure, and we're not leaving here without one.\" said Gallade sternly</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"ah yes, of course.\" he said. he motioned for them to follow. he closed the shudders on the pumped pig and they all waddled back to the lab. the couple smiled at each other at the sound of a cure.<br>\r\n\"will I finally be turned back to normal? no more farting?\" she inquired excitedly<br>\r\n\"uh... yes! of course!\" the Sableye responded. Gardevoir let out an excited little fart and looked over at Gallade, who was equally excited, although showing it much less obviously. Sableye stopped at a lab table and started fumbling through the drawers.<br>\r\n\"did you hear? finally we're going to be free of it all! once we lose all this weight we can escape together!\" Gallade simply nodded, unable to believe that the nightmare that they were in was drawing to a close. suddenly, they heard a swishing noise, and their hope faded as they realized it was the door. they looked behind them to the source of the noise. they watched in horror as Nidoking started filing in through the door. Gallade unsheathed his blades and Gardevoir turned to Sableye as he dug into the drawers.<br>\r\n\"hurry up\" she pleaded. to him. he leaned back from the drawer and turned to them.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but like I said, I never mess up\" as he said so he raised his hand, revealing a glowing metallic orb.<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Gardevoir screamed. her eyes and hands started glowing as she lashed out with her mind, forcing all of her psychic power at him. Sableye cowered at the sight the morbidly obese psychic type powering up, but suddenly the orb in his hand started flashing. Gardevoir cried out as a massive headache wracked her mind, and she felt all of her powers draining out of her.<br>\r\n\"It works! see, I never mess up!\" he cried as Gardevoir grasped her head in pain. Gallade rounded on him and swung at him, only to yell out and fall to the ground off balance, massive gut first. Gardevoir moved to help him, only to feel her body start to become heavy. she turned around confused, and saw herself looking directly at Zoroark. She was holding a remote in one hand, and a piece of cake in the other. two Nidoking rushed Gallade, pinning him to the ground. Gardevoir wanted to come to his aid, but she was fighting just to stand and every time she tried to use her psychic powers it was met with another headache. Zoroark smiled at her and waddled over.<br>\r\n\"tell me, how long did you expect to get away with your shenanigans while being reliant on our own tech to move?\" she asked as she stuffed the piece into her mouth. she held out her hand and a Nidoking replaced it with another. she smiled and turned a dial on her remote slightly. as she did so Gardevoir felt her gut weigh down even more.<br>\r\n\"look at you! I turned it to half power and you're barely able to stand.\" Zoroark was right. Gardevoirs eyes started to tear up as her legs started to shake with exertion. how could they be so close? how could they stay one step ahead for so long and lose it all?<br>\r\n\"although I guess I should be impressed. you're probably holding over 350 pounds on your own. I wonder if you can hold more...\" she taunted as she turned the dial. Gardevoir moaned in exertion as she felt the weight pile on. Zoroark smiled, showing off her new fat dimples. \"just a little more...\" Gardevoir couldn't handle it any more, and her legs gave out from under her. she hit the cold hard ground with a wet splat as she felt her mass spread out. as she did so she loosed a huge wet fart that sounded as foul as it smelled. she collapsed and started crying as the futility of it all finally dawned on her. Zoroark laughed and walked up to her. as she got closer Gardevoir was finally able to see the damage they had done to her body. she had quite a lot of pudge on her upper body, although her breasts were almost totally lacking. what wasnt lacking on the other hand was her lower half. her hips were remarkably wide, and had tripled in size since they had left her, defeated, and force fed on that chair. the fat on her thighs drooped down, almost concealing her knees. as she strided, Gardevoir was amazed, but she could she the faint outline of her swollen leg muscles. she noticed Gardevoir staring, and smiled.<br>\r\n\"you know, we have made food that can do more than just help people gain weight here you know\" she said, patting her tree-trunk sized legs. \"you see, after you showed me the wonders of the food here, and now that I can't stop, I figured I'd at least gain me some muscle\" and with that she pushed a foot into Gardevoirs swollen belly, and pushed off with her foot. assisted by both Zoroarks, newfound strength and the sweat that lubricated her butt, she slid down the hall back to where they saw the grumpig. Zoroark smiled and started to approach her again. Sableye fell in behind her<br>\r\n\"Mistress, about our agreement...\" at that the victorious sneer was instantly wiped from her face<br>\r\n\"our agreement?! you fool, look at me! it's your inability to make them fat that did this to me!\" she screamed, slapping her gigantic butt in rage<br>\r\n\"but we still don't know about them! feeding her could have adverse effects!\" Zoroark turned to him, searing with anger. she picked him up by his shirt and stared him in the eye.<br>\r\n\"you want to see some adverse effects?! I'll show you some effects!\" she screeched and grabbed him by his skull, reached around, pressed his face directly inbetween her butt-cheeks, and let rip a fart that could only be produced by somebody that has taken the pill. she pulled him out and looked at him, realized that he had been knocked out. she wiped some of her ass sweat off on him, threw him in the air, and spin-kicked him directly into the gut of a Nidoking. the force sent the two flying against the wall. she shook her head and ripped another piece of cake out of a nidokings hand and shoved it into her mouth. <br>\r\n\"now, back to you... Guards! hook her up to one of the generators!\" Gardevoirs eyes lit up as she realized that she was doomed to the same fate as the grumpig.<br>\r\n\"uh, Mistress? what should we do about this Gallade?\" asked a nidoking, pointing to the subdued fatty.<br>\r\n\"um, I don't know... stick him with that needle he dropped.\"<br>\r\n\"No! I'll do anything you want, just don't do that!\" screamed Gardevoir. Zoroark smiled at her.<br>\r\n\"you're already going to. now wake up that lab-geek!\" I want some warning in case he explodes or something.\" they nodded and complied. Gardevoir looked to Gallade, but rather than fear, his face was stone. they brought him over to an uninhabited cell, and locked him in it. Sableye, sporting a fresh bruise and a face covered in sweat and food, walked up. Zoroark turned Gardevoir around so she was facing the cell window. they all looked on as a Nidoking looked at the syringe, shrugged, and stabbed it in to his arm.<br>\r\nGallade flinched a bit from the pain then looked at the point where it went in. slowly the bruise turned red, then it turned green again. then something started to happen. the green started to lighten in tone, then the mark started to swell. swollen glow moved its way down, under his skin. it made it's way down to his gut, where it stopped. then, slowly, the glowing bump started to grow. rather than grow out, it seemed to surround his massive belly. he groaned in discomfort as the glowing seemed to turn his gut into a giant glowing orb. the nidoking inside let him go and started to meander back out of the room.<br>\r\n\"wait! lock the door right now!\" yelled Sableye, and the nidoking did so. <br>\r\n\"is it a contagious virus?\" asked Zoroark between bites of food<br>\r\n\"bacteria, actually.\" he corrected. \"and no, not yet\" he responded ominously. <br>\r\nwith that, Gallade started to groan louder, as if sick. he started to make odd noises with his throat, as if he was trying to cough up something. the nidoking, realizing that he was locked in. turned around in a panic as he realized that he was subject to whatever was about to happen to the Gallade. they all watched  Gallade with varying degrees of interest and fear.<br>\r\nHe started to gag a bit, as if something was coming up. his glowing belly was starting to swell slowly, as if the glowing bacteria were growing. finally, he stopped making noises and looked directly up at Gardevoir.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I couldn't get us out.\" and with that he gagged, and spat up a glowing green blob. as he did so his belly started growing at a much faster pace, and he started drooling glowing green goop. the blob itself seemed to come to life, and slid with surprising speed down his gravid tummy and moved directly toward the nidoking. the nidoking started freaking out and banging on the door. he turned around to see the blob, and as he did so it shot up and flew directly into his mouth. they watched as the radiating glow slid down his throat, and soon he started to suffer the same fate as Gallade. at this point Gardevoir was shaking and crying, and burping profusely.<br>\r\n\"what was that?\" zoroark asked, confused.<br>\r\n\"as I said before, it's a bacteria.\" he said as they witnessed the nidoking thrash and atttempting to grab his throat through his neck fat. \"it was an idea I had for causing much faster more contagious weight gain, but I couldn't harvest energy from it\" the glowing had spread to Gallades butt and was coming out of his mouth at a much faster pace. nidoking was still mobile, and was stumbling around clawing with his sausage fingers at his own luminescent gut.<br>\r\n\"it will be interesting to see what happens to him now that he is, in a sense, the bacteria's new... queen?\" he concluded as Gallades body was slowly turned bright green. nidoking had stopped thrashing now and was starting to dribble goo out of himself as well<br>\r\n\"well, it's time\" Zoroark said with remarkable casualness for somebody who just witnessed what she had. \"hook her up!\" she shouted, pointing at the distraught Gardevoir</span></div></div>",

Gardevoir's face was one of total defeat, and rather than protest she simply continued to look down sullenly. Zoroark walked up to her and grabbed a handful of her gut dragging her along, a process made possible by the numerous levitators. the walked slowly, Zoroark enjoying every second of her victory, while Gardevoir continued to cry<br>\r\n\"oh cheer up dear, you know it wasn't meant to be. a slim guy like him would never go for a land-whale like you.\" Zoroark mocked her between bites of food that was being provided by the nidoking at her side. she looked back repeatedly, each glance reassuring her that she had defeated the psychic type.<br>\r\n\"I mean, he's moved on already! he's found something else and I think the idea of a family life is really starting to grow on him!\" she remarked, spitting food everywhere as she laughed at her own joke. finally they arrived at a vacant room, next to the one containing the overflowing grumpig.<br>\r\n\"... and here's where you'll be making your new home.\" Zoroark continued her merciless verbal abuse \"I know it's a bit vacant, but I'm sure you'll manage to fill in the empty space. and don't worry, I'm sure you'll find that you have a lot in common with your neighbor!\"<br>\r\n\"just shut up and start feeding me.\" Gardevoir said coldly. Zoroark was taken aback by her sudden rebuttal. she turned around to see Gardevoir, face streaked with tears, simply staring back at her with contempt. Zoroark sighed, realizing that her offensive remarks were having no effect.<br>\r\n\"very well, piglet.\" she said. as the tube in the ceiling was lowered down, the nidoking removed the levitators, leaving Gardevoir once again sprawled on the ground. Zoroark walked up to her side (the only angle in which she could access Gardevoirs mouth) and grabbed the tube.<br>\r\n\"any last words you would like to say? or would you rather just start oinking now.\" she asked her defeated livestock.<br>\r\nGardevoir wiped away her tears and stared Zoroark directly in the eyes. Zoroark's smile disappeared at the soul chilling glare, and Gardevoir grimly spoke coherently for the last time<br>\r\n\"you think you beat me today?\" she asked with distain \"I'm not your enemy anymore. I'm your future.\" and with that Gardevoir grabbed the hose out of Zoroarks hand and slid it down her own throat. Zoroark simply stared back, unable to respond as the tube started pumping load after load of chocolaty sludge down Gardevoirs throat. the two held eye contact for a moment, until the spark of lucidity disappeared from Gardevoirs eyes and her body relaxed, accepting the viscous liquid as it pumped into her mouth. Zoroark looked down at her own body with a new-found horror, realizing that she had already seemed to put on weight since she had walked into the building. a loud fart snapped her out of her trance, and she went around to behind Gardevoir. she slid the second tube into place, and watched as Gardevoirs slowly expanding frame made her butt slowly swollow more of the tube. Zoroark left the room shaken, acutely aware of the fact that her own hips were nearing her old adversaries in size. by the time she had lumbered back up out of the room, her fear and shock had turned to anger. she grabbed Sableye by the throat and screamed into his face<br>\r\n\"what are you doing standing around? I told you to go work on a cure!\" Sableye cringed from the combination of the harsh scream and the large chunks of food that she sprayed on his face.<br>\r\n\"y-yes ma'am, I'll get right back to it\" he said, to fearful to mention that she had given no such order previously. he scurried off back into the lab, and she turned to the controls for Gardevoirs cell<br>\r\n\"how's this for a future, cow?\" she muttered to herself, and with as much distain as she could muster, cranked up the food dial. she looked through the window and saw the tube swell with pressure as the caloric mush started gushing into Gardevoirs awaiting mouth. Zoroark watched with sadistic pleasure as Gardevoir started to twitch uncomfortably, looking as if she were inside a bad dream. the effects of the food became visible almost at once. her giant belly and massive breasts started to swell as if being inflated, adopting a balloon-like shape. stretchmarks along her body started to widen as her body strained to adopt the unnatural speed at which she was receiving the sludge. her fat-laden backside was beginning to swell too, and her back-fat began to swallow the back of her neck in its expansion. her face began to swell as well, with her already stuffed cheeks ballooning outward, yet still unable to hold the food that was streaming down the sides of her mouth and on to her body. Zoroark smiled as Gardevoir slowly lost what characteristics defined her as a pokemon, becoming a swollen mass of disgusting fat, useful now only as a power source<br>\r\n\"I did win, fatty\" she said snidely, yet sounding almost unconvinced herself as she slid another slice of cake down her throat, not noticing that the pieces were getting larger</span></div></div>",

Sableye looked on at the giant form of the nidoking. the nidokings swollen body was strapped to the ceiling, and the tube running from Gallades room into his was connected to his mouth pumping him fuller and fuller. for the most part, the nidokings body had stayed relatively the same, with one very large exception. the parasitic goo had chosen to use the nidokings body as a storage rather than a reproductive host. compared to Gallades taut belly, his was much larger, and rather than swallow his body, it had grown outward much like fat cells. it was now a giant swollen mass that was touching the ground and expanding outwards. Sableye was proud of his idea to attach him to the ceiling, as all other methods eventually led to him being smothered under his own expanding belly.<br>\r\n\"more space required, consider further infection of at least two more hosts. consider using grass types to test synergy with bacterial growth, and attempt first infection of a female\" he walked over to the third room, much larger than the other two. he opened the blinds to reveal an incredible expanse of green and off-white that the Gardevoir had become. he sighed upon seeing her, disappointed that such a unique subject had been treated so unscientifically. her face was now supporting two incredibly swollen cheeks and two extra chins the size of inner tubes. her face itself was being swallowed slowly by her own body, with her second chin swollowing her first one and slowly approaching her lower lip, wile the top of her head was half way covering the back of her own skull and pushing her hair around to the sides of her face. her expression was very content for one being swollowed by their own warped body, resembling that of grazing cattle. the back fat that was swollowing her head sloped upwards into her gigantic rear, which easily took up half the room and was taller and wider than the rest of her body. it constantly shook  with the force of her violent and constant farts and was covered in cellulite that ranged in size from small marks to ones the size of bowls. her breasts had begun to cover her entire view, and hung over her giant belly, which had encroached on the walls and was covered in folds from being in its compressed state. her arms and legs were so swollen with fat that they had begun to swollow her hands and feet.<br>\r\n\"currently stable, order checking of grime build-up around tubes\" as he wrote the note, he heard an unhealthy wheezing behind him and turned to see Zoroark.<br>\r\nhe could not help but feel a sadistic satisfaction upon seeing her new body. she had grown immense since her addiction to the food. no longer able to gain muscle along with her fat (she actually believed him when he said they ran out), she had grown a gigantic grime covered belly. her hips were still her largest feature by far, almost as wide at the hips as she was from belly to butt. her breasts were still lacking compared to the rest of her body, which had actually allowed her to maintain her vision despite being much larger than Gardevoir was before she was hooked up in her final feeding session. no longer able to be held up by just one, she was attached to multiple levitators. finally, despite her legs being pushed apart by their own immense size, she had swayed her giant body over to him,<br>\r\n\"what do you want?\" she demanded of him, obviously angry that he had forced her to lumber all the way to the lab.<br>\r\n\"I believe I may have a cure\" he responded \"follow me\" they began the walk back to the lab. as they walked side by side, he looked up at her. he noticed her hair was matted and had food stuck in it. her entire body seemed to be covered in a thick grime<br>\r\n\"so I take it you've given up showering?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"I told you I can't fit in the shower!\" she spat back, quite literally. she have him the look that she wanted to punch him but without the ability to even get close to hitting her, she didnt attempt it. he knew this, and watched her fume. they arrived in the lab and he grabbed the pill.<br>\r\n\"first, I'll need to remove your levitators\" he said, and walked up to her. he went one to the other, taking them off and watching her body slump in that area. he watched as she struggled to stay upright for a while, until he turned off the last one and she flopped pathetically to the ground. he walked up with the pill in hand and gave it to her with a glass of water. with some struggle she brought the pill to her mouth and drank the glass.<br>\r\nshe looked over to Sableye who was grabbing a box, and asked \"so what happens now? do I lose the weight instantly or- uuugh...\" she cut off her question and attempted to grab her belly but only succeeding in grabbing the top of her gut.<br>\r\n\"feeling hungry?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"oh god, my stomach! you traitorous little- Gah!\" she screeched. he opened the box and took out a pink circular pastry<br>\r\n\"you are a fool, Zoroark. how long did you think I would take your abuse while working on a cure for you?\" he asked, feeling total power over her finally.<br>\r\n\"so... hungry! please, give me something to eat! it hurts!\" she was screaming now and he smiled at her<br>\r\n\"I felt that you didn't deserve a fate as nice as the one you gave the test subjects you stole from me, so I have you a second pill, but without the psychological effects.\" he stepped on to her gut and waved the pastry in front of her face \"I want you to oink for me, pig\" with barely a second thought, she began snorting like a pig. he dropped it into her mouth and she chomped it rapidly. as he fed sat on her gut and fed her he began to talk.<br>\r\n\"you were a good leader, but clearly, you failed. I decided that the facility needs a new leader, one who isn't going to become spherical.\"<br>\r\n\"do you like this food?\" he asked her, and she simply shot him a face of total rage, but her mouth was too full to retort. \"they're going to be distributed around the world, and it's only a matter of time before everything turns into a slob and becomes addicted to the food produced here.\" <br>\r\n\"and I think it's only right that we usher in this era with power supplied by your body.\" beyond words, she screamed in pure anger and attempted to take a swing at him, but he dodged the slow clumsy blow.<br>\r\n\"you know, it's not wise to bite the hand that feeds you\" he said. he re-attached the levitators, and lifted her up, while she continued to eat the food. he brought her to the room next to Gardevoirs and set her down. he hooked her up and gave smiled at his inflating ex-boss. she shot him one last infuriated look, and he smiled and walked out, ready to begin a new era in the pokemon world</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gardevoir decided against pulling out the faucet, and let the soda keep on flowing into her mouth. The euphoric feeling of the liquid on her tongue was too good to let go of. As she felt herself gaining weight little by little as the fountain of calories flowed down her throat, she drifted off into a heavy sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, the first thing she saw was two huge, jiggling masses obscuring her vision from below. She remembered the faucet in her mouth and quickly pulled it out and turned off the stream of soda. Looking at a clock on the wall, she saw that she had been asleep for only about an hour. That whole time, the soda hadn't stopped flowing into her, resulting in her body packing on a massive amount of weight while she dozed off. She tried to get up, struggling as she felt her entire body jiggle and wobble even more than it had been earlier. After a good 2 minutes, she finally got herself up, only to find her new weight to be quite unbalancing. She ran (waddled as fast as she could) to the bathroom and took a look at herself in the wall sized mirror, and a look of horror donned on her new softer face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body had gained a ton of weight, looking at herself she was surprised she could still walk, but it wasn't all that different moving around from her previous weight. Her face was looking much softer, the added mass making her cheeks bulge out more than before. Her chin had developed into a full on double chin, and a visible developing third chin could be seen when she looked down. Her arms were plushier and felt warm and soft, and jiggled whenever she lifted them to feel her soft face. However, this new weight was nothing compared to the pounds that went to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs had taken plenty of pounds, with her calves being thicker than her thighs had been before falling asleep, and her thighs now had widened out farther than her hips, two huge pillars of lard that were constantly rubbing together. Even when she spread her legs as far apart as she could, they touched. When she waddled, her thighs and calves wobbled and moved like jelly, and when she stopped walking they still jiggled for a good 10 seconds. Her ass had taken a great amount of weight as well, visibly bulging wider than her hips, so it was visible from behind. Turning her head to view it in full gave her a surprise, her butt had fattened up so much it started to bulge visibly upward like two blubbery hills rising off the ground from where it met the bottom of her back. She officially had a shelf booty, albeit a massively over sized one that looked like it could carry a dinner table with its bulging girth. She gave it a good shake, and it jiggled with such heavy movements that when she stopped moving, her ass would continue to wobble with the same force as when she moved. Despite the massive amount of weight she had gained in her sleep, not a single trace of cellulite or stretch marks could be seen, leaving her entire body smooth and plush with overflowing abundance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands moved to her middle, which she had to position herself in the mirror in a certain way to see fully. Her fat gut had gone from rotund to having just 2 massive rolls of fat, giving her a much 'curvier' look, even if her curves were a bit over-sized. The bottom roll wrapped around her waist, bulging outward and touching her thighs, while meeting up with her love handles and got some support from her widened hips. It was so soft and jiggly she noted. The upper roll wasn't too much smaller than the lower one, however it was very noticeable that the bottom one was definitely  bigger. It sat under her breasts, bulging outward and expanding all the way around to her back. Her naval was visible in between the two rolls, big enough now that a person could stick their head in it. But wait, why did she have to look at a certain angle in the mirror to be able to see her belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the first things she saw when she woke up, but she had been too tired to realize what she was seeing earlier. Now, however, it was the first thing anyone would probably notice if they saw her. Her breasts, while well-endowed before her faucet nap, were now so massive and girthy that they had expanded past that of her belly, farther outward than anything else had after her weight gain. They had widened with their new girth, and she couldn't move her arms forward without having to adjust to their presence. They were wide enough to be seen from behind visibly. She didn't even have to move her head to look at them; they had grown so massive that they began to obscure her vision, the only way for her to not actually see her breasts at all was to look up a good distance. Still, despite their gargantuan size, they remained perky with support from her belly. Her pudgy hands moved to feel them, and she found that they were softer than the rest of her body, feeling smooth as silk when moving her hands across their plushness. She tried lifting them up from underneath, only to have her arms sink into their softness, not moving up even a little as her arms sank into the blubbery masses of softness. She gave up and pulled her arms out. They began to wobble and took significantly longer to stop than the rest of her. She moved her torso side to side as best she could, and their weight shook and jiggled in all directions, but they still mostly kept their shape despite their movements. She stopped moving to see how long it would take for them to settle after all that, and she counted a full sixty seconds before they had completely finished moving. She stared at them, noticing that her just breathing caused them to slightly wobble around. They were comparable to a pair of wrecking balls with their size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling around the rest of her room, she found herself bumping into walls with her girth to be common now, and knocking over everything she went near was near unavoidable. She grew tired of walking and sat on her bed, her massive thighs widening out as she sat, and her belly pooling immensely into her lap. She laid down facing upwards, her breasts appearing like massive twin mountains of flub, moving until they settled, and she drifted off to sleep, not sure how to feel about her now massive curvy figure of fat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Context: for all future chapters down this line, the Gardevoir's name will be \"Holly\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly Woke up the next morning, feeling tired and sluggish, and was greeted with two familiar mountains jutting out from her chest. Looking down, she recalled the events of yesterday, and slowly heaved herself up into a sitting position, her boobs constantly smaking her in the face as her body jiggled with her movements. She looked down at herself, only able to see her massive mammaries, still just as blubbery and huge as yesterday. After about 2 minutes of struggling, she was able to stand up, her belly wobbling and her thighs vibrating with fat in response. She walked over to the mirror, huffing and puffing as the sheer weight of her entire body, especially her front, caused a major amount of stress to move and walk around with. She looked at herself, seeing the same near-immobile fattened body she had seen yesterday. \"Ugh, I'm sooo faaat...\" she sighed. She grabbed the top of her stomach, which was as far as she could reach on it, and squeezed. It felt so plush and soft, and she jiggled it up and down, watching her blubber-filled body move in response. She played around with herself for a little while longer, noting how heavy her individual parts were, and finnaly came to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to try and lose this weight. I can barely move after gaining all this flub.\" She said as she put her hands on the sides of her breasts and shook them for emphasis. \"There has to be some way I can work this off...\" She walked to her door to try and leave, then realized that even with the door being extra-wide to accomodate a wide figure, she struggled before her hips had even attempted to exit the doorway. Her massive breasts, wider than the rest of her, wedged themselves in between the door, pushing her massive cleavage into her face, while also reminding her how soft and squishy, yet firm and perky her tits were. She used the weight of the rest of her body to lean forward and push her bust through, the force squeezing them barely out of the doorway. Now all she had left was her hips and ass, which were stuck in the door, but not as badly as her chest had been. With some effort, and a lot of wobbling, she got through, barely able to stay balanced as she began to waddle around the halls. \"Huff, *wheeze* huff...\" Her massive bust wobbled with each breath and step, the rest of her blubber trembling and quaking with motion. \"I have to find a way to keep these from moving so much if I'm going to work off this weight...\" She said as she heaved up her chest to feel it's weight. She waddled as quickly as she could to the front desk, and met a very obese, bottom-heavy goodra sitting in a small desk chair, overflowing it with her massive ass, which while huge was nothing compared to Holly's own rear. \"Huff, hi, could I request some clothing?\" Holly asked the goodra. \"Ah, yes of course, we realize that some of our guests may need some extra support when they get too, erm, 'well-endowed' \" the goodra replied, staring at Holly's chest as it was so huge her face wasn't visible. \"What clothing would you like to request? We'll need your measurements in order to adjust the fit. Don't worry, we can make any size, but it will take about a day to finish most clothes.\" Holly breathed hard, still tired from her waddle from her room, which only caused her breasts to softly jiggle in response. Looking down, the answer was quite obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll need a sports bra, y'know, to help hold, uh... my front.\" she quietly asked, embarrassed talking to someone else about her humongous bust. \"I'll also need a cup bra, something comfortable to support, well, all this. And, uh, do you think you could get me some, uh, pants that would fit me?\" Looking down at her thighs from the side, she could see that there was no way she could fit them into any normal pair of pants, no matter how streatchy, anything she put on would most likely burst, with seams ripping and soft, jiggling flesh would pour out of all the holes. \"Of course dear, however we may only be able to create shorts, given your size.\" 'Oh jeez' she thought. \"alright then dear, now I'll just need to make some...\" the goodra looked at what she was dealing with. She had measured plenty of other fatties, but this one was by far the biggest one, at least the biggest that had ever requested clothing. She pulled out an industrial sized tape measure, and walked over to Holly, amazed at how huge she was from the side. \"Right, lets get started then dear. Now just hold still and this will only take a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was redder in the cheeks than a tomato as the goodra started down bellow, measuring the front of her thighs to her ass, and she wasn't embarrassed to touch Holly's flesh when doing so. Her gargantuan ass vibrated with the slightest of touches, and when the goodra finally couldn't reach all the way around her, she had Holly hold the tape measure on the side of her thigh and finally got around her hips. Her eyes nearly popped out of her head when she read the measurement, but Holly wasn't able to see the number from her perspective. \"O-kay, lets move on to the waist.\" The goodra began as she tried to think of how to do this. Holly's massive busty figure meant that her breasts were larger than her stomach and ass, so they overwhelmed her gut from above, meaning that to get her waist measurement properly, the goodra would have to pull the tape under her breasts and in between them and her belly. She had Holly hold the tape on one end and help her pull it under, noting that the Gardevoir's face was beat-red with embarrassment. She felt sorry for the girl, so massive and uncomfortable. She proceeded to wrap the tape around her back and got the second measurement. \"Good, only one measurement left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly knew what the last measurement needed to be, and held the end of the tape with her pudgy hand as the goodra wrapped it around her bust. She took a while to wrap it all the way around, but eventually Holly was able to see her as she came back around from under her bust to her back as the tape reached it's limit. It was a big roll of tape, and while it almost reached all the way around her bust, she had to give a hardy tug to connect the two ends, Holly feeling the tape push into her bust and her face turning even more red. \"All done, dear. We should have your clothing ready by tomorrow.\" Though, the goodra thought, with a bust that big, we may not be able to Finnish for a few days. Geeze this girl is lucky. \"T-Thank you, I'll come by tomorrow to pick them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled away from the front desk, something stopped her in her tracks, causing her entire body to jiggle. She smelled something delicious, and walked into a room full of food. \"Oh wow, this buffet is huge!\" She exclaimed, eagar to eat as much as she could. \"Ack! Wait! I can't eat any of this, I'm fat enough already!\" She said, grabbing her stomach and boobs to remind herself. \"Mmmm, but it all smells too good! What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll just...\" Holly waddled back into the room. \"...have...\" She picked up a huge burger, barely able to clutch it in her pudgy hands due to it's huge size. \"...a little bit...\" She quietly said to herself before her hunger overtook her. She began to eat at an incredible pace, scarfing down massive burgers in only a few bites. She filled her empty stomach up with food, all very fattening with it's massive size. Little did she know, this food was created with a special intention on fattening up people who consumed any, much more than normal. She continued to eat more and more, sweat dripping down off her massive chest as it slid down from her cleavage to below her chin. Her weighty body shook with fat due to how quickly she was grabbing and stuffing food into her mouth. \"Mmmmmm! Oh! All this food is soooo gooood...\" she stated as she continued to stuff herself completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut pushed forward from underneath her bosom, bloating out as it filled with fattening goodies Holly stuffed into herself without thought. It buldged forward, growing larger and rounder, her naval could now fully be seen as her belly pushed farther outward. She slowed to a crawl with her eating, taking small sips of the same soda that fattened up her previously only chubby frame earlier. She finnaly stopped and rubbed her belly, content and satisfied with the newfound feeling of being stuffed. She tried to get up, but no matter how hard she struggled or jiggled, she couldn't get herself back up off the ground. She had to get some of the resort staff to help her up, barely able to do so with her rippling fat body weighing her down. She waddled back to her room, and noticed that she had stuffed herself for so long it was almost nightime, so she waddled over to her bed and began to lay down, all her weight shifting untill she lay flat on her pudgy back, her entire frame wobbling and quaking with fat. She looked up at her massive breasts, then felt her bulging stomach, still stuffed to the brim with food. She began to rub it as she fell into a familiar deep sleep, having forgotten about trying to lose weight momentarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up that morning, seeing the same thing as yesterday: her massive, quaking breasts jiggle as she breathed. She tried to hoist herself up, noticing that she was still stuffed from yesterday. She was barely able to do so, her massive bloated gut getting in the way of things more than before. \"Jeeze, that buffet was a really bad idea, I'm gonna get even fatter now! Ugh, why can't I just lose weight as fast as I gain it?\" She waddled over to the mirror wall, and saw her still full belly. She shook it around a bit before feeling uneasy. \"Speaking of fatter...\" she looked at the rest of herself in the mirror and noticed that she looked as though she had gained a little more weight; her breasts were larger looking and a bit more bouncy than yesterday, her ass looking plumper and her thighs a bit wider. \"I definatly gained weight. Dammit!\" She jiggled her frame around feeling about 50lbs heavier than before, although only a little noticable on a large frame like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly looked at herself again, a massive, fattened, curvy frame of plush and softness. \"I have to start losing weight today, I'm almost too fat to move!\" She waddled to her door to go to the front desk, only to be stopped again by her slightly larger mammaries. Her chest wedged itself farther than it had yesterday, and she had trouble pushing her boobs through. \"Hng! Come on, I gotta go! Stupid massive chest!\" She finnaly pushed through, her face red from the stress of trying to get out of her room. She struggled with her hips and ass as well, but got them out too, eventually. She arrived at the front desk seeing the goodra again. \"Hi, are my clothes ready? I ordered them yesterday, and I kinda need them as soon as possible.\" Holly felt her chest bounce, only emphasising her request. \"Ahh yes, miss Holly. I remember you from yesterday.\" The goodra remarked. \"Luckily, we were able to match your measurements. Here you...\" The goodra paused, not able to see Holly's face once again due to her gargantuan tits still being in the way. \"Dear, could you turn to the side, I'm handing you your clothes.\" Holly felt embarassed. \"Sorry!\" she said, quickly grabbing her clothes after turning to the side to see the goodra handing them to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clothes, she saw the three things she had asked for: A hot pink, massive sports bra that looked like it could've covered her entire body a few days ago, A massive pair of workout shorts, wide enough to fit her, and a sky blue regular bra, with cups so large they had to be able to go over her breasts. \"Thank you! Erm, could you help me get these on really quick?\" The goodra looked at her with pity. \"Of corse, dear.\" She helped her first hoist up her shorts, all the way up her thighs before they started to go over her booty. She tugged with the goodra as best she could, and it eventually went over, feeling a bit snug after her food binge. Her stomach buldged over the hem of the shorts, but they fit. Now all they had to do was the sports bra. the goodra held the front of the bra as Holly pulled her arms through and got it on her back. Now the hard part. Holly and the goodra tugged down on the sports bra, barely bringing it over her gigantic breasts, and when it was on she noticed it too was snug, her cleavage buldging upward out of the bra slightly. She thanked the goodra and then waddled to begin her workout, noticing the bra held her breasts well enough for her to move, but they still bounced around within the bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved to a private area with no one around to begin her exercises in an attempt to try and shed some weight off her massive frame. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holly waddled over to a flat, open, empty area where she would begin to exercise without anyone watching. \"I'd die of embarassment with all this jiggling around on display,\" she said, refering mostly to her massive chest. She couldn't do sit ups or push ups, given her size, so she decided to warmup with jumping jacks. \"Huff, puff, *wheeze*.\" She did her best to jump, barely making it off the ground before comming down crashing, her entire body wobbling in response, her ass, belly, and most of all breasts bobbing up and down with their immense mass as she continued to try and jump. \"Huff, alright, that's enough.\" She was already so tired, but she was determined to lose this weight. She began to do some streatches, only to be hidnered by her own girth, her stomach folding up into numerous rolls as she bent over a little, her chest beggining to weigh her front down. She quickly rose back up, not wanting to fall with the weight of her two flesh mountains strapped to her chest. She spread her legs, her thighs still touching when she streatched out as far as she could. She decided the best thing she could do, given her massive frame, was jogging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started running, or rather, waddling faster than usual. Her breasts, though contained in the sports bra, still jiggled around within, attempting to push themselves up and out of the bra from her massive cleavage line, but they were contained every time. Her ass shook, moving up and down with every sway of her titanic hips, and she could feel it bounce from behind her. Her stomach, though somewhat hidden under her immense bosom, buldged outward when she moved forward, slapping against her blubbery thighs as she ran. \"*Wheeze* This is... harder than... I thought... huff...\" she said as she continued her workout. Her bra and shorts were already completely drenched in sweat, both wet all over from the stress she was experiencing with her girthy workout. She continued to jog, keeping at a steady pace despite her constant jiggles throughout her fattened up body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through her run, she began to start feeling even more weight jostling around on her frame. \"Huff, Puff, what the hell? I could swear I felt lighter than this just a minute ago...\" She tried to forget about it, convincing herself it was just her mind playing tricks on her. Little did she know, her body was getting heavier. The special food she had gourged on earlier had begun to completely digest all at once, all turning into numerous pounds of blubber that began to quickly show on her already huge frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass, already gigantic, took a decent ammount of weight, buldging out further behind her as it shook with even more force than before, it's fat began to buldge over her shorts, unable to contain it's new pounds, and her shorts slid down halfway from where they were, a massive ammount of her ass hanging out from above. Her thighs bloated with new calories, widening further with their new girth and shaking around underneath her, and their fat buldged out from under her workout shorts, making them tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach widened and spread further outward under her bust, her two rolls expanding to be horizontally larger than two car tires, both wobbling around even more and slapping her larger thighs with much more force than before. Her stomach shook with so much force that every time it slapped her thighs it sent them wobbling even more than when running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts took most of the weight as usual, fattening up so much that her cleavage buldged upward and out of her bra, buldging over her braline and jiggling with immense mass as they swelled enough to make her sports bra tighter and tighter on her ever growing boobs. Her tits began to buldge upward and out of the bra, and her chins eventually rested on them because of how fat they were getting. She felt a shortness of breath as her bra pressed her breasts into her chest, until finnaly she heard something. *RIPPP!* she felt the weight of her chest jut forward a bit, and she saw her cleavage spread outward. The front line of her sports bra had ripped with the immense weight of her blubbery mammaries. She watched her vast cleavage wobble and vibrate, hypnotized by it's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her body took some weight as well, Holly's third chin fully developing, her cheeks looking spherical, and her arms bloating softer and larger than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finnaly snapped out of it and felt the weight of her body preventing her from moving any faster than a slow waddle. \"D-Did I just GAIN weight?\" She felt herself up, feeling her plush soft skin even more than before, and her fingers sank into anything she pushed them into. \"Ahh crap, I knew I shouldn'tve hit that buffet before doing this. Ohh, moving is even harder now! I can't move without my massive udders pushing into my chins!\" She thought long and hard about what to do next. Should she continue exercising despite even more weight to lose, or should she take a break and do something else?</span></div></div>",

The room was a basic white color, with many of the household items that she recognized from the homes of humans, including a kitchen and a television. however, the fridge seemed to be two to three times as large as any other fridge she had ever seen. she waddled over to it and opened the door. her jaw dropped at the sight inside. in the industrial fridge was row to row food. every kind of meal, snack, or desert she had ever seen were stacked up, filling the entire fridge. behind the food the far wall of the fridge was non-existent, and she saw the swollen pink paw of another obese Blissey restocking the food. at that point, she heard a dripping. The pudgy psychic type looked down at the origin of the noise, only to realize that the droplets were in fact her own saliva.<br>\r\n\"Groth!!\" she exclaimed, spraying the pristine food in the fridge with her own spit as she slurred. she turned to look for a paper towel, only to give up immediately after remembering the policies of the institute she was now an unwilling member of. she let out an exasperated sigh that turned into yet another burp. as she wiped the spit off of her mouth and on to her equally messy arm she felt her stomach rumble, calling for more food. she clutched her overstuffed gut in pain as a feeling of uneasiness crept over her. she was already full to bursting, but her mind was getting cloudy with hunger. her greasy, swollen body started to sweat even more as she thought with terror of what the food here was doing to her body. another twinge of hunger shot pain through her engorged belly and she looked at the fridge with equal parts fear and desire.</span></div></div>",

Gardevoir wiped at her front, but only managed to spread the goo around a little. She paddled her hands in  midair to attempt to get some of the slime off of them.  She hated how it smelled, like drool and baked goods left out in the rain to rot. She could barely make out Roselia's sweet natural perfume over all of her new B.O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it here so far, Gardevoir? I figured this place would be right up your alley!\"  Gardevoir flinched back a little; Roselia spit when she talked now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I like this place, Roselia?! Everyone here looks like a bloated food addict! Do they even let you shower?!\"  <br>\r\n\"Sure, we get running water! How else could we make pasta and other boiled food? It's true fried stuff is better but a little boiled something isn't bad every once and a while, especially if you get a nice, thick, greasy meat sauce and...\" Roselia had grown a grin of pleasure describing the food, and seemed even more bubbly after accidentally passing gas. \"Why the face? You'll get used to it! But why would we want water to clean ourselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir felt her slender legs twitch, begging her to run away She decided to make this quick.  \"Roselia. I want to leave! You were wrong, I hate this place!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoselia stopped and tilted her head, her chins pressing into each other. \"B-but...you don't like it here with me and the rest of us? W-we're really...we're really nice and I get so lonely sometimes when I'm trying to find something to do in between snacks and you always liked to lie around and I just wanted to do something niiiiiiice!\"  Roselia began crying, letting drool schlop down from her mouth and her flatulence go like irregular cannon fire.  \"Waaaa&lt;frrt!&gt;aaaaaaaa&lt;bruuump!&gt;\" As she drew in breath, she would let some foul air out in the form of a belch. &lt;uuurrap!&gt; \"Waaaaa&lt;fiiirrrrt!&gt; aaaaahhh....&lt;Buurrrap!&gt;\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir felt nauseous from the smell, but realized Roselia really did seem to have her best interest in mind...what did this place do to your mind once it got its claws into you?! \"Its okay Roselia! I appreciate what you did, honest!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoselia calmed down a little. &lt;Burrp.&gt; \"Urp....ungh...sniff....but then at least have lunch with me before you go......please?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoselia gave Gardevoir a glance with wide, watery eyes. Gardevoir by nature are very noble pokemon, and she couldn't help but be the slightest bit moved by Roselia's face....even if it was covered in rolls of fat, with drool streaming out of the mouth....</span></div></div>",

Gardevoir didn't know how she would stand another minute with her transformed friend, let alone a whole meal, but it wouldn't be easy to escape with all this attention being drawn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you thank you!!!\" Roselia said jumping for joy. It was almost like her sadness had evaporated, and she stopped crying instantly. \"I'll have something sent for right away! Come back to my quarters, it'll be just the two of us!\" Roselia turned around to lead the way, which to gardevoir made everything worse. Roselia was also farting quite frequently as her massive body wobbled through the hall way. It was already too much to get used to Roselia's new height. She understood how a small pokemon could gain a hundred pounds, but what technology did one use to make a pokemon grow three feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it back to Rose's room very quickly, and Gardevoir saw a room that was the same shape as her room, but was decorated quite differently. First of all, this one smelled horribly, but that was par for the course in this place. Secondly, Rose had put up pictures of all sorts of flabby pokemon around the room. \"Oh, that's my sweetheart right there.\" Rose said, pointing to a massively obese grovyle whose front was caked in slime and crumbs. \"He's the greatest, the others... well, a girl's got to have eye candy right.\" There was a poster of a nidoking in a sumo wrestlers garb, stuffing himself with cake. Another showed a charizard, large as the others, with a stead stream of thick drool flowing out of his mouth. Another was of a... Dragonite smearing cake all over his body? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gardevoir found herself unable to hold off asking questions. \"Roselia, how can you live like this? So over weight, and gods, I still can't stand the stench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you *uuurrrrppp*\" Roselia punctuated with a belch, flinging more of her drool around the room. \"I try to keep smelly. And, I don't really get what you're asking. What's better than being obese? Heck, I should be asking you how you managed to put up with being so skinny.\" Then, Gardevoir was suddenly assaulted with her worst nightmare. Her old friend, reached out and hugged her. Rose's belly enguled her, coating the entirety of her skinny frame with drool, and worst of all, she got smeared with sweat from her arms pits. She was coated in filth, and she could feel the disgusting heat radiating from the plant types body. It took every ounce of control to keep her from screaming out at the disgust that swept through her mind. \"But don't worry, we'll get you in shape soon.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cupcakes, cookies, ice cream, chocolate! All had fallen victim to her sudden explosive appetite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so goooooood..... 'URP'\" Gardevoir thought as she let out a loud belch. Roselia took a whiff and was pleased. <i>She's finally accepting it</i><br>\r\nHowever unbeknown to her, the special ingredients in the food had started to make its way through her body, changing her mental state. It slowly began to change the frequency of her burps and farts, her drool glands could no longer be turned off and most importantly she now had no opposition to the thought of this new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRPPPPPPPP\" As her feeding frenzy ended, she looked completely different from when she first awoke.

Tomorrow would be her escape plan...at least, so she thought. The cake was brimming with flavor! Gardevoir was instantly lost in the luscious flavor of the cake, panting a bit as she kept eating.

If the Tyranitaur tried, he could surely make it around to get another clear shot at her. Still, the beast did seem pretty tired and lacked the ability to oxygenate himself as well as Jigglypuff could. Maybe she was safe.

However, the voice didn't seem to belong to a human but a rather dapperly dressed Smeargle. At the sight of the new surroundings however, Jigglypuff found herself in a frazzle, her mind abuzz with  worry, confusion, and numerous questions. When it came to the questions however, she didn't know where to begin. Starting with the obvious though was probably the best bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-where am I!?\" Jiggly puff asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, you do seem rather confused. This is the PSC Resort. A place for wayward souls to live in hedonistic luxury. Top of the line robots tend to the whim of every resident here at their beck and call. Might I say, you're lucky we found you. That was a dangerous part of the jungle you were in\" Smeargle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what!? wait, you found me? wait, if you found me, why did you bring me here!? where is this place!?\" Jigglypuff shouted, still very confused, her mind not really taking in much else of what Smeargle had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemed only logical to bring you here, though it was not I who found you, but some of the other staff. You should count yourself lucky though. This is an exclusive resort after all. Not everyone revives the privilege of being invited in\" Smeargle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't wake me up because...?\" Jigglypuff asked, glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seemed to be sleeping so peacefully, at least from what I'd seen. They deposited you here for convenience sake as I am the one responsible for orientation, and showing you to your quarters... Speaking of which, if you would care to come along\" said Smeargle holding out his hand, though he was a fair distance away in the large reception room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait, I wake up in some place I've never even seen before, still don't know anything about any of this, and you're offering me a room? Look mister. This place... it looks really nice and all, but this... this is all really confusing. I think I just wanna go home\" said Jigglypuff as she began to settle down, taking in the surroundings a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe had to say, now that she wasn't as baffled, the place did seem rather nice. very bright and fancy with allot of expensive decor. She rather liked the arrangement of flora on the sides of the room beside the benches. She then turned to look at the door. A solid and highly ornate structure that looked rather heavy and made of gold. despite her desire to leave, the idea that this was some kind of resort began to stick in her mind and was a bit curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain madame? you are a guest to us after all. would you care to at least take a look around? I promise I can answer any questions you may have about this place\" Smeargle pleaded earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff looked at the floor, then back to the surroundings, then finally back to Smeargle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to have a look around\" said Jigglypuff before making her way over to Smeargle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, it pleases me to hear that Madame. now, come along\" said Smeargle as he led her into the adjacent through the door to the right of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jigglypuff thought the lobby was impressive, it had nothing on this room. It was absolutely massive with a towering ceiling. to her right were a number of doors, each of them marked with a number and a letter. this was apparently the A section each door seemed rather far apart from the other. to the left was an expansive room with a dip in the center accessible by stairs Jigglypuff was unable to see into it however due to a short wall bordering the center and her short stature, barely over a foot. she figured she'd float around and investigate everything later. along with the rooms on the left were a number of flower boxes built onto the floor along the wall with all sorts of plants in them. how they managed to survive so well inside was likely thanks to the bright lighting from above and the numerous robots that rolled along the area on their treads. This place certainly seemed like some sort of paradise, up until Jigglypuff heard a sound ripping it's way through a hallway on the right. the sound its self was enough to make Jigglypuff gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez, what was that sound?\" Jigglypuff asked as to her, it sounded like a fart, though nastier than any one she had heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was probably just one of the guests, Pay it no mind... oh, speaking of which, good afternoon Miltank\" said Smeargle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore Jigglypuff could turn her attention anywhere, she watched a shadow form over her and felt something huge squish against her, something huge... and slimy? Jigglypuff turned, suspecting that a goodra may have bumped into her. However, what she seen was alarming. The culprit was an absolutely massive miltank, severely overweight, even for her species. Not only that, but she was positively slimy, or, at least covered in sweat. Jigglypuff stared in astonishment and horror as the figure passed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Sorry dearie\" said Miltank casually as she slowly lumbered onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff could only stare at her as she walked away, unable to believe just how fat the creature was. heck, she wagered that it would take at least three Jigglypuffs to make up even one of those butt cheeks. it was now however that she realized something even more vile, she was covered in the creature's slimy sweat, or at least, half of her was. Not to mention that the scent was absolutely rancid, as if this creature regularly bathed in a tub of onions and skuntank fluid. she had to hold her breath to avoid gagging. disgusted, she quickly flailed around, trying to wipe off the gunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming madame? your room is not far\" said Smeargle from a short ways away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff hadn't realized that she had stopped following and hurried to catch up, still trying to wipe away the grime. Eventually she caught up to him and the two soon stopped before a door, room A 127.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! here we are madame, your room. If your are in need of anything, do some see me. Inside, there is also a pamphlet explaining all of your room's different functionalities as well as a map of the resort. Now, do enjoy your stay madame and might I say once again, I am happy that you reconsidered... oh! and uhh, feel free to wash up if you must, the first day is never easy\" said Smeargle before unlocking the door and turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff still found herself trying to wipe herself off. she had gotten allot of it, but it sure was sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Washing up? yea, that sounds good. Hope soap can actually clean this junk off\" said Jigglypuff as she opened the door to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter stepping inside, she looked around a bit. The room was absolutely huge with a pair of large beds in the main area. however, depsite the beds, and the ample fournishing, there was still plenty of space.

Fortunately, her hunch was correct as the door she had opened was indeed the bathroom, though she did have to bounce upward to reach the handle. To her surprise, even the bathroom was large. Jigglypuff could understand that this place was a resort, and designed for comfort, but everything just seemed so... oversized. maybe a good size for that miltank earlier, but not for a tiny pokemon like Jigglypuff. Still, at least it meant there was plenty of room to bounce around. Jigglypuff immediately made her way to the shower. Again, much too large for her. still, she bounced up and turned the water on. fortunately, soap had already been provided and she slathered it onto a sponge before washing herself. Fortunately, the soap seemed to clean the rancid slime right off and down the drain, prompting Jigglypuff to release a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after taking some extra time to enjoy the hot water against her squishy body, she turned off the water and hopped out of the shower to dry off... with a towel that she could have made a tent for herself out of. Feeling good, she finally took a moment to settle down, her fist chance since she arrived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, a resort huh?... maybe one night here won't be so bad. After all, I haven't seen everything this place has to offer. Who knows, maybe I can make a second home here\" said Jigglypuff to herself, thinking positively as she placed the towel into the hamper as best she could. She then made her way back to the door and into the main room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jigglypuff made her way out of the bathroom and back into the main room, taking another look around, finally getting more of a feel for this place. The room was rather nice, the furniture looked sturdy and though large, was certainly of good quality. not to mention there seemed to still be plenty of space for her own personal touch. she began to imagine having plushies and the like from wall to wall. She grew excited as her mind swam with possibilities. first thing's first though, Smeargle had mentioned multiple functionalities of this room, what was that supposed to mean? fancy stuff? not to mention that the pamphlet pay offer some more insight to this place as a whole, or at least the map would. Jigglypuff turned tot he table and bounced her way up, checking out what lay atop it. among other things, there was indeed the pamphlet and map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff started with the pamphlet, opening it up to see an image of the room with some numbered lines pointing to different things. It read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings sir or madam, and welcome to the PSC Resort. to help you get the most out of your stay, your room is equipped with state of the art facilities and are attended to by robotic workers who are prepared to serve you at a moment's notice.

In the event that a device stops responding to your voice, you can input information manually or seek help from a certified employee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff smiled as she read on. This place sounded fantastic! Though Jigglypuff was more the sort to do things herself, she didn't mind a bit of pampering here and there. after reading various codes and other technical information, Jigglypuff looked around the room. Indeed, she could see a number of input keypads around the room. she also couldn't help but notice strange metal disks against the walls beside each one. What were those? Perhaps she would find out after trying out a code or two. She also noticed something else beside the keypad on the table. It was what looked like a menu. she decided she'd check that out when she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the pamphlet, the next thing was the map, which she looked over quickly. Incidentally, the map revealed that the resort its self fit in perfectly with the theme of being massive. Not only were there for more rooms, some even larger than the one she was previously in, but multiple floors as well. Some of what drew her eyes were the shops, the courtyard, and the cafeteria. Incidentally, the cafeteria wasn't too far from her own room. Maybe that would be a good place to meet some people. Placing the map back down, Jigglypuff looked around the room once again, seeing two options. She...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jigglypuff could feel her stomach grumble. It made sense, it was some time after lunch time after all, Jigglypuff wasn't sure. the clock revealed it to be 4:30, so she figured she'd grab a quick bite to eat. not to mention she was curious about how these panels were supposed to work. Jigglypuff scooped up the menu and began to read. Already she was impressed with the selection. so many choices and all conveniently labeled by dish type, much like a proper restaurant menu, except with even more choices. there were so many choices in fact, that she had no idea what it was she wanted to eat. her eyes went from the appetizers, to the seafood, to the beef, all over. Stuff like this only ever appeared in human towns as well, so it was rare that she got the chance to eat this kind of stuff to begin with. Finally, she set her eyes on a dish of chicken marsala. She then thought to herself about what size dish she wanted with the options ranging from small to giga. Jigglypuff wasn't exactly sure why there were so many size options and dreaded what a giga sized meal would look like among them. Though she herself certainly was not big, she could really tuck food away if she wanted to. instead of a small, she decided on a medium, and if she couldn't finihs it, well, there was a kitchen with a huge fridge just next to the entrance of the room. She smiled as she reached out and pressed her nubby hand against a large button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is a call for room service for room A 127 I would like one order of number 149, medium, with a glass of orage juice\" said Jigglypuff as she recalled the directions given to her by the pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff watched the colored panel on the pad until it turned green, signaling that her order was acknowledged. Jigglypuff then proceeded to stare at the door as she waited, expecting someone to come through to deliver her meal. Alas, after only a minute or two, it was on it's way, sooner that Jigglypuff had expect, and was not delivered in the way she had expected either. she jumped when the metal disk on the wall opened up to reveal what looked to be a radar dish that pointed down towards the table. stepping out of the way, Jigglypuff watched as a light shown down onto the table and upon it materialized a plate of food and drink. And what a plate it was as it was large enough for her to serve herself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, what!? i thought i ordered Medium, not giga!\" said Jigglypuff surprised. maybe she should have gone with the small after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what the heck, guess I'll have leftovers\" said jigglypuff with a giggle as she sat down and took a bite of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff's eyes opened wide as it tasted far beyond what she had expected. To her, it was absolutely heavenly. there was no hesitation when it came to digging in a second time, and then a third, each and every bite leaving incredible euphoria. she couldn't wait to take bite after bite. However, as she ate, something else was occurring with her body. her small round body was beginning to grow even more round, and not just because of the food. about half way through the meal, Jigglypuff began to feel full... well, as full as a Jigglypuff can feel with all that belly space, she had already eaten more than she normally does and noticed it. However, as she began to place her utensils back down, she took another look at the plate. normally, she'd have been satisfied as she had reached her cutoff point, and indeed, was feeling satisfied, but when she looked down at the plate of what food remained, she found herself wanting more, craving it even. However, before she could do anything, she was alarmed by something. She could feel drool beginning to pool in her mouth. though she's drooled before, this was already more than normal, looking to her right, she seen a small garbage can on the floor and spit out the drool into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... that was weird\" she said before something else caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhe could feel her stomach begin to bubble as she looked down at what she could of her belly. even at that sight, something seemed off but she was more concerned with the bubbling. suddenly, her face shot upward as gas piled into her mouth before pouring our in a quick but noisy belch, sending a bit of spittle at the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whoops... excuse me\" she said to herself as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping was relatively rare for a Jigglypuff and usually caused them to deflate, which it did a little, though not too drastically. however, there was something a bit more rare as she felt more bubbling, only this time, the air moved downward. Feeling the gas moving south, Jigglypuff began to sweat as her eyelid twitched and she fidgeted a bit, not wanting to let the gas out that way. Unfortunately, she hiccuped causing her to lose concentration and let out a noisy and smelly fart which caused her to bounce up a bit out of surprise and shrink down a little as she deflated a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" said Jigglypuff as she looked around, making sure nobody was there to see or hear that. of course, she was the only one in her room and she breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff could still feel a bit of gas moving around but nothing too severe. She Found herself rather concerned at this point as she turned a bit. Before looking back at the food, there was one last thing that seemed rather off. Jigglypuff couldn't help but feel as if she were a bit... puffier? from what she could see of herself, she did seem a little wider. Especially weird since she had just lost some air, and had not yet regained it. her eyes then turned back to the food as her face turned cautions. She then...</span></div></div>",

Though it wasn't a huge difference, Jigglypuff definitely thought she felt heavier, a different type of heavier than from just eating a meal. To confirm weather or not her paranoia was true, she made her way towards the bathroom and went back inside. After a brief search, she found what she was looking for., a scale. again, very oversized. why the heck was everything so big in this place!? sure, there were larger pokemon than her out there, but if this room were meant for them, why put her in it. Jigglypuff dragged the scale out as best she could and set the digital screen to read weights of pokemon her size. she then climbed up and stood on it momentarily until she heard a beep. returning to the screen, her pupils shrunk as she observed the number 15.5 lbs. Surely some of that was the food in her but that was a 3 lb increase. She'd have refuted it more if she herself didn't feel thicker, and with a pokemon her size, a small change like that was quite noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff's thoughts then drifted to the miltank from earlier, the massively obese creature that had covered her in rancid slime. She then remembered hearing that fart from around the same time, recalling her embarrassing little gas attack from earlier, causing her to blush again. What was this place. That miltank, why was she so huge? Why did that food add so much weight? Jigglypuff thought again about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's no way food would have acted that fast. that extra weight, it's just the food its self, no big deal\" she said to herself forcing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked again at how huge everything was. though a suspicion was nearly developed in her mind, she forced her mind off of it and made her way back out into the main room. as she entered it however, she looked around. to her left was the door, the way out. Perhaps she could investigate her fears if she went out there. of course, maybe she wanted to keep her fears at bay and stay stowed away in her room for now. she looked to her right where the television sat. She could just stay in here and watch that to keep her mind off of things. After a minute or so of thinking, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Immediately, she looked to her left, to where she had seen that miltank emerge. she could hear allot of noise coming from this direction, noise that wasn't there when she first passed by. She swallowed hard as she was terrified to move forward, and it wasn't long before her fears began to surface. As she got closer, she could hear the sounds of people taking. however, Jigglypuff soon found herself overcome with a stench unlike anything she had smelled before. It was... indescribable, something like a landfill of mostly rotten onion eggs with the hot sun beating down on it. Jigglypuff had to stop momentarily to avoid throwing up, though given her current paranoia, she may have welcomed that if she was that way. Though she feared to press forward, she knew her mind would not rest until she seen the source of this with her own eyes. Slowly, Jigglypuff pressed forward, being treated to more sounds as she approached. Among the talking, many of them were clearly farts and burps of all sounds and duration. Jigglypuff teared up out of fear as she approached the recessed, area, finally reaching one of the walls overlooking it. Though she would have puffed up to get a better view of the area, she had no desire to take that air inside of her. Besides, she had already filled back up to normal. Though quivering, Jigglypuff bounced up onto the short wall and glanced outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff nearly lost her grip when she saw the scene below. all around were pokemon, each and every one of them incredibly obese, though some were more so than others. This area was apparently a rec area where people gathered to just talk and eat. a fact that would not have been so bad on it's own if it wasn't for the smell. Jigglypuff knew she'd have to shower after just being around here. Of course, more importantly, she knew she couldn't stay here, her fears were by now, most certainly confirmed now. Jigglypuff couldn't stay here, she didn't want to become one of them. massive balls of gas, oozing thick slimy sweat and saliva. she needed to get out, or do... something...

Who knows how many meals she'd be able to handle before reaching such a state herself, and she didn't like the idea of starving to death either. It was then that she remembered, the lobby wasn't too far away, and there was a door there, she just had to open it and leave. she didn't care where she ended up, as long as it wasn't here. With great haste, Jigglypuff made her way to the lobby, hurrying through the archway she had taken out of it initially and straight to the large doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, are you alright?\" Smeargle asked from his post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff didn't listen to him as she hurried to the door. however, one problem immediately became noticeable, the door lacked handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what!? n-no, this can't... this doesn't even...!\" said Jigglypuff looking for a way to open the door before she pushed on it futilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam?\" Smeargle asked as he approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Smeargle! what is this, what's going on here!?\" Jigglypuff shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean madam?\" Smeargle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, don't play dumb with me, those people! what happened to them!? why are they so huge and gross!?\" Jigglypuff asked, infuriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare say, that is a tad rude madam, but they are that way because that is what they wish to be. in time i'm sure you too will at least come to appreciate it at any rate. They seem happy and content\" said Smeargle calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff stared at Smeargle in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-enjoy it!? how could I, or anyone, enjoy that!? look, I need to leave, can you open this door!?\" Jigglypuff asked, feeling afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry madam, but I do not have access to the front door, that is operated my the administrator\" Smeargle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where can i find him!?\" Jigglypuff demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not at liberty to say\" said Smeargle calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff looked down at the floor, then turned once again to the front door before pushing on it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, you cannot get out that way. please, cease before you hurt yourself\" said Smeargle concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff began to grow tired trying to push at the door. was Smeargle lying to her? She glanced back at him seeing that his demeanor had not changed, nor was he doing anything to stop her. maybe he was telling her the truth then. Maybe She couldn't get out that way. It certainly didn't seem like she could. Jigglypuff looked down again, then back to Smeargle before closing her eyes tight and bolting past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the Hall, Jigglypuff found herself with two options. She wanted out, but how would she do it? she thought first about returning to her room and grabbing her map. however, as she looked down the hallway, there seemed to be a large group of fattys making their way in her direction. if she were to try that, she may not be able to get by, at least not without being covered in copious amounts of rancid sweaty fluid. To her right however was a hallway that looked clear. If she hurried down there, she could avoid them and maybe find a way out. if not, she'd just have to find her way back to her room, hopefully this time without people in the way.

At the end, she found herself face to face with another door. she took a deep breath and opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jigglypuff regretted it as she was overcome with a wave of stink that made her eyes water at the sudden exposure. it was horrible and smelled as if it had been sitting there and festering for a long time. the area beyond was almost a parody of the previous floor. the place was grimy with a floor covered in rotted carpet with numerous unknown substances covering the walls and floor. containers that looked like they once held plants now held only withered black husks. Jigglypuff hesitated, but stepped beyond the threshold and into the hallway. Along the walls were a numbered doors, just like the floor above. the lighting was dim, making it hard to see, especially since Jigglypuff's eyes were still recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jigglypuff walked onward, she winced as she felt a grumbling in her tummy, her pupils shrank as she realized that once again, she had to break wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, c'mon, i don't still have gas do i?\" Jigglypuff whispered to herself as she made her way onward. she had thought she was over this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jigglypuff went on, the awful stench never subsided. why did this floor stink and not the previous one? Jigglypuff didn't see any fattys around here, so it made little sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, does anyone live down here, or did they all die and this is their stink\" Jigglypuff joked to herself about the horrendous odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jigglypuff continued on, she was beginning to doubt that anyone even lived down here. why would they with this kind of stink. As she was about to turn around and leave, she heard a sound from up ahead. Jigglypuff fell silent, focusing her pointy ears on the noise. It sounded like chatter, and laughter.... and of course, some gas. Jigglypuff slowly approached the sound to find an open door where the noise seemed to be emanating from. from her position, Jigglypuff listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, Zweilous and I snuck up on em, apparently they were \"too embarrassed\" to eat around everyone else so they were hanging out in that little lobby. ya know, the one by the flower shop. Well, I walked up to him and was all like, \"what's the matter Rioulu don't wanna seem improper around everyone else?\" Course, he didn't wanna talk to me, like the rude little punk he was.So we watched him as he had this burp come'n up, and it looked like he was gonna lose it, of course, he wasn't gonna let it go in front of us, so i was like \"hey, lemme help ya with that\" as I wrapped my hand around his muzzle. Then the little punk started squirm'n, cause that burp wasn't come'n out at all with my hand on his mouth, and it slowly got worse and worse. Then finally, when I thought he was gonna explode, we brought him over to the cafeteria, and he must've known cause he didn't want any of it. Then we tossed him inside, and the second I let go, oh man, I think he shot out a hyper beam with that burp\" said an unfamiliar voice followed by rowdy laughter from multiple sources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Scrafty, \\BRAAAAAP// always go'n for the little ones\" said a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ya know. don't get me wrong I can take on the \\FRRRRRRPT// big guys, but the little ones are just so much more fun\" said Scrafty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff's eyes shrank. that was far from the kind of conversation she wanted to hear right now. she felt her lust for adventure suddenly fade out of her. However, that's not the only thing that made it's way out of her as her fear of the situation cause her to lose focus and the fart she had been holding in for so long escaped her with a loud \\FFFRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP// plenty loud to echo a bit around the hallway and smelly enough for Jigglypuff to be able to identify among the already horrendous smell of floor B. This alone cause her go gag and cough. Unfortunately, all this noise was loud enough to catch the attention of the punks in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah woah hey, who out there is stink'n up my floor?\" asked Scrafty, enticing laughter from his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff gasped a bit at the sound of footsteps moving towards the door and bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey, not so fast there chump!\" Scrafty shouted as he and his friends waddled their way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff paid no attention to them as she ran to the door she had come from like her life depended on it. What followed was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jigglypuff ran, the door in her sights and not much further, Jigglypuff felt something wrap around her. when it came into view, it appeared to be a vine. Sid one of those punk just vine whip her? She felt herself be lifted off of the round and pulled backwards, away from the door. Not the direction she. fortunately, she seen an opportunity. her squishy body would be very hard to hold with just one vine in this position. Jigglypuff then attempted to squeeze out and it seemed to be working. however, the assailant caught on and another vine lash out, wrapping her upper body as well as lower, and heeping her held to where he could block her attempts to squeeze out, which she attempted multiple times. However when she found herself this far away from the door, and when she was turned around to face the punks, she knew they had her number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whaddya know mates. what's a little girl like you do'n in a dingy old place like this?\" the Scrafty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon before her consisted of the Scrafty, likely the leader of the group, an Ivysaur, a Zweilous, a Scizor, and a Florges, all incredibly obese and covered in grime. the five of them taking up most of the fairly wide hallway. Jigglypuff's eyes watered at the smell the five of them were giving off and she healed back a gag. She managed to squeeze her hand to her face and cover her nose. Fortunately Ivysaur's vines weren't slimy like him. Still, Jigglypuff was in a bind, literally. She didn't know these pokemon, and she didn't care to. all she wanted to do was leave this place and never return. She also couldn't help but stare at them out of utter revulsion. What kind of pokemon could let themselves get this way, who would want this. Jigglypuff knew there was no real fighting her way out of this, and her fate was left up to their mercy, if there was any to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, I-I just want to leave, get out of here, get out of this resort. I just wanna go home\" Jigglypuff pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you want out of here do ya? Sorry to break it to ya toots but as far as I know there aint no way out once you're in\" said Scrafty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea, I've heard something like that,but, maybe there's a way...\" Jigglypuff replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, maybe. Still, not like I care, I've got everything i need \\BRAUUUUUP// and more. Speak'n of which you're uh, you're new blood aint ya?\" Scrafty asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, what makes you say that?\" Jigglypuff asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause folks don't usually stay so tiny after spend'n even a couple days in this place. ya know, I've never broken in new blood before, this is gonna be a heck of allot of fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait, what are you doing!?\" Jigglypuff shouted as she squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrafty simply grinned and smacked his belly, making it wobble close enough to Jigglypuff for her to see it in it's entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope ya like shopping plus size kid\" said Scrafty before turning and making his way back inside. Venisaur then turned the struggling Jigglypuff to face him, looking her in the eyes and grinning as she got a strong whiff of his odor. Though determined to keep fighting, Jigglypuff knew her situation was near hopeless. that is, until she got one last idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the room was as much of a disaster as would be expected and smelled even worse than the hallway. the room was also quite hot. Jigglypuff could see why as there seemed to be an old furnace in the back of it. did these guys really need the heat? they seemed to be sweating enough already. if you could even call it that at this point. then Jigglypuff watched as the Zweilous position a chair in the center of the room. A chair that was practically dripping with bodily grime and probably thick enough to measure with a ruler. As Jigglypuff was being placed onto it, her pupils shrank. She had absolutely no desire to touch this stuff. She probably stunk bad enough already. Fortunately for her, she watched as Scrafty knocked away the chair with a kick before he ripped a massive fart that made Jigglypuff cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idiot, get this girl a clean one, that way she'll know every bit of sweat and drool she builds up on herself is her own product\" said the Scrafty with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff shook at the idea, nearly bursting into tears as she continued to try to fight the idea of what was about to happen to her, the same thing that got her into this situation to begin with, the same thing she was try to flee to escape. that fate was now staring her in the face as she was placed into the chair and turned to see a cart filled with desserts and such, likely having been ordered some time earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this, that's supposed to be all of our dinners, and now it's all go'n to you. Hope you appreciate what we're do'n for ya kid\" said scrafty as he turned to grab some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, Jigglypuff felt her restraints shift. It was no longer her entire body, but her limbs being held by the vines. If she struggled enough, she may be able to break free, though she likely would not have that kind of time. If there was ever a time for her previous idea to come to fruition, now was that time. Closing her eyes, Jigglypuff opened her mouth and began to sing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jigglypuff began to sing, sending out a soothing melody and triggering some drowsiness from most of the pokemon. Scrafty grebbed his head and grunted, trying to keep himself focused. There was only one good way to stop this kid now as he grabbed a plate of blueberry pie and spun around quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Scrafty growled as the pie splattered into Jifgglypuff's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mouth wide open, she received a good mouthful of the pie and her song fell silent, allowing the other sto snap out of it. Jigglypuff however began to cough as the rest of the pie fell off her face, trying to spit out what was in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, i don't think so\" said Scrafty with a grin as he picked the pie back up and shoved another handful into Jigglypuff's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then covered it with his hand and pushed against her pliable body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, swallow it. Mmmmmm, tastey right?\" Scrafty asked tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff couldn't like, it was quite delicious, which is why she had tried to spit it out so quickly. However, with it forced to stay in her mouth, she got a good taste of it and impulsively swallowed, her pupils shrinking after realizing what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's good, aint it so much easier to just accept it? I mean, it's all you can get after all, as long as your here. might as well enjoy every bit of it \\URAAAAP//\" said Scrafty with a grin as he shoved more pie into Jigglypuff's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(sure, it would be easier...) Jigglypuff thought to herself before shaking those thoughts. What she had seen become of the people on Floor A, and these punk here assured her that she did not want to give in. Still, Scrafty continued to shove more and more pie into her mouth, practically shoving it down her throat, preventing Jigglypuff from spitting it out. It also wasn't long before everything she swallowed began to take effect on her. she could practically feel her body growing, not only from food, but with fat from whatever kind of stuff was in the food. She could also begin to feel her mouth salivate even more and the pours over her body opening up and beginning to sweat. Jigglypuff shut her eyes tight, an occasional tear streaming down them. She didn't want to show these people that she was afraid but her whimpering said it all and filled the group with glee as more and more pie was shoved into the growing pink ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl refused to open her eyes in fear of seeing her body swelling up. Her effort however became harder and harder as she began to feel gas bubbling up inside her, even more fiercely than before. with the pie gone, Jigglypuff was left filling up much more of the chair as Scrafty turned and grabbed a large cake. Jigglypuff peeked out, seeing all the food items that remained, which were far more than she cared to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jigglypuff's belly began to rumble loudly as a powerful belch was shot out which kept Scrafty from stuffing her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good one. Let's see if we can't make it even better\" said Scrafty continuing to grin as he stuffed jigglypuff again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was clearly experienced with this as he thwarted Jigglypuff's every effort to spit out the food, which was becoming harder and harder to do as her body began to crave more and more, practically forcing her to suck it in the second it entered her mouth. another rumble of the belly send the gas south causing Jigglypuff's eyes to open wide as she tried to hold it in. seeing this, Scafty merely chucked before continuing to stuff the puff, pushing down on her a bit harder to force the gas out. Eventually Jigglypuff's rear erupted with a loud and nasty \\PFFFFRRRRRBBBBBTTT// as the gas blasted out, smelling even worse than the last one. however, there was nothing she could do about it but blush as Scrafty continued to stuff her throughout her emission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came another cake, followed by a bowl of ice cream. At this point, Jigglypuff was crying there was no more holding back her thoughts as she could feel her body doing everything she didn't want it to. Her mouth pouring drool, her body sweating a thick slimy sweat and swelling beyond the chair, and finally, gas bubbling inside her like a hot tub which only caused her to swell further. with every burp and fart that squeezed it's way out, Scrafty laughed. He had her right were he wanted her and there was no stopping until everything was inside this Jigglypuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandful after handful, dish after dish, Jigglypuff only swelled further and further, her body's natural lack of stretching limits allowing them to stuff her as much as they pleased. with every pound, her body became slimier, droolier, and gassier, and she could feel every bit of it. every time her eyes slipped open, she never wanted to open them again. Because her body was completely spherical however, there was no extra definition to be had, no expanding belly, no discernible butt jut more and more size as she grew outward and upward. she did however produce a pair of noticeable facial cheeks, constantly keeping a puffed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the final dish came around. a tall angel food cake. savoring the moment, she slowly slid the cake into Jigglypuff piece by piece, her body having given up any effort to spit out the desserts. However, she had not quite given up fighting as she held in every burp and fart that tried to make it's way out to prevent giving the Scrafty the satisfaction. a fact which he had noted. Finally came the last piece and the last bit of swelling that would occur as a result of this. afterwards, he stepped back to admire his handywork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff had grown immense compared to where she was before. Three and a half times her original diameter as a matter of fact at about 4.6 feet, with at least a foot of that being gas. Her body was oozing slimy sweat out of each pour and creating thick layers of it on her body. A hefty pool of it was forming up beneath the chair. Her drool was pouring out like a slow water fall and adding to the mess on the floor when it finally made it's way off of her body. She was exhausted and had her eyes shut, but was still awake, he mind taking in all the wrong sensations of her body's current state as she could hardly believe this was happening. At this point, Ivysaur was holding onto her, just to keep her from rolling out of the chair. Gas rumbled around inside of her as she sat there but refused to let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Feeling satisfied, Scrafty approached the Jigglypuff and patted her on the massive side causing her entire body to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up\" said Scrafty as he leaned in to look Jigglypuff in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jigglypuff opened them, looking exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I think you're the jiggliest puff there is now. never gotten to stuff a newbie before, and might I say, look'n good. So, any more inhibitions about eat'n? aint too good for us any more are ya? well, lemme tell ya, this is your life now kid, and i just saved you a whole lot of trouble but get'n it over with nice and quickly\" said Scrafty as he looked into Jigglypuff's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff just continued to sit there and lazily look at him. Scrafty simply chucked and gave Jigglypuff a couple more pats causing her to wobble like jello and shake the gas inside her around uncomfortably..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you wanna do with her now Scrafty?\" Florges</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scrafty looked down at Jigglypuff, something about her seemed to trigger something in his mind. her body was basically just a squishy pink sphere. Normally pressure on such a pokemon would only flatten her, but at this size, and with this much fat, she kind of resembled a beanbag chair. However, Scrafty was already a bit of a tall pokemon, but one with his girth was even larger, and this Jigglypuff was still too small for such a prospect. However, Scrafty made his way over to her with the eyes of the other pokemon watching him, including Jigglypuff's. With a grin, Scrafty turned his massive rear around and hung it over her. despite her new size, his butt was still much wider than her. Jigglypuff's tired eyes opened wide with horror as Scrafty's butt slowly made it's way own closer to her. in response, she wiggled her arms and legs, but to no avail before the larger pokemon's butt pressed down onto her. As Scrafty pressed more weight onto the pink puff, it was clear that she was not big enough to sit on and her face slowly wedged into his crack before he eventually stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, so, what do you think boss?\" Ivysaur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrafty wiggled around a bit before releasing an absolutely massive fart all over Jigglypuff's face, making her squeak in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I like it, but there's one problem... she aint big enough\" said Scrafty as he looked down to his victim and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff however was experiencing another issue, that being all the pressure on her gassy belly. her refusal to fart had stored up a massive amount that now demanded release from all the pressure Scrafty was applying to it. she still struggled to hold it in however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, how much bigger does she need to be?\" Florges asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ya know, I've been sti'n on that dinky little chair over there since we started this whole thing. don'tchya think a boss aught to have something big and comfy? I'd say... we need her no less than ten feet wide\" Scrafty declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff of course heard this and her pupils shrank. Ten feet wide!? she already felt huge, larger than she ever imagined and larger than she had ever wanted to be. The thought of getting any larger terrified her. This terror also caused her to lose concentration and with it, all defenses she had committed to holding in her fart. Scrafty suddenly felt a rumble beneath him, and before he knew it, Jigglypuff started letting loose with a massive blast of gas. This took scrafty by surprise as he began to lose balance and feel himself lowered to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fart was concluded, the room smelles ripe withj the addition of the increasingly raunchy Jigglypuff gas and Jigglypuff had shrunk by about a foot. Scrafty got up and peeled Jigglypuff away from his disgustingly sweaty butt before taking a look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she's gonna need allot of work. Everyone, go get some more food!\" Scrafty demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unanimous agreement, everyone got up and waddled their way out of the room.</span></div></div>",

For about half the session, you didn't let either rip \\FRRRRRRRP// once. And i know how this stuff works, every pound you take on causes more and more gas buildup, yet even now, you're just holding it in, just like that. Normally I'd just let you go out of respect for that kind of feat but... that mush be one heck of a gas attack waiting to happen\" said Scrafty with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have no idea what you're talking about\" said Jigglypuff just before her belly roared like a Pyroar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, and i think it might be a good idea to let some of that out before I send you on your way. of course, I don't quite have the dexterity such a thing requites, Florges, would you do the honors?\" said Scrafty turning to Florges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but of course darling\" said the Florges as she slowly drifted towards Jigglypuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff's eyes opened wide as she began to try to struggle again, but her size made it difficult. Then with great effort, Ivysaur lifted and placed Jigglypuff on the ground, tilting her so her belly was turned to Florges who began to reach down with her massive sausage fingers and press against Jigglypuff's belly. It started soft as she felt the gas bubbling around inside Jigglypuff and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, that's quite the payload you've got in there. But do you think it'll stay tucked away in there if I dooo.... this?\" Florges asked before she gently pressed down on Jigglypuff's belly, squishing it down and stirring the gas around. as she did so, her hands became covered in Jigglypuffs sweat, making her chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother push made Jigglypuff since as the gas in her moved around. She could feel it attempting to escape but held it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a fighter. ah well, I've got all day\" said Florges, clearly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorges then began to slowly massage Jigglypuff's belly, moving the gas around inside her, making it more and more difficult to hold in, especially with the constant pressure of Florges's massive hands. As she was massaged, Jigglypuff's body continued to twitch as she continuously wanted to move her arms and legs into a better farting position. She was unable to use them to move Florges's massaging assault as she tried that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jigglypuff's cheeks began to swell and her butt began to pulsate as the gas continued to be forced into those regions. To make matters worse, Jigglypuff had only been producing more gas during this time and attained an extra 3 inches from it. Jigglypuff began to really runt as she strained hard to keep the gas in, still not wanting to satisfy these villains. Before she realized it however, her arms and legs had tucked in, her body desperate to let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the constant massaging cause Jigglypuff's cheeks to swell out massively, and her butt to pulsate the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... can't hold...... iiiiiiiit!\" Jigglypuff shouted before she erupted from both ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\\BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP// Her burp sent spittle flying out in all directions. \\BRRRRRAAAAAAPPPPTTTTT// Her fart shot out with almost enough force to blow Florges back. The flower pokemon did manage to stay in position and keep massaging Jigglypuff's belly until all that was left were toots and hiccups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo what a workout and *sniff* oh man, what a stink\" said Florges teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, see, aint let'n anything slip past me kid. Now then, come on, let's get you back topside\" said Scrafty as he held out his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypyff's eyes were practically rolling form that explosion and she was embarrassed in ways she had never been before. Eventually she regained her composure and slowly attempted to stand. However, standing only caused her to roll forward into a cocktail of bodily fluids as her body squished to cover as much of it as possible. One thing was discovered though, like this, her legs were simply too weak to carry her weight. she tried again but could not lift herself. Her eyes moved up to meet her captor's pleadingly. Scrafty and Florges noticed the struggle and instead moved to her. With the aid of Zweilous, the managed to lift the massive immobile puff and carry her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe crap, we've got stairs...\" Scrafy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and work\" Florges demanded as they heaved the heavy puff up the stairs. when they made it to the top and opened the door, they set Jigglypuff down and rolled her out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya around kid\" said Scrafty before the trio closed the door and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff stared forward blankly at Floor A. part of her was happy to be back here but, still, this was her first moment to really let it sink in. Everything, this would be her life now, a massive slobby ball of a Jigglypuff. It was now that Jigglypuff found herself in tears again. Unable to walk, unable to leave, forced into this state by no will of her own, just a punk who got his kicks from picking on the weak. She checked herself over one last time, seeing if it was real. Indeed, she was huge, and with the gas out, about 3.6 feet in diameter, though she felt that gas welling up again. Her mouth was still drooling, though not as severely as when it was being fed and her body still slimy though less so now than before. Even now, she still couldn't believe this and started crying again, her nubby hands covering her eyes as tears poured out. she st there hoping for someone to come by, but maybe nobody came around this way... at least at this time. come to think of it, she had no idea what the time was at this point, she didn't know how long she was stuck on Floor B. Jigglypuff just sat there and waited, forcing back tears and trying to remain hopeful. Maybe... maybe this wasn't the end? maybe she could still find a way to escape, maybe find a cure. For now, she did realize she could be a least slightly grateful to those punks. She was terrified before about becoming a massive obese slob like the others in this place, but now that she was one, and she'd figure out how to deal with it, giving her time to compose herself and focus on the task at hand. getting out of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her recovery of positive thought shone through, not exactly in her face, but in her body as she was suddenly able to stand. Curious, Jigglypuff examined herself. nothing special seemed to have happened... However, she felt something inside that may have been responsible. She had once again bloated out more with gas, enough so to lighten her body enough for her to walk. She still felt heavy and sluggish and her movement had become a waddle, but she was able to move again, and with it, came opportunity. Perhaps she should take this time to try and meet new people, make some friends in this place, since she had no idea how long she'd be here. Or, she could do that later and instead get some rest.</span></div></div>",

Unusual, as even places for pokemon were staffed by humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day mam!\" The Combusken said. \"Checking in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's under Joy.

Gripping her sides as her body exploded with weight.  Her upper arms drooped with thick fat sags, thighs were pressed tightly together and her belly hit the ground and folded on itself.  Her ass ballooned and began to blow more gas out than before.  She was disgusting, but it felt soooo good.  Her own foul stench began to drive her on her search.  \"Mooore...it's not fair, I need more!\"  she looked wildly around, dropping her fat body to the ground and crawling on all fours, sniffing at the ground like a hound.  Her ass waved in the air and she thusly farted, closing her eyes to enjoy the heat escaping her hole, licking her beak with a slug-like tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened her eyes she almost cried, she saw berries in the distance...large, engorged, unimaginably large berries!  A bush that hadn't been picked clean, one that had been allowed to grow for no telling how long.  Each berry had become watermelon sized, if not larger, and there were six at least, the weight of each bending the tree low enough for the picking.  Blaze drooled, it almost hurt her to have to move her bulk such a distance to get the delicious prizes.  She dug her fat fingers into the ground and clumsily sloshed her fat body forward, her knobby knees tripping up against her belly as it dragged against the ground.  A smile crept along her fat beak as her tongue lolled out, drool spilling from the edges, and she sloshed forward at a surprising pace for one so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked her bulk towards the tree, her ass cheeks slapped together, quick but noisy farts ripping free with every bit of movement.  Her clumsy form finally arrived at the treats, her mind racing with hunger, dignity had gone out the window, and so had her breathe...panting loudly and miserably she grabbed a watermelon sized berry and planted her face into it, slurping, chomping, taking the whole thing into her mouth and crushing it to paste.  She shook with orgasmic pleasure, a painful sounding gasious rip escaping her rear as once again, her body grew...and grew...and grew...mounds of thick fat building on her body, finding new spots to form.</span></div></div>",

She farted over and over again, her scent filling the area very quickly.  She finally landed on her fat rear and with a noisy squeak from her bottom, covered her fat face in utter embarrassment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it!\" the charizard boomed, slapping his fat tail on the ground.  \"I went through that...it's the berries...they're great stuff.

Mike fanned the air. <br>\r\n\"Phew, Drak!\" he said, \"You've got some nasty farts today, buddy! I don't know what you've been eating, but please don't eat any more!\"<br>\r\nDrak wasn't sure either, having no idea that it was the collar that was intensifying his gas. He belched and flecks of drool shot out.<br>\r\n\"That's gross, Drak!\" Mike scolded him, \"What's with you today? First you've got some nasty gas, now you're drooling?\" Drak whined and started drooling again, the slobber moving down his chin towards the collar.<br>\r\n\"No, don't drool on the collar, whatever you do!\" Mike shouted, rushing towards his dragonite, \"You might ruin it!\"<br>\r\nMike grabbed the collar and tried to get it off of Drak so the drool wouldn't hit it, but it was stuck. The slobber ran down onto his fingers, and he pulled away in disgusted defeat.<br>\r\n\"It won't budge!\" he said, wiping the drool off. Drak frowned and farted again. He wasn't sure what to do, either. But suddenly, he had an idea. Mike scolded him as more gas squeaked from his wide rear. But instead of getting upset about it, he turned and shoved his scaly backside in Mike's face, forcing him to smell the gas.<br>\r\n\"Ugggh! Drak!\" Mike shouted, jerking away from the dragon's tush, \"Stop that! Don't put your butt in my face, especially if you just farted!\"<br>\r\nBut Drak was delighted with this idea. He wanted Mike to get a great big whiff of his farts, wanted to squish him under his rump and fart all over his face until he stunk all over. Maybe then Mike would stop scolding him for farting and learn to like it!<br>\r\nDrak moved towards Mike and turned around. Mike barely had time to flinch before he was pressed under the dragon's posterior. He was unable to move from the weight, and even though Drak wasn't hurting him, he didn't want to be stuck under his gassy rear. <br>\r\nDrak laughed happily. This was going to be great! He squished his bottom around on Mike, getting nice and comfy, then sat there for a second before letting rip a tremendous fart.<br>\r\n\"Gah, Drak, get off me buddy! That's disgusting!\" Mike groaned. Drak responded with a series of airy toots, culminating in a windy \"frrrrrrttt!\" He could feel Mike squirming and hear him complaining about the stink. He'd have to keep trying. <br>\r\n\"Pffft! Frrrrrt! Pffffoot! Frrrrrtt!\" Drak's butt released a variety of different sounding farts on Mike, including a particularly nasty one that lasted for twelve seconds and sounded like an elephant trumpeting, but smelt like the opposite end of a pachyderm. Mike continued to squirm and complain, wanting Drak to get off. Drak continued farting away, blasting wet and bubbly farts, and farting so hard that he knew he got some slime on poor Mike. He let out another long airy toot and listened. <br>\r\n\"Are you almost done, buddy?\" Mike asked. His voice was different, he sounded happy! Drak knew he had succeeded, when Mike said, \"If you run out of gas, then I'll have to get you some more food to fuel you back up!\" <br>\r\nYes, it worked! But then Drak noticed that the collar was glowing and realized that it wasn't his doing, but the strange accessory that had changed Mike's mind. It must also be what caused him to have such horrible flatulence in the first place! Well, he knew he couldn't take it off now! This was great! Drak celebrated this discovery by releasing an enormous, fifteen second fart in Mike's face, smiling as the gas sputtered and trumpeted noisily. A few small toots were all he could muster, and he knew he'd finally run out of gas, at least for now. He hopped up off and Mike and smiled down at him, noting happily that Mike was also smiling. <br>\r\n\"Man, that was some REALLY nasty gas,\" Mike said, wiping the fart slime off his shirt before going to hug his flatulent friend. Drak smiled and hugged him back, then heard his belly gurgle hungrily. <br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time to get you some food, huh?\" Mike laughed, patting the dragon's belly, \"Where do you want to go and eat?\"</span></div></div>",

The food they were eating looked great, and Mike was glad his friend had chosen to eat here after all.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... what should I get to eat?\" Mike wondered, as he looked at the menu, \"What are you having, Drak?\"<br>\r\n\"Drago!\" Drak responded, pointing to the burrito section.<br>\r\n\"Sure, but which one?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n\"Onite!\" the dragon said, running his claw down the entire section.<br>\r\n\"There you go, one of everything!\" Mike said.<br>\r\nDrak's belly grumbled. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm... better make that... three of everything,\" Mike concluded.<br>\r\n\"Drag! Dragonite!\" his friend responded happily.<br>\r\nThe waiter returned and took their orders. Mike got a chili-releno and ordered three of every type of burrito for Drak, with an extra-large order of refried beans, too. The waiter raised his eyebrows at this, but shrugged and walked off.<br>\r\nMike sipped his water as he chatted with Drak while they waited for their food. <br>\r\n\"From now on,\" he told his Dragonite, \"Your diet consists of high fat, fiber packed foods, to get you nice and pudgy while maintaining a steady supply of all important farts. And don't be afraid to drool over your food. It shows you're hungry and you appreciate the cooking. So does belching after a meal, so make sure you do it whenever you eat. And, most importantly, whenever you need to fart, whether its a little squeak or a huge blast, make sure you do it in someone's face, or sit on them first. Don't hurt them, but make sure they get a nice, big whiff!\"<br>\r\n\"Drag-o-nite!\" responded Drak, nodding to show Mike he understood and would comply.<br>\r\nIt took a little while for them to get the food, considering the size of Drak's order, but when they finally did, Drak assaulted the meal with gusto (making sure to drool all over the tablecloth as the waiter brought it, to show his appetite, of course). As Mike slowly ate his chili-releno, he watched his friend scarf down burritos and refried-beans, getting sour cream and cheese sauce and beans all over his belly ridges. As he ate, the collar glowed as it had before, instantly converting the food into extreme weight gain. <br>\r\nDrak's belly was most noticeable, pushing back his chair and hanging down over his legs, which now looked like telephone poles in their thickness. He had acquired a noticeable double chin, and shoveled the spicy food into his mouth with flabby, squishy arms. His tubby tail was draped over an enormously widened rear that spilled over the chair on either side, rounded out like his belly. <br>\r\n\"URRRRRRPPP!\" belched Drak when he was finished eating, and several of the other customers turned and glared at his rudeness. <br>\r\nThis angered Mike. How dare they glare at perfection!<br>\r\n\"You're all just jealous because your pokemon can't be as free and happy as my Dragonite!\" Mike shouted, shaking a clenched fist at them.<br>\r\nDrak belched loudly again, then took a napkin and began wiping off his chest and belly ridges.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa!\" Mike said to him, \"What are you doing, buddy? You don't need to clean yourself, you know? You're free now!\"<br>\r\n\"Drag?\" the Dragonite questioned him. He'd prefer his new blubber remain shiny and beautiful.<br>\r\n\"Well... okay, okay,\" Mike said, \"I'll level with you. You can clean your belly and face, but you're not allowed to clean your backside, unless you're wiping it on someone. Deal?\"<br>\r\n\"Nite!\" Drak said. That sounded like a good deal to him.<br>\r\nThe waiter brought the check and started when he saw the blob of a dragon that now sat in the chair opposite Mike.<br>\r\n\"Sir, is... is... is your friend alright?\" he asked, taking a few steps back and dabbing his pale, sweating face with a napkin.<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's better than alright, aren't you, buddy?\" Mike said.<br>\r\n\"Drag!\" the Dragonite said, grabbing the waiter in a big hug to show his thanks for the food. He remembered Mike's teaching and burped in his face, getting a bit of drool on him. His breath stunk of beans and cheese. The waiter recoiled and squirmed free of the dragon's grip, wiping his face off with a napkin.<br>\r\n\"Here's your check!\" he said, and stormed off.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... this is a bit more than I thought it'd be,\" Mike said, looking at the total, \"But... your happiness comes first!\" Mike assured his friend.<br>\r\nDrak nodded and smiled, then his bowels grumbled audibly as he felt a load of gas building up. He lifted the left half of his flabby butt off the seat and farted enormously, filling the air with a ghastly stink. The other patrons glared at him, complaining about the smell.<br>\r\n\"Drak!\" Mike glared at him as well, \"What did I tell you about farting?\"<br>\r\n\"Nite!\" Drak nodded, and hoisted his rear up out of the seat. He noticed his gas had left a stain on the cushion and grinned. <br>\r\nHe plodded over to the trainer of the Nidoqueen who had yelled at him earlier, his enormous girth towering over her.<br>\r\n\"What do you want, you filthy pokemon?\" she spat, getting up from her chair to confront him.<br>\r\nDrak turned around and sat on her with a loud, *squish!* as he trapped her underneath his fat butt. She squirmed and pounded on the rolls of dragon fat, but he sat comfortably with a huge grin on his face. He tilted his rear end forward slightly, positioned his anus carefully, and farted as loud and long as he could in her face. The force of the fart shook the ground like a tiny earthquake, his blubbery bottom jiggling from the gassy force. He could hear Mike cheering him on and he pushed harder, the dwindling fart springing back to life as his rump blasted away for five more seconds. He then sighed with relief, and sat down flatly on the girl once more, who was groaning in a muffled tone beneath his flabby tush. He sat there for a few seconds longer to make sure she had smelled it, although it would be impossible not to, since the stink filled the entire restaurant and several chefs had come out of the kitchen to complain. Mike was on the floor with laughter, and gave the bill to the startled waiter, who returned a moment later with the change. The two then left the restaurant and the scowling woman, whose dress was ruined from the stink of the fart and the stains it had left behind. <br>\r\n\"That was amazing, buddy!\" Mike said to Drak, squishing his belly fat in a big hug, \"That must've been the biggest fart ever, at least the biggest one I've ever seen!\"<br>\r\nThe Dragonite smiled and laughed, and hugged Mike back, squishing him gently into his belly fart.<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do now?\" Mike asked him, \"It's barely just seven o'clock. We could either find some other people to share that gas with, or go explore the town for something fun to do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike and Drak decided to go off into town and look for something fun to do. While they wandered, Drak would occasionally feel some gas coming on, and he would lift his tail and let it in Mike's face if no one was around, or tackle the nearest pedestrian and trap them under his fat rear. Mike would pat him on the head and tell him, \"Good boy!\" and Drak would smile, pleased with himself. <br>\r\nThey passed by several restaurants, dozens of shops, and a cinema and theatre, but nothing seemed really exciting. Sure, they wandered in a few of the shops and looked around, the Dragonite squeezing his flab through the entrances, and once getting stuck as he exited and stinking up the small shop with a noisy blast of flatulence, but nothing really caught their attention. Mike got some comic books and bought Drak a candy bar, and the two continued wandering through the town, Drak's face covered in chocolate as Mike flipped through a comic, when they saw the advertisement. <br>\r\nIn front of a huge building designed in traditional Japanese fashion was posted a sign emblazoned with the words: \"Club Sumo! Amateur Pokemon Sumo wrestling and tournaments held here! Always looking for new wrestlers! Sign up today!\"<br>\r\n\"Sumo wrestling? How cool is that!\" Mike exclaimed, \"C'mon, Drak, let's go in!\"<br>\r\n\"Nite!\" replied the Dragonite, and the two entered through the doors. <br>\r\n\"Well, well!\" said a voice, as a man approached them. He wore a robe and split-toe boots, had a shaved head, and a wide and pleased smile. His voice was very amiable and inviting. \"Are you interested in joining our club? You certainly have the body type for it, my friend!\" He patted the Dragonite's belly, chuckling softly.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n\"I am yobidashi here,\" the man replied, \"In addition to advertising, I also own this establishment. Ours is most unusual, you see, in that our heya, or training stables, are actually attached to the main building. Come, perhaps I could give you a tour?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds great,\" Mike said, and they followed the man as he led them down the hallway.<br>\r\nThey stepped out into a large open room, surrounded by bleachers and seated like an arena.<br>\r\n\"That is our dohyo, or ring,\" said the yobidashi, indicating the traditional clay and sand arena where the matches took place, \"As I'm sure you know, the winner is the first wrestler to knock his opponent outside of the ring.\"<br>\r\n\"Who determines that?\" Mike asked, \"You?\"<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" the man responded, \"The gyoji, the referee, makes all the calls. He is not here right now, but he will be here for Friday's match.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Mike said, \"Okay, then.\"<br>\r\n\"We are most unusual in a number of ways, actually,\" continued the man, wanting to pique Mike's interest, \"For instance, we use the ancient loincloth garments instead of modern mawashi, because many wrestlers prefer to use their rear ends as a weapon.\"<br>\r\nHe smiled, noting Mike's interest.<br>\r\n\"You see, we have fewer rules here than professional sumo. Farting and sitting on one's opponent are encouraged, and one is free to humiliate one's opponent after a match, within reason, of course.\"<br>\r\nDrak smiled. That sounded like fun!<br>\r\n\"You see those benches down there?\" gestured the yobidashi. There were two benches on either side of the arena, made of varnished wood. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Mike, \"For the wrestlers, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Not just the wrestlers, my friend,\" grinned the man, \"For trainers and lucky guests, too! You sit on the bench, and the sumo sit on you!\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mike asked, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n\"It is our own tradition,\" responded the yobidashi, \"Or it will be. Fat, stinky, Pokemon butts comfortably squishing trainers and lucky guests as they sit and watch the match. No one will complain about it, either, because we will throw out anyone who tries to cause trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"That's... that's awesome!\" said Mike, \"How many Pokemon do you currently have signed up?\"<br>\r\n\"As of now...\" thought the yobidashi, \"I'd say we have about twenty. Perhaps you'd like to meet a few of them? If you like, I can show you around the heya.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I know one thing,\" Mike said, \"I'm definitely signing Drak up for this! You want to wrestle, don't you buddy?\"<br>\r\n\"Drag!\" shouted the excited Dragonite.<br>\r\n\"That is very good,\" said the yobidashi, \"because we do not have any other dragon-class Pokemon right now. We have grass, fire, psychic, but no dragons. Now we do!\"<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be awesome, huh, Drak?\" Mike said.<br>\r\n\"Onite!\" the dragon shouted. </span></div></div>",

He had rather large blue eyes that drew attention past many of his other facial features. \"Eat up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoqueen gripped four doughnuts in her armored claw and shoved them into her gullet. She was starved. Each and every morsel she consumed tasted better than the last. She didn't even notice that the boy had wheeled several more carts in, only that her doughnut and cake supply hadn't run out. As Nidoqueen are very large Pokemon, standing almost as tall she put away the entire ten pounds of doughy goodness without missing a beat.

He also made sure tray after tray of sweets were brought into the warehouse. The first few saliva tests still failed to get the serum working, so Emmy ordered all water be taken from the warehouse and replaced with milkshakes. By the fourth day Nidoqueen was in captivity, the siblings decided to bring their pet pokemon, Arcanine (Felix's) and Lopunny (Emmy's) to the lab to help out with the trays and maintenance. Felix's Arcainine was full of energy and fond of the sibling's affection, while Emmy's Lopunny was often content with quietly executing her orders and standing diligently by Emmy.  Emmy was sometimes a little impatient with her brother, but she adored her Lopunny and often stroked its head as she ran over calculations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoqueen didn't know what to make of her new situation. She hadn't been able to find a way out of the warehouse, but she was given all the food she wanted ( though it wasn't like the food she found in the forest, where she would feel full and energized after eating. Her new food was tasty, but it made her want to take a nap and eat some more really soon...) and sleeping here was much more comfy than the forest. She had just began eating four major meals a day instead of her usual three, and now knew the luxury of snacking. She found herself putting a hand on her hard-plated chest and letting out a blech from time to time. Also, the warehouse was a little hot, and she didn't have any ponds to take a dip in! A light film of sweat had gathered under her arms, between her toes, under her tail when she sat, between her thighs, and even a little around her rear end! She spent less time exploring the large warehouse and more time trying to lounge in a way that would air herself out a little on the mattresses and pillows. Of course, it was to no avail, and she found herself getting even warmer as time went by...after all, she was being pampered, and her scales were slowly losing their hardness to compensate for the extra fat she was putting on.   <br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Hmm...still nothing little bro. I think we're going to need to go in there every day and treat that Nidoqueen like a princess. We don't want her doing anything for herself, we need this to go faster! After all, Dad's only on his business trip for a year. If we figure out this formula we need time to do something with it before he gets back!\"  Emmy grabbed the last cooking in the box she had been working on since the afternoon. It was a bad habit of hers; she needed to eat while she worked, and she had been testing Nidoqueen so often that she had polished off an entire box in one afternoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure sis, we'll get Arcanine and Lopunny to help out too. Also, maybe you should cut back on the cookies, we're trying to fatten up the Nidoqueen, not you!\"  He gave a good-natured laugh. His sister wasn't fat, but she had rather meaty thighs that made her look a bit chubby standing next to her stick-thin brother.  \"Yeah yeah little bro, big words coming from someone who girls won't date because he would go aerial from a passing breeze!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Felix cried in a fake-insulted voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of them had plates of brownies dripping with ice cream. One of the humans, a Red-headed human girl who looked taller and a little wider than the slim boy she was used to seeing, smiled. \"Hello! We're all here to make sure you are having fun! You don't have to do anything tough or tiring anymore. Just leave that to us!\"  Nidoqueen gave a slightly confused \"Nido?\" to inquire as to why they were doing this, but she found that her tummy was rumbling and that ice cream looked nice and cold; she was still a little hot and sweaty. Emmy carefuly moved the plate toward nidoqueen as she stopped grabbing the brownies and started gripping the platter to scarf it down directly with her mouth. \"I'll go get the next course: Caramel-Walnut coffee cakes by the dozen!\"  Nidoqueen realized that the humans weren't making her walk over to her food anymore- they were bringing it right to her! Nidoqueen decided that this life was the life for her; no more wandering at night looking for food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays gave way to weeks. Nidoqueen was spoiled as rotten as even the most pampered of pokemonthanks to the formula becoming steadily more reactive; it even began to change color when the saliva was added now. Emmy put her brother and their pokemon on overtime mode, refusing to let herself or anyone else leave the lab until Nidoqueen was fast asleep to get the last bit of oomph out of the saliva. Nidoqueen reaped the benefits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoqueen had put on nearly 120 pounds of fat since things began. Her scales had all softened into dough, and her neck now hung with excess flesh. She grew copious breasts out of her tan breastplate, and her belly was flabby and began to cover her groin. Sweat had soaked through the mattress, and she had developed a pungent reek as her unwashed B.O built and built. Her breath smelled moldy cake, and she had developed a carefree flatulence due to her utter pampered state. Drool seemed to be piping constantly from her mouth. The makeshift science team held their breath whenever they got close to give her more food. But...they were so close! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this will do it!\"   Emmy's hair was slightly uncombed, and sweat had seeped through under her armpits. She hadn't left the lab to shower or eat something other than the sweets they were having delivered for three days. Her brother wasn't any better. He had dark circles under his eyes and seemed in a daze. Not to mention how badly their pokemons' diets had become since they were helping full time at the lab. Arcainine was starting to get a belly, and Lopunny's thighs looked a lot like Emmy's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmy, in a state of utter concentration, dropped a dollop of sweat into the serum. </span></div></div>",

Everyone in the room coughed, took a step towards the exit, then relaxed. \"Wow....I wonder if that did anything? The cloud already cleared up!\"   Felix looked at his hands, as if expecting his skin color to be changed or something equally shocking. There wasn't any changes. Emmy put her hands on her hips. \"Well....I suppose we should wait in the lab and see! I know dad was working on something good, this can't be a dud, it just can't!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanine had padded over to a tray of scones and began eagerly lapping them up.  \"Arcainine! Stop that, you're getting pudgy!\" Felix said in his usual \"I'm not really mad at you \" tone.   Then he felt his own stomach growl. In fact, Felix felt so hungry he was perspiring!  Sweat continued to stain his shirt along the neck, back, and armpits.  He went over to a tray next to Arcainine, sat down by his companion, and began eating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lopunny, are you hungry? Because I sure am!\"  Emmy undid the top button of her white dress shirt and went to grab a slab of carrot cake to nosh on. Lopunny hopped excitedly. <br>\r\n------<br>\r\nThe next day, Emmy was the first to awaken. It was the early afternoon. \"I guess I passed out....woah...how much did we eat?\"  Though a new shipment would arrive in an hour, 90% of their generous stockpile of sweets had been obliterated. \"There is NO way we ate all of this!\"  Emmy grunted at her jeans. They felt extremely tight. She undid the button and watched as a muffin top unfurled slightly, unzipping half her fly. Her pink panties showed through the opening.  Lopunny was still asleep, but looked downright plump.  Emmy scratched under her wet armits, wincing at the odor, then at her equally moist rear end. In fact, she was perspiring as bad as yesterday already, although now she felt itchy everywhere, as if a prickly holiday sweater had grown underneath her skin.  She untucked her shirt and scratched at her soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix got up next. Emmy noticed he had a slouch. \"My neck is killing me, Emmy! And I'm starved!\"   Emmy's eyes widened as she got a better view at her brother. \"Woah, bro, it one thing if I've gained a few working here....but are you packing a gut?\"    Felix looked down. A bulge had formed at his midsection, and for once his pants didn't look so baggy on him.  \"Woah....well no biggie I guess! Lets scarf the rest of these doughnuts while we wait for the delivery truck!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmy found herself agreeing before she could stop herself. Soon their next shipment came in, and although they brought Nidoqueen her fair share, they no longer had a reserve- the four ate that themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoqueen began to observe changes in her four servants. The Arcanine's pelt had become greasy, and he had a noticeable potbelly. The boy looked like he couldn't right his posture, and walked with a permanent slouch. He sometimes let his tongue loll out of his mouth when he was distracted. The girls on the other hand seemed to be embarrassed about something. Whatever it was, it complimented the girls' widening thighs; the redheaded human grimaced with pain from her overtight pants as she brought her food.  Over the next few days, she observed several choice altercations between the siblings in between her rather loud belches and farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Three Days After exposure to gas-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay on the other side of the room!\" The redhead pushed the blonde away from herself, then jammed a hand into her pants to scratch a painful looking itch. The boy was slouching rather badly, almost dropping six inches of height. \"You smell like a wet dog! Arcainine isn't any better! Could you try cleaning him?\"    The blond seemed offended. A bit of belly was peeking out under his shirt. Saliva sprayed at his sister as he shouted \"I told you, he dosen't like to be cleaned! And we're both so hungry! I know we upped the food shipments but we need to take it up another notch! And I don't think Arcanine smells bad at all!\"  Leaving the redhead to wipe flecks of his spit off her face, he moved to a corner mattress in Nidoqueen's room with his Arcanine, and they both curled up in a doglike fashion to get to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Six days after exposure to gas- <br>\r\nThe blond's face seemed to be crunching up into a permanent snarl. His nose wiggled constantly, as if sniffing something, and a massive gut hung over the waist band of his pants.   \"Would you put a cork in it? You two have been passing gas like its going out of style!\"  The redhead had little red welts coming up around her skin with what looked like a brownish center spreading from them. Her jeans were ripped down the middle, revealing doughy buttocks with pink panties wedged in between the cheeks. \"Our ladylike figures leave us disposed to flatuence! Exuuuse me! What do you have, a super-nose all of a sudden?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Twelve days after exposure to gas-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde, who now had patches of red fur growing under his arms and around his belly button, loped over with such a severe slouch it looked like someone had placed a stone block on his back. His tounge was longer and it lolled out, dripping saliva. He was noticeably overweight, his pants ripped long ago and only ill fitting boxers remaining.  His pectorals had begun to plump up with fat.  He had a double chin, and reeked to high heaven...not that this was a problem for Nidoqueen. He  looked like he may have partially understood her \"Nidoqueeen\" for what it was: \"Looking good there, stud!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-16 days after exposure to gas-<br>\r\nThe redhead was almost completely covered in brown and creme fur. She looked like she weighed about 300 pounds, and almost looked like a scaled up version of her lopunny. However, her bright blue eyes were distinct.  She ran up to nidoqueen with her food, only she was in tears. Nidoqueen listen to the girl's sobs. \"I can't stop passing gas! I'm a disgusting slob!\"  Nidoqueen tried to talk to her, and found that it worked almost crystal clear this time. \"You smell fine to me, honey. Why not relax with me and have a few pieces of cake!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-24 days after exposure to gas-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right Nida! We smell fine to each other now!\"  A very large, blue eyed Arcanine with a maw dripping with drool grinned at Nidoqueen. His gut was only a foot off the floor, and he reeked like moldy newspaper and spoiled meat.  His hypersensitive nose began sniffing and found its way once again to her sister's colossal, three foot wide brown furry behind.  \"Come on 'Sis, get gassy for me! You know I love it!\"   The larger, blue eyed Lopunny laughed. \"You naughty little thing you!\" With a sly grin she ripped a fart in her brother's face.   The smaller Arcanine and Lopunny was busy fattening themselves on some of Nidoqueen's sweets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are just precious! I need to thank you for such a wonderful setup.\"  Nida, the Nidoqueen said. </span></div></div>",

Sticky, sweet, candy-like delicacies that improved the qualities of their eaters. While her trainer explored, Mathilda gnawed on the controls, and started the poffin production.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, her trainer returned, following odd noises and an awful stench. The poochyena had pokevolved into Mightyena somewhere along her poffin binge, and was now taller than her trainer while sitting atop her absurdly swollen belly. Her trainer, in a vain attempt to subdue her, ordered her to return - but she wouldn't fit in the Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily devoured her trainer and resumed her feeding, eventually attracting other wild pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slob Club was formed that day. Pokemon who swore allegiance to a way of life, that of the slob. Some had evolved in that short time, walking on two legs helped some remain mobile for just a bit longer, while it allowed others, the neat ones, to serve their masters, whom they adored carnally. Now, similar to Team Rocket, agents of the Slob Club seek to recruit new slobs, if even by forceful means. All the while furthering the plans of their leader...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew recruits are treated to an introductory video. You walk, or are dragged, in, and sit down. From afar, there's nothing but a massive, gray shape overtaking a vast acreage of land miles across.

Her body has overtaken a space one hundred miles across, a landscape of sloshing, swelling, reeking flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands and feet paws have long been engulfed by gigatons of fat. Her gut rolls sixty miles behind her, rising dozens high. Breasts like weather balloons overinflated to thirty miles across lie splayed across atop. Her fur glistens with copious amounts of sweat. But her most glorious attribute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt. Just over a hundred miles across, and sticking out forty behind her, the gigantic cheeks have smothered many cities. Vast explosions of gas sound from her crack, which puts the grand canyon to shame. Clouds of whitish steam literally burst from her, altering the weather patterns of the area noxiously; wet, noisy *FffFRrRRRRRRBbBBBBBpplllppppPPPFFFRRTTFF!* farts that often take an entire hour to subside, and start up again seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathilda has grown so gloriously, disgustingly obese that her head sits in a valley far below, with mountain ranges of her belly, breasts, butt, and puffy shoulders rising high above her head on all sides. Countless rolls of chins splay out for miles, hoses traveling down them to the epicenter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face is bulging, massive with fat, her eyes squinted and her cheeks bigger than buildings, tiny muzzle buried inside. Drool gushes from her dripping maw at an oceanic rate, filling the valley and making it more of a lake - she often has to drink her own slobber just to keep from drowning in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood from Slob Club factories pump into her at all times through a hose as big around as a subway tunnel. She's so out of shape, she's on a respirator, and gives orders through a comm system, bellowing for more food even while she eats more than every other Slob Club member combined. She basks in her vileness, getting bigger, and worse, every day. She's so stinky that only the highest rank members of the Slob Club can even think of getting near her without passing out! Hypnotized members who see her often have to be re-hypnotized, her girth so massive, so gross, that a love of normal slobbiness just isn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Team Rocket, she's bent on world domination. Even if she has to engulf it in her blimpy butt-cheeks.</span></div></div>",

The buttons, similar to the ones in his room, also were closer to the ground from short stacks with some higher for giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lucario grabs a tray of a medium size even though smaller Pokemon grabbed bigger trays than that and got up to the buttons. They had a lack for berries and familiar foods so he pressed a button at random. A shoot came down over his tray, giving him a full stack of 10 plate sized pancakes with syrup dropping after in a glob, splattering onto the breakfast and some of lucario. With a sigh, the fighting steel type sat down and picked up the first batter disk with no useable utensils, but before biting in, he noticed...</span></div></div>",

That chocolate filled gut's amazing.\" The Gengar could only laugh, watching the Lucario wiggle and thrash under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Gengar hops off, grabbing the Lucario's paws and forcing them to cross, looks like he was caught stealing from the cookie jar. The Lucario just sighed, as the Gengar leads him out from the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you know what I was eating, right?\" The Lucario looks back at Gengar, \"Could we...make a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Gengar couldn't help himself from smirking, because it's...most likely apart of his anatomy, \"A deal with you? The walking blob of Lucario flubber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's not all digested!\" The lucario claims, after a mighty burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. What do you want, tubby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to say nothing about this, okay? Please, this is embarrassing enough. If this gets out to any pokemon out in the forest, I'm gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario gasped as the Gengar smacked his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He snickered, \"You think I'm gonna let this slide under me? No thank you. You're coming with me, like it or not. Sorry man, it's just the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walk through the sidewalk, the city illuminating through the night. People didn't bother the Gengar, they know exactly who it belonged to, and where it was going. Of course, nearly no one understood the passing conversation, they can't translate the speech of Pokemon, afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's a pokemon like you doin' in the city?\" Gengar curiously asked, patting his gut more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I got hungry\" Lucario answers, letting out another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, eh? So no berry could calm you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that, I couldn't find it. I'm not one to steal, usually, but...I stepped on something. It injected something inside of me, and...I've gotten hotter and hotter ever since\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I know what you stepped in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stop at that Slob Club. Gengar points to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That place is the Slob Club.\" Gengar begins to explain, \"That's where pokemon go in order to fatten up tremendously. You don't wanna go in there, pal. They have food all over their bodies, burping and farting all the time, focused on nothing but eating...what was put into ya? Probably leftovers of their hunger drug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunger drug?\" Lucario questions, watching the Gengar nod his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunger drug. The town's usually pretty clean, that is, if you're tryin' to look for somethin' you shouldn't be looking for. Slob Club usually lays out hunger drugs to 'minnistrate pokemon. Think that the only reason they get away with it because the boss of the place is all buddy buddy with the cops. Plus, we're just pokemon. They'll breed a ditto with another pokemon if we're competitive types. If we ain't, then what's a few thousand Pokedollars a day tryin' to keep up with a hungry Snorlax lookin' Furret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you have a point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gengar smirked, letting the Lucario's paws loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, bub, if you're lookin' for the cure to whatever thing's goin' on with ya, it's in there. But seriously, unless you're in forra culture shock, it's best you come with me. My boss'll take good carra ya if you come with me, though. 'Slong as you have that weird Aura thing I heard Lucarios have, you can explain the story to her. Woman's got niceness comin' out of her butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs...charming at the Gengar made her sound, the Lucario looks back and forth, considering his options.</span></div></div>",

It was very compact, but that was just because all the Pok\u00e9mon in there were massive. The bar seat Lucario was sitting on was as big as he was, maybe even bigger. A large Ursaring sitting a little far down at the bar took up three of the massive seats. His ass massive. It jiggles with every little breath the Ursaring took. Lucario stared at the Ursaring's ass and daydreamed about slapping it and watching it jiggle around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem 'scuse me!\" The large Goodra was back with the drink, \"What no tip?\" Lucario picked up a pokedollar from off of the floor and gave it to the Goodra, she scowled and stomped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slobbery Heimlich was bigger than Lucario's whole upper body. Lucario stared at the Slobbery Heimlich and realized that he had to start somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya kid,\" Gengar slapped Lucario on the back of the neck, \"Y'know the only way to become your old self again is to drink the WHOLE damn thing. See, I used to be one of the fattest around but then, wooh wee, one of these babies now look at me!\" Lucario looked at Gengar then everyone else in the bar, by comparison Gengar was a toothpick. \"I'll tell ya what to do after you drink it all, but until then, I'll go gamble on that eating contest between the Aggron and the Tyranitar over there, the trick to gambling is, you hafta bet on both of them to get any real moolah hahahah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, Gengar was annoying. But he seemed to be Lucario's only way out. Lucario realized that he was becoming a bit more gassy than before. A steady stream of burps and farts erupted from both ends of him. Not as much as that Ursaring though, wooh boy. Any fatter and that Ursaring's ass would break a window. Lucario just hoped he never grew as far as him because Ursaring didn't even look mobile anymore, he just sat there, being fed by a Goodra, farting constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario eyed the drink again, it fizzed downwards instead of up which was odd. The vomit-brown liquid of the drink didn't look appetizing at all. But he had to do it. Lucario stood up on the massive barstool chair and took a sniff of it. It smelled like dirty diapers left out in the sun for a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooh boy haha, is that a Slobbery Heimlich?\" The Ursaring rhetorically questioned, \"Damn, you're challenging Queen Mightyenna by drinking that good luck son HAHAHAH.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that worried Lucario, but what did he know he was probably drunk anyways. Welp, here goes nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted---delicious. It tasted like Lucario's favorite food, a chocolate-poffin pie. Man, one sip wasn't enough he needed more. Lucario drank the brown liquid, little did he know that with every sip he gained 50 pounds. It all went straight to his ass. It jiggled with glee. His stomach grew quite a lot too, Lucario drank and suckled as fast as he could like a greedy piglet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime from the drink erupted outwards, beginning to fill the bar and engulfing whoever got in its way. The slime developed tentacles and plugged itself in every orafce of Lucario's body, his mouth, his nose, his ears, his ass, his swollen nipples. A Goodra got caught in the slime and went directly into Lucario's maw into his stomach. It blurbled in complaint then gained an extra 200 pounds. Lucario felt heavier than he did before, his ass now taking up 3 barstools like the Ursaring, he was almost bigger than the Ursaring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime picked up the nervously-farting Ursaring and plopped him right into Lucario's mouth. Lucario swallowed him whole and farted immensley which caused his whole body to quiver in gluttony. Lucario became as big as the bar, his whole body cramped and trapped inside the restraunt, he didn't wanna burst out and expose his gelatinous-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-body. </span></div></div>",

For the lack of a better way to sums it, Meloetta was a great singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the forest with her roaming Pok\u00e9mon friends, no one knew if it is was a \"he\" or a \"she\", mainly for the fact that Meloetta itself was genderless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meloetta of the forest however, prefer to be called as a \"she\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one secret that Meloetta kept to herself from the rest of the forest inhabitants: Gaining weight. Lots, and lots, of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor so long, Meloetta pondered what's it like being a blob of flab that lived a carefree life like a Snorlax, always sleeping, never stops eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discussed this topic for days to weeks to her best friend, Jigglypuff. Another Pok\u00e9mon that sang just like Meloetta would, but has a daily problem of putting others to sleep. Really deep sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigglypuff found it odd that some Pok\u00e9mon like Meloetta would gains weight all of a sudden, but how could she became enraged? Meloetta is her very best friend after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then on a day like today, Meloetta's dreams are about to be as closer than she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wake up...etta...H-Hey! Meloetta! Wake uuuup!~\" A familiar charming voice said. Meloetta couldn't of forget it, it was Jigglypuff's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...w...wha?\" Meloetta said, getting up from her tree stump, which is not much, but a thing to call it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleepyhead!~\" Jigglypuff said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jigglypuff...it's early in the morning...\" Meloetta said with a tired voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, just wanted to make up some quick preparations.\" Jigglypuff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preparations? What for?\" Meloetta asks back, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't tell me you forgot about your weight gain dreams, haven't you?\" Jigglypuff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I forgot about that...\" Meloetta said, rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you remembered! Just make sure you gets your Rinka Berry as always! After all, your voice is really sore on rough mornings like these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Meloetta said.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a couple of water splashed on her face, Meloetta walks up to Jigglypuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about it?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jigglypuff starts. \"We can start off simply by giving you plenty of berries. Or we could look up all of those delicious gourmets at the All-You-Can-Eat buffet! They made a 20% off on those blueberry pies they have there!\" Jigglypuff stated, Meloetta's eyes were beaming with a hint of happiness, blueberry pies were her absolute second-favorite snack, hands down right next to Rinka Berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, b-blueberry pies?!\" Meloetta said in pure enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Blueberry pies! So what about it?\" Jigglypuff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeloetta pondered for a bit. Eventually, she decided.</span></div></div>",

The chair was stuffed really well, and Jigglypuff relaxed and got comfortable. Then a speaker came on. It produced a very high pitched tone that instantly put Jigglypuff into a hypnotic trance. He closed his eyes, and listened very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are under the influence of the slob master.

Its completely normal to have a trail of saliva dripping down your chin. You will think that slobber is normal, and will find it unusual to not be drooling all the time. What do you think of slobbering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its completely natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its unatractive and bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't.

You will want to be as fat as possible, to be sexy yourself, so all the obese pokemon will like you. What do you think of fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best thing ever!

Those things are good and polite. Neat people are backwards people. We let them serve us. Slobs are more important than neat people. Remember, neat people serve your needs, they are the workers. You are their master. They give you food, and tend to you. What do you think of neat people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're my servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, When you hear the tone, these teachings will sink in, and you will think like a fat, dirty slob.

He looked over himself. Skinny. No slobber down his chin. No crumbs either! He hadn't burped in a while. He felt like the ugliest Jigglypuff ever! He needed to put on at least 50 pounds, and he wasn't drooling enough. Then a human came in. Jigglypuff noted that the human was skinny, very skinny, wasn't drooling, looked properly groomed, probably ate with utensils... a NEAT human. One of his slave. \"Backwards neat freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human smiled, seemingly able to understand the Jigglypuff now, \"Yes sir?\"</span></div></div>",

He was more of a talker anyway. He read this note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear online food provider,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe would like to mention that our food should be transported not to here, but to the family's summer home in the west.

He ate them like popcorn, but with less crunching and crumbs. Instead, he  had more juice around his lips. Not much to begin with, but as he ate blindly, the more accumulated around his mouth and muzzle. He also slowly had his belly with food. His digestion was good since he moved a lot, until now of course, so his other features like his hips, butt and face slowly gain with his gut. Another thing to thank digestion for was the gas.

There was cans of beans and sauces plus containers of stews and soups. Some of the ingredients inside needed outside items like some bread or veggies. He didn't care and just tossed some inside the crate just to say he included them. As he went to push the box toward the tv, he noticed the sink. Seeing that made him think of a bathtub. He didn't know much about them besides being bigger sinks. He did need a bath, but with a glance to the more liquid and mashable items in the crate he new he was going to get a different bath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The extra distance to the bathroom was the only drawback as he pushed it. The small journey gave him a chance to let out a belch which will soon duplicate in size, concistancy and smell later. He huffs and sweats by the time he makes it to the tub. It must have been a guest bathroom with how small it seemed with some carpeted mats around the appliances.

He had some of the first few containers pour into his mouth early with a moan from how good it had tasted. This made him do the same a couple more times while filling the tub in a gross, meaty and foul smelling broth. After a half hour of filling, the containers were tossed, the tub was just about full and zoroark was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He dunked his face in and opened his throat for a good gulping. He chugged without getting in the tub itself. His stomach gurgled with the built up gas rising from the concoction made while the ingredients stain his face's fur as well as the tub itself. It was just a few minutes before the contents were halved. Most of it was bubbling gas which made zoroark bend over the tub, raise his backside and release what was left of the food eaten while the rest was in the tub or in his flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With a heavy breath and a smile, he climbed into the soup he made. It was a bit snug, but it was mainly the food's fault. The broth helped lube him up as he soaks inside. His gut was like a lone island in a polluted ocean as his wallows in his bath. It was strangely relaxing, so much so, a second fart came out without his effort. The bubbles came up like it was in a tar pit. He could just sleep in this stuff.</span></div></div>",

He looked over himself and the tub to notice the food gunk was either dried on the tub as stains, on his fur as green, grey and brown stains, or evaporated.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Biff felt awful. Not only did he let down Amy, but he failed the Pokemon League. He was always the smallest Squirtle, but he wanted to prove that he was the strongest Blastoise that he could be. The hyper beam that Gyrados sent out was pretty traumatizing, Biff felt all his muscles jerk due to the extreme amount of energy coursing through his body. Biff wasn't fainted, but he had no energy to continue.<br>\r\nThe Blastoise stared at the serpent with a new shiny medal around his long neck, and the trainer of the Gyrados with the new shiny badge on his coat. At least the Gyrados looked happy. It's not every day that you win the Pokemon League. <br>\r\nBiff was a very sweet and considerate Blastoise, so he felt tranquillity towards his rival winning the battle. But Biff would win next time, he would win and be the b-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Biff woke up, he was in the Pokemon League's Pokemon center. Many injured Pokemon and worried trainers waited for their Pokemon to be healed in a long line that stretched out of the building. He was lucky to be revived. <br>\r\nBiff waited in his Pokeball patiently to be sent out. He loved his Pokeball, it was a little cramped, but it's much bigger and nicer on the inside. <br>\r\nThe curious Blastoise stared through the peephole of the Pokeball, he saw that Amy was playing with one of his teammates. <br>\r\nHe saw the coat of black and orange and he knew it was his colleague Luke. <br>\r\nLuke was a trained and rough around the edges sort of Houndoom. He took everything way too seriously and training is his #1 goal in life. He reminded Biff of a Drill Sargent . Way too serious and way too stern, even when he's told to calm down. Luke would never let loose and relax. <br>\r\nBiff saw Amy trying to play with him to get him to be happy, she hugged him, gave him smooches, threw a stick, cuddled him, nothing worked. Luke just sat there, sitting on his slender bum, waiting for his next battle command. <br>\r\nFinally Amy put Luke away, realizing he wouldn't lighten up after their loss. Luke must of been crushed after he realized they lost. <br>\r\nAmy reached for another Pokeball, Biff hoped it wasn't him, he couldn't bare to see the sorrow on his trainer's face knowing the he was her last hope and he let her down. <br>\r\n\"Please not be me, Please not be me...\" Biff chanted hopefully.<br>\r\nBad luck. Amy reached for Biff's Pokeball, the whole room shook for Biff, it was dizzy but he got used to it, being her first Pokemon and all. <br>\r\nShe threw the Pokeball on the ground, and Biff was forced to \"Come on out\". He didn't even wanna look at Amy he was so ashamed.<br>\r\n\"It's okay Biff, I know you're bummed that we didn't win, but I'm telling all you guys this, we hafta stay in the closest city's hotel for a few nights then we'll be ready to fight again!\" <br>\r\nBiff still looked down at the floor, still feeling bad. <br>\r\n\"Biff...don't be sad. I know you tried your best, and boy, that Gyrados was tough. We almost did it though. All thanks to you!\" <br>\r\nAmy gave her larger Pokemon a hug, Biff, a big alarmed, felt odd and tingly for a moment then hugged his trainer back lightly. <br>\r\n\"Now you get some rest, it's a long drive to the nearest city. I'm gonna talk to Big Shauna next.\" <br>\r\nBiff was returned to his Pokeball, with the image of Big Shauna still raging over their loss and the young girl trying to calm the 8ft, 550lb Ursaring down. Big Shauna was an irritable Ursaring, anything could make her snap at any given time. She was rude, crude, and violent. But she was still a part of their family and very protective and loyal.  <br>\r\nAs Biff was returned to his Pokeball, something happened, <br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\nHis water tank snapped! The Blastoise began freaking out as the water began engulfing the Pokeball he was in, water up to his knees in just a matter of seconds. The Blastoise pulled the hose from his water tank and tried to cover it with his hand, water not stopping any less. Then,<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\nThe other one popped too! Water flooded the room twice as fast, and Amy knew nothing about it. <br>\r\nWater now up to his neck and shell too heavy to swim, the Blastoise did what he had to do, he began chugging down the water that surrounded him. His belly becoming more and more full as he did so, the water was kept fizzy from his body temperature so the Blastoise needed to make time to burp between each gulp. The Blastoise closed his eyes as he swallowed, hoping it would run out soon. He felt his belly sag to the floor.

The Blastoise continued belching with no escape, a jet of burps rocketed from out of his mouth like a machine gun. He was embarrassed, but no one was around to hear it. As the inflated Blastoise sat, he felt the bag moving, and he hoped he was almost at the hotel.<br>\r\nHe was starving.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Who knows? Maybe they could find a Master Ball! One such girl, around sixteen years old, with dirty blonde hair, a bright blue skirt, a short jacket and a T-Shirt with a Ralts emblem on it, was one of those excited trainers. She was peddling down the road, hoping to get to the Festival on time, when she was suddenly assaulted by an unknown, squishy object, stopping her path. She flung off her bike and groaned, rubbing her elbow. Didn't look scrapped, just felt a little hot. The girl gets up and puts her hand on the squishy object, leaning in a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn return, she starts to concentrate, trying to hear...something. She could hear what was going on inside of the plush beast, more importantly, what they were thinking, and how they felt. She sighs a bit, patting the blubbery behemoth and walking over to the side of it. Surely enough, it was our protagonist, the Snorlax, resting on a not really busy street. The girl leans in on the Snorlax's head, trying to read its thoughts. She giggled a bit, seeing its dreams of conquest on a giant, chocolate kingdom. The girl smiles, pulling out her flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not be a good addition to my team...\" She states, \"But you are going to be a good pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling on her flute, the Snorlax yawns as it wakes up. Snorlax become hostile once they are woken up, however, the girl knew this. She readies the pokeball that contained her precious Gardevoir, and another pokeball, containing nothing.</span></div></div>",

I'll even cook some for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snorlax stood and thought for a moment. Truth be told, Katie had a thing for big guys, and...well, since she was the nerdy type, a Snorlax might be the closest thing to ever get to a boyfriend. Sure, it sounded weird to everyone else, but Katie couldn't help but love what's cute. Snorlax makes his decision.</span></div></div>",

The new owner seemed young with a youthful look on his face, and as he walked up to Myrid, he eyed her large belly. \"I see you had fed her well, you must of lived a very good life till you hit this... snag.\" Her owners laughed sheepishly in response, \"We had raised her from a Zweilous, and the two heads never did complain with what food we fed them. So when she evolved, she became the house garbage disposal in a way.\" The husband said, as he gave a sigh \"It was a good thing a friend of mine suggested that I sell my stocks early, especially since the correction caused many people to lose allot of money, and we just could not afford so much food to fill her up due to the fact I wanted to wait for the stocks to hit the lowest point in the correction, but...\" \"I'm guessing you bought stocks too late and missed the most profit, it happens.\" The young man responded \"That's what happens when you play the stock market, but lets get back on track, how heavy is she?\" The young man asked as he walked around Myrid to examine her rear. \"She is about 500 pounds, but that is just an estimate. We never attempted to move her onto a scale to get a more accurate measurement, we thought she would just break the scale.\" The wife responded, giving out a sigh at just the thought of lifting a pokemon that usually weighs around 350 lb to a scale just to measure it's weight. \"Very well, we have a deal. Let me just write the check and I'll be taking her with me.\" \"Oh, wow... good! We did not think you would make your decision that quickly...\" The husband responded, shocked that one could make a decision that fast when it came to the subject on a fat dragon-type, \"Oh, it has been lonely at the house as of recent. I could use company like her.\" The young man responded \"I'm guessing your kids have left the nest, I take it?\" \"Yep, all 3 of them, and all of my pokemon are either with them, with friends of mine, or out in the wild to have their own families. And my wife kinda left me in a way, it's more like her job took her and I really don't care, she sends me money weekly, and she makes allot on her own so money is no object to me.\" He smiled as he turned to Myrid, who had zoned out while he was examining her, \"Now, are you ready to come with me to your new home?\" he said with a tone not too unlike a pokemon champion asking someone to join them on their adventure. Myrid smiled as she made the attempt to get up, but the man stopped her \"oh, don't worry, I can just carry you there.\" he said to her, all while filling out the forms on his checkbook. \"You can carry her?\" the husband asked as he took the just signed check \"Oh please, I've lifted heavier pokemon than her.\" He said as he picked her up as if she was a plushie and walked off with her to his car as she just could only look out bewildered at what is happening. He placed her in the back seat as he prepared to head home, with Myrid still confused with what just happened.</span></div></div>",

It was time for lunch and there was no one else around to join him for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive bear stomped over to the tree and began to eat it. Ursaring couldn't stand it anymore he needed food. Anything would do. Even this tree. But the tree didn't taste so bad. He kind of enjoyed it actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor Furret tried to hide from the massive bear but there was nowhere else to turn, this was the end for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SCHLORP\" Ursaring had eaten a whole tree. Bark and all. He let out a loud belch and picked up the Furret by his tail and stuck him in his greasy maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRMMBBBBLLLLLEEEE\" Ursaring's obese gut pressed on the ground now, it was round and blobby all at once. Ursaring had a glint in his eyes. He was famished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Ursaring devoured another tree, bigger than the last. Pok\u00e9mon who had been living in it practically fell into his boulder-sized belly. Ursaring ate rocks and trees and stones all within the area. His legs bigger and flabbier than a red oak's trunk. His ass grew to the size of a pickup truck and farted relentlessly. But his belly was his crowning jewel, it had almost become bigger than the pond he was surrounding. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was sleeping on a park bench in a city that looked similar to Saffron City, albeit a smaller version. Feraligatr began to walk around, daydreaming about what he could be doing right now. You see, Feraligatr wasn't with a trainer, he was abandoned at a young age and he was forced to survive with no help from anybody. He had no family or friends. He was homeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he would be considered homeless, if he moved around from place to place. He did move around the city but when he did he would gravitate towards the city park. Mainly because of the pleasantness of the park always drew him back to it. It wasn't really special, but to him, it was beautiful. He cherished every second when a bird sang, and he would always be interested in the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was somewhat active, he would still be considered underweight when compared to his species. An average feraligatr would weigh at least 250 pounds and usually 7 feet tall. But Feraligatr was only 150 pounds at most, and he was only 5 feet 11 inches. His body didn't look too healthy for a pokemon like him too. His ribcage could be seen, his face was very angular and his cheekbones jutted out. His legs and arms looked more like bones with skin on top of them, with barely any muscle to support them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't complain too much though, every once in a while a battle would happen and he would imagine if it was him fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may be wondering where he gets his food (if any) and water, well Feraligatr recently found out a place that would reward him with food and some water if he worked for a while. However most of the work was manual labor, which was unfortunate for Feraligatr because of his lack of muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, he noticed other pokemon joined in on working too, and some of them were very well fed, to say the least. A plump Raichu, A flabby Charizard, A chubby Dragonite etc. Their bodies hid their strength fairly well, most of them finished in a hour and they didn't look like they broke a sweat while Feraligatr would be finished in 3 and he would be sweating profusely. He decided that if he wanted to not worry about how much food he got, he would have to be like them. He just didn't know what to do in order to be like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, he realized that he would have to eat a lot in order to be like them. There was only one problem, he didn't have a surplus of food on hand, and he didn't know where to get a lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut luck was on his side, and he found out that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His savior, a cute Munchlax, was sitting under the tree, looking up to her friend and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's be careful out there, you hear?\" She teasingly warned Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu responds with a giggle, before hopping down from the branch and giving off a cocky pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Riolu boasts, \"I'm the king of pokemon, I can handle anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax could only giggle at Riolu's egotistical delusion. The two kids were fantastic pretenders, and by a trainer's standards, a rare duo. Some trainers only see the potential they could have in battle, while others saw only their cuteness, and some greedy trainers saw their value in money, rare pokemon like that would make a killing! Lake Maki was the place Riolu and Munchlax reminiscent on the times they almost got themselves caught, Riolu teasing trainers with his acrobatic stunts, able to communicate with both Pokemon and People. See, Riolu loved sneaking out of the forest to go spy on human behaviors, having adapted some himself. For one thing, the boy can speak fluent English now, and can read about 80% of what you would put in front of him. Munchlax was learning, slowly but surely, she was learning. She's got down the basics, like Hi, How are you, etc. But one thing that always peeked Riolu's curiosity was the food that humans ate. How odd it looked...how tasty it smelt... it was just so odd to him. He looks over to his buddy, she never saw human cuisine before. The only cooking she's ever laid eyes on was Pansear's Grilled Berries. So, Riolu hatched an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Munchlax?\" He started to question, tossing another rock across the lake, \"Have I ever shown you a human restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Munchlax questioned her friend, looking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, a human restaurant is a place they sit down to go have food that they can't make at home. I saw this weird one when I was over in the Forbidden City, people were lining up at this big...container thing where food was placed in, and they just grab them with these weird tools to put them onto their round discs, that's what they use to eat off of by the way. They're white, some of them have floral patterns, and they're always really, super duper shiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's their food like?\" Munchlax ponders.</span></div></div>",

Val didn't mind however as night time was the best time for travel among the city streets, free from the eyes of people, people who may wish to capture him, or ogle over his presence. Not that he minded the challenge that escaping form them brought, but it was more of an annoyance at this point. speaking of challenge however, that's what Val was on the prowl for tonight. Unfortunately for Val, most battles had grown rather dull since he would either win them, or loose and have to flee from trainers trying to claim him as theirs. Pok\u00e9mon on the other hand were a different story. Pok\u00e9mon never tried to capture him if he lost to them, making them a proffered opponent. It wasn't just battles that this Victini took pleasure in winning, it could be an art challenge, a cooking challenge, even a spelling challenge and he was eager to take it on. There was always some sort of action going on in the city however. so much in fact that Val never bothered to keep track of it all and sort of drifted from placer to place. As he passed an alleyway he took notice of something, a poster plastered onto the wall. Curious, Val made his way over to it to investigate. Before him was the poster, apparently for some sort of underground contest of some sort, which would explain why there weren't more of them. in fact, this almost seemed like bate of some sort. Still, he took the time to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe main focus was the image of two Pok\u00e9mon battling it out. however, there was something odd about them. They were massive. not just in the sense of height, but in girth as well. Victini had seen many Pok\u00e9mon before, but these specimens were uncharacteristically huge of their species. The top of the poster read \"Heavyweight Pok\u00e9mon fight Club\". Val didn't recognize it and looked down to the lower half of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Heavyweight Pok\u00e9mon fighting circuit is looking for new heavyweights to join our ranks. We accept Pok\u00e9mon of all types. The only requirement is that you are huge enough to dwarf others of your kind. Bigger is Better in the Heavyweight Pok\u00e9mon Fighting Circuit!\" Was all the poster read. Presumably he would have to learn more by finding a representative. Speaking of which, there didn't appear to be a location of any sort on this poster. that's when Val heard a voice coming from his right. it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well I'll be. Now what's a legendary like you do'n around these parts?\" Asked a voice from the shadows. Val turned to see a rather gruff Weavile making it's way towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal wasn't sure what to make of this individual, but he prepared himself for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, Saw you look'n at the poster. So, have you an interest in The club?\" the Weavile asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal looked to the poster and then back to the Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... well, I suppose so. I've never heard of this before, though to be honest, it kinda looks like just a regular battle to me, except it apparently wants fatties\" Val Replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoho, does it now? Well, yes, it may look that way, but i assure you, you've never fought a fight like this before. Think about it, two massive pokemon duking it out in close combat. every step you take shaking the ground. the audience being bounced into the air when you slam your opponent to the ground. it's a rather immersive experience and one that has become popular with a number of wealthy individuals\" the Weavile explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal considered the idea. A new type of battle which he had never even heard of before. that did get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, alright guy, sign me up. I think I can take on some overweight blobs of Pok\u00e9mon\" said Val as he hit his fists together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well, I like your enthusiasm, but there is a rather glaring issue. you're kind of a shrimp. Even if you're strong, the fans aren't paying to see your average battle, they want the ground to shake beneath them like an earthquake. they want their challengers larger than life, so big that it's a wonder they can move, let alone fight\" the Weavile explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVin went silent with thought again. the idea was tempting but it was true that he was much tinier than the others. He didn't much like the idea of having to be fat either. not that he knew how he would get that huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... well, I do like the idea of a new challenge, but I don't know about having to get fat to do it\" Said Val as he looked up to the Weavile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weavile looked to him and his heart skipped a beat. This Pok\u00e9mon, a Victini, would be an incredible asset in the club, especially for what he had planned, and he was actually rather nervous about losing such an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I guess I aught to lay it all out there for you then. You see, my name is Zaz. I'm a promoter for the circuit, always looking for new Pok\u00e9mon to add to the ranks, and to be honest, someone like you is a rather rare find. Although, I guess I'm not your typical promoter. You see, I also represent a special interest group who is rather fond o these battles. the trouble is, they only have very few people in the circuit who represent them. we hope to introduce a whole new style of combat you see. With your help, we could bring the Heavyweight Pok\u00e9mon Circuit to the top. Of course, there would be allot in it for you. Money, fame, glory, all that stuff fighters like. you'd be sit'n pretty for the rest of your life\" Zaz explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal thought about things once again. The idea of being fat still didn't appeal to him, but he couldn't seem to pass up the new challenge. he then turned his attention back up to Zaz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's assume I'm interested. like you mentioned, I am tiny, and rather proud of my figure to boot... but, let's say I were to try to bulk up a bit, how do you suggest I do that?\" Val asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I was waiting for you to ask that. you see, I happen to be aware of something that's... well, actually rather secret. you see, outside the city is a rather well hidden cave in the forest. so well hidden in fact that it's impossible to see the entrance. but, well... before I tell you about it, I'm going to require your agreement. As in, I need you to sign a contract. It will get you into the circuit with me as your manager. Feel free to look it over as you like, but I think it is a rather generous agreement\" Zaz stated before handing a piece of paper and a pen to Val.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal wasn't stupid when it came to contracts. He had been involved with enough bad ones that he knew well to read everything. Val was surprised however with how clear and honest it looked, and it was fairly generous. the only thing that really took his attention in it however was something about a Slob Club. apparently this guy was a representative of that. Still, he wasn't sure. this would be a big decision, literally. If he needed to gain weight to join this, just to try becoming a champion of something new, it may not even be worth it due to how long it would take him to loose all that weight when he finally got sick of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some deliberation, he...</span></div></div>",

Now then, in my possession I have a map that should lead you straight to the entrance. it is hidden due to it's location being not only being on a cliff, but the only known entrance being a dead tree trunk. your ability to fly however should get you up there just fine. I should mention however that the way out... well, it aint gonna be so simple. you see, the guy who reported this to me mentioned that the enterance is like a small slide. a pokemon of your size won't have an issue passing though but, let's just say you won't be getting back out that way. However, with the terrain there, there may very well be more access points. Anyway, you may be wondering why I plan to send you there. Well, it's been reported that this cave is full of strange berries. My contact tried one, and well,he had a hard time getting back out through the small tunnel. When I say full however, I really mean full. who knows how long this place has gone untouched. From what I heard though, this is just the place you're going to want to visit if you want to join right away... buuut that's only one option. you could also play it safe and stick around town. I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty of food, and I could point you to some of our member's favorite places to eat\" Zaz explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal thought about his options. A cave exploration would certainly be allot more fun than just pigging out in town. Then again, he did mention that getting out would be difficult for him, so eating in town may be slower, but it would definitely be safer. Val decided to...</span></div></div>",

After he had a good idea of where he was going, Val focused on this list which displayed a number of different berries, each one saying something different about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Bulk Berries - These yellow berries are known to rapidly increase the weight of the individual who consumes them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wind Berries - These white berries contain chemicals that couple with the intestines, increasing gas production and causing the individual to fart more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Belch Berries - These blue berries contain chemicals that couple with the belly, increasing gas production there which tends to lead to more burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Persperant Berries - These light green berries contain chemicals that couple with your pours and increase your sweat production.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Cascade Berries - These light blue berries are known to increase the production of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Firm Berries - These berries contain chemicals that couple with your fat cells and toughen them up, making your flab more dense and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Bum Berries - These dark red berries are known to rapidly increase body weight and accumulate the same amount of fat as a Bulk Berry. However, all of the fat seems to be focused on the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Paunch Berries - These light purple berries are known to rapidly increase body weight and accumulate the same amount of fat as a Bulk Berry, However, all of the fat seems to focus on the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Giga Berries - These rare yellow and red polka dotted berries can actually increase the overall size of an individual by couple feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Appetite Berries - These orange berries increase your appetite and belly size, granting you the ability to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-  Boil Berries - These black berries increase your digestion rate as well as strengthen stomach acids, granting you the ability to dissolve otherwise undigestable things and at a faster rate, though your insides become quite a bit noisier and gassier after consuming food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Warning, all berry effects are permanent. All berry effects will stack so consume at your own discretion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, so many odd berries. Val wasn't quite sure what to make of them all, he wasn't even sure if he still wanted to go through with this. well, it was now or never. surely if he flew off now, he could escape from the city and any complications from ignoring the contract. Or, he could press on. he could see the cliff in the distance. It wouldn't be long now before he reached the point of no return. Val decides to... </span></div></div>",

They ate, and ate, and ate. Most of them started to sprout butt cheeks out of their once flat rears. Most of the Miltank were on two legs, which was odd for most of these Unovan cattle. She watched as their legs plumped up into large tree trunk-like appendages. Their udders expanded massively with their bellies as well, most of them held their udders/bellies with one fattened arm so they could reach down and eat the grass. Their asses shook and jiggled with each movement, so did the rest of them. They just didn't seem to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours they had gotten tired and sat down on their new massive asscheeks to rest, the largest was almost as big as a small car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybelle couldn't believe her eyes, this couldn't be right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden she heard the door creak and footsteps. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to eat one, but there was the possibility of him being punished. He would bring them back if they were good enough and would say something along the lines if 'testing if they were any good' or 'checking if they are poisonous'.

The amount was surprising for such a shriveled thing. Despite the looks and smell, it was actually very good. Good enough for more! The salandit started to pick more. He was almost in a frenzy. He rationalized it being the hunger, but he didn't know the berries actually made him do this. He also couldn't hold as much juice each berry had. It mostly spilled onto his chest from his teeth. It also gave him the smell of the berries, if not a stronger version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He didn't stop until there was only a handful left and with his belly on the floor. He was barely able to crawl. He was going to be in trouble, but wasn't going to disobey his superior completely. He gathered the rest and waddled back to the cave salazzle was in. He knew she would be tapping her fingers on the rocks as she waited for him, and he was right. She was laying on a flat rock with a couple salandits on her back massaging her. \"You are late, as usual, but you are fat and covered in something. Explain yourse-\" she sniffed and smelt the aroma on him as his legs shake nervously. She gets up and walks over to him.</span></div></div>",

There was a massive assembly line spanning miles from the Salazzle, Salandit passed down food as an offer to their queen, if they brought too little she would eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salazzle was massive, much too big to move, her hands had been sucked into mounds of fat that used to be  her arms, her legs were like thick sausages that had become longer than three Alolan Exeggutors.

Her gut was massive, it was round and blobby all at once, it was far bigger than any Wailord or Snorlax's combined. It had hit the ground and created earthquakes anytime it rumbled. But her biggest asset was her ass. It was massive.

He could be a farmer or yoga instructor, but he lets out the excess stress in fighting competitions, usually placing in the top three.

Pan was fighting a snorlax. He knew how to fight larger opponents, but this one was too beefy to damage. It was only slightly tubbier than other snorlaxes. Even still, one belly flop kept Pan from winning. He went to the nurse's office afterward for some chiropractic work only to see the snorlax and a hariyama duke it out on a monitor. Not only that, but the third place was given to an emboar. All three were fatter, beefy Pok\u00e9mon. They didn't even look in shape, sweating and smelling up the ring. Even some of the thinner novices looked like they were fattening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He wasn't going to let this slip away.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the days went by Mightyena kept on being fed more and more food from the tubes that led to the slob club. Her head was now slowly starting to sink into the ever growing ocean that was her body, she could only watch helplessly as her own grey flab rolls slowly began to rise over her head even more, now everything goes dark as the Mightyena's belly and butt begins to get soo big that they begin to press up against each other and have now sealed off all visible light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMightyena couldn't see anything anymore, the only thing that she could see now was her own cascading walls of flab all around her head, even if she could see, her eyes were now completely covered in flab now, her sweat now created waterfalls for the tiny people and pok\u00e8mon, the putrid smelling substance literally flooding entire cities, shortly after being steam rolled by an ever growing wall of grey forever being lost underneath an incredible amount of heavy Mightyena flab, but they were all safe because the wall of flab was very soft, but it did destroy buildings however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless countries looked up at the mass of grey that dominated the much of the sky above them, meanwhile, the Mightyena couldn't see anything, but she could definitely feel her belly and her butt push out and balloon bigger and bigger and she loved the feeling of more and more people, pok\u00e8mon, and buildings being flattened underneath the two as she sucked on the hose with a grin letting some of the food coat her flabby fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBrrrraaaaaaaaaaappppp\", the Mightyena's burp could be smelt and heard all over the world now, as for the glorious butt of this fantastic beast, the butt cheeks were so big soo immense, soo gigantic, soo absolutely titanic, that just one cheek could sit on one continent and the other one on another, cracks spread out from underneath the Mightyena's body in all directions due to her impossible ever increasing weight, her tail just like her head was now buried in flab just above those two sweat covered and smelly monolithic mountains and a chasm, that if she were at normal size would be call a buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mightyena at this point was now state sized and quickly being visible from space with a belly soo big that her breasts rise above the stratosphere, her bellybutton alone could hold an entire state in it now and still have room for more, her two grey monsters that were her buttcheeks were even bigger now, words could not describe the sheer immensity that those two rumbling, sweaty, jiggling, wobbly wonders that became of them, they rose   slightly below the stratosphere now, with her butt was seen all over the world now, with people looking up only to see a huge jiggling grey object that was on such a massive scale, that they were like dust mites to it, her buttcrack was so massive that it would take days to go from one buttcheek to the other buttcheek, however, with greater size comes even greater power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever the Mightyena farts, people all over the world need to sound air raid alarms  and try to evacuate everyone underground, but even that might not be safe enough to escape the blast and deadly poisonous clouds that follow, deep inside the mound of furry flab that has swallowed up the Mightyena's head Mightyena was still sucking on her food tube, her sweat and drool have created a lake in front of her face, she suddenly felt a very painful feeling in the very core of her titanous gut, \"uuuughh\" she moaned as the very Earth around her began to shake and tremble violently, she then heard a very loud noise, as she smiled and began to bask in the heavenly scent that could have only come from a well deserved meal finishing its journey in the form of putrid gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwile, sirens were blazing all over the world while people and pok\u00e8mon alike started to evacuate the area, all the while the whole planet began to tremble with such a force that it caused buildings to topple over, trees shaking, and mountains to have avalanches with rockslides, people and pok\u00e8mon could only watch and listen in horror as when they stared at those two globular monsters when the shaking stopped and all was quiet and calm again, a sudden terrible as well as deafening PPPPPPPPPBBBBBBBBBBTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT a visible greenish cloud blasted out of the Mightyena's massive and still growing buttcrack, the sheer power of the fart completely blew away clouds, demolished buildings into dust, uprooted numerous forests, and any people or pok\u00e8mon who couldn't find shelter whether it be underground or in a fallout shelter, were blown away by the thunderous blast, but at least they landed safely on Mightyena's ever growing sweaty flabby body, the smell was next to take hold of the poor planet, the green cloud replaced the atmosphere on the planet as it worked its way all over the planet, trees and plants started to wither and die, cities were now barren ghost towns, streets ran wild with the putrid green smog, mountains cracked, and finally the pure blue sky that was always there was replaced by a sickly green one that was poisonous to breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mightyena just kept on eating and eating eventually growing so big that now her butt was sitting with the Earth in between her buttcrack and both buttcheeks overflowing into space along with her gigantic flabby belly, her breasts are now bigger than the moon now in size and gently pushing it away the bigger she gets, Mightyena in the meanwhile was still in pure bliss, thankfully before she got too big the psychic pok\u00e8mon used psychic on the slob club and placed it on Mightyena's expanding body, now lost within the zillions of fat folds that now make up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people and pok\u00e8mon had to make a dire decision which was, to stay on the dying planet or to round everyone up and live forever on Mightyena's big sweaty and flabby body as their new planet, so the people decided to live on the Mightyena, they ordered the psychic pok\u00e8mon to collect the pok\u00e8mon and people underneath the Mightyena and bring them onto Mightyena's belly, once everyone was safely on the immeasurable Mightyena, they could only watch as their old home world continued to slowly shrink and disappear underneath the titanic pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMightyena eventually got big enouth to fit the whole planet in just her buttcrack, she then let out another mind bending PPPBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT that shook the planets to their cores, and she completely destroyed the Earth in the process, the Mightyena smiled from within her flesh prison, feeling all of those microscopic life forms moving around on the outside of her prison, the only thing for the Mightyena to do, especially now that she was her own planet, was to not let those tiny lifeforms down and keep giving them more and more land to live on by becoming an even bigger planet and more.</span></div></div>",

She'd be classed on the lightweights for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lightweights?\" She asked, \"Miss, my Braixen is around 180 pounds, that's very fat for a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to the other pokemon, she would be a lightweight.\" The woman claims, \"If we get her up to 600 pounds, we put her in the medium weights, with all the rest. If she gets lucky, and hits around a ton, she gets to be put in the heavy weights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this establishment is based solely off of fattening pokemon up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am! Would you like to sign her in? You get a few nights with her if you wanna see how this club works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fennik Girl sighs, signing her Braixen in, staring intensely at the trainer sign in sheet.</span></div></div>",

Beside her, sat her trainer, a young girl who...admittingly, has been gaining some weight ever since Delphox was added to her team. Her team was small and manageable, a Snorlax, a Gardevoir, and now a Delphox. The young girl lets out a burp, relaxing back, dangling her feet off of a 3 foot drop, Delphox couldn't help herself from finding her trainer just down-right adorable. With her stomach poking out of her ill-fitting shirt, her pigtails, and her face, which always seemed to have a food splotch on it, this Delphox would always smile. She helps her trainer up with Psychic after she finishes her training, and pats her on the head. Her trainer was just 8 inches shorter than her, making her even more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thank you so much!\" Her trainer praised Delphox, right before letting out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphox giggles, patting on her trainer's gut as they make their way back home.</span></div></div>",
