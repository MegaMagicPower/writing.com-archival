She has small semi-useless wings on her back, which are a sharp black contrast to her pale milky flesh. You can tell that she's still new to the job by her rather small 5' 4\" frame, her breasts are barely over an a-cup, and her hips are boyish at best. She wears rather conservative clothes for one of her species, a skirt that reaches down to just above her knees, and a white blouse with the sleeves cut off.<br>\r\nShe has a weakness for sweets and french pastries, she also loves to watch cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up is the lovely madame Petra.<br>\r\nShe's the oldest amongst the group here, at 2600 years of age.<br>\r\nLike most gorgons, she has snakes in her hair, and they have a life of their own, causing a bit of a problem when she washes them.<br>\r\nUnlike others of her kind, she's not a green-scaled creature, rather, she looks like a beautiful Greek woman, with snakes for hair. She takes after the fashion that she was so used to when she was first born, which is a simple white toga, but has taken to wearing sun-glasses to make sure that she does not petrify people accidentally.<br>\r\nHas a soft spot for lamb and feta cheese, and loves to mock people who come onto her with the phrase \"Do I make you hard?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her, there's Melonie the Lamia.<br>\r\nMel is the second oldest in the group at 2500 years.<br>\r\nPetra and her are good friends, since they have lived in the same town since she was born(or rather, hatched). Like Petra, she's a lovely greek woman, but unlike Petra, she doesn't have snakes in her hair, but rather, she has the lower body of a snake, which makes meeting people quite difficult for her. As for her hair, she has shiny brown hair, that she keeps shortly-cut(just barely below her chin-line)<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she has the upper-torso of a human, she is still cold-blooded, and tends to get overly lethargic when it's cold outside, even with her heaters turned onto full-blast, which has led to her constantly worrying about her ever thickening tail.<br>\r\nHas a liking for pork, and capybara, loves to curl up with a good book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there's Lucinda the vampress.<br>\r\nShe's the second youngest at 1900 years of age.<br>\r\nShe looks like your typical European goth, long black hair, a pale, almost white, skin, and black leather attire. She has a fondness for long skirts, halter-tops, and thigh-high boots.<br>\r\nUnlike most people who share her fondness for the night, and the colour black, she's actually rather friendly and doesn't obsess over blood or the darkness in her soul, in fact, she's actually quite warm.<br>\r\nBut don't let your guard down around her, because she uses her sweet personality as a way to lure her prey into a false-sense of secruity, before she pounces on them and drain them dry.<br>\r\nLoves horror-punk(stuff like the misfits) and ska music, and loves to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a brief description on the age and appearence of these gals.<br>\r\nOver a thousand years, they appear to age like a human would in one year, until their twenty-fifth thousand year, to which they stop aging.</span></div></div>",

Gosh darn it that freaking hurt! Why did you--!? Suzy opened her pale, violet eyes to the face of the man who pulled her back from the truck. He was a handsome man with dark brown eyes, gold flecks of brilliance spread unevenly throughout them. Suzy became instantly entranced by his dreamy eyes and her sentence slowly drifted into incoherent mumbling as she stared blatantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh! Excuse me ma'am...! But you sort of drove your knee into my...gentleman parts...\" He shifted painfully as he pushed your knee from between his legs. Suzy's cheeks flared to the color of roses as she became flustered with embarrassment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm....\" Melonie groaned, her face in her glass. She had been refused another date yet again. The guy must've been either grossed out by how she swallowed food whole, or by her long and thick serpent's tail. \"Why is it that all the good guys run away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender, a young woman of about 30 with gentle eyes, brown hair, was listening to her troubles. Melonie had known her for the last six years as possibly the best person to talk to. Rawlins was her name, she said. Rawlins always listened to Melonie and gave advice when need be. Today, she was just the audience in the empty pub. She was busy polishing a glass, her lean and muscular arms taking care to hold the brittle mug carefully. Melonie sighed and let her head hit the table, rattling the other mugs and glasses on the counter. \"I guess I'll never have any luck now...been doing the same thing for the past thousand years and I still can't get someone who isn't freaked out by me and isn't a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRawlins set the mug down, obviously done polishing as it glowed brightly in the warm light. It was highly unusual for a woman to run a pub, Melonie had said. Also, she had said, was how strange she dressed. Rawlins was clad in a tight tanktop, the collar sinking just below the neckline. She had skintight shorts, blue and slightly ripped, and wore odd socks with combat boots. She also had a weird hairstyle: her bangs were draping over her right eye, and it was let loose in a pineapple-reminiscent bunch at the back. Still, Melonie loved her like a sister, and spilled all her secrets to her. Rawlins simply listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any ideas, Rawlins?\" she asked, raising her head a little in false hope. Her heart was just about ready to cry itself out. Rawlins pulled out a cigarette and lit it, taking a small puff of the oddly potpourri-smelling stick before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Melonie,\" she said, in a drawling Southern accent, \"Ah reckon you should actually TELL people about your entire body first. Ah've known some people into really weird stuff that aren't complete jerks, idiots, or perverts. They would simply DIE to have someone like you, darlin'. You just have to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelonie sat up. Rawlins was right! She couldn't give up now. At this time, she remembered a war story Rawlins told her. Her platoon was outnumbered. Her tank was out of ammunition. And there were at least two heavies injured. She had pulled out her rifle, dubbed \"The Mediator\" for obvious reasons, and took out large encampments while her radioman phoned in for support. It went on for three days until they were able to be pulled out. Her situation was just like Rawlins' back then. \"All right! Thanks Rawlins!\" She was about to leave when she remembered the bill. \"Oh, sorry! How much do I owe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll just put it on yer tab, sweetie. Come back anytime ya need help.\" Rawlins waved Melonie out and watched the cheery lamia slither out into the night, whistling a happy tune. She turned to a computer behind the bar and ousted her cig. \"Well, Samsara, looks like we're in it for the long haul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Melonie got up and stretched, yawning loudly. Today was the day she was going to get a man! Taking a set of clothes with her and a towel, she hopped in her bath tub and twisted the knob all the war to hot. As she soaked in the steaming water, the phone rang. Irritated that her morning bath was interrupted, she slithered out and into the bedroom, picking up the phone and stopping its annoying ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Melonie Lamia residence, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The local night club was, as usual, packed with several dozen young party goers and glamor girls just enjoying the night life with the art of dance or drink. Either choice was a constant at these type of joints. At times though, the loud booming bass and clinks of martini glasses can zone someone out of there mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a victim of this drone was Lucinda, a rather drab and dark looking girl who was at the moment sitting on one of the several bar stools in the club. She had her eyes on a rather handsome martini mixer making all kinds of different maneuvers and tricks to really 'shake up' the martini mix. He was graced with luscious locks of blonde hair, blue eyes shining underneath the golden veil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mixer finished his concoction, Lucinda spoke to him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're really good at that...I wonder if those hands of yours are good at anything else, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixer looked in Lucinda's direction with a look of hubris, a glint of lust in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, you know. I get lots of practice...\u201d He let the sentence drag off, hoping to let Lucinda know he was getting the right idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucinda leaned in a bit to let the mixer get a good view of her decent cleavage, an average C cup. She trusted in her black lacy push up bra to enhance her bust even more to her advantage. The mixer almost instantly glanced down at her breasts, eyes widening a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Lucinda,\u201d stated the goth, wanting to get back the mixer's attention, \u201cWhats yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the look on the mixer's face, he was obviously having trouble getting his attention back enough to answer Lucinda's question. \u201cUhhh.... Oh! Um, heh, my name is Marcus, Marcus Walberg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus extended a hand to Lucinda, and she accepted it by placing his hand on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, your hand is so warm, Marcus...\u201d She gave a fake sigh of contentedness. Marcus just let Lucinda rub his hand, swallowing as she did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...uh...If you want, we could, ya know, ditch this place. I can easily get someone else to take the rest of my shift.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucinda could practically smell the lust on Marcus's heavy breathing. \u201cAre all mortals so easy to seduce these days?\u201d thought Lucinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she grasped Marcus's upper arm, softly rubbing back and forth on his goose-bump covered skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Marcus, you dog! We've barely talked for ten minutes and you want to sleep with me?\u201d said Lucinda with a mock expression of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, yeah! I mean, isn't that-\u201d Marcus was interrupted by Lucinda's finger covering his mouth in a flash. \u201cWhy didn't you ask sooner...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nearly melted right there as Lucinda softly spoke those words into his ear. His skin was tingling. He could hardly believe that this was happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen...lets go. Lets go right now.\u201d said Marcus in a hasty whisper. Lucinda smiled as they parted and exited the club and went out into streets of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHes as excited as I am...\u201d</i> thought  Lucinda with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rush, Lucinda and Marcus tumbled throughout the latter's apartment, each of them reaching for buttons or undoing belts of there clothes. The order does not matter, as they all found a place upon the cold hardwood floor, discarded and tangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could be said for the two lovers, who had descended upon Marcus's mattress, their bodies tangled together as Marcus moved his hands over Lucinda's sleek, pale body. They continued to move in a ever changing pattern of hot, passionate love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIts a shame I'm hungry tonight. This mortal is a good lover...\u201d.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and with it Marcus rising clad only in red boxers and a look of success on his smug face. He meandered into the kitchen, opening the fridge and pulling out an unopened carton of 2% milk. He took a deep swig of the white liquid, letting a bit dribble over his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lucinda came from behind him and stopped the milk drop from falling to the floor. She brought her finger to her lips and licked the milk from it, eyes staring right into Marcus's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning babe. Ya hungry? I can cook up some sausage for ya, if you get my meaning? Heh heh...\u201d said Marcus in a perverted manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes. I'm.....very hungry....\u201d said Lucinda as she crept up behind Marcus and wrapped her left arm around his chiseled stomach, her right being placed on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus cooed in arousal, the touch unknowingly dulling his senses. Lucinda's hand brought itself over Marcus's open mouth, causing a muffled response of confusion from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get a chance to finish though, as Lucinda plunged two large fags into his vein riddled neck, letting loose a torrent of red hot blood. Marcus's eyes widened with fear, and he tried desperately to cry for help, but he could not, as Lucinda's grasp was much too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucinda drank greedily, rivulets of blood flowing over her crimson lips. Marcus's leg muscles gave out suddenly, but Lucinda predicted this. She quickly knelt the now limp body of Marcus onto the kitchen floor, wasted blood dripping onto said floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly planted her lips onto the bite wounds once more, this time not stopping for anything. If someone were observing this event, they would see that Marcus's body was slowly turning into a husk of bones and skin and decayed organs. All Lucinda was after was his crimson juices, his life blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lucinda is a vampiress, an ancient hunter of the night. </span></div></div>",

Note that some are mortals so they have a shorter life span.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa the mermaid:<br>\r\nShe's just reached 19. (Mermaids live the same amount of time as humans). Melissa has a slender yet curvaceous body, a hot-looking face, blue eyes, bright blond hair, and if she measured herself, her measurements would be 35C-22-34 (in inches)(and for those who don't know how to ready women's measurements, the 35C is her bust, the 22 is the upper waist, and the 34 is the hips). She usually likes to pick large, orange seashells for her bra. And she, among her other merfolk companions, is unique because her fish scales turn from her ordinary blue to scarlet red when Melissa is horny, blushing, promiscuous, or when she spots a guy she likes. Her normal personality is moderately shy and curious when she's new to something, and sassy, thrill-seeking, and slightly naughty (mischievous) when she is at home. She loves eating shark fins, blue crabs, and some other rare and genuine seafood. She cannot taste bitter with her tongue and she is slightly less sensitive to salty foods since she is very much used to being in salty ocean water for almost all her life. BUT, she CAN taste sweet, spicy, sour, and tungish (a kind of taste humans don't have). Though she still doesn't know what her favorite type of human food yet bcuz she still hasn't met any humans yet. She also doesn't have a favorite music since sound is very much dull and soundless underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie the sphinx:<br>\r\nShe is a young, 235 year old daughter among her rare legendary family of sphinxes. She is smart, bright, magically telepathic, and wise but also slightly curious sometimes. Unlike a layout of a centaur, Stephanie (a sphinx) appears as a shapely golden-colored ___(lion,  with a beautiful, human head: starting from the upper stomach of the woman half(right under her perfectly round breasts), the rest of her body turns into a lower torso of a lion covered in short golden body fur with full, round glutius maximuses (butt cheeks, if you don't mind). Even though her upper body is of a woman which bends upwards from her horizontal lion body, her forearms are the front legs and paws of a lion. Since her front legs are connected to her shoulders (not where the belly of the woman half would be), her arms (front legs) are longer to match with her shorter hind legs. She has a She has an interestingly carnivorous appetite for humans though. She lures them to her with a melodious, wordless song. Because she is a playful sphinx, she ALWAYS gives her human prey a chance to live by offering a riddle to her prey. If they answer wrong, she does what ever she pleases. And if they answer the riddle correctly, she can either spare them, or offer herself to them. For some reason, all sphinxes love to riddle her prey. Besides humans being her prey, she also has a large appetite for large or small animals. Especially female mammals that lactate, as she simply LOVES milk since she is half feline. Although smart, she is still young and has not enjoyed or explored human cultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen the centaur:<br>\r\nCarmen is a promiscuous and picky centauress in her large tribe of centaur. Many Centaurs hit on her, but she either pays no attention to them or just passes it on with a  casual thanks. She is 26 (centaurs live slightly longer than humans), she has long, brown, wavy hair that flows down the small of her back, and has dark brown eyes. Undoubtly seductive, she approaches things in an outgoing way relentlessly. Being the sexy centauress she is, she towers over humans at 8'6 (average centaur height since centaurs have those horse legs). This horse half of her body has a brightly brownish-tan color and her upper human body is moderately tanned. The color on her legs fade away to a light tannish color as they reach down to her hooves. She loves almost anything with hazelnut and cinnamon in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlessandra the archangel:<br>\r\nShe is a young, 38 year old archangel who died an early age at 23. She swiftly advanced up heaven's social ladder from a common spirit to an archangel in 15 years with her stunning beauty. But still, she is kind and caring of older angels beneath her. Although her is now a holy being, she is stained with sexual fetishes like her human self. Alessandra has ultra bright, shiny, silky blond hair and a very cute face who many people on earth and heaven can't keep themselves from staring. She's too innocent to notice their staring but is conscious of her own beauty. She loves R&amp;B, light modern rock, electronica, and some other sub-genres. And of corse, she likes anything sweet and fancy-looking.</span></div></div>",

Unlike all of those other dragons read in fantasy stories, this 200 ft (minus the tail) dragon had a different form: bipedal and had a humanoid appearance. Red scales, with a yellow leathery underbelly, layered the dragon and had a bit of potbelly on it; a sign of its appetite. It's big, meaty tail rivaled the 226 year old being's height and the creature was feminine, due to its massive breasts it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"urp!,\" the dragon belches before fully waking up.

She essentially has the form of a normal human female albeit a little shorter than most, the only thing different about her is the pair of crumpled rabbit ears she bears on top of her, brunette colored head, and although they look false what with them having buttons on the side of them, her ears are quite real and are attached to her head. Her chest is relatively average in size (about a C cup), her hips on the other hand are wide and curvacious. Romi even has a cute cotton tail, as well. Her attire is somewhat odd, consisting of a black blazer with a dress shirt under neath and a long blue dress. Sh wears a pendent on the right side of her blazer and claims that all bunnies from the moon wear one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality wise, she is rather spacey and often day dreams alot, mostly about humans and what they do. However, when it all comes down to it, she's not that bad of a bunny, just a bit difficult to understand at times what with her odd observations and such. Romi's favorite food is carrots but she'll also indulge in sweets as well. Self concious about her figure and will easily become embarrased if it is the subject of certain conversations.

She is of a human female shape, and is of average size as well. Orika's hair color is a strange pale purple, with two horns jutting from the side of her head. She is rather curvy and has volumptous breasts that push the D cup limit as well as shapely hips and thighs to balance out the weight of her ample bosom. She has a long bushy tail that is the same color as her hair. Orika chooses to wear a simple turtle neck sweater, with a jumper dress covering the rest. Also wears glasses, and claims to be blind without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrika is a motherly beast woman, having been told that humans rely on Bai Ze, and thus she strives to take care of them and keep them happy. Case in point, Orika is compassionate and kind hearted, thinking of others before thinking of herself. Orika is an avid book reader and often likes to read during her spare time than anything else, music for her has to be soothing and calm, anything loud seems to distress her and causes her to lose her concentration.</span></div></div>",

She is very obese with a large belly and D-cup breasts, but her weight mainly goes to her large butt. She mainly wears a black bikini with a turquoise sari-like skirt and a pair of pink heart-shaped sunglasses that are usually placed atop her head. Due to having talons, she never wears shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Anemone is slightly rough around the edges and very short-tempered and stubborn at times. This makes her quick to get into arguments with people who she believes antagonized her. Nothing angers her more than being made fun of for her weight. However, as a gargoyle, she has a natural instinct to defend people from harm and confront the forces of evil. She especially has a soft spot for children. She lives with her human boyfriend Carlos in Malibu. The two of them get along well most of the time but Anemone likes to remind her boyfriend who\u2019s the boss, mainly by sitting on him. She is also a very gluttonous gargoyle with a weakness for hot wings and ice cream. Her favorite pastime is surfing, even though she needs to surf using two boards because of how big she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Anemone is the second oldest of 4 sisters, all of which are as big as she is. When gargoyles started to integrate into human society, Anemone and her sisters; Fuchsia, Autumn and Snowflake moved to different areas in the United States. Anemone moved to Malibu and met her boyfriend, Carlos when she accidentally sat on him at a train station. Carlos agreed to allow Anemone to live with him as Malibu got used to a gargoyle walking around and not long afterwards they begun to date, usually by frequently a popular beach grill that specializes in fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Being a gargoyle, Anemone is inhumanly strong, being able to lift 100 times her own weight (which is saying something given how enormous she is) and being a nocturnal creature, her eyes glow bright red in the dark. Anemone's claws are sharp enough to cut through solid steel. In spite of her large weight, she is fully capable of flight at the speed of a falcon. Due to living on the beach, she is also adept at swimming and diving and can hold her breath underwater for a long time.</span></div></div>",

However, there were two young lovers already awake in their house on the water in Malibu Beach. It was a 3-level house built directly on a rocky jetty overlooking the sea. The inhabitants of the house were a very unusual couple and not just because they were an unmarried couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakening in bed at that time was a young tan-skinned man in his early 20s with spiky black hair and green eyes. This was Carlos and he let out a yawn as he looked at the alarm clock. He then looked back to see that he was the only one in bed. \"Look's like Anemone is already up as usual,\" said the young man as he got out of bed. \"And I think I know where she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos was of course referring to his live-in girlfriend, Anemone who at the moment was listening to the radio as she was busy cooking pancakes for breakfast. Anemone however, was not an ordinary young woman. She was in fact a 10' 11\" gargoyle. She had light blue-skin like water with leather wings that had red-violet membranes and long black hair that she wore with tropical wildflowers stuck in it. She was also absolutely massive with large breasts, a huge stomach and a titanic butt that was wider than she was tall. This was because Anemone was a very big eater and woke up early to get breakfast ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos descended downstairs and saw the gargoyle girl's tail wagging as she was working the frying pan. \"I should've known by now, Anemone,\" said Carlos. \"One of these days, Greenpeace is going to haul you out into the ocean.\" Anemone glares and smirks at her boyfriend as she flips another pancake. \"Ha-ha,\" she said sarcastically. \"Very funny, Carlos. Keep up those fat jokes and I'll wrap you up in pita bread and swallow you.\" \"I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Sheesh. I thought gargoyles were supposed to be hard-skinned.\" Anemone gave a laugh before she got both her breakfast and her boyfriend's breakfast ready and placed the pancakes on the table before sitting her huge butt down into three chairs at once and digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the radio was broadcasting a news announcement. \"It has been exactly 6 months since gargoyles have integrated into human society. Though certain speciesist groups have attempted to discourage interspecies relationships, these hate groups have been for the most part detained with only a few of these radicals still active. Fortunately these lowlifes are contained in the South West and it is only a matter of time before their capture. In other news, New York's largest corporation's future is uncertain after the untimely murder of their CEO.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos walked over and then turned off the radio. \"It's really been 6 months, hasn't it. Until that point, I had no idea that gargoyles were real and yet there you are.\" Anemone gave a scoff as she downed five pancakes at once. \"I'll bet you also thought we couldn't come out in the day didn't you?\" Anemone then downed some orange juice before letting out a thunderous belch, forcing Carlos to plug his ears. He let out a sigh and then decided to start eating his breakfast while Anemone still had some of her own to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos was used to Anemone\u2019s big appetite and explosive burping by now. The two of them had been dating for a while and they got along fine. Although, when Anemone wanted to remind Carlos who was in charge of the relationship (usually after Carlos had made fun of her weight) the enormous gargoyle would sit her huge behind down on him. That was actually how they met. Carlos was waiting for a subway train one night when Anemone came in and since she was listening to her iPod, the big gargoyle was so oblivious that her bench-sized butt came now and plastered Carlos to her backside. She didn't notice he was stuck to her until she reached her stop. It wasn't long before they became boyfriend and girlfriend and moved to Malibu. Malibu was the perfect place for them because they were both avid surfers. Of course, Anemone was so big and fat that she had to tie two surfboards together in order to hit the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present day, Anemone let out another belch, having finished her breakfast before Carlos could finish one pancake. The gargoyle girl tapped her enormous belly before picking her teeth with her sharp claws. \"For crying out loud, Anemone,\" said Carlos. \"I've seen hippopotamuses that ate less than half you eat.\" Anemone gave a scoff. \"I could eat an entire hippopotamus in one sitting if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the telephone rang and Anemone walked up to answer it. Carlos couldn't help but laugh because Anemone had three seat cushions plastered to her big rear. But then he stopped himself to avoid angering his gargoyle girlfriend. That didn't stop him from staring though as it was his favorite part of Anemone that he was looking at. The gargoyle folded her wings into a cape as she talked on the phone and then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that on the phone, Anemone?\" asked Carlos.</span></div></div>",

And I was planning to go sailing later.\u201d As Carlos ran downstairs, he heard the sound of a vacuum cleaner and sure enough, Anemone was cleaning the house, at one point stopping only to pull her sari out of the nozzle. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Carlos. \u201cThis must be serious. The only thing I\u2019ve ever seen Anemone clean is her plate.
