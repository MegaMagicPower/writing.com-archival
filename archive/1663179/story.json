You remember the Book of Peace from the movie? It was an all powerful book that when open would bring lasting to peace to whatever land it was held in. Lovely artifact isn't? However, there was a twin to this book, something soo powerfull and dangerous the gods casted it out of their world and into the void of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was called the Book of Chaos. This book was the exact opposite of its twin the Book of Peace. It was never meant to be opened. Its power and danger made many wonder why such a thing was ever made. In fact the gods themselves had no idea why or how or who could have made the book. So away it went into the void never to harm anyone... Or so they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The gods knew nothing of the book. So, could not have known that it had mind of its own, or that going into space was exactlly what it wanted. They could not have known the evil book would travel the multiverse collecting information on the worst monsters that ever lived, the heros, the worlds, and the powers. They did not know what they had done. They allowed the Book of Chaos to travel the multiverse and do all the things mentioned. And finally it found its way to a small young planet, where the humans in their foolish pride had thrown out magic in the name of science and there by did not believe a book could cause destruction. Yes, here the book could stay without problems, here it could find a host to help it destroy. Here it could find someone to open it... 2010 Earth would be its new 'play ground.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man walked down a side street in Japan late that night. You wouldn't know it by looking at him, but Aaron Hicks was a blood thursty murder. He was happiest when he was guning someone down. He's monsterous love didn't match his good-looking boyish face and heart throb charm. He had moved to Japan 5 years ago to escape the Law after he kill 3 women, 5 men, and an unknown number of animals in a brutal massicure in New York. He was not a human. He showed no compasion for those he killed or guilt. He was soulless. He continued to kill when he got to Japan. The Underworld of both Japan and the USA had heard of him. He was the only man who could make hardened Gang and Yakuza members tremble in fear at his name. He was as smart as he was sick minded. When he found out who ratted him out to police in the American, after he went to Japan before he told anyone he was there he had the man brought to Tokyo under the ruse of a radio contest price. When the man got to Tokyo, Aaron caught him, tourtured him for 3 weeks and killed him. To make sure no one would cross him again Aaron took picture of everthing he'd done to his captive and sent them to every criminal orginazion in Japan and American with ethe meassge: \"Leave me alone and you won't see me when you wake up tomorrow.\" The meassge was audio recorded so the crime bosses could hear that Aaron had no fear over what he did. Since then, Aaron had killed almost 100 people. To cover his tracks he destroyed the bodies with acids and fire. Now tonight he was on the hunt for a new victum, someone easy that no one would miss, someone like that occult store owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The owner was keeping the store open a bit longer, business had been great that day and even though it was already 11:00 PM his last customers had only left 15 minutes ago. It was a clear night the owner was happy with the huge pay he got from silly school girls buying useless books about fortune telling and love potions, and the man that walked into his shop had a hansom boyish face with a happy and cheerfull smile. The owner had no reason to think this young man was going to end his life in the shore he was soo proud of, but then none of Aaron's victums ever thought that before he killed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aaron walk into the store with a happy smile on his face and his left hand on the gun in his pocket. The owner walked up to him also smiling. \"Hello, and welcome customer. How may I help you this beautiful night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I was just in town for a bit and I heard that this place sell some interesting artifacts. Well, I just had to come down and have a look.\"<br>\r\n \"Delightfull. Now was there something you wanted to find or are you just looking around?\"<br>\r\n \"What do you recomend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The owner began showing Aaron all the different things he had around the shop from spell books to fortune tell, and cursed items to magic charms. Aaron was only half listening. This was part of his sick game, he let the owner talk about his wonderful collection all the while Aaron had the gun pointed at the man's back ready to fire. He waited till the owner was happieat then he would do it. Finally the owner brought Aaron to a glass case. Aaron was ready this was the old man's last breath. Aaron amided through his pocket at the man's back move to pulled the chrigger and...Aaron let go of the gun and did not kill the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aaron had glanced at the book inside the glass case. It was black with all kinds of symbols on it Aaron had never seem before. For some reason when he saw it Aaron knew he wanted it. And just like that a simple black was in Aaron's hands as he left the store. The owner was one book less and $50,000 dollars richer, and though he didn't know it, he was alive thanks to that book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Aaron walked down the street back home, another young man named Alex Sullivan was on a plane heading to Japan. They didn't know it yet but these 2 would shape the fate of many worlds when they meet.</span></div></div>",

The Book Of Chaos slowly possessed him and gave him all he needed to know to carry out his new goal...death to everything. As he was reading the book changed his hair white and eyes to a horrible blood red color. So, the most powerful force of destruction in the universe is in the hands of a murderous psycho. Don't you feel safe? But relax, something that powerfull can't get away without someone finding out, or someones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Alex Sullivan ran through town on a bright Saturday morning with friends John and Bill close behind. They were extatic, after three years of saving money these 20 year old American anime freaks had finally gotten enough money to go to an anime convention in Tokyo Japan, the birth place and capitol of the anime world. Finally, they reached the Tokyo convention center. They smiled as they ran inside. However, just behind them was a man dressed in black robes with blood red eyes and white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  None of the players so far could have known that when the book as opened a pulse of negetive energy flew through reality traveling faster than thought. It past every world in existence warning all of creation that the Bringer of Chaos was coming. Only the most powerful beings could feel the pulse, that is how 2 young warriors would be called into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just outside the village of Konoha in the Land of Fire, there lay a forest of mighty trees peaceful and calm. A young woman with red hair jumped through the tree branches smiling away as she was chased by man of her age with light brown hair also smiling. They ran around for 15 minutes until the man snuck up behind the woman and grabbed her as she landed on a hill in a loving hug as she giggled in surprize. \"You can't get away that easily my dear,\" said the man kissing her on the cheek. \"Oh, yeah? I bet I can take you.\" She said with a devious smile. She grabbed the man's arms and fell backwards causing both to roll to the bottom of the hill. At the bottom they both laughed and looked into each other's eyes nearing a loving kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, the dark pulse hit both of them and they froze. The man was the first to react. He jumped to his feet, ready for battle, as he looked around for the sorce of the pulse. \"Darkly, what was that?\" The woman asked with terror. She and her lover Darkly had battled powerful foes before but this energy was different, powerful, evil, and almost omnipotent. \"Yuna, I don't know but it came from Earth.\" \"What?!\" Yuna cried in alarm. \"This is bad. I'm going there with Ryu. I'll be back soon\" And Darkly vanished. Yuna looked at the spot where Jack Mist Darkly was standing only seconds ago. She knew he would return but she was still worried. \"Be careful my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Darkly ran through the woods twords his house. As he ran he was joined by a black haired ninja runing along side him. \"So you felt it too?\" Darkly asked. The other ninja nodded. \"Ok, lets go!\" And so the ninja guardiens J.M. Darkly and Black Pyro rushed to Darkly's house grabbed Darkly's reality gem and used it to travel to Earth, where they knew a difficult fight lay ahead of them. As they did Alex and his friends walked to the coplayer's booth, as did Aaron. The fated journey is about to begin.</span></div></div>",

There a chance that it could mess up the natural order of thing there.\" Ryu said to Darkly revealing his demonic and angelic wings. He flew alongside Darkly whom was jumping from roof top to roof top<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not the one to use those black flames of yours to save that child from that tree. What was I supposed to say? That you're the child of the devil. Some may challenge because they think it could be some sort of nickname. Point is, you disturbed it enough. No need to make it worse.\" Darkly said laughing a bit. Ryu thought about for a while and sighed before admitting that Darkly was right and that it could of been worse.Ryu knew it was going to a difficult and long fight ahead of them. There was no telling what would ahead of them. It was relatively peaceful now but it's just a calm before the storm. Ryu decided he might as well have his weapon ready. He rolled up his sleeve. Blood seep out of his skin but it had a metallic quality in it. The blood began gathering in his hand and started to take shape. A second later it solidified took the shape of sword, not too much unlike Genesis's from FFVII Crisis Core.  Ryu looked at Darkly. They arrived at the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me...\" Ryu said. They noted that it was a Japanese Anime Convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. At least we don't have to sneak in there. We can practically walk right in and everyone will think we're cos-players too.\" Darkly said. Ryu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a big place though. How do we go about doing this? Should we split and cover the ground twice as fast or stick search the place together so we can cover the area better? Kinda like quantity vs. quality.</span></div></div>",

Ryu casually walked through the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;This is gonna be impossible. These human get way too into this. It's gonna hard as hell to find someone who actually looks like a menace.&gt; he thought as he passed by convincing Sephiroths, Virgels, ect. As well a couple semi-convincing Tifas and Aeriths. He smirked to himself knowing that he's one of the few people who that live in this world that know the actual Aerith and Tifa. The hair on Ryu's neck stood up.. &lt;He's close...&gt; Ryu used only his eyes to look. Using fake curiosity to disguise his intentions. He tense something was about to attack. He glanced to left and gasped when he sense the attack coming from the right. </span></div></div>",

It was like the master had released the chains holding it back and it was now engulfing the entire area and beyond. Even as he stood there shaking, Ryu could not tell where it started and where it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, a new presence sprang to life. It came from Ryu's right. Though no where near the strength of the first sign it was still powerful...And moveing fast. Ryu turned and had just enough time to see a man in a blood red coat jump at him with a equally red sword held high. \"Genesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the other side of the grounds Ninja Master J M Darkly also felt the huge jump in power. He ran for the central building of the convention center where he last senced the origin of the evil power. Moving fast Darkly noticed that while the people around him could not feel shifts in reality like he did they did notice that something bad was about to happen. All around him he saw looks of confusion, worry, and down right agitation on their faces. However, as he ran he felt chakra spring to life and saw Zabuza jump out of the crowd right at him...</span></div></div>",

Last thing he remembered was laying down to sleep while watching old episodes of Fairy Tail. He was now alone in the strangely quiet woods. Quiet that wasn't ti last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"ROAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The trees and even the air shook with an unearthly roar. Alex was forced to hold his ears, the roar was so loud. It was followed by an equally thunderous explosion, and he saw the telltale rising cloud of the blast not far from him. Another roar, this one sounding more like pain than challenge, and the ground shook as something massive seemed to crash down. Before Alex could run, the tree line near him exploded and something massive came tumbling head over heels into his path, stopping in a heap against a large boulder on the path. As the dust cleared, Alex's eyes widened in a mix of fear and pure wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before him was a massive dragon the size of a hill. Sparkling purple and gold scales ran over its body, its large bat-like wings held all the colors of the rainbow. It turned its head slowly to look at Alex and he saw its ancient and wise icy blue eyes. It was beautiful, there was no doubt of that. Majestic and grand, everything one would expect from a dragon...Save for the fear and pain in its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dragon tried sitting up to growl at him, but only shivered slightly and fell back down, its right front leg broken and bent at an odd angle. As Alex looked for closely, he saw the poor creature was covered in other, much more serious injuries. Dark red blood leaked from horrible gashes across its sides and chest, its right wing was hanging slightly, the membranes ripped and shredded. To his horror, Alex saw a large bloody gap on the dragon's back, where one of its spinal ridges had clearly been ripped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dragon seemed to notice the look of pain and sympathy Alex was making, and became less threatening. That was, until a man walked out of the bushes from the direction the dragon had come. A tall man, covered in a green cloak and holding an iron staff with a great red ruby in the top. The man smiled at Alex as he walked into view, and bowed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello there.\" The man said, cheery and pleasant. \"Sorry for the sudden scare. Just doing a bit of bounty hunting at the moment. Just stand back and finish this up.\" He raised his staff at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (What does Alex do?)</span></div></div>",

Sitting there in basement of this friend, Eric's, house was some kind portal. The space age looking platform on the floor seemed to be the cause of the pulsating rift in the fabric of reality. Alex, lost for words, just continued stareing while Eric chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You believe me now?\" Eric asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alex just knodded. Two hours ago Eric had barged into Alex's house shouting about having unlocked the door way to alternate realities, other dimentions. Alex ofcourse didn't believe him at first and said: \"Prove it. If you can show me you're telling the truth I'll be the labrat for whatever experiment you want to run.\" So, two hours later Alex found himself about to eat his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alex slump to the floor in shock. \"How did you do this? Its not possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh really? Well it looks like I proved that wrong...Again.\" If Eric had been anymore pleased with himself, his face would have split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So,\" Alex said slowly. \"What are you going to do with it? Hand it to the government? I bet you'd be set for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No.\" Eric said flatly. \"This device has limetless potental. Both for good and bad. I won't let others deside which is right.\" He looked down for a moment then turned to Alex with his smile renewed. \"Besides wouldn't it be more fun for you and me to find out where it leads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What, you want me to go through there?\" Alex crossed his arms in protest. \"You have no idea what's on the other side. For all you know you could be sending me into the void of space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No. You see I already sent probs through. There is a breathable atmosphere and gravity on the other end. No known danger at this time. And didn't you say you'd do any experiment I asked if proved this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Damn, Alex thought. He got me there. Alex stood and looked the portal over. There was nothing visible on the other end. Just a strange light kinda like a ray of sunlight at the end of a long tunnel. Dispite Alex's fears, something in him sturred at the sight of this portal. Its possiblities of exploration, adventure, it was exsiting. And he would be the first to explore it. He felt like the hero in one of his anime shows, a young man standing on the edge of greatness, only held back by his own fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But, would they have let that stop them? Would Naruto let fear stop him? Would Ichigo? No. They would charge headlong into the unknown if it meant furthering their causes. And now so would Alex. All his life he'd dreampt of the chance to do great things like his cartooned heroes, and was not about to let fear stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright,\" Alex said, standing to his full height and smiling at Eric. \"Let get started.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Michael walked home after another long day at school. As usual Eric and the other boys spent the whole day making fun of Michael for his silver hair and eyes. As if that wasn't bad enough the girls lead by Jeanie felt the need to kick him while he was down by teasing him about being only 5 feet tall. It just wasn't fair Michael thought. It wasn't his fault he was born with permanitly dyed hair or that the avereged height girls had to tilt their head's down to tease him about being short. It just wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Michael entered his house in a bad mood (no kinding). His mom and dad were still at work and wouidn't be back for a few hours. So, as an only child Michael had the house to himself, complete privacy to feel horrible in. He flung him back pack into the air chair in the living room and grabbed a snack from the kitchen, an apple and juice, and walked back into the living room. He sat on the couch and turned on the TV. He flipped to Cartoon Network, Pokemon was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This put smile on Michael's face. He loved the original season of the show and it just so happened that \"CN\" was playing a marathon of season 1 episodes that day. The episode when Pallet Town celebrates Ash placeing 16th in the Pokemon League was half way through so Michael watched the rest. As the episode ended Michael finished his snack, threw out the trash and ran to the bathroom. He came out just as the next episode began. But as he sat down the TV screen began to screech while the picture was flickering. \"Oh man. Come on.\" Michael said as he smacked the TV remote. Unfortunatly, this did not work and the TV finally went staticy and the sound was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great,\" Said Michael. But just as he was about to get up to call the repair man the screen flickered back into a picture and sound returned. However, Michael did not see Ash prepairing for a new adventure. Instead he saw Mewtwo strapped to a strange machine in a lab that looked vagely like the one he was born in. Mewtwo looked to be in pain as if he was trying to fight something back but was slowly loseing the fight. Michael looked at the screen confused, he had never seen an episode like this before. Maybe it was a new one they brought out to try and boost rateings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, Team Rocket's boss Giovanni walk on the screen, but he looked alot older than he did in the show. Michael was wondering what was happening when Giovanni spoke. \"So, Mewtwo, we finally meet again. You know it took me along time to find you. I wasn't too sharp back then but it seem I've gotten quite sly in me old age.\" He paused to look at the captured pokemon with a smile while Mewtwo just glared at it's old master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll escape soon.\" Mewtwo said with hate in it's voice. \"NO you won't.\" said Giovanni. \"The machine you're hooked up to is serpresing your powers and slowly binding your mind to my will. You will not escap me this time. For 10 years I've searched for you and now finally you are mine.\" Giovanni finished gloating watched as the world's most powerful pokemon was slowly being broken for him. Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All at once the machines around the lab started going crazy. Alarms of all kinds went off. Giovanni looked around in panic. \" What are you doing?\" the Rocket boss cried. Mewtwo lifted his head up to reveal glowing blue eyes and an evil smirk on his face. \"You're right Human. I can't break out with my  powers but I can still put a curse on you. One that even I can't not break. You enjoy being big man on campus well lets see how you like being 3 inches tall! With the last of my free will I curse you Giovanni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Mewtwo cried out the blue glow in his eyes became a violent blue light that swallowed everything in the lab. Michael watched in horror as the light came out of his TV and covered him. He felt a force grab him from behind and push him foreward with amazeing speed. Michael blacked out and knew no more.</span></div></div>",

As his vision cleared the first thing he saw was his gloved hand over his eyes. This took him aback for a moment for he didn't remember putting on gloves. He then looked at the rest of his body and jumped in shock. He was wearing a black and white verson of Ash Ketchum's original outfit from when he first started his pokemon adventure. If that made him jump then what he saw next made him leap out of his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Michael looked around the area to see a forest all around him. And not just any forest this forest was huge! The flowers towered over his head like trees. The trees themselves were like giant wood covered mountains. Michael shivered at the thought of what kind of animals might live in a forest this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just when he thought he couldn't be anymore shocked Michael turned to see a giant bycicle sat upon by a giant female. He looked up into the face of this giantess as she reached down for him.</span></div></div>",

Feelings of fear erupted in him as he went higher, mostly from the fact that he had no idea what she was going to do to him. When he reached eye level the giantess opened her hand allowing Michael to sit in her palm. Working up his courage Michael looked into the giantess' eyes...and was in awe of her size and the fact that he reconized her. Looking back at him with a look of consern and curiousity was Misty, the Cerulean City Gym leader of the Pokemon world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Misty looked over the tiny boy to make sure he was ok. She could easily see the wonder in his eyes as he looked up at her...and the fear. So she tried her best to look non-threatning as waited for him to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Michael relaxed alittle as it became clear Misty wasn't about to hurt him. As the shock wore off he began noticing things about this Misty that were alittle compared to the one he was use to seeing. She was no longer wearing her hair in a ponytail, it was now hanging down to her neck. Her short-shorts had been replaced by a pair of jeans and she was wearing a light blue jacket over her signiture yellow sleevless top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  However, her most drastic change was the fact that she looked a whole ten years older now than she did in the show. Michael could see that she was easily in her early 20's, and, he blushed to think about it, she had matured quite well physically. She was easily an equal or greater beauty compared to her sisters now. (Not that she wasn't before.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At the moment they were at a stailmate, neither wanting to make the first move, and both worried about spooking each other...</span></div></div>",

He must have blacked out for a moment cause he didn't remember hitting the ground. He also felt werid, like something wasn't right, something to do with his body. He waited for his mind to clear before getting up, he didn't trust his legs yet. Thats when he realized something horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The world around him was gigantic. The trees, buildings, and even some flowers now towered above him. Tsukune figured he was about 3 inches high. Panic slowly set in as he realized the implictions of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tsukune went to Yokai Academy, a school for monsters to learn how to interact with the human world in peaceful coexistence. That being said, any human who entered the academy was to be killed on sight, or so the rules made by Yokai's insane founder stated. Thus, at his normal height Tsukune had plenty to fear at the school. Now, he was 3 inches tall, no more than a bite size snack. He was a little scared now. Tsukune turned wildly and tried runner off to the direction of the Newspaper club, when he smacked into something and fell back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up Tsukune found a woman his own size staring at him with a toothy smile. She wore a Yokai girls' uniform and had red tied back into a pony tail near the top of her head. Her saphire blue eyes held a look of amusement as she looked him over. Tsukune vaguly remembered seeing her around the school once or twice, never having talked to her before. She suddenly bent down and offered her hand for him to grab. He hesitated, then took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks,\" he said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem.\" She smiled back cheerfully then added, \"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do y-,\" was all Tsukune could say before the girl suddenly jumped into the air with a death grip on Tsukune's hand as she pulled him along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tsukune screamed in terror as he found himself soring over the buildings before landing on the roof of the main campus building, the one he and Moka often relaxed on after lunch. After landing, the girl let go of Tsukune's hand, who then backed up slowly away from her, fist up ready to fight. Nearly two years at this school had prepared Tsukune for many challenges. This girl had suddenly appeared and kidnapped him, she may even be the one who shrunk him. He didn't known if he could take her, but he did have a few skills that could help. The girl just looked at him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you doing?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why did you bring me here?\" Tsukune asked seriously. He felt the familar rush of strength as Moka's Vampire blood began to awaken in his veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"To keep you safe, ofcourse.\" She walked closer to him arms at her sides. \"This is a very dangerous place for you at this size. Don't you think, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tsukune's breath caught in his throat. She knew what he was. Did that mean she'd done this to eat him herself. Or was she making it easier for others to get him? He wasn't about to find out. Tsukune let the Vampire blood fuel him as he punched at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With lighting speed the girl knocked his punch to the side after hitting his wrist. Shocked, Tsukune tried again. He punched at her only for her to grab his fist. He winced slightly as her grip seemed to be slowly crushing his hand. She let go by throwing his hand back at him causeing him to stumble. Thinking quickly, Tsukune kicked at her but that didn't work either as she simply ducked under his foot and charged straight at him. Tsukune saw her attack but was off balance from his own and was unable to counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a crazed smile the girl stopped inches away from Tsukune's face and delivered three quick strikes to his chest and stomach, knocking the wind out of him and forceing him to the ground. As he lay there gasping for breath, the girl lowered herslef on him while pining his arms to the ground. Breathless and with no levreage, Tsukune was trapped by this new and very scary girl. While under her, Tsukune couldn't help but notice the girl's beauty or her well endowed body. She saw him looking at her breasts and smiled fox like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You'll have to try alot harder than that if you want me, Mr. Aono.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wasn't trying to...you got the wrong idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, whatever. Now as to the question that I know you want to ask, yes I know you're a human. I've known since you first came to this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\" he looked her in the eye, more questions forming. \"Why did you wait til now to attack me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl removed herself from Tsukune and stood up. \"This is not an attack, Tsukune. If you remember you are the one who attacked me. I was just moving you to a safer location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rising to his feet Tsukune looked at her confused. \"Then, why did you shrink me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I didn't do that either.\" She dusted herself off. \"I just shrunk myself so we could talk face to face. If I wanted to harm you, I'd just attack you at normal height.\" She looked at him with sly eyes. \"You can't say that it wouldn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Given that their fight just now showed she was more than a capable fighter (maybe as good as inner Moka) Tsukune had to admit that the idea of her meaning him harm and being the one responcible for his current problem was seeming rather silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok,\" he said slowly, still not sure about her, \"then who are you? And what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She bowed a little, though never letting her eyes leave his face. \"My name is Marya Firehart. 2nd year student at Yokai Academy. And what I want is to help you through a rather tough ordeal you must now face, Tsukune. The person who shrunk you fully intends to kill both you and your friend, Moka Akashiya...\"</span></div></div>",

He looked forward to a night of binge-watching his favorite anime, Yo-kai Watch - a slice-of-life anime involving the mischief of spirit-like entities called Yo-kai. It often fell to a fifth-grader named Nate Adams (or was it Katie Forester..?) to befriend these spooks and solve problems that science couldn\u2019t explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he was roughly a block away from home, Blake encountered a mysterious-looking machine. Inside the clear display were...gumballs! Fortunately for the boy in need of something sweet, he still had a quarter left over from lunch. Reaching into his left pocket, Blake then inserted the quarter into the machine, and out popped a delicious purple gumball! He eagerly popped it into his mouth and started to chew, but this gumball was strangely sour. So sour in fact, that it caused Blake to black out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Some time later...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, gimme a rare Yo-kai!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly awoke as he heard the excited voice of a fifth-grade girl. He looked around to notice that he was inside some kind of spherical capsule! Something was definitely weird. Weirder still, his body was now tiny...and purple...and slightly squishy! Before he could get any more perplexed, the capsule opened at last, revealing Blake to the outside world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, he saw the source of the voice: a fifth-grade girl with brown hair in a ponytail, a white pullover over a striped shirt, blue shorts, dark grey socks, and black tennis shoes. This was none other than Katie Forester, a major character in Yo-kai Watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh..?\u201d Katie reacted in confusion upon seeing tiny you be revealed from the capsule. \u201cI guess anything\u2019s possible with Springdale\u2019s Crank-a-kai. But it\u2019s a good thing, because...\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> Yo everyone, Darkly here. Its been a while since I showed my face around. Sorry about that. But now I have RETURNED! Yes I'm back with a brand new interactive. This is called \"Anime RPG Giantess\". It may seem similar to Black Pyro's \"RPG Giantess\" well thats because it is the same thing but with ANIME. Before you all start worrying I asked Pyro before making this and he gave the OK, he even agreed to write some of it too. This is a giantess/original character/get super powers fan fiction. Now lets get started:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chose from different original charaters and send them into an anime world with powers similar to the those used in that world. However, the charater you chose will be shrunk to 3 inches tall. For this to work the eternally use plot device, the \"BAD GUY\" will be shrunk to the same size and do battle. Pretty straight forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now rules:<br>\r\n 1) You can chose the characters I made or make your own.<br>\r\n 2) You can use the powers of the anime or pick the \"Awesome Powers\" opition and use a power from another anime or TV show.<br>\r\n 3) NO god like powers. That means nothing like \"John waved his hand and Sepiroth exploded Dr. Manhatan style.\" Thats not only cheap but also boring. Make your guy strong but not invinceable. We want good fights.<br>\r\n 4) This story is rated 18+ for violince not sex. NO SEX. Kissin' and huggin' is OK. Romance is allowed just no sex.<br>\r\n 5) NO one line chapters. One paragraph or more. Paragraph most be atleast 4 sentences.<br>\r\n 6) Don't suddenly end the story. Nothing like \"John and Naruto faced off with Itachi\" and then the next chapter going \"Naruto killed Itachi and John lived happily together with Hinata.\" Again too boring.<br>\r\n 7) Crossovers are ok.<br>\r\n 8) Look guys the Feet thing is way over used. In most stories there are like 10 chapters in a row about the same girl's feet. I allow feet chapters but no more than two in a row.<br>\r\n 9) Respect the last person's writing.<br>\r\n 10) Leave opitions open. Let the stroy branch out as much as possible and try not to let the stroy end too quick or give the opition of going on before you end it.<br>\r\n 11) The thing Sith did with his stories you know traveling through the giantess' body is also allowed and incouraged.<br>\r\n 12) Giantess only. No giant men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I will delete anything that breaks these rules. Extra Gift points to good additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And I will be continueing my Tales of J.M. Darkly story real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2/8/2013: I want to do an experiment. I'll be adding some chapters using a charater named Marya Firehart. I would like some feed back for her. Please tell me what you all think of her and if you'd like to see a fanfiction centered around her. Any feed back is welcome. Thank you.</td>",
