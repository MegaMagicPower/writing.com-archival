She sometimes even stated she wished she could have cared for him all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was gonna get her wish, and Max was gonna get a big loving family. Quetzal had given Max a potion, and stated that the effects were not gonna be immediate, but would show up in their entirety in a few days. Not long after taking the potion, Max had passed out in Rhea's arms, due to the potion's effects. Quetzal had told Rhea that the potion would reverse max's age to sometime of being a hatchling, and may even have him reverted back to when a dragon is in an egg, so his ability to know when to go, might be lost very soon. Rhea agreed that she would have Max in protective padding, and would explain the situation to Max when he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Rhea gently place Max into her pouch where he slept snug and soundly, and flew off with Cassie to their family cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen max awoke........</span></div></div>",
