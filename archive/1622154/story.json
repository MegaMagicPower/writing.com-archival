I just wonder what really happened to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I Jay,\" Jessy said, as she gave the human a kiss on the top of his head, and slowly shrank him. \"So do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after the party was over, Jessy was looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do it?\" she asked herself. \"How did you grow Jay, father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessy remembered something. She remembered that every time that her father shrank or grew Jay, he would put on a fingerless matalic glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could that have somethig to do with it?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Jessy was walking around her old town, seeing how much of it had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the old place is still around?\" she asked out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be,\" came Jay's response from inside of a small carrying case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jay,\" Jessy said. \"So much has changed since father sent me and you to my aunt's place so that she could raise me to be a 'Proper young vixen' or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have to admite,\" Jay said. \"The fact that he sent us to your aunt's probably saved your life, sence those theives showed up and killed him a few days after he did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jessy said. \"I just wish that he had survived the wounds that they gave him, I miss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Jessy,\" Jay said. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess then twenty minutes later, as Jessy walked down her old street, she was surprised to see the old house still standing. However, there was a sign that said \"Condemed by order of the Government.\" It was also schedualed to be demolished that day. Also, the place was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to get in Jay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the backdoor?\" Jay asked. \"I remember that it couldn't lock quite right and when you were younger, you would use it to sneak in and out at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Jessy said with a smile. \"I had forgotten about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Jess was inside the house. It was full of dust and cobwebs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that the bank didn't try to sell the place after dad died,\" Jessy said. \"I wonder why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we better find this glove that your father used before the demolition crew showes up,\" Jay said. \"The sign said that it would be done at five o'clock in the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's three now,\" Jessy said, as she looked at her wristwatch. \"We best get looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an hour and thirty minutes later, they still hadn't found any sign of the glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, where is it?\" Jessy ask. \"Where did you put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have we tried pulling a book from the bookcase yet?\" Jay asked, with a  chuckle, as he pointed at the only thing that remained undisturbed, a large wooden bookcase that had several dozen scientific books on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that only works in the movies, right?\" Jessy asked, as she looked at her pet, who had been like a brother to her ever since her father had bought him when they were nine years old, shortly after her mother died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well think about it,\" he said. \"We've tried everything else, and it would be the last place that anyone would look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be onto something with that,\" Jessy said, as she started pulling the books out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir search was not in vain, because just as Jessy pulled the last book, which was, of all things, a book on how to hide things in plain sight, the bookcase rotated, and Jessy and Jay found themselves in a hidden room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deffinatly wasn't expecting that,\" Jessy said, as she sat down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in doing so, she hit a switch, which turned a projector on, causing it to play. The image on the screen showed her father in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessy,\" he said. \"If you are seeing this, chances are that I am either dead or arrested and concidered a traitor to the government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the long dead fox sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessy, I have so much to tell you, but so little time,\" he said. \"However, I can tell you this. Shortly after your mother died from phemonia, I found a book, but not just any book, a book written by, and for, humans. All it was was a simple magic trick book, where I learned how to pull a coin from your ears and how I always knew what card the you had picked. However, it also showed me that humans once were, at least, close to the size of the average anthro. Now, while I don't know how it happened, or why, I decided to work on a device that increased my ability to shrink or grow living beings, to see if it was possible to increase the size of a human beyond the one foot mark. I'll admite that I used Jay as my test subject when I tested to see if it would work, while the two of you were asleep one night. At first, the device didn't work, until a piece of my hair fell onto it, and completed a circit. After that, Jay begin to grow, to four times the size most humans are suposed to be. Also, and I must apologize for this, I tested it on you, and I found out that I was able to shrink you like if you were a human. I hope that you can forgive me for making you a little short, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering about why my clothes were a little loose a few times myself father,\" Jessy said, as she put her hands on the screen, as if to touch her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" the man said, contenuing. \"I found out that four feet was about the same height for most people at his age. If my calculations are correct, his real height should be, when he is about twenty years old, six foot two inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, both Jay and Jessy gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only five foot eight,\" Jessy said. \"It's hard to imagian that you should be a full six inches taller than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Jessy,\" Jay said. \"But I think that we should watch the rest and find the glove soon. We have less than ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have hidden the glove and the book in the safe behind this projector screen,\" the dead fox's voice said. \"The combination is your birthday followed by your mother's backwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jessy pushed the screen to the side, saw the safe and entered her birthday, followed by her mother's. However, the safe wouldn't open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" she said. \"I entered my birthday, and mother's correctly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did say backwards after he said your mother's birthday,\" Jay said. \"Maybe her birthday should be entered backwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Jessy said, as she punched the numbers in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, their efforts were rewarded, with the safe opening, and showing them a book and a matalic fingerless glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest that you grab them and go,\" Jay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, but how do we get out?\" Jessy asked, as she grabbed the items, and put them in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw a sign that said, \"Jessy, incase of emergancy, say 'Uncle.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean,\" she said. \"Why would I want to give up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say 'Uncle'\", Jay said. \"It could be a way to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it a shot,\" Jessy said, as she heard the whine of a demolition machiene start up, and started to cause the house to shake as it smashed down the walls. \"UNCLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright light enveloped her and Jay and the two of them found themselves in a feild outside of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Jay said. \"That was new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Jessy said. \"I thought that it was illeagle to have a personal teleportation device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he built it in secret,\" Jay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I guess you are right Jay,\" Jessy said. \"You usually are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, let's see if that device works,\" Jay said, as he looked down at the pocket on Jessy's pair of pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jay,\" Jessy said. \"It might not work after all these years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it,\" Jay said. \"What have you got to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" the vixen said. \"I mean, you have always been there for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I didn't know that you cared for me,\" Jay said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you,\" Jessy said, as she set the human down, got the device out and put it on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stepped back, and tried to make Jay grow. However the device didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not working,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try putting your hair on it,\" Jay said. \"That's how your father said it worked for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jessy said, as she pulled a piece of hair from her head and tried it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it worked, and Jay was soon looking down into Jessy's eyes for the first time in six years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it works,\" he said, his voice sounding slightly deeper than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I guess so,\" Jessy said, as she looked at the handsom man before her, and started to blush under her red fur. \"Um, I best shrink you back down to your normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Jay said. \"After all, we don't need to draw attention to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize what this means,\" Jessy said, as she shrank Jay back down to his usual size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the idea,\" Jay said. \"We'll be concidered traitors of the government if anyone finds out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jessy said. \"Your species should be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jessy,\" Jay said. \"Most humans are content with their lot in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Jessy said. \"But still, your kind should be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jay said. \"But still, we'll need a lot of help, and we could be executed, like your father probably was when he was killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jessy said, as she picked him up. \"But I think that that is what he would want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the sooner we start, the sooner that that dream will come true,\" Jay said. \"Count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, that the fight to free humans started, two young people, who were not even twenty, decided the future of humanity forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several years, the two started to form the group, which tended to concist of those whose parents were executed by the government, humans that where bought from pet stores, people who wished to see humans get better treatment, and so forth. The group called itself HG, which stood for Human Growth. A few of them had been part of the armed forces, and proceded to train the others, including the humans, especially after the shrink/growth device had been duplicated and was fully functional. The group would raid government buildings, free political prisioners, hijack the airways, spread their message, and so forth. However, while they would take prisioners, they always treated them with respect, and would give them the choice of joining. If they refused to join, they would be knocked out, and dropped off along the outskirts of the nearest city, as the group was constantly on the move and would break itself up every so often, with small numbers going one place or another. This would do two things, the government couldn't find all of them, and those small groups could form sub-groups of the HG, all of which reported to Jessy and Jay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who are you in this rebelion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please note, by this time, seven years have passed, meaning that Jessy and Jay are both twenty-five, just in case you wish to use them in your story.*</span></div></div>",

There was only one point of entrance, the front gate. Having an inside man in this operation was the way to go without alerting the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking under the cover of night, a group of 6 infiltrated the facility without a sound. Assisted by night vision goggles, silenced weapons and black camouflage they were nearly invisible. Navigating their way to the storage houses, they eliminated 4 enemy patrol wolves. A knife to the throat will do that. Now at the storage buildings, they secured a perimeter and radioed in for some soft-tops (these are trucks used to transport weapons and ammo). The group cleared the building and loaded the jeeps and trucks to the top. This place had everything, weapons, ammo, C4, bomb making material...TANKS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the silence was broken. \"I'm gonna get me a tank,\" the leader said to himself. and hopped inside. \"Christ this thing is loud\" he said over the roar of the engine, and slowly drove the tank out of the building. The trucks and jeep followed behind suit and were soon out of the enemy territory, keeping silent the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were a couple miles away, the convoy stopped on a hill. The raiders got out and faced the direction of the enemy supply stockade. The man who had stolen the tank had an explosive remote detonator and pressed the ARM BOMB button. He said to the person next to him \"Should you do it or should I.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get an answer. Sadly he looked at the detonate button thinking of all the lives that would be lost...but only for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the detonate button and walked back to the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion was enormous. Even while standing 2 miles away, they could still feel it in there feet as thousands of pounds of high grade explosive ignited into a fiery inferno of melted metal and ash. The piercing, bloodcurdling,  screams of the dead and dying echos across the hills and canyons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood standing, staring, at the compound with a mix of happiness and sorrow, took his face mask off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Jay<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt hands wrapping around his arm and glanced to see their owner. A young female fox, Jessy, whispered to him \"We need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be one of those nights that they would never forget.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the explosion was probably an IED or mine that must have destroyed the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they!\" he shouted over the din of battle. \"Oh my god, there everywhere!\" Jake heard one of his comrades say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone out and form a barricade, circle those trucks around and call in for assistance!\" <i>Damn it, I should have seen this coming</i> Jake thought. \"Jessy get out and call for support\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir\" she responded and promptly radioed in to H.Q. \"Comedy Central come in, this is Red Robin can you hear me, over.\" Jessy prayed for a response. \"Comedy Central, this is Red Robin please respond, over!\" What was seconds seemed like hours as Jessy waited for a response.

He brought his M14 with a sound suppressor back up to his shoulder. Moments later several crates drop from the copter into there defensive circle of trucks along with several elite soldiers. After securing the ammo, 2 other crates fell. These crates were radioactive yellow and were labeled top secret in red spray paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio then sparked to life. \"Red Robin, this is Comedy Central come in, over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Red Robin, come in Comedy Central, over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red Robin, the two boxes that you see in front of you contain...</span></div></div>",

They were also the dominate species of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed the day the anthros showed up. Whether they had been living in underground cities or came from another planet, it didn't matter. What mattered is the fact that, due to their superior technology, they were able to conquer the human race and shrank them. Then, instead of wiping them out, the anthros made the humans their pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays, a human was lucky to reach the height of one foot, but that was only if their master decided to grow them that high, as the shrink/growing ability was something that all anthros had. Kept between the heights of an eighth of an inch to one foot, the humans were forced to depend on their anthro masters for survival. Slowly, over time, the humans forgot their past, as did the anthro population in general, who treated them like they were adorable pets, being gentle to them, bathing them, feeding them, and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were those in power who knew the truth that the masses didn't know, that humans were once the dominate species on the planet. As a result, they destroyed anything related to the past, to prevent people from not only knowing the truth, but to prevent them from reversing the process that kept humans at their current less that a foot size and releasing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their best efforts however, one man figured out the truth. He had discovered something, an old book. This book had no anthros in it, only humans. What was more, a human was listed as the author, with a picture of the man on the cover page. The man who discovered the book, a fox anthro, who was a scientist, kept the book and started examining it at home in his lab. After comparing the objects in the background, like a bench, a small coppery-coin in his hand, and a few other things, he realized that the man must of been close to six feet tall, six times the maximum size that humans should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, the man started to tinker in his lab and created a machine. This device magnified his ability to grow or shrink the human that he had bought as a pet for his young daughter. He then set up an experiment, to see how intelligent the boy was. To his surprise, the boy, who was the same age as his daughter, was almost as intelligent as anthros that were around the same age as him. After that, he started to teach him how to read and write, to see how intelligent the boy could be. Needless to say, he started to see the boy as less and less of a pet, and more and more like a son. Also, he left the boy at his true size, unless someone came over, and had to shrink him for his safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the scientist started to gather people who wanted humans to be treated better around him, although he was careful to keep the information about the book, and anything related to it, quiet. Unfortunately, someone in the government found out about him, and sent assassins to kill him, and those with him. However, the rebellion had just begun, as he had sent his daughter, and her pet human, to her aunt's place, ostentatiously so that she would grow up to be a proper young vixen, but in reality, it was for her protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Anthros have the power to shrink/grow other sentient beings, though they tend to do this to humans for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed, but try to keep it casual. Gay/lesbian, straight, bisexual, are all allowed, as is sex between humans and anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Since a rebellion is going on, there can be battle scenes, just don't cover the whole screen with blood and gore, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Keep your additions in the third person, like if a camera was following the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Nudity is allowed, but don't get into descriptions about breast sizes, penis sizes, and such. However, if you say that a woman has a nice set of breasts, and a man has a nice package, as it were, and that they have cute ass cheeks, I'll allow it. Just don't go overboard on the erotica and the sex scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, one more thing, while they may be rebels, the group does respect the sanctity of hospitals, schools and churches, or its equivalent. They are not to attack/raid those places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, here is a list of things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
