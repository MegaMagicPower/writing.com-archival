Another benefit to this age group was that they'd be more trusting of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn into a fly and go to the local daycare, looking for boys that you would hitch a ride with then reveal yourself at their house. You pick a boy and fly into his brown hair, burrowing yourself to the roots and waiting. Eventually, the boy is picked up by his mother and is taken to his car. Now that you were secured with the boy, you flew out of his hair to take a look at your surroundings. The car you were currently in was a regular 4 seater car, which means the boy likely either had one sibling or no siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice before, but the boy appears to be approximately 6 years old, a pretty good age to introduce yourself. Now that you took in your surroundings, you just sat on the headrest of the seat right above the boy and waited to arrive at your new home. Thankfully, it didn't take too long, as their house was pretty close by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mom opened the door for her son and you flew out after him. They walked together towards an average house, pretty much what you expect a house to look like. One story with a basement and attic. As you entered the house you heard the mom say \"Ok Jimmy, go put your things away in your room.\" and the newly named Jimmy replied, \"Ok mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now knew the boy's name, Jimmy. That would help you secure his trust in the short term, so you committed it to memory. You followed Jimmy over to his room, still in your fly form. Once Jimmy closed the door behind him you landed on the floor behind him and turned back into yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jimmy! Don't shout, I just wanna ask you something. How would you feel about having a friend that would transform into anything you could ever want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shouted, but not of freight, more so of glee. Thankfully, it seems the walls are either soundproof or the mother is on the opposite side of the house. \"That would be awesome! There's so many times where I lost one of my socks or a pencil for school! Why do you ask mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to transform, and want to be your helper until you grow up. What do you say, champ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that! Thank you sir for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need Jimmy. So, is there anything you need right now?\"</span></div></div>",

With a little jump the boy drops his rear onto the new approximation of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grabs a controller Jimmy sighs and wriggles back to get comfortable. The fact that he was running his backside against another sentient being barely crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit content while listening to the muffled beeps of Jimmy's game and the odd shifting or grumbling sound his body made. Normally you would never notice all the tiny sounds and movements caused by a living body, but from beneath it was hard not too notice. Because of this it wasn't as surprising when Jimmy asked you a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir is it okay if I fart, errr I mean pass gas\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Have you lost something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked back at you with her blue eyes and blond hair. \"Yes, I lost my phone. Do you perhaps have a phone I could call mine with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk to yourself. \"That's part of the reason I approached you. I have the power to transform and wanted to be a transforming helper for someone, transforming into whatever they need, and you seemed to be a person I'd be fine with transforming for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked blankly at you. \"God you're a crazy person, I thought you were a chill guy but I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had doubts, understandably. Thankfully, you could easily dispel her doubts. \"Tell ya what miss, I'll transform into a phone and you can use me to call your phone, and in return you let me be your transforming helper. Would that be ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I doubt you can actually transform, but if you can, go for it. I do find myself losing a lot of things, so if you could actually do that it would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou transformed into a phone simply by thinking about transforming into it and drop on the floor. The woman has a look of disbelief on her face as she picks you up. \"Is this really you? Can you talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, I'm here!' You thought to her. With your power, you could talk through your thoughts as long as the person was in contact with you, and vice versa, and you told the woman as such. 'By the way, what is your name miss, since we'll probably be together for a long time coming.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I'm Mary, and yeah, guess I gotta own up to my words. I'll let you be my transforming helper.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used you to call her phone number, the feeling of her fingers sliding across the screen was amazing.

A girl like her could definitely use the help of someone with abilities like yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into her home through the window, as small as a fairy, with the wings to match, you fly right up to her face, a good few inches away at the very least. \"Hello There!\" You bow, with the utmost grace a fairy can have. \"My name is [Your Name Here], and I'm here to help!\" Zora, of course, looks at you with a glimpse of confusion. \"..Is this some weird dream? There's no way you can be real..\" She says, before poking you in the stomach, as you recoil gently. \"I can assure you, miss, I'm very much real! And I can help you out in any way you need me to!\" You say with confidence, as she doesn't seem to believe it. \"Alright then, [Your Name Here], how about you prove it? I bet you can't make yourself into an exact pair of my stockings.\" She smirks, thinking that she's already bested you. Of course, you smirk back, as you stretch yourself out vertically, becoming a long tube-like shape, with a single hole at the very top, as your flesh then becomes mere fabric. What little details you showed as a person vanish under the veil of black and purple stripes, as you soon split into two, falling to the ground as a mere pair of stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this takes Zora by surprise, kicking off her Mary Janes, and pulling off her original stockings, putting them on the bed as she approaches, picking you up, her soft hands stroking your softer fabric. \"Huh..I thought I was calling your bluff..guess you really are able to help in any way..\" she says, sitting down in a computer chair nearby, and pulling you on her nice, soft legs, your body now covering her warm flesh, with your own warmth comforting her as well. \"Huh...you're comfier than my normal pair, too..\" she taps her finger to her cheek, as you giggle, and gently moan, from the feeling of being worn. \"...Hm...I have an actual way you can help out..\" She smirks one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can...\"</span></div></div>",

Plus, with the gothic-styled baldachin on top of the bed, <br>\r\nblocking any incoming light from disturbing her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Zora?

This may sound really corny and cheesy, but feel myself like a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that does sound corny and cheesy, alright.

Moving the bedsheets slowly, without disturbing Zora, you began tickling at her bare feet, <br>\r\nearning a short giggle, turning into a laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, [Your Name Here]! That was just plain cruel!\" Zora said to you, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! I thought it was all in good fun, seeing as you weren't getting up, even though you asked me to wake you up, after an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think, it was funny at all.\" she said, still pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! I apologize, for taking it too far. Well then, what would you like to do next, Zora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Saturday, so there's no school today. We could watch a movie together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a great idea. What else is there, that I could help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could also go to a mall, where there is this store, specializing in gothic style clothing and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Anything else? Remember, I'm here to help you, so if there anything at all troubling you, or if you just need an ear, <br>\r\nto listen to your troubles, I'm here for you, Zora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. my parents are still against my choice of clothing and style. Maybe you could transform yourself, into a gothic boy, and put a word for me, <br>\r\nto my parents. When they see, that I'm not the only one, with this kind of style, I believe thay would become more accepting of it and stop belittling me. <br>\r\nI do have a cousin, who's into the same kind of style as I am, but we don't see each other often. <br>\r\nHer parents are more accepting of her style, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you felt more determined than ever. It was your job, your duty, your mission, to help Zora to feel more comfortable with her own life. <br>\r\nTo prove, not only to others, but to herself, that she too, has a place in this world.
