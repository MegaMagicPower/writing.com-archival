The building was small and old but basically clean.  She was walking down the hallway, carrying documents to be filed, when she noticed a corridor branching off to the right that she had never noticed before.  The corridor was void of features except for a water cooler.  Kate suddenly found herself irresistablely thirsty.

With long blonde hair that hung down to her waist and crystal blue eyes, she was one of the few women who could say that Barbie did not promote unrealistic standards of feminine beauty, at least not where her own looks were concerned.  And as hot as those looks were, her demeanor was equally cold.  At 24, she possessed an MBA and ran the company's accounts receivable department as her own little fiefdom, but an efficient fiefdom that was very profitable for her company.  She planned to make vice president before she turned 30 and there was no one in the company who doubted she wouldn't do just that.<br>\r\nIt was late on a Friday evening.  The rest of the building had already gone home, and the cleaning staff wouldn't be there until early Saturday morning.  Kate was heading to the copier room when she stopped cold in her tracks.  She was looking down a corridor that didn't exist.  Couldn't exist.  She knew this building like the back of her hand and there simple wasn't a corridor here.<br>\r\nExcept there was.<br>\r\nThe corridor was void of windows, door, everything.  Except a water cooler, with a paper cup dispenser attached to it.<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, Kate realized she was thirst.  Incredibly thirsty.  Without a second thought, she dropped the papers in her hand to her floor and rushed toward the water cooler.  She gulped down four paper cups worth of water before stepping back, bewildered.  She never acted in such an impulsive manner.  Never.<br>\r\n    Inching away from the water cooler, she left the corridor, picked up the papers she had dropped, and hurried back toward the copying machine.  The first thing she was going to do was get a copy of the blue prints for this building.  One minute later the corridor had disappeared from her memory and reality.  Two minutes later she shrank.<br>\r\n     There was no warning, no dizziness, no anything.  One minute she was 5'7\", the next she was a foot even.<br>\r\n     There wasn't even much confusion.  Kate found herself looking at a pile of blue cloth surrounding her, and realize that was her blouse.  Her hair had come undone, cascading down her back and over and between her breasts.  Her bare breasts!<br>\r\n     Kate realized she was standing one foot tall in a pile of her clothes completely naked to the world.  Just then she heard...   </span></div></div>",

Mom and Dad must have put out big bucks for this.\"  Clare gave a triumphant smile at this assurance of her parent's general approval of her, then began playing with another doll.  Mac fingered Kate's hair for a few more second and then, becoming bored, tossed her onto the floorboard.  Fortunately for Kate, she landed inside a duffle bag full of clothes.  She stealthily made her way to the bottom of the bag, hoping that by remaining out of sight, she wouldn't suffer from renewed interest from either Mac or Clare.<br>\r\nShe had just made it to the bottom of the bag when she froze in fear:  the duffle bag was being zipped closed!  She felt the car coming to a stop and then felt the bag (and her inside it!) being lifted.  She heard voices, but buried under the clothes, wasn't able to decipher what they were saying. Worse of all she felt the shrinking coming back, soon enough she was 3 inches tall and naked again.<br>\r\n    \"Well, Mac, you looking forward to spending another weekend at the lighthouse with Tim!\"<br>\r\n     \"Yes sir!\"<br>\r\n     Mac's Dad smiled.   Six years ago, he had bought a beach house just as another family bought the one next to it.  Both families had sons of the same age.  The sons had taken an instant liking to each other.  The first year they even dragged out a dryer box between their two houses and dubbed it \"The lighthouse\".<br>\r\n     Tim's Dad was an award winning architect, while Mac's Dad had started life as a civil engineer before moving up the ranks of managment.  The two conspired to build the boys a one room clubhouse between the two houses.  Each year it became more elaborate, until a miniature light house (still one story, the lighthouse portion was strictly a prop) stood between the two.  It had electricity, running water, inside plumbing, a mini-fridge and microwave, plus a tv and an Xbox.<br>\r\n     Last year, the boys declared their independence, wanting to camp out at the lighthouse undisturbed (except going to either one beach house or the other for meals or when a storm was gathering in.)  Since the boys were in easy sight of either beach house when they played outside and they both carried cellphones which their occasionally overprotective mothers could call them on, the demand was acquiesed to and the lighthouse boys had their independence.<br>\r\n    Mac was walking to the lighthouse and saw Tim already there.  He grinned and waved and Tim grinned right back.  Boy this was going to be a great weekend, Mac thought.  Not a cloud in the sky and no clouds all weekend long. Little did he know he was carring a six-inch naked woman in his duffle bag.  Little did Kate know she would be spending the weekend alone with two eleven year olds.</span></div></div>",

She felt a little dizzy spell and noticed she had shrunk again (from 12 inches to 8 inches).  Damn it, this has got to stop before I shrink down to nothing.  Her earlier question about what the kids were doing here was quickly answered?  Mac was helping his little sister find a prized Barbie doll.  Well, the whole company knew Frank overindulged his two kids.  Obviously he would even put the family weekend trip on hold so that his 4 year old daughter could find her favorite doll.  There was another shimmer and she felt herself shrink again (down to 6 inches).  Lord, make this stop she groaned internally.  <br>\r\n    Then her blood froze.  4 year old Clare pointed to the pile of clothes she was hiding in and said, \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n     Mac turned around and his eyes went wide open.  He turned to his sister, \"Nothing, somebody just left their laundry here.  Listen, why don't you go down to the car and I'll be there in a minute.\"<br>\r\n    \"Why aren't you coming down with me, Mac?\"<br>\r\n    \"I just won't to make sure you didn't leave any other Barbie stuff up here.\"<br>\r\n    Clare smiled.  \"Thanks, Mac, you're the best!\"<br>\r\n    As soon as Clare left, Mac started looking around furiously.  He had heard his dad and other guys talk about sex in the storage room, and he thought that meant he might be able to catch someone actually doing it.  After a few minutes he gave up, knowing if he wasn't downstairs soon, his dad would come looking for him immediately.  He decided to go through the clothes real quick to see if he could find anything.  As soon as he did, he saw a six-inch beautiful little woman staring straight back up at him.  And she was naked!<br>\r\n    Knowing he had to do something fast, Mac grabbed her and stuffer her six-inch body inside his shirt. However he didn't count on her....</span></div></div>",

Mr. Bosworth would be gone for the weekend, but the files still needed to be put on his desk as soon as Kate got them.<br>\r\n    This didn't bother Kate at all.  She was actually a attractive, shapely young woman, but her strict attire, no nonsense personality and hair always in a bun added fifteen years to her projected persona.  A persona she very carefully maintained as Mr. Bosworth's executive administrative assistant.<br>\r\n    As Kate hurried down the hallway, she passed a corridor that she had never seen.  That she knew wasn't there.<br>\r\n    Except it was there.<br>\r\n    The corridor had no doors, no windows.  Just an aging water cooler.<br>\r\n    Suddenly Kate found herself remarkably thirst.  With a quick look to make sure no one was watching, she entered the mystery corridor and found a stack of paper cones hanging to one side of the cooler.  She greedily drank down three cones of water before leaving the corridor.<br>\r\n    As she walked hurriedly back toward Mr. Bosworth's office, the corridor that wasn't there before wasn't there again.<br>\r\n    Suddenly, she felt a dizzy situation, and felt her glasses fall off her nose.  When she opened her eyes, she was this thick cloth surrounding her.  Suddenly, strangely, she immediately knew what that cloth was.<br>\r\n    It was her own clothes.  She had shrunk out of them.  (Unknown to Kate at the moment, she had shrunk to six inches).  Her glasses looked monstrously huge before her, but they were reading glasses only, and her vision was basically unimpaired.<br>\r\n     The pins in her had also not shrunk, and as result, her long dark hair hung down to the small of her back and between her firm but ample breasts.<br>\r\n     Kate really didn't know what to do.  All of the personnel had left for the weekend and the cleaning crew wouldn't be here for hours.  And in her present state, she didn't know if she wanted to be discovered right away.<br>\r\n     Just then, she heard the echo of footsteps in the hallway.  Ducking back into the pile of her clothes, she saw a 12 year old boy enter the hallway unescorted.

The door to the lab is shut and the knob high above your reach. So, there is no way for you to leave there unto your own power. By an odd act of chance, some of the rubble has, however, piled up in front of the broken windows. You could climb up there and then exit. Fortunately, the lab is on the first floor and there are some bushes in front of the windows. Once outside, you could try to find someone who can help you. On the other hand, if you stay in the lab, Miss Higgins is bound to come and check on you (after all, she is already way overdue). She may be distraught at times, but she is your chemistry teacher and effectively responsible for you at the moment (what a weird way of thinking.).</span></div></div>",
