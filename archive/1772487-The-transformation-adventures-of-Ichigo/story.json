As strange as it was for him to be wearing them, it was as if some part of him found them to be a natural thing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, he put on the yukata, and after that, he tied an obi sash onto his waste.

He instinctively kept tugging at the hem of it which caused him to realize something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand brushed against smooth skin and Ichigo's attention shifted downwards to realize his legs were hairless which only confused him more. Whatever or whoever did this has quite a weird sense of humor and that annoyed the hell out of Ichigo. Someone is gonna get punched in the face if he can help it. For now he needs to get out of this outfit and find a way to get back home and get his own clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to figure out what to do he failed to notice the door opening up and Tatsuki coming through. Cheeks grow flush and Ichigo straightens up while holding his hands up. \"I can explain!\" he quickly shouts, though Tatsuki doesn't break into laughter or react in a way one might expect. Instead she just tilts her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain what, hime?\" she asks while looking around. \"Why you are late in meeting me down the block? Don't worry about it. It isn't the first time.\" She grins and she motions for the door. \"Come on lets go before we are late for school too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just leaves Ichigo more confused.

People will be asking enough questions as to why we aren't acting normally, but we don't need people thinking we've gone missing or ditched school. For instance, if Orihime didn't go to school as me, my dad would get a phone call asking where I'm at, and then if we fix this before nightfall, I'll have to get an earful about not skipping school, something Orihime would have done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if we cannot undo this?\" Nemu retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Listen, we're going to school. End of story. Besides, it'll allow us to see how far this strange zanpaku-to event has permeated the city, and see if anyone else we know has been switched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that way, I guess we should go to your school...\" Nemu says, before digging at Uryu's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Nemu?\" Orihime wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu blushed, then said, \"I'm not used to wearing pants...\" Ichigo and Orihime do a deadpan anime pratfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at school, they found Ikkaku running up, trying to tear off a Karakura girl's uniform, along with Byakuya dressed like Rukia, Nanao dressed similar to Mizuiro, and Hinamori also there, but she was in a girl's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you found one too!! I can't stand the indignity!!\" Ikkaku blubbers to Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, Ikkaku,\" Byakuya states. \"You are making a spectacle of yourself. The humans here believe you are a girl named Mizuho, so if you are embarrassed about your manner of dress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it!!\" Ikkaku screams. \"Why did it have to be her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I recognize who each of you swapped with, based on how you dressed, but who did Momo switch with? So far whomever isdoing hass had a perverted sense of humor in swapping people of opposite genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizuru Honsh\u014d.\" Hinamri said dejectedly to Ichigo, apparently aware of what kind of person Chizuru is, or at least knows of her reputation, just before Tatsuki gives Hinamori a flying kick to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better keep your hands off of Orihime today, Chizuru!!\" Tatsuki yells at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I hadn't touched her...\" Hinamori mumbles, jaw swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsuki grins and puts her arm behind her head, \"Um, sorry then...

Hey, what happened to Hinamori?\" She pointed out Hinamori had been beaten to within an inch of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime was holding her up, saying, \"My friend Tatsuki thought she was Chizuru, a girl that likes to grab my breasts, and beat her up every time she touched Ichigo, thinking he was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so the same-old, same-old...\" Rangiku said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean...?\" Hinamori said out her swollen mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um guys, can I help you with something?\" Kisuke suddenly says, seemingly coming from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... have a problem.\" Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour explaining everything, and Ichigo telling Urahara things only he should know, he believed them. \"Well, it seems this is possibly an amazing practical, at the moment, but I'm concerned if it may have affected your reiatsu as well. I'm going to have Byakuya and Isane stay here overnight in order to do some tests. I've also had Yoruichi notify the Soul Society, and they're bringing your 'swap partners' here in order for me to better monitor them, because they're scared enough, and we don't need Mayuri scarring them for life with his 'experiments.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, Yoruichi came through the Senkaimon with the swapped parties from the Soul Society, along with Soi Fon. Yoruichi reported to Kisuke, \"After we had to explain to them about the whole Soul Society and Soul Reaper concept, we got them to tell us their side of the zanpaku-to tale, and it seems outside of the Honsh\u014d girl, everyone's stories are all the same; they found a strange sword with a violet handle and a Moebius Strip (an infinity symbol) shaped tsuba. The Honsh\u014d girl and Lieutenant Momo however claim they found a gold sword resembling Tensa Zangetsu with a gold blade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was decided those that currently as students should keep playing their roles for now, to keep from ruining their lives, and somehow I got chosen to babysit you, much to my chagrin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you'll be adorable in it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only going to wear it because you asked me to, Lady Yoruichi, but you know how feel about them...\" Soi Fon grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Ichigo utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skirts!! I hate them!!\" Soi Fon screams out in defiance, just before Yoruichi, mouth grinning an almost Mayuri-like grin, jumps her!! \"Please, no!! Not now, Lady Yoruichi!! Don't make me wear the thing now!!\" she screams in the confusion, no one able to see what was going on in the dust and wrestling. However, after thirty seconds of wrangling, Yoruichi gets off of her, revealing Soi Fon dressed in a Karakura High girl's uniform similar to Orihime's, including sweater vest. Soi Fon frantically pushed the fabric of the skirt down on her groin, crossing her legs, her feet red as a beet. \"I can't fight in this!! Who designs these things?!\" She waddles over, legs clenched, over to a couch, whee she sits down, and quickly covers herself with a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, Soi Fon. You have to look natural, and that is the official uniform of Karakura High, so lose the pillow, or I'll make that skirt shorter.\" Yoruichi jests, holding some scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoi Fon, still blushing, quickly tosses the pillow out a window and sits in a more natural, but still tight legged, position on the couch. \"Yes, ma'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to business,\" Urahara says, trying to remove a smirk from his face, \"Everyone should head to the homes of the people they've swapped with, and keep going about like this is natural. Something like this will have to had left a major reiatsu signature, and maybe some hints on what is happening, so I hope to have some data sometime soon, possibly soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone decided to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Ichigo saw right away all the guys swapped with girls a couple of inches shorter, and the girls a bit taller. Also, Ikkaku had hairy legs, and now they were baby smooth. Sajin had some noticable changes, his muzzle crushed down, making his face look more human, but also feminine, and much of the fur was gone, only the fur on his head where hair would be, and on his ears, was still intact. Ikkaku had signs of a faint buzz of hair on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else noticed...?\" Ichigo blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Orihime said. \"I went to pee this morning, and I saw boy stuff down there inside of, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, balls and all... Also, my legs seem hairier...\" Nanao said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo... I have a vagina. God help me, if I turn into that girl, I will end my own life...\" Ikkaku pouts. \"Look at my head!! It was less hairy than this when I woke up, and this is after I shaved it!! It grew back this fast!! Even if I don't turn into HER, I can hear it now, Yumichika giving me Hell, saying a bald girl just won't be treated the same as a bald guy. Fix it, Ichigo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" Ichigo says, being shaken by Ikkaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Soi Fon shows up with a number of gigai duplicates surrounding her closely. \"Urahara sent me to tell you guys to forget school for now and go down to the shop... I...\" she goes from serious to dejected pouting, \"...got to stay here and babysit these stupid gigai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><i><b>***FLASHBACK***</b></i></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had little time to whip these up, but they should be able to stand in for everyone today.\" Kisuke states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!!\" Soi Fon sighs with relief. \"I can get out of this stupid skirt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I just whipped them up, so I hadn't got a chance to beta test their personality stability and psychological states, meaning someone has to keep an eye on them, to make sure they don't go insane and try to kill everyone.\" Kisuke utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make you pay for this...\" Soi Fon exclaims, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><i><b>***END FLASHBACK***</b></i></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even run in this thing and not feel exposed...\" she grumbles, taking out a stapler and is about to staple the skirt shut between her legs, before Yoruichi comes up and swipes the stapler, saying, \"Now, follow me. Noba is around the corner to warp us to the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How convenient.\" Ichigo says sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!!\" Orihime chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the shop, Ichigo noticed he now had little bit of a bust. Only A-cups, but still, he could tell he was gaining boobs. Once there, he saw his sister Yuzu freaking out, with Rangiku growling at her, \"Get 'em back!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want them!! Stop shaking me!! You're making them bounce more!!\" Yuzu was screaming. Ichigo's jaw dropped when he saw his sister sporting Rangiku's massive rack, but otherwise was still the same, while Rangiku was now flat as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that working?\" he screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Yuzu here pointed out that like Hinamori, the sword she picked up was different, and therefore the one Rangiku got was different from the normal purple handled zanpaku-to.\" Kisuke said, pulling Yuzu free from Rangiku's claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... The sword I saw was pink, with a rainbow handle..., and a kitty on a chain attached to the handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can tell, you're all changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\" Nanao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when Byakuya and Isane began to change, it seems anyone with any even the slightest bit of reiatsu was able to see past the 'swap illusion,' and see the real person, but I still felt like I was looking at Rukia Kuchiki and Keigo Asano. Apparently, I've deduced the effects of the violet sword most of you have been affected by, and it seems it is now changing your genders to that of the people you swapped with. Boys will become girls, and girls will become boys. However, the blades that affected Rangiku &amp; Yuzu and Hinamori and Chizuru seem special, so I'll have to monitor them to see what they'll do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You want us to stay here and track our changes?\" Ichigo blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!!\" Urahara said, \"Your gigai doppelgangers should be able to cover for you, and I have Soi Fon watching them, except for Rangiku's, since she goes to a different school, so I have Ururu tailing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh... I don't like it, but if it'll help you figure this out, I guess we should stay...\" Ichigo grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the three days, Ichigo found himself regularly monitoring his appearance, as did everyone else. He also used soul candies to check on everyone's Soul Reaper powers. He found his height had dropped to around 5', his facial features softening into a feminine shape, looking like what he would look like if he had been born a girl, and as he figured, his chest kept growing. By the third day, his breasts her close to, but not quite, where Orihime's chest was at. His waist was narrower and hips wider, but he noticed his hair had not changed in the slightest, save for the hairline, which now reflects his now feminine gender. Orihime looked like a lightly haired man, with chiseled figures and a toned body, her face bearing bishonen good looks, accentuated by her long hair. In fact, most everyone seems to look like their opposite gender equivalent, as though they had been born the other gender, but still had their same hairstyles, but Ikkaku and Sajin had some differences, as did Ry\u014d, the girl Sajin swapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku now stood at only 4' 9\", supporting massive breasts that dwarf Rangiku's chest, and of everyone, boy or girl, had the longest, most luxurious crimson hair, draping to his knees, shimmering effortlessly in the light with nary a single split end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSajin now had a human face, but still sported wolf ears, but now had a wolf tail as well, and the fur on his head was replaced with long brown hair. However, he still towered over even some of the girls-turned-boys, despite losing some height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRy\u014d gained Captain Komamura's wolf face and head, losing her hair in the process, and grew wolf ears of her own, becoming an anthropomorphic wolf like he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the changes that really interested Kisuke were Rangiku &amp; Yuzu, and Hinamori &amp; Chizuru. He noticed that outside of swapping bustlines, the only thing that changed between them was they swapped butts, giving Yuzu a ridiculously curvy figure despite not even starting puberty yet, and Rangiku moping about how she looked like a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomo &amp; Chizuru was the most surprising, because unlike everyone else, they changed mentally, not physically. Hinamori began acting like a horny pervy lesbian, so much so she had to housed with the girls-turned-boys because she kept trying to grope the boys turning into girls and snag panty shots, only getting worse the more feminine they began to look, and Chizuru stared acting like, well... Momo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... After running some tests and analyzing the data, I have some news. First, it seems you're done changing physically. Second, it seems now, according to Soi Fon's report, that everyone remembers your swapped counterpart as looking like you do now, so for instance, everyone now remembers Orihime looking like Ichigo does now, and Ichigo looking like Orihime does now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, but it sounds like you have bigger news.\" Uryu quips, having a waifish figure not too dissimilar to his male bod, with small breasts and narrow hips, but his long smooth thighs and legs are the attention-grabbers due to wearing Nemu's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How observant!!\" smirks Kisuke. \"The last bit of news I have is...\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't want anyone to see him like this. But before he could think further on the matter, he caught sight of a clock. \"Oh no! If I don't hurry now, I'll be late for school!\" he thought frantically as he started off running, somehow forgetting about his current attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as he was a few blocks away from the school did he recall, and hid behind the nearest corner. \"How did I forget something as embarrassing as this? How did I get that distracted?\" he thought. He wondered if anyone had seen him. He couldn't go to school like this! Bu then again, if he didn't go, he didn't want to miss class. Today one of their art projects were due, and he did want to see what others thought about it. And there he was getting distracted again. He hadn't even cared much about the thing this morning. 'First I'm suddenly dressed like this, and then I start thinking weird stuff.</span></div></div>",

Why did I do that!?' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo was ready to do his best to try and explain a situation that he didn't even understand, he noticed that she didn't even seem to bat an eye at his state of dress. \"Good morning to you too, Orihime.\" she replied as she walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, what?' he thought. She had just called him Orihime? He couldn't think of why. Then again, he did just suddenly appear in front of her apartment earlier, and dressed in a girl's school uniform.</span></div></div>",

As he wracked his brain for what to do in this situation, he said the first thing that popped into his mind, though it wasn't what he considered the best thing in this situation. \"Lets walk the rest of the way to school together.\" he said to her, somehow a cheerful tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" she replied, oblivious to the problems of the person before her. As they walked, Ichigo felt oddly calmed, despite his situation. Tatsuki would talk about some stuff, and he would find himself chime in. He found this situation as natural as he found it strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then occured to him. He was dressed like this and Tatsuki thinks hes Orihime. Maybe his strange behavior was because he was acting a bit like her as well, like he had gotten a bit of her personality in whatever had happened to him. It would explain some of his actions and thoughts up to now. And what about the real Orihime? Where was she in all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think further on the matter, he suddenly found a pair of wrap around his chest. \"Good morning, Hime!\" a new voice said, a voice that he recognized as Chizuru, a friend of Orihime that was openly infatuated with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, good morning, Chizuru.\" he replied, currently unsure how to react to the situation. So then it isn't just Tatsuki that thinks hes Orihime, it was likely that everyone did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizuru was then yanked off him forcefully by Tatsuki, who said \"Jeez, you just can't ever keep your hands to yourself, Chizuru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ichigo, the part of his mind that himself found the situation growing stanger to him by the second.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not knowing what else to do at this point, Ichigo followed his friends to class. Afterall, he didn't want to be late, and maybe he could think about . In class, he couldn't help but stare at the sureal sight of Orihime acting like him and her and everybody else believing that she was him and he was her, but for some reason, he also felt there was another reason he kept staring at Orihime. On a few occasions, Orihime had looked over to him, only for Ichigo to quickly avert his attention elsewhere as he blushed and wondered if she had noticed him staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that would happen was that he seemed to have odd daydreams every now and then. As he was thinking about how he had swapped with Orihime, the thought had somehow gone to an image of him and Orihime fighting alongside one another, with her dressed up in his bankai and him using her Fullbring Shun Shun Rikka. From there, he wondered what it would be like if others were in similar situations, and imagine Tatsuki with Chad's power, Chizuru with Uryu's, Urahara and Yoruichi being swapped with each other, Rukia swapping with Byakuya, and other such swaps, and even imagined said people acting like who they had swapped with, and let out a giggle at the thoughts. From there though, the daydream had evolved into him picturing them all being swapped into the roles of various fictional characters, and acting out the roles while still having the personalities of whoever they had swapped with prior. And from there, it had gone to him picturing them really at a costume party. And then the costume party turned into them changing their clothes back into the initaily swapped with. And then people looking just like them all showed up, only in their original roles, and everybody got into a fight with the others in their role, such as Orihime as she currently was fighting a normal version of himself. And then more copies of themselves showed up, only everybody was in different roles, such as a Tatsuki who thought she was Ichigo, a Renji who was in Rukia's role, etc, and then they joined the fight. And then more of them showed up again with different roles. And then Arrancar showed up in their roles. When he finally snapped himself out of such thoughts, he wasn't sure what to think. He chalked them all up to Orihime's over active imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he couldn't figure out what to do about the situation, the one thing he did gather from class was how much of Orihime's personality he had seemingly aquired with this strange swap that they had experience. He was still completely aware of he he really was, even if no one else was, but would also answer to the name Orihime without thinking. He would also have the kind of thoughts that he assumed were hers, such as the daydreams and others. If he had to estimate, he'd say his personality was about 60% himself and 40% Orhime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, he decided that there were two choices. He could either investigate into the sword by himself after school. Or he could talk to Orihime, who currently thought she was Ichigo, and maybe either talk to her about the situation, or just see if she noticed anything strange, maybe ask her about this morning.</span></div></div>",

They all started to strip out of their gi, none of them seemingly alarmed by his presence, and continued what they were doing. Looking around and doing his best not to pay attention to the girls stripping around him, he found the locker labled 'Arisawa' and started to strip as well. Underneath his gi, he discovered a sports bra on his chest, and a pair of panties, and blushed harder than he already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, once he was naked he followed the other girls into the showers and washed off, repeating 'Don't look, just focus on yourself!' over and over in his head the whole time.

His uniform shirt seemed to remain about the same, albeit seeing rather loose in the chest area as it continued to change. The looseness made it seem like something was missing in his pectoral area.. A small ribbon tie would appear, wrapping around his shirts collar before seeming to magically tie itself into place, resting right above the second button on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, his pants would be the next to change, slowly slinking up his legs. It would shrink down, gaining pleats as it slid up past his knee, moving to about mid thigh. The pant legs would suddenly separate, swishing to the side with each step, a breeze causing Ichigo's new skirt to lift up in the wind slightly. He would barely notice though, aside from shivering his legs ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo softly rubbed at his eyes, his vision seeming to blur a little as he walked up to his locker at the front of the school. He wouldn't notice, however, that the locker he went to was not his own, but that of his classmate Chizuru. He would step out of his shoes, getting into the indoor uniform pair before placing his old ones into the locker ands shutting it.

The arrancar nearly jumps out of her skin hearing that. Upon completing his bankai release, he holds out Tensa Zangetsu. \"Tensa Zan... Rukia...\" Rukia is doing all she can to contain her laughter, before letting loose, but is blushing too. Even the arrancar seems to be diverting her eyes from Ichigo. \"What the hell is so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... shihaku... sho... Even Rangiku would call it... trampy!!\" Rukia guffawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked down and splurted blood at the sight of his own body. His boobs were now bigger than Orihime's and Isane's put together, covered only in a tiny white bikini top, nothing else on the top half of his torso, wearing gloves that reminded him of the X-shaped wrapping of his normal bankai up to his forearms, but on his feet were black four inch heeled platform knee-high boots instead of the normal waraji, and he swore the hem of that miniskirt was now an inch shorter, only coming just a little past his now cartoonishly plump rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, I think my shihakusho in this body is based on Chizuru's psyche. Two, if so, Chizuru needs help. And three, <b>HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FIGHT IN THIS!!</b>\" Ichigo yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrancar makes the first move, firing a cero, but Ichigo easily snuffs it out in his hand. He slashes the breastplate in half, exposing the arrancar's chest to the world. Embarrassed as can be, she stops her attack, when suddenly, Ichigo feels a strange surge in his reishi when he saw her chest. It was nearly on par with his Final Getsuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... where did her reishi go...\" the arrancar screamed in terror, no longer feeling Ichigo's power on this plane. Even Rukia was dumbfounded, never experiencing this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on, Ichigo?\" In a panic, the arrancar summons hollows on an unprecedented scale to attack. All of a sudden, Ichigo flash steps behind the arrancar, presses his massive chest to her back, holds her in her arms, holding a burning Tensa Zengetsu in front of them and turns them around, mashing his sword into her breasts. As Rukia saw them turn, it seemed Ichigo's eyes had gone blank, mouth drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go... of me!!\" the arrancar tried to resist, but her boobs bouncing on his wrists only seems to enhance Ichigo's reishi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair grew long long, then turned black, and then he said in a slutty voice Chizuru reserved for her pervy antics with girls, \"Mugetsu.\" A massive black wave swallowed the sky, blotting out the sun. As crickets started to chirp and birds chirps in confusion from the sudden darkness, hollows by the tens of millions were vaporized. The black wave seeped into the gargantas before they could close and began massacring even more hollows on the other side until they exploded from the energy overload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blackness faded, Ichigo released the arrancar, his hair returning to Chizuru's normal style. \"That was... amazing... I was able to use my Final Getsuga abilities again, but this time without risking my powers... But how did I do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrancar holds her shirt closed, exclaiming, \"Alright!! I'll be good!! I won't hurt humans anymore!! I'll join the Soul Society!! I'll do anything you say... I.... I'll even be your lover... Just, please don't kill me!!\" She was bowing frenetically at Ichigo's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Rukia says to her sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that power!! I heard of it!! It was just like the power that beat Aizen-sama!! There's no way I'd ever compete with that, and I'd rather repent and be a good girl than guy for some Soul Society traitor that never really cared for us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighs and says, \"Oh, alright. I'll let you live!! Just don't be lying, or you'll regret it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe salutes Ichigo, letting her buttonless shirt fly open in breeze, making Ichigo spew blood from his nose as she says, \"Yes, ma'am!! For now on, I dedicate myself to the betterment of humans, and anything you ask of me!!\" She vanishes in a sonido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure letting her go was a good idea?\" Rukia asked Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knew she was beat, and I can tell she meant it in her voice. Now I just have to explain to explain not only why I look like Chizuru, but now have my own arrancar minion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began back, Rukia said, \"Ichigo... back there, your eyes blanked out... What happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember using my Final Getsuga Tensho again, but my reishi is perfectly intact. I can still feel Zangetsu in me and everything, but I didn't feel that transcendent reishi surge through me until I saw her exposed breasts... What if I'm acquiring Chizuru's lesbian obsessions and it is having an effect on my reishi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think about it, that arrancar did first call you 'Karakurizer Erotic,' and seemed to know Chizuru intimately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... I think Urahara might have some 'answers.'\" Ichigo grumbles, cracking his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any rate, we should get back to school before they haul your... er, Chizuru's body off to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, if I look like Chizuru, could it stand to measure that Chizuru might...\" Ichigo pondered allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, Orihime!! Vamonos!!\" Rukia shouted, the two of them flash stepping for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">What happens next?</div></span></div></div>",

Scowl deepening, he scratched his scalp and continued on. He was about to enter the school grounds when something black drooped down in between his eyes. He grabbed the offending object and gave it a firm tug, only to grunt in mild pain. He frowned and entered the school, only to go into a nearby bathroom and look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What the fuck is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suspended in his face, hanging right between his eyes, was a familiar strand of glossy black hair. He tugged at it irritably, thinking that his psycho father had played a prank on him, but it didn't budge. He turned the faucet and wet his hand with water and ran it through his hair. He was not surprised when the black didn't come out, what he was surprised to see were the numerous streaks of the same black that began to peak through his hair. And right before his eyes, his orange  locks began to vanish as each strand began to darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair began to weave down the sides of his head, the spikes flattening and smoothing out. And slowly, as the hair grew and darkened more and more, he began to see elements of a distinctly familiar hairstyle take shape. When it reached the base of his neck, it fanned out slightly. He knew that hair, it was Rukia's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat changes next?</span></div></div>",

He has wated enough time this morning with that weird sword he saw and now just dawdling about trying to remember what he was doing.

It was more the opposite in this case, though. He had lost almost eight full inches in height before he finally seemed to stop shrinking and his black locks grew a slight bit longer into a rather tomboyish style. He hasn't even realized his hair had darkened and shifted so given lack of a mirror and the hair still being short enough that it didn't fall into his gaze at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still a bit lost in thought when he heard some crying from not far off. Taking a brief looking around a younger kid perhaps in grade school was on the ground staring up at three guys that Ichigo recognized from another school that were about his age. \"No money? How could you waste our time like this?\" the leader of the gang said. Of course the three didn't notice the rapid approach of Ichigo before it was a bit too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foot met the face of the one talking and he goes staggering about and the other two just stared a moment. \"Who is this shrimp?\" one asked before they too were met with a kick. This one hit the guy in the gut and he went staggering away as well. \"Oh screw this! Guys it ain't worth it!\" called out the first and the group went running off. The chance to work off some aggression felt nice for Ichigo. Given how odd things were this morning he really needed something like that.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, you okay?\" Ichigo asks before clearing his throat. His voice sounded off for some reason. Not only that he in no way could tell the fact his face was getting a bit softer around the edges and his adam's was vanishing. The young boy just nodded as he finally got to his feet. He then smiled faintly. \"I will be! Thanks, miss!\" he says and he turns around to dash off. This just left Ichigo looking a bit confused. \"Hey I am not a-\" he starts coughing from the sudden tickle in his throat that finishes changing the sound of his voice. \"Oh nevermind.\" he mumbles under his breath.</span></div></div>",

He is also frowning at how wrong his voice sounds to himself right now. Not only that it sounds familiar. Almost like Tatsuki's voice now that he thinks about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continue as he runs to class. His body remains athletic, but it is taking an overall more feminine shape. His waist draws in, but remains fit and well toned. His hips pop a few times as they spread wider. The popping is just dismissed more as him overexerting himself from running so fast. His rear also fills out a bit to give a nice curve that is shown off rather nicely by his tighter pants. Calves grow more toned while thighs just fill out ever the more slightly to finish things off for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe manages to round the last corner and come down the sidewalk to the entrance of Karakura highschool before slowing down and panting a few times. He made it before the first bell thankfully from the looks of it. Despite his appearance no one seems to notice anything strange. Though Ichigo is starting to realize something has to be going on. Everyone feels alot taller than he is used to. He always considered himself a pretty good size, but he feels like one of the shortest males around at the moment.</span></div></div>",

A feeling of freefalling through darkness before he feels himself resting on something soft. Slowly his vision returns and he is left looking upwards at the ceiling. As he sits up he finds himself to be resting on a bed with pink colored sheets on it. On top of that he seems to be in Soul Society for that matter given how the room looks. It definantly belongs to a female shinigami at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally gets to his feet and he starts to notice something else. His school uniform has been replaced with shinigami robes. There were slight differences to it he realized. One he didn't have Zangetsu and it was nowhere to be seen. There was a zanpakuto nearby, but he didn't fully recognize it. Secondly he was wearing the armband of a lieutenant on an arm. \"What the hell is going on?\" he says to himself while scratching at his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon pauses because he realizes what else was feeling off. His hand travels and touches at a small bit of clothed that seems to be keeping part of his hair in a bun. \"Oh now what?\" he says a bit loudly in annoyance and finds a mirror to look at. He just stares at his reflection. His hair was styled in a more feminine way and his usual spike locks were straightened while it must have gotten longer given how much is gathered in the bun in the back. It slowly dawns on him while it looks familiar too. He has seen someone with the same style before in Soul Society. \"Momo?\" he says while looking confused. </span></div></div>",

Than you for asking. It was just a bad dream.\"  the officer nodded, believing the lie, and left, Ichigo sighed in relief and put his head on Momo's pillow, starting to close his new eyes...only to snap open again when he realized he's now the squad 5 lieutenant and he had to get dressed in Momo's clothes...</span></div></div>",

What kind of zanpakuto just disappears like that?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he didn't have much time to walk around. He had school after all to go to. He was already a bit late after examining the sword. He began to walk down the sidewalk towards Karakura High School. However, as he walked, he began to feel a bit strange, as if he was starting to feel \"crammed\" or something like that. He looked down at his body and didn't see much wrong. However, when he looked back up, and saw a couple of girls walking by, he almost gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost taller than he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" he asked himself as he looked around. By comparison, he was hardly as tall as he usually was, considering that he was one of the taller males in the school. He couldn't tell if he was younger or anything, but it did feel weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could figure that out, he felt shifting along his school uniform. Ducking off to the side a bit, his white shirt began to conform closer to his body, keeping its white color. However, the neckline and hem of the sleeves began to form rings of dark red around them. The neckline itself then plunged into a little triangle shape. Ichigo thought that the shirt looked familiar, but he didn't get much time to think before the next change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, his pant leggings began to merge together, trying to form a single skirt as they began to rise up his legs. As the leggings formed into a single skirt that went to his knees, it retained its brown color, with a couple of red rings around the middle of it. His white socks grew up on his legs, going to near his knees as they turned darker. His school shoes even shifted, turning white and becoming a normal pair of sneakers for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second. These clothes look familiar.\" said Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was only the beginning, as Ichigo's body continued to feel smaller and smaller.</span></div></div>",

Even if he couldn't understand whatever was going on, he knew something was changing him and he at least needed to know what first. Before long, he managed to a window at a dress store and was able to see himself at least a little bit more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! I look like a eleven year old!\" he shouted in a prepubesent voice at his reflection. Some of the people walking by thought it was a tiny bit weird, but though it'd be best to leave the young boy alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost as short as my sisters! Wait... These are Yuzu's clothes! Am I turning into her?\" His bright orange hair becoming a ligh shade of brown before his eyes all but confirmed his theory. What could this be happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that zanpaktou from earlier. <i>That's </i>what's probably causing this. But where is it now?!\" Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure if it existed anymore. Still, it was his only lead. He had to find it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Ichigo decided to skip school and focus more on the problem at hand. He figured the best place to start was where he first saw it. Though, he had to hurry. The more he walked, the more his hair straightened and lengthened. Before long, it managed to grow down his neck and light brown bangs got in the way of his eyes. Luckily, Yuzu's signature hairclip helped <i>some </i>of that problem. That is, while still aiding in the larger problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is it?!\" he screamed in his little sister's high voice. \"Dammit! Maybe I just need to get home. Yeah, home sounds nice right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he started dashing towards the Kurosaki Clinic. Again, each step accelerated the transformation process. His now young figure started to develop small yet noticeable curves and anything resembling muscle or body hair was drained from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' Ichigo thought to himself. 'Looks like the worst is yet to come.'</span></div></div>",

School was the furthest thing from his mind now as he walked in normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to now?\" he asked himself, his voice fully sounding like Yuzu's now. He then had a thought. If he was becoming her, perhaps he should check out her room. That might be a good idea. Following that, Ichigo put his backpack down and began running upstairs. As he did, he felt his face shifting, causing him to stop and put his smaller hands on his face. He felt his face softening, with not many other distinguishable features forming. He took a quick detour at the top of the stairs, running into the bathroom. There he ran in and looked in the mirror, seeing Yuzu's exact face looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, he felt a little pressure in his groin, feeling what was happening next. It didn't take long as he felt his manhood slip away underneath the skirt, completing his change into his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this happen? What did that zanpakuto do?\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu! Are you ready?\" Ichigo heard his dad boom through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?!\" Ichigo cried back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For our annual trip what else? Now hurry up!\" shouted Isshin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo hardly ever heard his dad yell like that, outside of their annual cemetery trip. Wait, was that today? Boy, he must have lost track somewhere down the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Yuzu's room, well his now, he looked around the room, deciding that he might as well go along with it for now. He found Yuzu's usual green jacket with a skirt and yellow socks. It was one of her classic outfits anyway. Besides, it was chilly out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well.\" Ichigo groaned as he got ready, not particularly happy at the thought of changing in his sister's body. He did wonder though. Where was the real Yuzu if he was here? </span></div></div>",

Yuzu felt an extra need to considering the series of events the day had given her. She had to admit, she hadn't felt this vulnerable in a while, but now it felt more wrong than usual. She felt like she had to to keep her emotions in check, or else she'd be acting too...girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Yuzu thought that having such strong emotions was girly, it was that she usually had them in check. She had accepted her mom's death at the last visit, especially after avenging her death. Still, that was when she was Ichigo and had power. Before she was standing right next to her former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, Ichigo, er, I'm looking rather hard right now,' Yuzu thought to herself while looking at her older brother. 'Wow, I'm my own big brother. Isn't that confusing.' Still, she couldn't get over how different this Ichigo looked. He almost looked angry at himself still. 'Maybe this Ichigo doesn't know about mom.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the forest surrounding the cemetary and noticed Rukia motioning to come by some bushes. At first he thought that she was motioning towards Ichigo, but he didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu, can I talk to you?\" Rukia whispered from the bushes. Wait, why would Rukia want Yuzu? Wait, why was Rukia in a gigai? Wait, why was she wearing the same dress as the last visit?! Okay, something was definitely wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Yuzu didn't have much of a choice.

Funny, even in this world she was stuck with Rukia. Except now, he had to look up to talk to her. When she did, Rukia was looking surprised at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't think I've ever heard you swear before, Yuzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu blinked. \"Sorry, I don't know what came over me,\" she chuckled. \"Just a little stressed, that's all.\" Since Rukia didn't know what was going on, that made one more person he had to fake this to. \"So... How about that Hollow? We should probably go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" her taller partner agreed while pulling out a piece of Soul Candy and throwing it to Yuzu. She proceeded to eat it and was immediately ejected from her own body. The only thing Yuzu could think that was stranger than talking to her old body was seeing her own little body in Soul Reaper mode. She even had a zanpaktou. It was definitely smaller than Zangetsu was at the time, but it was still there. Who knew what this zanpaktou could be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\" cried a high voice from near the gravesite. This was followed by another shout of \"Karin!\" from a much deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect,' Yuzu thought to herself. 'Now I have to save myself from a Hollow. I don't think this Ichigo could fight off a small Hollow, much less the Grand Fisher. Hopefully this Yuzu can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chappy!\" she heard Rukia call over to her ejected body. Wait, so now Rukia's stupid bunny Soul Candy was her substitute? Well, that's one of the lesser surprises of today. \"As soon as we take care of the Hollow, make sure to bring Karin and Ichigo to safety, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" the Soul Candy responded before hopping away to wait until her masters took care of the Hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's head out,\" Rukia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" And with that, they headed towards the Grand Fisher.

This will be the hardest Hollow yet, for many reasons.\" said Rukia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I think I can handle it.\" Yuzu sheepishly smiled. Doing that felt so weird. Ichigo hardly ever smiled at a moment like this, making Yuzu wonder about how she was acting. However, there was no time to worry about that. The dense spiritual pressure caused by Grand Fisher was just ahead. Yuzu just hoped that it would turn out better this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes nothing.\" said Yuzu as she drew Zangetsu. Strangely enough though, she couldn't really feel Zangetsu all that well. It kind of felt like back when Ichigo was first learning how to use Zangetsu. Not only that, this version of Zangetsu looked more like a conventional sword, rather than the huge one Ichigo used to wear due to his uncontrolled energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who it is.\" a disembodied voice boomed out. Yuzu took a step back as the familiar shape of Grand Fisher rose before her, as frightening as ever. Yuzu didn't know how to react. It was one thing when she fought him as Ichigo, because he was there when their mother, Masaki, died. Yuzu wasn't there, making this kind of strange. Never the less, she steeled herself and tried to look fight ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh, more souls for the taking I see.\" Grand Fisher laughed at the little girl. Yuzu gritted her teeth a bit; the last thing she, whether as Ichigo or Yuzu, liked was being looked down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" Yuzu charged forward, trying to strike Grand Fisher. However, the Hollow flash-stepped away, appearing behind Yuzu and slapping her down from behind. Yuzu fell face-first, thankfully still holding on to her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, that hurt.\" she groaned. Injuries seemed to hurt a little more now. Apparently, the difference between a high school boy and an elementary school girl was large. Still, she got back to her feet and turned to the Hollow again. Not being able to feel Zangetsu wasn't making this any easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zangetsu, if you're in there, I could use your help.\" said Yuzu. No answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong girly? Having trouble?\" Grand Fisher laughed at her. Yuzu gritted again, deciding to charge again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't keep charging! It's not going to do much good!\" Rukia tried to warn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late\" grinned Grand Fisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuzu charged, Grand Fisher grabbed her in one hand, slamming her on the ground hard, making her cry out in pain from the impact. Yuzu was barely holding on to consciousness right now. The Hollow was even more overpowering in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come...on....get....up.\" she groaned as she fought to stay awake. However, that feeling was waning as her eyes began to feel heavy. Grand Fisher began to approach, and Yuzu fell into unconsciousness. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuzu awoke to somewhere much different immediately after. Considering past experiences, she expected this to be her inner world. Everything pointed to that, considering she remembered blacking out and was currently looking at the sky while standing perfectly straight. However, instead of a sideways city, she was currently on a sideways forest fullof bright flowers. That was new. Not to mention, old man Zangetsu couldn't be found anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zangetsu!\" Yuzu yelled to the scenery, causing a large echo. \"Zangetsu, where are you?!\" This question was met by a hard slap on the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell that was that?!\" the girl cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time you got here, Yuzy,\" a voice resembling a young girl's called out from the trees. This was then met with an unexpected headbutt to Yuzu's stomach. After some momentary disorientation, she was finally able to see the source of the attacks: a girl that barely looked older than herself with platinum hair and a purple jacket above a white, frilly skirt. Also of notice were the purple boots this girl wore, since Yuzu got a good look at them after getting kicked in the face with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ib1.keep4u.ru/b/070716/de794004c333ec0705.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ib1.keep4u.ru/b/070716/de794004c3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! WHAT THE FREAKIN' HELL?! Who are you anyway and what are you doing in my inner world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really are off, Yuzy,\" the mystery girl taunted. \"I expected more from the girl who used to be Ichigo Kurosaki himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?! You know I'm Ichigo?\" Maybe this was finally his chance at solving everything! \"How do you know who I really am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, twenty questions?\" the girl mocked. \"Seriously, I think I've counted seven already. Got to admit, that is a pretty good start. Though, I can only answer one at a time. So, I'll start with the first one, to which the answer is 'here'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked where Zangetsu was, so I answered 'here'. Seems pretty straightforward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he's here. I just wanna know where he is!\" Yuzu was practically steaming by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you just have to <i>have</i> everything spelt out for you, don't you? This is your inner world, where a soul can communicate with parts of their spirit. And I'm pretty sure I'm not an inner hollow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Yuzu stammered. \"Are you saying you're...No. No, no, no, <b>NO!</b> Don't tell me you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" the girl said proudly. \"Zangetsu, the Slaying Moon, in the spiritual flesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu was speechless. She had come to accept some of the wierder things today. Transformation, time travel, alternate reality, Soul Reaper Yuzu. But <b>this</b> was by far the most disturbing. Zangetsu was now a little girl that was playing games with her. No stranger fact had ever been known to her. This was <b>completely </b>out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, even if you are old man Zangetsu, how do you know who I really am?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And that's now eight questions. Which one do you want first?\" Zangetsu smirked. Yuzu put her hands over her eyes. One thing was certainly the same; this Zangetsu beat around the bush as much as the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell. Me. Why. You're. Here.\" Yuzu emphasized every word in that sentence. Zangetsu just smirked before jumping on to a tree branch, swinging her legs back in forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha! Okay okay, let's just calm down and handle this like civilized people.\" Zangetsu giggled. \"I suppose, first and foremost, as your zanpakuto spirit, it wouldn't' be very sporting for me not to know about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can you know about me? Everything recently has been topsy-turvy.\" said Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course. What do you think happened? After all, you just fainted fighting Grand Fisher again.\" smiled Zangetsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I had assumed some kind of combination between time travel and some alternate reality.\" said Yuzu. Zangetsu clapped her little hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely right on the alternate reality part, because that's exactly what this is. This is an entirely different dimension, one where Yuzu became a Substitute Soul Reaper instead of Ichigo Kurosaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that even happen?\" asked Yuzu. \"Yuzu could barely even see spirits where I came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of hard to explain. Anyway, Yuzu is the Soul Reaper here. Understand that much?\" asked Zangetsu. Yuzu nodded, although a bit hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why am I here? You know that I'm Ichigo Kurosaki, but why am I here in some alternate universe. And if Yuzu is the real Soul Reaper here, why isn't she here?\" asked Yuzu. Zangetsu suddenly hardened her gaze a bit, surprising Yuzu that a stern look could come from the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this world's Yuzu....is dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu gasped at those words. Yuzu was dead in this world? How could that be? No one noticed anything strange. If Yuzu was dead, wouldn't they have noticed that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Zangetsu started. \"You may or may not know, but there was a near collision of worlds some time ago. Specifically, between Soul Society and the World of the Living. Like I said, you probably don't remember, but trust me, it happened.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That near collision was so huge that other dimensions were affected by it as well. The Yuzu of this world was caught up and that, and died during a pivotal moment.\" explained Zangetsu. Yuzu gasped a bit after hearing that. She didn't want to believe it, but Zangetsu seemed dead serious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to find some replacement, so I sent the special zanpakuto to another dimension that had a Half-Human/Half-Soul Reaper that could become her. Well, that and because it was fun.\" she cheekily grinned. Yuzu got mad at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you whisked my away from my dimension? Why about my friends back home?!\" asked Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. I think another you has appeared there. I don't know. I'm on an expert.\" Zangetsu smilled as she flipped and landed on the ground. \"So that's the facts. Your world will be fine, and this world needs Yuzu, and so do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what can I do? I can't fight like Yuzu. I don't even know how to fight like this.\" said Yuzu a little exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu giggled again. \"There is one way. Another reason why you're here. I'm going to help you fight like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" asked Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By becoming her.\"</span></div></div>",

I hate to ask such a sacrifice for you, Ichigo, but this universe needs Yuzu as much as your universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already know what's going to happen! I know what happens after this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, after this, you're going to get killed <i>again</i> because you're a teenage boy inside his little sister's body. Then, so well Rukia, then the rest of your family. So what's it going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu thought long and hard. Was her memories worth sacrificing? Well, at this rate, she was almost certaintly going to die trying to fight the least favorite of all the Hollows she'd ever fought before. Yuzu was going to die. Yuzu did die. Only he could keep Yuzu alive in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you hurry up?\" Zangetsu asked impatiently. \"There's kind of an evil clown-gerbil outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu couldn't help but chuckle at her zanpaktou's description of the Grand Fisher. Maybe she already had a little bit of the real Yuzu in her all this time. Well, maybe this Yuzu wasn't too different from her old self, also. No matter what, she was still her family and friends' guardian. Her universe still had their Ichigo. This universe needs their Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" Yuzu said bluntly. \"Bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! Thank you, Ichigo Kurosaki. We're going to have so much fun together! now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait wait,\" Yuzu responded dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time for the fun part!\" Zangetsu then brought out a long Naginata from behind her back that began to glow at the blade. \"Don't worry, this won't hurt at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It never does,\" her master grinned. \"Thanks, Zangetsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Yuzu Kurosaki,\" Zangetsu smiled back. \"Just keep my name in mind even after everything changes. You'll probably need it to fight Scruffy Butt out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't need shikai last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but imagine how much cooler you'd be with it! Go make Rukia jealous.\" She then proceeded to jab the glowing blade right into her wielder's forhead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuzu suddenly fell into a dreamlike state and could only stare up at the sideways sky while her entire life was flashing before her eyes. Well, Ichigo's life, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying with a younger Karin and Yuzu, karate lessons as a child, his mom dying in his arms, his first meeting with Rukia, becoming a Soul Reaper, all the acinine things that happened after that, everything. Especially how much things escalated after the Grand Fisher, who used be her hardest opponet. She sure was going to have a lot on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, certain memories started to disappear like a burning piece of film. Soon enough, Yuzu had no memory of anything beyond her latest trip to her mother's gravesite. Just as soon, she couldn't remember the first four years of her life, or at least Ichigo's. It was then that these memories started to change rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's fourth birthday became little more than a subconscious memory and most of the two years following that became a blur, though she did remember playing with her younger brother and twin sister. These memories became consistantly clearer as Yuzu's memories became more vivid. By the time she was remembering when she was five, they became crystal clear. She recalled her mother's death, but forgot what it was like being there when she died. Any feeling of anger at herself for the death was replaced with pure sadness and the need to feel a void in her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was followed by a great knowledge of how to cook and clean and anything to keep her family together, even basic medical proceedures. She rembered tiny details like everyone's birthdays, favorite foods, how to read emotions, knowing what buttons to push with certain people at certain times, and which to never push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were memories and feelings any Yuzu would have no matter the universe, but with one small difference: for as long as she could remember, Yuzu could see ghosts. She wasn't sure how, but it was a definite fact. Her twin, Karin could see them a little, but always denied their existance. Her brother, Ichigo, could only see faint signs of them, though he could barely see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, she started to remember the events of barely a month ago.<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n\"You must take my zanpakuto and run it through the centre of your being, so that I may pour my powers into you. I can't gurantee you will live, but if it doesn't work, it won't matter,\" the beaten up raven haired girl said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then give it here,\" Yuzu responded with a rare look of intensity on her face while accepting the blade. \"I sure hope this better works, Ms. Soul Reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rukia. Rukia Kachiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Yuzu Kurosaki. I hope we can talk again after this. If either of us can still talk, that is.\" Even while stabbing herself and receiving great power, Yuzu couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Zangetsu asked while snapping her wielder out of her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am, Ms. Zangetsu,\" Yuzu smiled. \"Let's teach that fuzzy monster a lesson in hurting my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, Yuzy! Congratualations on learning my name, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me remember it.\"</span></div></div>",

Down the hatch!\" laughed Grand Fisher as he began to converge on Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Yuzu!\" cried Rukia. This couldn't be happening. Yuzu was going to die, and she couldn't do anything to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yuzu's body began to glow, her yellow aura began to erupt as Grand Fisher got off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the hell is this?!\" roared Grand Fisher. Just as suddenly, Yuzu began to move, slowly pushing herself off the ground. As she staggered to her feet, she glared at Grand Fisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've hurt my family too much! I won't let you get away with killing anyone else!\" she cried as she brought out Zangetsu again. Grand Fisher just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha! What can a little girl like you do? I'll kill you, just as I do your mother, and the same thing I'll do to everyone else here!\" he roared. Yuzu just gave a sweet smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mister, but that's not happening.\" she said as her yellow spiritual energy spiked again. She concentrated her energy on her sword, hearing it speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready Ms. Zangetsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just say the word!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her zanpakuto's confirmation, Yuzu gripped her sword with both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump, Zangetsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu glowed as yellow as her spiritual energy, beginning to elongate as Yuzu began to twirl it above her like a baton. The more she twirled, the longer it seemed to get until the energy vanished, revealing a long naginata weapon. The long handle was light purple, like Zangetsu's clothes in the inner world, the blade seemingly brimming with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia gasped as she looked. When did Yuzu learn her zanpakuto's shikai?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr, it doesn't matter what fancy tricks you have! I'll still eat you!\" he roared as he began to charge once again. He lunged at Yuzu, who casually jumped away at the attack. Angered, Grand Fisher lunged over and over again, failing to land any blows on Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you, damn brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's really bad language. You should go better.\" spoke Yuzu with an authoritative tone. Angered even more, Grand Fisher continued to attack. Just as he lunged, Yuzu used her sword to jump into the air, coming down with a deep slash through Grand Fisher's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHH!\" the beast roared in agony. Still focused, Yuzu began twirling her sword again above and behind her, as yellow energy began to build inside. Soon enough, the blade of the weapon was fully charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, time to put this to rest for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ready when you are!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getsuga Tensho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thrust of the pole weapon unleashed a wave of yellow energy, slashing straight through Grand Fisher's mask. In utter disbelief, the hollow thrashed in anger at the girl as it slowly crumbled into dust, ending the threat once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, Yuzu collapsed to the ground, catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Zangetsu, we did it!\" she cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excellent! Freakazoid is gone for good. And that technique was super awesome!\" </i>cheered Zangetsu as she reverted back to sword form. Yuzu giggled along with her zanpakuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything Ms. Zangetsu. You've done so much for me.\" said Yuzu with a grateful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, no problem. I live for this kind of stuff. Oh, and I think Rukia's going to want to question you. Bye!\"</i> cheered Zangetsu as Yuzu felt the spirit get away from her a bit as Rukia approched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu....that was....amazing. When did you learn your shikai?!\" asked Rukia, almost sounding like a proud mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now actually. Everything just seemed to come at once. Ms. Zangetsu was very cooperative.\" smiled Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Zangetsu. I hope the sword isn't making you call her that.\" sighed Rukia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's just me!\" smiled Yuzu as the girls enjoyed a brief laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're watching mom.\" prayed Yuzu at the gravestone of Masaki Kurosaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wierd, did something just happen? I feel like I missed something.\" said Karin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too.\" said Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. Now let's go home. I gotta start on dinner.\" said Yuzu with a cherry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Come on dad, stop smoking and let's go!\" called Karin to Isshin, who was indeed smoking one cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you promised not to smoke anymore!\" chided Yuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's only one, and I only do it on this day. Sue me.\" laughed Isshin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole family just groaned, but Yuzu was in a really good mood, so she let it slide. She felt like she had a boatload of things on her mind recently, but now everything seemed natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could only wonder what was in store for her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, as normal as things could be anyway. Ichigo was still his normal self. Defeating the ex-soul reaper Sosuke Aizen had taken quite a bit out of him. None the less, it was a proud victory and everyone returned home. Although, Ichigo felt sorry for Toshiro Hitsugaya, the captain of Squad 10. One of Aizen's illusions ended up forcing Toshiro to stab his longtime friend, Momo Hinamori. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta be rough for the poor guy\" said Ichigo as he continued his walk to school.

I will leave my body, control his body, even let him control mine for as long as it takes!\u201d Stark was staring at her in shock, but she didn't care, she wanted to ensure they (Stark and herself) would never be alone again. Aizen was just giving his normal smile, Gin was giving his normal grin and keeping his eyes in slits, and Kaname Tousen was saying how good she was for willing to go that far for justice. Aizen then said,\u201cVery well, and thank you f<b></b>or accepting this mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------1 hour later--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilinette was staring at a blade that seemed to glow brighter the more she concentrated, Stark whispered in her (not for long ear),\u201cYou don't have to do this, you know.\u201d Lilinette without taking her (soon to be Ichigo's) eyes of the blade said,\u201cI know, but I don't want to risk ever being alone again, so I'm doing this for us.\u201d Stark stared at her shocked that she would say that, but he also felt touched that she cared for him as much as he cared for her. Then Szayel-Apporo Granz entered the room and said,\u201cIt's ready.\u201d Just as he said this Lilinette's body fell over and the sword stopped getting brighter, Stark without a thought went over and picked up the body that spent all those years with him in the desert of Hueco Mundo, that woke him up, and beat him up; the light seemed to be gone from her eyes, but he knew her very being was in <u>that</u> sword. He suddenly felt a surge of anger that <u><b>that</b></u> sword took her away from him, and someone else would be in control of the body he came to love as a sister, he never met Ichigo Kurosaki, and no one here knows what he's like when he's not fighting. He almost grabbed the sword by the hilt be closer to Lilinette one last time before she left and became a he, hopefully temporarily, before he remembered the first person to touch the blade would enter Lilinette's (former?) body and she would enter theirs. So he left it alone, so he went to tie Liline-no-Ichigo's body up, so when she (from now on I will call Lilinette <i>he</i> and Ichigo <i>she</i> as that is what their new bodies are)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------after Ichigo picks up the sword--------Lilinette's P.O.V.-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilinette opened his eyes and said in a voice that she never heard before,\u201cDamn I hope that worked or I got this killer migraine for nothing.\" As soon as he finished, his eyes widened, he realized it worked, and some flashes from Ichigo's life flashed in front of his eyes; not much but enough so he wouldn't act suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------Ichigo's P.O.V.-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo woke to see a dark and cold room, the cold wouldn't of bothered her so much if she was in her human (clothes covering most of the body) body, but as this wasn't even her body (at least that morning when Lilinette was getting dressed) Ichigo was freezing as the clothing she was currently wearing was only two areas. Then Ichigo realized she had a mask on and a piece of her felt like it was\u2026gone! Ichigo then yelled,\u201c<b>What the damn hell is going on</b>?!?!\u201d As soon as she finished yelling this, her eyes widened\u2026and she looked down to see her new body; and then she screamed out of shock and a man with a goatee, somehow a mix of laziness/fear/and tiredness on his face, and a tattoo of the number \u20181\u2019 on his hand.</span></div></div>",

Ichigo turned to Stark and nearly yelled in her new voice,\u201cYou <b>have</b> to be joking! Why the <b><i>damn hell</i></b> did that jar fall on my head!?!?\u201d then in a more hopeful voice she asked,\u201cDo you have ways to clean people and their clothes without getting undressed?\u201d Stark was, pleasantly, suprised to hear this; this went that Ichigo probably wasn't a pervert like person and the blush on her face showed how embarrassing the idea of showering/bathing in her new body. Stark shook his head to clear his thoughts <i>and</i> reply \u2018no\u2019 to Ichigo's question. After she saw this she started cursing under her breath then suggested,\u201cWhat if I don't bathe, then I don't have to see\u2026<i>myself</i>\u2026nude?\u201d Stark would've thought this was a good idea, <u><i><b>but</b></i></u> then her body would get sick and he didn't want that to happen. After voicing this to Ichigo (they were both on the way to Stark and Liline-no-Ichigo's quarters) Ichigo replied angrily,\u201cThen I'm going to either shower or take a bath, which one should I do?\u201d Stark thought about it,<i>\u2018Hmmm\u2026</i><i> If she takes a bath the water would distort the image so she won't get a clear view of everything, but Ichigo will still get to see alot; a shower would make it harder to see her body but it will be clearer</i>.\u2019 after a minute of waiting Stark answered,\u201cYou should\u2026</span></div></div>",

Did it go back to its owner or something? Oh well, perhaps he could mention it to Rukia later or something like that.

Mizuiro was a bit shorter than Ichigo, but he was slowly starting to look bigger in Ichigo's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he asked himself. He briefly looked around, seeing some other girls walking by. Ichigo was a bit surprised to see that he was close to about eye-to-eye with them, when he was normally much taller than them. He briefly looked at his body, which looked normal except for the height thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I hallucinating?\" he asked himself. He certainly wasn't prone to being insane, given his line of work and all that. However, he wasn't sure what kind of work made him perceive himself as being much shorter. Orihime would probably be as tall as him if this was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could just get to school and calm down.

He hadn't met anyone else he knew along the way, to which he was kind of grateful for. He wasn't much in the mood to talk when his mind was occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as he passed more girls along the way, he continually noticed that he was eye level with almost all of them, almost making him feel small in comparison to the men. That was bizarre for Ichigo, who was pretty tall for a guy normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the school appearing within his field of vision got his mind off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe I'm actually looking forward to class, but if it'll get my mind off of this crap, then by all means.\" he muttered as he soon walked up the steps to the school. Getting everything all prepped, he opened his locker, got what he needed, and then began walking to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICHIGO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo jumped behind Ichigo, to which the soul reaper just replied with a backward fist to his face as per usual. The redhead collapsed to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you just stop doing that?\" asked Ichigo in annoyance. However, Keigo got right up and gave a surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, are you alright? That punch didn't feel nearly as hard as you normally do it. You need to work out more.\" laughed Keigo, as if being punched was absolutely fine with him now. After Keigo walked away, Ichigo took a look at his hand, to which he tensed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the hell?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand looked a bit smaller. Actually, ALL of him looked a bit smaller. It wasn't just his height, which seemed unchanged from earlier, but his body build didn't seem to fill out as much as usual. His hands especially looked smaller and....actually a bit softer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am losing it.\" he groaned to himself. However, the school bell soon rang, getting Ichigo's mind off of it and sending him running towards class. As he ran though, he didn't notice stands of dark hair beginning to form from his scalp.</span></div></div>",

However, his question basically answered itself as soon as he got closer to the two girls. He had to actually look up to Orihime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is going on here!\" he shouted to no one in particular. He might as well have shouted it to everyone, since it certaintly gained all of his classmates' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Ichigo?\" Orihime asked worryingly. This was followed by a quick gasp as she noticed she was looking <i>down </i>at him. Ichigo used to be a good seven inches taller than her, but now he looked about three inches <b>shorter</b>. In fact, his hair seemed to have strays of dark hair. Honestly, she couldn't think of doing anything to do but drag Ichigo to the hallway to cause a little bit less of a scene. So, she did. In fact, it was rather easy. Ichigo seemed noticablely lighter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvenient. Strange if not downright disturbing, but neat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, what's going on with your....\" The Inoue girl couldn't think of enough words to describe the situation, so she just signaled Ichigo's entire body. His short, hairless, almost dainty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Orihime,\" he answered with a cracking voice. Great, now even his voice was embarrassing. \"I was just walking over to school and started shrinking. Either I'm going through reverse puberty or something's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo thought a little bit about what else happened before he started changing. \"Well... Yuzu made breakfast as usual, checked my phone for messages, got dressed, headed out, found a zanpaktou that...vanished into thin air...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that might be why you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely, yes,\" Ichigo answered before Orihime could even get her question out. \"Dammit, I have to get a way to stop this, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, your head's looking a little...curved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Ah, hell! Orihime, I have to go find out what's wrong with me. I'm putting you in charge of keeping Kon under control.\" With that said, he popped in his Soul Candy and ejected into Soul Reaper mode before jumping out the nearest window.</span></div></div>",

Further investigation proved that there was nothing to investigate. There was nothing. Zelch. Nada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Nothing's here!\" Ichigo couldn't help but shout. Even as he did, he noticed his voice sounded higher than usual, at least by a pitch. \"Maybe somebody in Soul Society is responsible for this.\" Well, it was the only thing he had close to a lead. So, he drew out his cell phone that had been updated to communicate with Soul Society and dialed Rukia's number. Perhaps she could shed light on the situation. Somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" the female Soul Reaper answered after a short dial tone. \"Ichigo, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's wrong. Very wrong,\" he answered with his voice cracking up still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! What's wrong with your your voice, Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing. Somehow, I've only become five feet tall, my muscles are disappearing, and my hair is dark now. Honestly, I think I'm starting to look more like a girl. That, or Hanatarou. Either way, it's not a good position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible. What could have caused you to change like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was this zanpaktou I found laying on the ground that later vanished into thin air, so that may be related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to see you for myself to confirm. This better not be a prank, Ichigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you it isn't. Now hurry up! My hair's starting to grow down to my back! It feels weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm on my way. Just meet me by the bridge in a couple minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you then.\" They both hung up, leaving Ichigo to run over to the Karakura Bridge as fast as possible with his newly elongated hair to rush in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope she knows <i>something</i>,\" he said to himself with an extremely girly voice that managed to stay melodious through the fright.</span></div></div>",

It was beginning to be pretty obvious what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Ichigo landed on the bridge, thankful that no normal citizens could see him like this. As a minute passed, he felt the pressure in his chest building. He hugged himself a bit, as if trying to hold it in. However, it didn't help at all, as he saw breasts beginning to poke through his Soul Reaper outfit a bit. They weren't really big, like Rangiku or anything, but they were definitely there. The lack of a bra really felt weird to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy.\" groaned Ichigo as he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he stayed there, he soon felt a squirming feeling in his face. He groaned in discomfort as he put his hands to his face. In his hands, he could feel his face starting to get softer, and more petite from the feel of it. He jumped down to the river below, putting his hands down as he looked in the reflection. He gasped as he saw his features soften, his eyes becoming a different color as his face completely reshaped itself. It began to look similar to someone he might have seen at one point or another, but he wasn't too sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could go wrong?\" he asked himself, his hand going to his mouth as his voice was now completely melodious.</span></div></div>",

With Rukia, it'd finally be more than just self depreciation. He let out one big groan of displeasure that gradually turned to a moan as he felt <i>something </i>slip. Yep, Ichigo couldn't deny it anymore. He was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, what's wr-\" Rukia blinked a little bit before the spiritual door behind her closed. \"Oh! Liutenant Hinamori. Didn't know you were here in Karakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liutenenant Hinamori? Who the hell is that?\" Ichigo asked in said liutenant's exact voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some type of joke? Wait... Did Ichigo set you up to this?!\" Her face turned into a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I <b>am </b>Ichigo, whether my body reflects that or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Liutenant, but I know this has to be some sort of prank. Let me guess, Renji's on it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Rukia, this isn't some joke! <b>I AM ICHIGO!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukia did have to admit, she'd never seen Liutenant Hinamori snap like that. Either she was a really good actor, or all of reality was shattering. She was going to go with the actor choice. Though, she did have to give her a benefit of a doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, <i>Ichigo</i>, answer me this one question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great. The old \"only he would know\" test. How original.\" The liutenant really could imitate Ichigo uncannily. There had to be something that only Ichigo would know and that he wouldn't <i>ever </i>tell anyone else. Wait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, tell me: What was the name of the hollow that attacked your family the night we met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo paused. \"The hell am I supposed to know?!

He furrows his brow while trying to figure things out and his gaze travels downwards. \"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in his school uniform, but over it he was wearing an apron for some reason.

The sword is gone, but that isn't even the problem. He could care less about a thing. The real problem is his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't even like he ended up in Soul Society or the like. The look of the town is like none he had seen before. He looks about and finds himself in a rather empty area. Maybe something along the lines of a back street that doesn't get alot of traffic. \"Where the heck am I?\" he asks as he scratches his head which was tingling a bit. Upon touching his hair he frowns some and runs his fingers through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt thicker for some reason. Maybe longer than he usual too. In fact it was long enough he could feel it tickle over his ears and along his neck. It is even long enough he is able to pull some strands into view and he goes a bit wide eyed that his hair has lightened to a blonde. As if the new surroundings weren't weird enough his hair seems to want to keep growing. Longish bangs with the back not seeming to want to stop until it is down to about his rear. There is then a tugging as the hair in the back is pulled into twin tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls one of the tails to drape over a shoulder and stares at it. Whatever that sword did can't be good.

He ungracefully tripped over trash cans and rubbish tossed around at the sides of the alley, but still scrambled for the open street just ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place was like a combination of traditional Japanese architecture and new age technology.

His socks were also slowly getting devoured by the shoes themselves, pretty soon Ichigo's naked skin showed underneath the shoes. Worst of all, the heels of the sneakers were slowly rising making it harder for the teenager to balance himself as he ran and the size of both shoes dropped several numbers, tightening their grip on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't even notice any of the changes on his feet. By the time Ichigo reached the larger street, his sneakers had completely transformed into a black pair of high heeled shoes. A crowd of people, dressed in very odd clothing, gathered around stalls and houses that lined the sidewalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe one of them could tell Ichigo what was going on, or the very least where he was.</span></div></div>",

Not only that something seemed really off about how he is standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps over to a stall where an elderly man was selling trinkets. \"Ahh, sir?\" he says seeming uncertain as he looks about. His feet ached slightly less, but that isn't because he has stopped running. It is the fact his feet are shrinking to fit the heels he now wears. On top of that the nails ended up coated in a blue polish by the time his feet had finished changing. It made it easier to balance on those heels as well which made him forget about things feeling off down there  for now. There were more important things to worry about right now anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly man looks up and he then goes a slight bit wide eyed before offering a smile and standing up. \"Ahh, did not expect to see you here. Out for a walk and getting out of that stuffy office?\" he asks. Of course the question itself just confuses Ichigo. Is he being mistaken for someone now? Things are just getting weirder and the fact things just seem to be going downhill is frustrating him more.</span></div></div>",

The loose fitting jeans he had been wearing began to take on a deeper shade of blue, to the point where they were almost black. The material of the pants also softened, becoming stretchy and almost like latex. As the material changed composition, the pants themselves slowly clung tighter to his legs becoming a small woman's size. The cuffs shrunk up his legs, stopping at about halfway up his shins. When the transformation finally stopped, his new pants looked uncomfortably small on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath his pants, Ichigo's briefs also began to shrink to a much too small size. Their clean white color shifted to a faded pink tone as the fabric lost more of it's thickness. In just a manner of seconds, he was wearing a pair of woman's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now though, he was far too wrapped up in his debate with the old man to notice the change.</span></div></div>",

The old man on the otherhand is looking more worried at the fact that something is very wrong, for reasons different than Ichigo, and he isn't the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are quite a few people that are looking now and murmuring to one another. Someone even goes running off quickly after a discussion. To them seeing an irate and confused Hokage is not a good thing and obviously some help is needed. It looks like someone is quickly grabbing the proper help in settling Ichigo down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to know how I got here! I don't know why you keep calling me that!\" the teen fumes as changes further start to affect him. His legs itch momentarily as the hair starts to fall out. Calves start to tone and become more womanly while thighs also gain plushness to them and fill out the pants a bit more properly.

Do I look like a lady to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fight went on, more strange changes happened to Ichigo's wardrobe. The sleeves of his white polo school shirt which he had been wearing began to shrink further up his arms, to the point where they became sleeveless. The collar of his polo started to stretch out in front of him, exposing a large portion of his naked chest. As this happened, the color of the shirt changed from white to light gray. Solid blue lines, which matched his new pant's color, also began to form on his shirt. It twisted and turned, becoming more like a traditional Japanese blouse meant for a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's belt, which had been securing his pants for a time, migrated to the outside of his new blouse. There it grew both larger and softer, as it it were made out of cloth. In just a few moments of changing, it looked more like a sash than a belt that again matched the color of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most noticeable addition, however, was the large green mass that had formed on his back. It spread all over his upper, covering his arms and shoulders like a large jacket. As the mass hardened, it looked more and more like a giant green robe. Letters formed on the back of it, spelling out the word \"Gamble\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ichigo finally take notice to the changes?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hands that have gotten smaller and are covered in the same blue polish that his toenails. He then looks down and realizes finally what has happened to his outfit that makes his heart start racing. \"Who is doing this?!\" he sputters and he looks around at all the gawkers. \"This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage please calm do-\" The shouts are drowned out as Ichigo steps away, and turns about to break into a mad dash again.

He was starting to look like a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, his entire torso began to constrict and lean itself out. This made his hips look even more flaring as his entire stomach grew thinner and more womanly around the sides. All of his body lost any extra body fat, save for his big round bottom. There was no sign yet of any breasts, which while running Ichigo was immensely thankful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think!\" Ichigo shouted to himself. \"You picked up the sword! Everything went black! You woke up here! Things started changing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit him. \"That's it! The sword did this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was mostly alone in the alley, Ichigo skidded to a halt. He frantically started to look around on his person for any signs of the missing blade.

I gotta undo this somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a voice called out to him from the entrance to the alley. \"I thought I'd might find you here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo turned around.

But just because it went dark did not mean he wasn't conscious, it felt like his mind was being dragged through a rusty, old pipe that was too small. Each second added to a growing migraine until Ichigo was able to open his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Ichigo saw though, was something very different than what he expected to see. He expected to see the same path that he took to school that morning, or maybe an enemy, even a random soul reaper. But this was very different. A sewer. A dirty, rusted, run down sewer with bars just ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling with anger, something that Ichigo did not realize at the moment, he ran forward towards the bars, feeling strange while he ran, but not knowing why. Once Ichigo made it to the bars, he charged right into them, expecting to break them with his reiatsu. But to Ichigo's surprise, the bars held firm and even hurt him when he crashed into them more than they should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked down in frustration, only to gasp at what he saw. For in the reflection of the water below him, he saw a big fox that was looking right back at him with wide eyes. Ichigo yelped and jumped back, only to see a few giant tails as he did so. Ichigo spun around, catching glimpses of his new body, and getting a sinking feeling in his stomach as he looked at his reflection again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo spoke to himself, \"This can't be real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime, that could have been hours or minutes passed, Ichigo stood up on four legs and walked towards the bars again, hoping to see something that could explain this. But, as Ichigo got up, he noticed that something felt very strange on the lower half of his body. So, with two hind legs pushed closer together, he found out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's roar of anger woke up a sleeping Naruto.</span></div></div>",

The young boy let out a sigh of relief, and lied back down, when nothing scary popped out at him, only to start freaking out when he realized that he had no idea where he was and that it looked like a really poorly maintained sewer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sound of someone shouting, \"Why the hell am I a girl fox?! What the hell is going on here?! I mean seriously-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood up, making a face when he realized that the back of his pajamas were soaked with the water now, and started walking towards the sound of the voice, curious as to what a lot of the words meant as old man Hokage called them 'grown up words' when he asked what they meant before. Soon enough, he saw a gigantic fox marching back and forth in a really big cage while talking aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Naruto a few moments to realize that the fox was the one speaking, \"WHAT THE HELL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo stopped talking and turned his/her head to see who spoke. Upon seeing Naruto, Ichigo barked out, \"Oi, kid. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, not wanting to look scared, walked forward, \"The name's Naruto Uzumaki! Remember it, fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo roared, \"DON'T CALL ME THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fell down from the strength of the roar alone and was staring at the vixen with fear on his face. Ichigo, feeling bad for scaring Naruto, sighed, \"Sorry, kid. It's just...I was a high school teenage boy just a few hours ago, and now I'm a gigantic female fox with no idea where I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo let his/her body fall down in resignation at the last word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as he guessed what was going on, \"I know what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's eyes widened and turned all of his/her attention to the short boy, Naruto continued, \"Eight years ago, a giant fox attacked the village, but the Hokage killed it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo opened his/her mouth to say that he had no idea what Naruto was talking about, but the boy continued before he/she could say anything, \"What if that fox wasn't killed, but was slowly coming back to life, and...and you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pointed at the visibly confused vixen now, \"You must have gotten sucked in or something and your mind took over the kyuubi's while it was weakened. You're a hero! You saved the village without even knowing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wanted to correct Naruto, he/she truly did, but Ichigo also didn't want to crush the look of pure joy on Naruto's face for 'figuring it out,' so instead replied with, \"I guess that's possible, but how do you know that I'm not the fox that attacked eight years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted, \"I'm a great judge of character, I can just tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wanted to smack him on the head for being so naive, but refrained because he/she wasn't entirely what was going on, and that this kid might be his/her only company for awhile now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ichigo was lost in thought, coming up with his/her own theories, Naruto went into Ichigo's cage, and pet one of the vixen's front legs. Ichigo jumped back at the feeling, and Naruto said in a smug voice, \"See? If you really were that fox, you would have crushed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's eye twitched, and returned to his/her slumped position, trying to ignore Naruto's laughter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Along the way to school, Ichigo Kurosaki was carrying on his usual routine, when an unknown hollow reiatsu filled the air. It was so dense, tears were forming in the air. Suddenly, Ichigo could see translucent images of people walking about, doing various things, but they didn't look like wholes. \"What the hell is going on...\" These people were of various level of transparency, some passing through one another, but what really shocked Ichigo was that he saw at least 60+ incarnations of the same people doing different things, and their numbers were growing. Out of nowhere, a catgirl in a pink dress showed up, fighting a horned elephantine monstrosity. Both were transparent too. He couldn't hear what she was saying, but knew she was talking, then pulled out some kind of heart-shaped item with a gold bell on it from a bell tied to her tail. Behind her, a garganta was opening. A voice said, \"Excellent, the walls separating the many possibilities of the multiverse are falling apart. Reality will be mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cue!!\" Ichigo went to use his substitute soul reaper badge, when it struck the bell of the heart shaped weapon the catgirl had as she ran through him as it touched him. To his surprise, it resonated with the bell, ringing, then unleashing vast reiatsu discharges. The voice said, \"Damn!! There was unknown energy spike before the realities merged. The energy is unstable now!! I have to abort...\" Ichigo's vision blanked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he was on the street, but he noticed he was still standing, like he never fell down when he passed out. A female voice he never heard before yelled at him, \"What's your problem, Ichigo?! Finish the chimera anima already!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blinks slowly, looking around, then sees the strange monstrosity from before, the one that catgirl was fighting, throwing an innocent bystander with its trunk, then charging right for him. \"I don't know what you're talking about, but if you mean stop that, I'm all for it!!\" Ichigo stands his ground and grabs the monster's tusks, and manages to grind the beast's blitz to a halt next to a giant fountain. \"Whoa, when did Ichigo get that strong?\" another unfamiliar voice said to him. Looking to his right, he saw a blue-haired girl in a blue minidress, sleevelets, garter belt, and ankle boots, but on her back were tiny black bird wings and and plume of tailfeathers rested above her butt. Next to her was a little extremely blonde-haired girl, maybe Yuzu's age, Ichigo figured, wearing a short-legged yellow leotard with puffy sleevelets on her arms, yellow leggings on her shins, mocassins on her feet, and fingerless furry gloves, but she also had furry monkey ears and a monkey's tail curled up behind her. However, most shocking was when Ichigo saw his own reflection in running water from the fountain they were next to. He was looking back at the catgirl from before... The catgirl was HIS reflection!! \"What the hell!!\" He thought about it, then yelled, \"The hollow!!\" Forgetting about the beast before him, it swatted him away with its trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hollow? What's Ichigo going on about?\" the blue haired birdgirl said. In the sky, a humanoid figure popped up. Ichigo saw the was a brown-haired pointy-eared boy... well he thinks he's a boy, because the twin pigtails do seem goofy on a boy, as well as the loose red rest tied with the black ribbon, wearing black shorts. \"Met your match yet, 'granny' Ichigo?\" Ichigo was confused. He knew the body was in couldn't be no older than his own... What was up with this boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, he's coming for you again!!\" the monkey girl said, as the birdgirl seemed to go after the strange boy. Ichigo looked around for his weapon, or any weapon, but was at a loss. \"If I just had Zangetsu, this would be a cakewalk... Wait, just like when Uruhara was training me... I'll just sense him!!\" Ichigo closes his eyes to feel out for the reiatsu of Zangetsu, and feels an energy coming from the bell on this body's tail. He reaches for it and pulls out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo reaches into the tail bell, and with a deft pull, draws Zangetsu from its depths. Everyone stops in awe and surprise. \"When did Ichigo get a sword?!\" the monkey girl blurted. Ichigo charged at the monster, and then flash steps behind the beast, cutting the monster in its rear legs, severing its tendons. \"That'll slow you... What the hell?!\" He was shocked by the rapid regeneration of the creature, and at turned to swing its trunk and tusks again, and Ichigo blocks with Zangetsu. The monster quickly uses the remainder of the trunk to launch a second attack, but Ichigo flash steps back. \"You're through. Getsuga...\" The strange boy stared in disbelief at the glowing blue energy building on the blade, and how much power he could feel coming off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where has Ichigo been hiding this power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tensho!!\" The zanpaku-to technique cleaves the beast, disintegrating in the process. In the reiatsu dust however was a perfectly healthy elephant. Behind it, though, a wall and several trees in a nearby park were leveled. Thoroughly scared, the boy bolstered all his strength, enough that Ichigo knew he needed to up his game. As the boy flew in with his fist drawn, screaming, \"I'm not scared of you or your freaky new sword!!\" Ichigo channeled his reaitsu and said, \"Bankai!!\" However, before Ichigo could undergo any sort of bankai transformation, another strange pointy-eared being showed up, looking closer to Ichigo's age, with lavender hair, shows up and stops the boy, telling him, \"We must fall back for now and analyze this newfound power of Ichigo's.\" They seem to teleport away. Ichigo disperses the reaitsu and sheathes the sword back in the bandage wrapping, throwing it over his shoulder, but found that Zangetsu was much larger compared to this girl's body, so Zangetsu nearly scraped the cement. The birdgirl ran up and asked, \"What was that? Getsuga Tensho? Bankai?! Where's your Strawberry Bell? Where's our Ichigo?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to know that one...\" Ichigo said, looking at his reflection again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Karakura Town, a different Ichigo was getting up. She looked like she did in her world, but she wasn't dressed like she was. All of a sudden, she heard a strange female voice call out to her, \"Ichigo!! Ichigo!!\" Before she knew what was going on, she found her, and grabbed her by her strange new black clothes. \"Alright? Who are you, what did you do to Ichigo, and why are you dressed like a soul reaper, and giving off soul reaper reaitsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo mumbled, \"Huh, who are you? I'm just as confused!! Please don't hurt me...\" She saw her reflection in a car window. She still had her ears and tail like she would as Mew Ichigo, and was wearing the tail bell she would wear as Mew Ichigo, but her hair was red like her normal human hair, the bow was black, and her clothes were some kind of pink shihakusho under a black shihakusho over a hakama tied by a pink sash, and on her feet were socks and waraji (straw sandals). On the sash is a sword with a shape similar to the Strawberry Bell on the end. \"Speak now!!\" the raven haired women yelled at Ichigo. However, before this woman could do anything to Ichigo, a wiry man with bluish hair and glasses stops her and says, \"Rukia, stop!!\" He grabs her hand and tells her, \"Look at her.\" Ichigo was crying in fear; fear of this new place, fear of this new situation, fear of not knowing what these people will do to her. However, the man goes on, \"Something says she might not be involved. Besides, her reiatsu isn't like the massive reiatsu we felt before. I think we should get her side of the story. Let's take her back to Urahara's shop with Ichigo's body.\" Rukia puts her down, but keeps a dirty scowl directed at Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow us.\" she says coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Cafe Mew Mew, Ryou is looking over Zangetsu, while Ichigo talks to the the genius and the girls, who now look completely human. \"So, give it to me straight; what the hell happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyou said, \"I really don't know yet, but if I were to go by your fantastic story, I'd say when you went to use your 'substitute soul reaper badge' to fight this 'hollow,' it reacted with Ichigo's Strawberry Bell and tore open a wormhole that swapped your souls. I do know some good news and some bad news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news first.\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your powers, we can neutralize the alien threat in no time, not to mention it opens up all new kinds of research opportunities...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not very good news.\" Ichigo exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and the bad?\" Pudding (the blonde monkey girl from before, now all human in a yellow waitress outfit) asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Ichigo's power seems to have stabilized Ichigo's Red Data, to a fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Pudding remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we get our Ichigo back, she will be permanently stuck in her Mew form for life.\" Everyone gasped, except Ichigo, who was a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Who do we follow now?</i></div></span></div></div>",

As he continued walking, he didn't notice that the steps he was taking slowly began to change. At first, he had found it a bit difficult to walk in the platform sandals. However, with each step he took, his gait seemed to become more feminine, until he was walking perfectly in them, almost as if he wore them all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a while, he took another look down at what he was currently wearing. Strangely though, as Ichigo looked at the clothes this time, he wasn't as bothered by what he was wearing as he had been earlier. He didn't think it was as bad as he had earlier. For a second, he thought he kinda like it a bit. He then shook his head in confusion. He didn't want to wear this! He then looked around, and as he was walking, he noticed a clothing store. \"Maybe I could go in and get something better to wear.\" he said to himself out loud.</span></div></div>",

No longer in his school uniform, he now wore a red corset and skirt with short, puffy light green sleeves, and over the corset he wore a magenta coat. He also now wore black gloves were elbow length and thigh high socks of the same color and red high heeled pumps.

Looking around, he found himself in the clearing of a wooded area that he didn't recognize as any of the woods around Karakura town. He then noticed his appearance with surprise. He was dressed only in a pair of red-and-white sneakers and a pair of white gloves. Ohter than that, he was buck-naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!? How did I get here, and why am I dressed like this?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up, he tried frantically to cover as much of himself as he could with his hands; not that it helped much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that I'm almost naked! Where did all of my clothes go?!?\" he exclaimed to himself. Looking around the clearing, it was clear to him that his clothes where nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better find my clothes before anyone sees me like this,\" said Ichigo. He wanted to hurry so he took off running, only to find that he was going much MUCH faster than normal! It was going so fast that he didn't really see where he was going and ended up running right into a tree next to a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back up (after having let out several grunts of pain) Ichigo noticed something odd in the lake.  He was shocked when he saw what it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a humanoid-looking blue hedgehog-like creature! It was down in the lake looking up at him; or that's what he thought, until he noticed that the hedgehog-creature perfectly mimicked everything he did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, even though he still looked human, his reflection had been changed into that of this hedgehog-thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's scream could be heard throughout the whole forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next???</span></div></div>",

As he walked further he felt a sudden feeling of queasiness settle in his stomach, ducking into an alley, he ditched his bag and grabbed his chest, stifling a moan as his bones began to ace like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, his body began to change, his body began to shrink slightly til he was about an inch shorter, arms thinning and becoming more ladylike, the callouses he had worked so hard to achieve giving way to dainty fingers that look liked they had never worked a day in their life, his nails were manicured with a thin layer of clear nail varnish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes back in pleasure as he felt his hard abbs give way to a soft, sensual stomach. his waist began to pull itself inwards, compounded by his hips pushing out against his hips pushing outwards, causing the stitches of his pants to groan in protest. He bit down on his lip as he felt his legs thin to that of a beautiful woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen mewled of pleasure and pain as he felt something shrinking at his throat, coming out as a feminine purr. His new female arms encircled his chest, his ass cheeks plumping to that of a large and succulent peach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell is happening!?.\" He wondered to himself only to stop at how he sounded. <i>he</i> sounded like a she, seductive and husky, like men would drop their pants with just a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his hair begin to lose its trademark spikiness till it was smooth as silk. it began to grow, slowly but surely till it touched the base of his neck before forming into a high class bob cut, the color shifting from vibrant orange to black, not the glossy black that he associated with Rukia's hair but a deep black, as if someone had spilled ink in his hair. His light brown eyes slowly shifted to a golden brown as his facial features began to morph, decidedly feminine Chinese features replacing boyish Japanese ones, his lips plumping and glowing with clear lip gloss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp burst form his throat as he felt his chest swell, large newly made D cup breasts swelling forth, hard brown nipples pushing against his school shirt, newly formed nerve endings parroting new found joy. finally he felt it, a tingling in his most sacred area. \"No!\" he cried out in the voice of a woman, not that, it was all he had left. Alas, with a fizzle and a tingle, he felt his manhood wither into nothingness, a set of beautiful lips replaced them, looking as if they had always belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat changes next? </span></div></div>",

He looks around, but sees it no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange.... I'd better talk to Hat-and-clogs about this later. But nothing seems out of place here at least.\" Ichigo scratches his head before running off, not intending to be late for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu is looking around frantically across the rooftops, a panicked expression on her face. \"I must find that sword soon. If master Mayu- Ahh!\" a snap sounds through the air as Nemu's body is suddenly wracked in pain, falling to her knees as the shadowy figure of her master walks up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri seeths, \"You blundering idiot!\" Slaps her to the ground. \"Moron!\" Kicks her in the stomach. \"Do you have any idea what you have done?!\" He continues to kick her, barely letting her speak a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu struggles to speak, \"...Ma-Master..... I-..I hear...gah!... heard you nee-...ugh.... to tes-..... cough.... test it!....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri stops kicking her for a moment. \"To test it?! Did you not even read the notes that it won't work for a woman?!\" Nemu just looks at him confused. Mayuri delivers a strong kick into her stomach, sending her flying into the roof's cement railing. Mayuri yells, \"You blundering buffoon! If someone finds that before us, the Soul Society firing me will be the least of our concerns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu weakly gets up, coughing up blood, as she gets curious, \"The-Then why did you make it, Master Mayuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri fumes, \"I was tired of having to limit myself to such a limited amount of test subjects in our squad on my greater experiments. After the Zanpaktou incident, Muramasa's widespread capability to effect those zanpaktous around him caught my interest, and I was curious as to if I could create something to an even greater effect without his feeble limitations with different effects. I ended up succeeding beyond my wildest expectations. With that tool alone, the entire Soul Society could bow to my power alone just through threat of controlling it. But, were it to come into the hands and be absorbed into another male's hands without knowing how to control it, the results would be disasterous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu, standing firmer, loyal still to her master, asks next, \"What results, Master Mayuri? What does the sword do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri grumbles, \"Do I have to explain EVERYTHING?\" He sighs as he prepares for a lengthy speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri takes a breath, then explains, \"That sword is absorbed into the individual's body, down to the very fabric of the soul in which one's zanpaktou spirits resides. Even they become effected from its powers, so as to prevent them from gaining control of it. It'll turn those near the user into submissive doting female servants around the users age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu interupts, \"Female, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri slaps her for interfering, \"Don't interupt me! ... Yes, female. It was designed for me, and I'm a male. You really think I'd accept just any loyal servants? I don't claim to succumb to such... primitive... urges as commonly as most lower lifeforms, but even I have a preference. Why else do you think I made you the way you are, you weak excuse for an experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu hesitantly asks, \"If I may, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri glares, but doesn't stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu continues, \"I am born from your blood, so would that not count under inc-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri blanches, \"Incest? You actually believe in that psychological drivel? You idiot!\" He slaps her again. \"As if I'll let some idiotic taboo prevent my work! That sword completely ignores such things. What irks me more is that somehow naturally growing women like that lazy blonde 10th lieutenant ended up growing up better than my version of perfection that you were SUPPOSED to be.... Not this time though. And this time, I made sure that you flaws weren't included in the changes, you idiotic girl. Not only will those changed be submissive and loyal to their master, I used the so called emotion of 'love' to ensure loyalty, unlike your flawed disloyalties. And not just those facsimiles often heard of in childish stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu raises an eyebrow, \"How do you mean, Master Mayuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri sighs with an aggravated sigh, too frustrated to slap her, \"I'm not some incomplete buffoon to use methods that'll only result in some sex slave or giddy fan girl. Lust may indeed be involved, and they'd be sure to be turned into attractive developed women unlike that flat board girl Kuchiki. But, it is much more involved than that. Those changed will want to spend their life with the user, actually feeling.... blech... 'happy' to be with and serve the user. Just thinking of him will bring happiness, while simultaneously driving the victims to want to serve and aid him. But I'm not so blind as to make this blind them to their own health. What's the point of servants if they become useless? With this though, they won't mind sharing the user, which would have gained me an army of servants. Not even the head captain could resist its effects. But ugh... making him into a servant? It would be degrading if it didn't make the results around the user's age. And if my preferences were to change, I made it so that the user could even change the results.... but that's only in those of someone that can control it! Not even I know how suggestible the sword will be in some idiot's soul. It'd still retain its default settings, but that could change at any time by the user without the user even knowing it. We must find it before an epidemic occurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu pauses, \"But, Master Mayuri, what's to prevent us from coming under the sword's effect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri gasps upon realization. He hadn't realized that. \"We must act fast then. If we come under its effects, we'll be too submissive and love struck to remove it before the effect becomes permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu asks, \"Permanent? How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri, \"A day at most, half a day in the least if we're unlucky. But the stronger the spirit, the less time it'll take to become a permanent fixture of it. As long as it doesn't wind up in someone of captain level or higher spiritual energy, we still have at least 12 hours.\" Unknown to them, Ichigo sneezes as he runs to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly depart, still uncertain as to where to start their fervent search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue this story, or something else?</span></div></div>",

At least I won't be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo continues towards the school, not realizing he's only at the calm before the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Elsewhere--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what the heck is it, old timer? Sure is breeming with power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo figures, one dressed in white and one in black, stand upon a world on its side, glass floor of building windows as they stare at a glowing blue katana stuck into one of the steel rafters of the building they're standing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know. However, we should be cautious. It could prove dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo laughs, \"All the better for me! Perhaps I can use it to finally take over this weak chump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu stands in his way as he begins to approach the glowing sword. \"I advise against it. We do not know what wielding it may do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo just flash steps passed him. \"I don't listen to our 'king'. What makes you think I'll listen to you, old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu glares at the hollow as he reaches a hand out to grab the sword. Before he can even grab it, it bursts forth with energy, enough so for Zangetsu to look away despite his dark glasses. Zangetsu hears a scream..... but, it's higher pitch than it should be. He turns to look, only for his eyes to widen and his pupils to dilate. It was good for him to be cautious after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the ground, sitting in pain from being blasted back, was Hollow Ichigo.... or what used to be him. In his place was now a beautiful woman, her white kimono open wide enough and tight enough to show as much cleavage as Rangiku, along with a wild spikey main of hair pulled down by gravity to the small of her back. Also, it'd seem his formerly white skin was now closer to that of a human. A pale human, sure, but closer to human none-the-less. She has a pout on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww.... that hurt, damn it. I was hoping this could make Ichi-king come back.\" She hisses at the sword as she stands up as she pouts. \"I miss our master. And we still need to make him stronger. If he's gonna protect his friends, he'll need all the help he can get to bring it out. He's still so pathetically weak. Hmm.... perhaps we could train him? Then, perhaps he'd give me some 'lessons in instinct' in return.\" She giggles at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu snaps out of his shock as he replies, \"Do you even realize what it is you are saying? Have you taken a look at what that sword did to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo looks down at herself, then looks at him confused, \"What the heck are you talkin' about, old timer? I'm the same sexy self I've always been.\" She pushes her breasts together for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu calmly states, \"No, you are not. It appears that blast has changed not only your body, but your mind as well. It almost sounded like you wanted to rape Ichigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo promptly blushes and frantically waves her hands in denial, \"No, no, no! You crazy, old man? I can't force it on him.\" Zangetsu raises an eyebrow. \"... He's the man here. He should be the one to take the lead.\" Zangetsu's eyes bulge at her seductive smirk. \"But, though I won't force him if he doesn't want it, doesn't mean I can't give him...\" she slips her kimono down to nearly bare a tit. \"...plenty of suggestions. If I can convince him to 'take me', all the better. Even if I have to beg for it. Though he's the only one I'd ever do so for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu actually blushes at that, causing her to laugh a surprisingly melodious cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo calms herself, \"What's with ya? And where's your stache you always have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu raises an eyebrow, \"What are you talking about? I've never been able to grow a mustache in my life. I can barely grow my beard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo suddenly has a glazed over expression and shakes her head, \"Yeah, guess so. Don't know what I was thinkin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu pauses. <i>Wait. If her memories were altered. Then.....</i> Zangetsu raises a hand, and a mirror forms from the glass they're standing on. He looks at himself. His chin is now thinner, his mustache is gone, and his beard is at least half as thick as it was before. His expression doesn't even change as he doesn't notice as the facial hair retracts right in front of his face, getting thinner by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu calmly states, \"I don't look any different than normal.... or do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo pops up from behind him. \"Oooo.... nice mirror. Need some beauty tips? We may lack any shopping districts here, but if you need some tips, I'm your gal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu looks up at her, \"You said I had a mustache. Are you sure I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo thinks for a moment, \"I don't think so. But, I'm honestly not sure now. What's the deal, oldie? Somethin' up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu raises an eyebrow at the oldie comment. \"This sword is effecting us, yet from what we see outside, Ichigo and his personal mindscape are uneffected. Look at the sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look toward it. At closer inspection, they see roots in the steel. An aura also covers Ichigo's mindscape. However, it's of a different type that the slowly flaming aura emitted by the sword. The flaming aura is not quite reaching the ground that the sword is stuck in, as if it were blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu curiously states, \"I wonder....\" He closes his eyes, using his spiritual senses to look at it. He's shocked as he turns around. There's two different auras now. One was coming from the hilt and back of the katana. It covered Ichigo's mindscape with an odd almost purple barrier. The other flaming blue aura that was coming from the sword refused to come into contact with anything covered in that aura. Himself and the hollow were not covered in it though, and the flame was extending invisibly throughout all their mindscape. And beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu's eyes snap open in panick. \"This is NOT good. We need to contact Ichigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo suddenly gets a nervous expression. \"Wait, you're gonna bring him here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu looks at her plainly, \"I see no other choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo swallows, then gets a determined look on her face. \"Outta the way.\" She shoves Zangetsu away from the mirror. Zangetsu turns to look back and ask what she was doing, only to be surprised to see her using a beauty kit she seemed to pull out of no where in front of the mirror. Zangetsu sweatdrops, the sweat going down his now smooth cheeks, his facial hair gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu asks, \"Just what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo, \"If Ichi-king's coming, I've gotta look my best. And don't you dare contact him till I'm ready, oldie! Or I'll kill ya! I gotta make myself look my best to prove to Ichi-king I'll do anythin' to help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu frowns, \"This is not the time for such. I'm contac-\" a giant sword barely misses his face, taking some hair strands with it, having been thrown yet held back by the ribbon on the hilt, held by a now pissed off Hollow Ichigo-chan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo hisses, \"Don't make me say it again. We are waiting till I am ready, and that's final.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangetsu glares, but nods, not noticing his own now slimmer waist, or the fact that he's now nearing the Hollow's height, which was also apparently reduced from becoming female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Back in the high school--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's moving through the halls towards his class, feeling as if something's amiss and not being able to put his finger on it.... as he completely remains oblivious to the changes going on around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl students around him are starting to grow into their outfits, them getting tight as they stare at the passing Ichigo. While the men are getting shorter and less muscular, the already skinny ones having their pants shorten and turning the color of the skirts on the girls' school uniforms. Meanwhile, the older teachers' baggy skin is getting de-aged, their hair returning to a natural hue, and the younger teachers... their outfits are becoming lighter, closer to that of the school uniform, as they begin to think they're students on a teacher internship. All the while, boxers are all but disappearing from those in range of Ichigo's new aura, becoming briefs and preparing for further changes as those around him begin to change more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the happenings around him, Ichigo reaches the classroom without incident. Whom greets him upon entering the class room?</span></div></div>",
